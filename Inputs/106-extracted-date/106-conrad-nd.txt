   Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, today, I wish to pay tribute to the very distinguished Senator from New York, who will be retiring at the end of this Congressional session. 
   Senator MOYNIHAN, as his recent biography makes clear, has been an intellectual giant in the Senate and throughout his service to our nation. The breadth of his interests--and his knowledge--is extraordinary. From questions about the architecture and urban development of Washington, D.C. to the problems created by single parent families to the workings of the International Labor Organization, Senator MOYNIHAN has thought deeply and designed policy answers. I don't think there's a Senator who hasn't learned something from Senator MOYNIHAN's vast stock of personal experience, understanding of history, and ability to draw parallels between seemingly unrelated topics to enlighten our understanding of both. 
   I have had the particular pleasure of serving with Senator MOYNIHAN on the Finance Committee for eight years. As Chairman and as ranking member of the Finance Committee, Senator MOYNIHAN has been a true leader. Starting in 1993, when I took Senator Bentsen's seat on the Committee and Senator MOYNIHAN claimed his chairmanship, Chairman MOYNIHAN successfully guided the 1993 economic plan through the committee and the Senate. That budget, which I was proud to help shape and support, laid the foundation for our current record economic expansion. That same year, we worked together to expose the shortcomings of the North American Free Trade Agreement. 
   After Republicans took control of the Senate in the 1994 election, Senator MOYNIHAN was a fierce critic of their excessive budget proposals. We joined in opposing shortsighted proposals to have Medicare ``wither on the vine,'' turn Medicaid into a block grant, and destroy welfare rather than reforming it. Senator MOYNIHAN was, as always, an especially passionate defender of teaching hospitals, warning that the plan to slash spending for Medicare's graduate medical education would threaten medical research in this country--a fear that has proved well-founded as teaching hospitals have struggled to survive the much smaller changes enacted as part of the compromise Balanced Budget Act that emerged in 1997. 
   The Finance Committee--and the Senate--will not be the same without him. Who else will be able to gently tutor witnesses on the importance of the grain trade in upstate New York in the early nineteenth century to a current debate about health care policy? Who else will call for the Boskin and Secrecy Commissions of the future? And who else will educate his colleagues on the inequitable distribution of federal spending and taxation among the various states? 
   Mr. President, I will miss PAT MOYNIHAN. But I have no doubt that he will continue to be part of the debate. As Senator MOYNIHAN retires to his beloved farm in upstate New York, I join my colleagues in looking forward to more and more insightful treaties on new and complicated policy issues.

   Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to my good friend Senator BOB KERREY. I have mixed emotions knowing that the United States Senate, the State of Nebraska, and the nation are losing a valued public servant at a time when we can ill afford to lose a person of such great talent. I am saddened thinking about the loss of his valued presence in this chamber. But, I also recognize that my friend is leaving by his own choice to take on the challenges of a new adventure as president of the New School University of New York City. New challenges and new accomplishments are about to be added to his already legendary list of achievements that include Medal of Honor recipient, entrepreneur, governor, and Senator. 
   I smile as I think about the good company my colleague has been at the Senate Committee on Agriculture. I always felt as if the hearing room brightened up a notch when Senator KERREY entered the room. I appreciated greatly the fact that we never failed to share a few light moments together, even as we worked to help the farmers and ranchers we represent. His collegial approach crossed the aisle, too. Senator KERREY moved landmark agricultural legislation to passage with hard work and the respect he garnered from his colleagues on both sides of the aisle, as he did this session with the crop insurance reform bill. 
   We also served together on the Senate Finance Committee, where Senator CONRAD has been an absolute bulldog on the issue of entitlement reform. Senator KERREY headed up the bipartisan entitlement commission and served on the Medicare Commission. He was a particularly active participant in the centrist coalition, which worked to find common ground on budget issues during the partisan stalemate in 1995 and 1996--an effort that helped produce the 1997 Balanced Budget Act. On these very difficult issues, Senator KERREY has always been willing to consider policies that make sense for the long term even when these policies carry a high political price in the short term. He was a leader in insisting that the Senate version of the Balanced Budget Act contain long term Medicare reforms as well as short term fixes. Yet throughout these discussions, Senator KERREY has also been a strong defender of the most vulnerable among us--from children in low income families struggling to get by with cash assistance, food stamps and Medicaid to rural seniors who depend on adequate Medicare reimbursement to maintain health care in their local community. 
   All of us will miss his keen intellect, his insight and his candor. We will miss his terrific sense of humor. We will miss his positive attitude. We will miss the unique perspective he brings to every discussion. We will miss his integrity and his courage. But most of all, we will miss the boundless enthusiasm he brings to public service. There is no question the Senate will soon be made poorer by his departure, and there is no doubt Senator KERREY will make the university community he now joins richer by brining these wonderful attributes to his new position. 
   We thank you Senator KERREY for your service to the United State Senate. 
   And I thank you for your friendship.

   Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise today to add my voice to those paying tribute to Senator SLADE GORTON upon his departure from the Senate. 
   I have had the privilege of serving with Senator GORTON on the Senate Budget Committee for the past eight years. During this time, Senator GORTON has fought hard for the principles he believes in: a stable economy and a balanced budget. He has made a significant contribution to bringing fiscal discipline to our nation. As part of that effort, in 1996 Senator GORTON and I, as part of the Centrist Coalition, worked with many other Senators to forge a compromise budget resolution that balanced fiscal responsibility with our nation's discretionary spending needs.  Senator GORTON can be proud of his contribution to ending the deficits of the 1980s and early 1990s. 
   Senator GORTON has been a leader in the Senate by focusing on the high-tech revolution that has dramatically changed our economy. He has fought to ensure that we are teaching the next generation of high-tech workers in our schools and has fought to keep our high-tech sector the best-trained in the world. He has also been a champion of providing tax incentives for companies to conduct the basic research and development that has helped fuel the dramatic growth of the high-tech industry in recent years. 
   Finally, let me recognize the work Senator GORTON has done as Chairman of the Interior Appropriations Subcommittee. Every year he has had a difficult task developing a spending bill for the Interior Department and related agencies. He has also helped other Senators to meet needs in their own states, and I appreciate all of Senator GORTON's help over the years to meet particular needs in North Dakota. Even when Senator GORTON could not meet all the requests his colleagues presented, he was always fair in his consideration of each Senator's needs. 
   Senator GORTON's dedication to the long-term health of our economy, his work for the high-tech sector, and his leadership on the Interior Appropriations Subcommittee are but just a few examples of his work that have produced clear results not only in Washington state, but also for our entire nation. He will be missed here in the Senate, and I wish him all the best in his future endeavors.

   Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, before Congress adjourns for the year, I wanted to take a moment to pay tribute to Senator FRANK LAUTENBERG of New Jersey, who is retiring this year. 
   Senator LAUTENBERG served our nation in World War II, and later became a successful businessman. He helped to found a payroll services company, Automatic Data Processing (ADP), and built it into one of the largest computing services companies in the world. 
   In 1982 FRANK LAUTENBERG launched a new career, in public service, when he was elected to the United States Senate. He has represented his state well. FRANK LAUTENBERG has been a leader on budget issues, a good friend to the environment, and an accomplished legislator in the areas of transportation and health care.  
   I have served on the Senate Budget Committee with FRANK LAUTENBERG since 1987; he became Ranking Member of the Committee in 1997. Senator LAUTENBERG played a key role in the 1997 negotiations on the bipartisan Balanced Budget Act, which completed the work of balancing the federal budget. That legislation provided important resources for education and health care, while cutting taxes for millions of Americans. 
   Senator LAUTENBERG has also been a good friend to the environment, serving as the top Democrat on the Environment and Public Works Committee's Subcommittee on Superfund. Throughout his time in the Senate, Senator LAUTENBERG has fought to improve the Superfund program, and has worked for legislation preventing pollution, and ensuring clear water and clean air. 
   Senator LAUTENBERG's accomplishments in the area of transportation are impressive. He serves as the top Democrat on the Appropriations Committee's Subcommittee on Transportation. Senator LAUTENBERG authored laws establishing the legal drinking age at 21, and was successful just this year in encouraging states to reduce legal blood alcohol limits to .08. He worked successfully to ban smoking on airplanes, and has championed funding for Amtrak and mass transit. 
   Senator LAUTENBERG has also worked for some time on health care, including tobacco policy issues. He is a nationally recognized leader in the fight to protect our young people from the health consequences of cigarettes. In 1997, I was extremely fortunate that Senator LAUTENBERG was chosen to co-chair the Senate Democratic Task Force on Tobacco. Senator LAUTENBERG was a particularly strong proponent of provisions on second-hand smoke and the so-called ``look-back'' enforcement mechanism to reduce youth smoking rates.

   Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, when this Congress finishes its work it will also mark the end of a particularly distinguished 30-year career in this body. I rise to pay tribute to my chairman on the Finance Committee and my friend, BILL ROTH. 
   No Senator could hope to serve under a more thoughtful and considerate Chairman than those of us on the Finance Committee have experienced over the last five years. BILL is a true gentleman who works as hard as any Senator I know to make sure that issues under his control have the broadest possible consensus. He has consistently reached out to members on our side of the aisle in order to make law in a way that honors the Senate's best traditions. 
   Like BILL, I represent a small state. He knows, as I know, what a special responsibility that is. People in a small state expect to have a personal relationship with their Senators, and I know from the times I have taken short vacations in his beautiful state the deep affection BILL inspires all over Delaware. 
   I am grateful for the opportunity I have had to work so closely with him on the important tax, health, and trade issues we deal with in the Finance Committee. BILL has a natural appreciation for the strong roles agriculture and tourism play in the economy of my state of North Dakota because they are such important components of Delaware's economy as well. He knows instinctively the value of looking for common ground. 
   Even as he leaves the Senate, however, one thing will set BILL apart. Many Senators are well known among the public at large, but very few have their names become household words. Senator ROTH earned his membership in that tiny elite. BILL's deep commitment to retirement security and savings led directly to the establishment of the Roth IRA, a retirement savings vehicle that will give savers decades from now a reason to be grateful to our beloved colleague from Delaware. 
   When we consider the departure of Senator ROTH in conjunction with the simultaneous retirement of the Senator from New York, the Committee on Finance is losing more than half a century of institutional memory and experience. That is a loss not only for our committee, but for the country as well. 
   We wish BILL ROTH all the best as he leaves us, but he will be greatly missed by his many friends and colleagues in the Senate.

   Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I want to pay a tribute to my friend and colleague from the State of Florida who has decided to leave the Senate after a distinguished 12-year career here. It has been my pleasure to work with Senator MACK during that time on a number of important issues. 
   He has always been willing to reach across the aisle when bipartisan cooperation can make the difference. As colleagues on the Finance Committee, we have cosponsored each other's bills on such varied subjects as benefits for retired coal miners, fairer treatment for real estate under the Internal Revenue Code, and keeping gray market cigarettes out of the U.S. market. Senator MACK has been a generous, thoughtful, and constructive member of our committee, and we will miss his presence there every much. 
   Year in and year out, I am constantly impressed with the energy, intelligence, and commitment that CONNIE MACK brings to the challenging job of representing such a large and diverse State Floridians have been privileged to have the benefit of his effective advocacy for their concerns. 
   I am confident that a man with public policy interests over as wide a range as CONNIE has shown during his tenure in the body is still going to be checking in with his old friends in the Senate to let us know what he's thinking. I hope we will see him often in the coming years. 
   I am happy to join my colleagues in wishing only the best for CONNIE and Priscilla as they move on to the next chapter in their lives.

   Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I would like to recognize the leadership and accomplishments of an esteemed colleague who will be retiring at the end of this term. Senator RICHARD BRYAN has served in the Congress as a representative of Nevada for more than a decade. During his tenure, he has been a tireless advocate of a wide range of legislative reform activities. 
   Throughout his career, Senator BRYAN has fought for improving natural resources, enhancing the quality of the nation's classrooms, and protecting privacy on the Internet. Senator BRYAN has also been nationally recognized for his efforts on behalf of consumers. 
   As the former Chairman of the Senate Consumer Affair Subcommittee, Senator BRYAN was responsible for enacting laws to give consumers new powers to correct errors found on their credit reports and led the fight against telemarketing fraud. Perhaps most notably, DICK BRYAN was a champion of 1993 legislation that required air bags be installed in every new car sold in the U.S. These are important accomplishments that benefit consumers across the nation. 
   As colleagues on the Finance Committee, we have fought to address the challenges facing Social Security and Medicare. Just this year, we worked closely to develop a proposal to provide prescription drug coverage for all Medicare beneficiaries. I am proud to say that this proposal would provide much needed drug coverage to millions of seniors citizens and disabled individuals. 
   I have also had the opportunity to work with Senator BRYAN to address a very important priority for the nation--balancing the federal budget. We enjoy federal budget surpluses today because of the efforts of members like Senator BRYAN who supported measures to cut government waste and get our fiscal house in order. 
   For these and many other reasons, I have been honored to serve with DICK BRYAN. I would like to join my colleagues in wishing the Senator and his family the best in the future and in paying tribute to DICK BRYAN's lifelong commitment to public service. I wish him well.

   Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I would like to recognize the leadership and accomplishments of a respected colleague who will be departing at the end of this term. Senator CHUCK ROBB has served in the Senate as a representative of Virginia for more than a decade. During his tenure, he has been a strong advocate for a wide range of important legislative reform activities. 
   During his time in the Senate, Senator ROBB has fought to strengthen national security, maintain fiscal responsibility, and protect the environment. He has also been widely recognized for his longstanding commitment to improving education. 
   As a former Governor of Virginia, Senator ROBB was instrumental in increasing resources for schools. Building on these efforts, he spearheaded efforts to help states and localities build and  renovate schools, promoted legislation to put 100,000 new teachers in the classroom, fought for school safety initiatives, and championed measures to wire schools to the Internet. These are important efforts that have benefited children and teachers across the nation. 
   As colleagues on the Finance Committee, we have fought to address the challenges facing Social Security and Medicare. Just this year, we worked closely to develop a proposal to provide prescription drug coverage for all Medicare beneficiaries. I am proud to say that this proposal would provide much needed drug coverage to millions of seniors citizens and disabled individuals. 
   I would also like to note that I am proud to have worked with a colleague with such a distinguished military background. Senator ROBB served our nation for more than 34 years, during which time he received national honors for his leadership and commitment to serving our nation. 
   For these and many other reasons, I have been honored to serve with CHUCK ROBB. I would like to join my colleagues in wishing him and his family all the best in the future.

   Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Senator JOHN ASHCROFT as he prepares to leave the Senate. 
   For the past six years, Senator ASHCROFT has done important work as a member of the Commerce, Judiciary, and Foreign Relations Committees in the United States Senate. For example, Senator ASHCROFT has focused on reforming our nation's use of agricultural sanctions during foreign trade disputes. We share a common vision that we must not use food as a weapon in our disputes with other nations, and Senator ASHCROFT has made a high priority of changing this policy. His work is important both domestically and internationally, and he can be proud of his contributions. 
   I also appreciate Senator ASHCROFT's recent work with Senator DORGAN, Senator BOND, and me on the Dakota Water Resources Act. This legislation is critical for the economic future of North Dakota, and I greatly appreciate the constructive role Senator ASHCROFT played in representing the interests of his state. During discussions on this bill he was a tenacious advocate for his state's interests. His diligence in representing his state's interests, coupled with his willingness to gain an understanding of the water needs of my state, ultimately helped us reach a compromise acceptable to both states. The people of Missouri can be proud of his work fighting for their interests. 
   More generally, Senator ASHCROFT has been a man of his word who served his state and his country with distinction. I join my colleagues on both sides of the aisle in wishing him well in his future endeavors.

   Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, for the past six years, I have had the privilege of serving in the Senate with ROD GRAMS, a colleague who has distinguished himself on a number of important issues including budget, tax policy, and agriculture. He has served Minnesota with distinction as a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, the Senate Budget committee, and the Joint Economic Committee. 
   On a national level, Senator GRAMS is perhaps best known for his ``Families First'' plan, first discussed as part of the 1994 Republican budget alternative. This plan included a $500 per-child tax credit, a recommendation that eventually became part of the 1997 Balanced Budget Act. 
   On a more parochial level, I have worked closely with Senator GRAMS on issues affecting our farm communities, and in 1997 to help our states recover from the disastrous floods along the Red River Valley. Communities along the Red River were devastated by this 500 year flood which disrupted business and forced thousands of families from their homes. 
   Senator GRAMS worked closely with delegations from North Dakota and South Dakota to make certain that the urgent needs of so many families and communities were met. He played an important role in ensuring bipartisan support and passage of the disaster relief legislation that was so critical for our states at that time. I know that many North Dakota families and businesses are very grateful for his support. 
   I extend my best wishes to Senator GRAMS, and his family, and my appreciation for his support on critical agricultural, budget, and disaster issues that we have worked together on in committee and on the Senator floor together.

   Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute and recognize the accomplishments of a colleague, Senator SPENCER ABRAHAM of Michigan. Since joining the Senate in 1995, he has served with honesty, dedication, and integrity. 
   As members of the Budget Committee, I had the opportunity to work with Senator ABRAHAM on a number of important issues. A fiscal conservative, Senator ABRAHAM work to balance the federal budget and cut government waste. He has also been a champion of keeping our Social Security dollars locked away. This is an interest in which Senator ABRAHAM and I share a keen interest. 
   Most recently, Senator ABRAHAM was the lead sponsor of the American Competitiveness in the 21st Century Act, legislation that will help ensure our nation's continued growth and leadership in information technology (IT). The bill authorized visas for 195,000 high-tech professionals to work in the U.S. to meet the growing demand for skilled IT workers throughout our economy. During consideration of the bill, I was pleased to work with Senator ABRAHAM and his staff to include in the legislation long-term initiatives to ensure that Americans of all ages are trained to fill critical IT positions in our Information Age economy. 
   During his time in the Senate, Senator ABRAHAM also worked to curb unfunded mandates, stiffen sentences for cocaine dealers, and advocated stronger privacy protections for consumers on the Internet. His work has been thoughtful and our nation is a better place because of his efforts. 
   Mr. President, it has been a pleasure to serve in the Senate with SPENCE. I have the utmost respect for my friend and colleague from Michigan, and appreciate all of his contributions to the United States Senate and our nation. I would like to join with my colleagues in wishing the Senator and his family the best in the future.

   Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I too want to speak about the former Governor of Missouri, Mel Carnahan. 
   Over the last 3 weeks, I was engaged, along with my colleague, Senator DORGAN, in intense negotiations with Governor Carnahan and the two Senators from Missouri with respect to a major water project in our State, the Dakota Water Resources Act. 
   We had the opportunity to talk to Governor Carnahan directly, and we talked to his top staff repeatedly. I found him to be a fierce advocate for the people of Missouri, just as I have found Senator BOND and Senator ASHCROFT to be fierce advocates for the people of Missouri. 
   We have had a difficult time reaching conclusion on our water project because of objections from the State of Missouri. But the representatives of that State--Senator BOND, Senator ASHCROFT, and Governor Carnahan--worked in good faith with us, all the while protecting vigorously and aggressively the interests of their State. I respect that. That is what representatives are supposed to do. 
   I found Governor Carnahan to be absolutely ferocious on the issues that he thought were important to the people of his State. When I heard the news that he had been killed in a tragic plane accident, it saddened me. It saddened our family because we are certain that the Carnahans are suffering greatly. And the people of Missouri have had a terrible loss. 
   It reminded me of a similar incident with a Missouri Senate candidate more than 20 years ago, Congressman Litton, who was also killed in a light plane crash in that State. It almost makes one wonder if Missouri is somehow star crossed with leaders of that caliber--so widely respected by the people of their States--being lost in these tragic accidents. 
   I send my best wishes to the Carnahan family and to people all over the country who are grieving at the loss of the Governor of that great State. We are thinking of the family and thinking of the friends and staff of Governor Carnahan. 
   As I say, I have had several weeks in which I talked frequently to the Governor's chief of staff and the head of his department of natural resources. I found them to be very good people, very decent people--very difficult to negotiate with but very good people. We share their loss. 
   I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, we are now considering the Agriculture appropriations conference report. It is critically important to a number of our States. It certainly is critically important to mine. 
   We are faced with one of the toughest downturns in the agricultural markets in the history of our country. We currently have the lowest real prices for farm commodities in 50 years, and we are in a very serious situation as a result. Literally, thousands of farm families will be forced off the land if there is not an adequate Federal response to this crisis. 
   A number of years ago we passed a new farm bill. That farm bill is not working. I think the proof is abundantly clear. The fact is, we have had to write disaster bills every year for the last 3 years to try to deal with this collapse in farm prices. 
   The situation now is even more grave as we have dealt not only with collapsed prices but also with what I call the triple whammy of bad prices, bad policy, and bad weather. 
   In my State, as in many others, farmers have not only had to cope with very low prices but, in addition to that, weather conditions that have dramatically reduced the value of the crop even from these very low prices. 
   I just had a farmer stop me when I was home and tell me he was offered 75 cents a bushel for his grain--75 cents a bushel. 
   A lot of people wonder, what is a bushel? We talk about these things in farm terms. I think many people in the country have no idea what a bushel represents. A bushel is almost 60 pounds. Can you imagine getting 75 cents for that product? That is ruinous. That is confiscatory. And it will drive thousands of farm families into bankruptcy if there is not a response. 
   Thankfully, each of the last 3 years, there has been a Federal response. Three years ago, I am proud to say, the first amendment was mine, offered with Senator DORGAN, to begin to respond to this crisis of collapsed prices. 
   That developed into a $6 billion assistance package. 
   Last year, we had another package. Senator GRASSLEY of Iowa and I offered the only bipartisan package of assistance, and it formed the basis for what was agreed to, an $8.7 billion package. This year, for the third year in a row, we have already passed, and the President has signed into law, a package of $7.2 billion of assistance, again to offset these collapsed prices. But since that package was passed and signed into law, we also have these weather disasters across the country. In my State, overly wet conditions have led to an outbreak of a disease called scab that has dramatically lowered the value of the crop. In other parts of the country, there has been devastating drought, a situation where farmers have not received any rain throughout the growing season. As a result, they have almost total losses. 
   In this bill we will vote on next week, there is an additional $3.5 billion of assistance, including provisions to address the quality loss affecting my State's farmers; $500 million to address the quality loss circumstance in which farmers go to the elevator and in some cases the people at the elevator say, we won't buy your grain at any price because it is so loaded with this fungus called scab. That is the nature of the crisis. 
   It is so important that next week we pass that bill. It is so important that this aid start to flow. It is so important that we say to farm families across America, we are not going to let you fail because of a failed farm policy written in Washington. We are not going to let you face a circumstance just because our major competitors, the Europeans, are outspending us 10 to 1 in their support for their producers, that we let our people fall by the wayside. We are not going to say to our producers, just because the Europeans account for 84 percent of all the world's agriculture export subsidy--we only account for 1.4 percent--just because they are outgunning us 60 to 1 on that measure of support, we are not going to let you go under because of a failed policy out of Washington. 
   These are critical times. Our major competitors, the Europeans, have done everything they can to support their producers. I am not being critical. I admire them. They have stood up for their people. They understand that if you just abandon them to this world market, where we see catastrophic prices, what that will mean is an exodus from the rural parts of Europe, just as we are seeing that kind of circumstance in America. We are seeing thousands of farm families leave the land because the economics just don't work. 
   We obviously need this rescue package. We need this assistance. More than that, we need a new farm policy, one for the longer term, one that recognizes what is happening in world agriculture, one that understands the Europeans are supporting their producers at a rate of $300 an acre on average while we support our producers at a rate of $30 an acre on average. It is no wonder that Europe is moving up in world market share and we are moving down because our friends in Europe are doing it the old-fashioned way--they are going out and buying markets that have traditionally been ours. They have a strategy; they have a plan. Their plan is to dominate world agricultural trade. They are putting the money up to do it. 
   The harsh reality is that USDA now tells us for the first time in as long as anyone can remember, Europe is poised to surpass us in world market share. Let me repeat that: This 
   year USDA tells us for the first time in memory Europe is poised to pass us in world market share for agricultural products. That ought to be a warning to all of us of what is happening. It is happening because the Europeans have spent tens of billions of dollars a year, nearly $50 billion a year, supporting their producers, paying for export subsidies so they can buy markets that have traditionally been ours. Shame on us if we allow them to take us out of world markets that have been ours for decades. That would be a serious mistake. 
   When I ask the Europeans, how is it you are able to convince your people to step up and support your producers in the way that you do, they say, it is very simple: we have been hungry twice in Europe. We never intend to be hungry again. We are not going to rely on outside food sources to feed our people. We just are not going to do it. 
   I hope next year we will begin the debate on a new farm policy, and we will recognize that unilateral disarmament does not work. It doesn't work in military affairs; it doesn't work in an agricultural trade confrontation. It hasn't worked with this new Federal farm policy. It has been a disaster. I don't know of any better proof for that than the simple fact we have had to write disaster bills the last 3 years to try to cope with the wreckage that is represented by this Federal farm policy: the lowest prices in 50 years; thousands of farmers being pushed off the land; an agricultural economy that is in deep trouble. 
   I hope next week, when we take a vote on the Agriculture appropriations bill, there will be strong bipartisan support for that package, and then when we convene next year we will begin the debate on a new Federal farm policy, one that recognizes that our major competitors are on the move. They are on the march. They have a strategy. They have a plan. They have an intention to dominate world agricultural trade, and we have an obligation to fight back, to give our producers, our farmers a fair fighting chance. 
   So far we have said to our farmers, you go out there and compete against the French farmer or the German farmer. And while you are at it, you take on the French Government and the German Government, too. That is not a fair fight. Our producers can compete against any producers anywhere in the world, but only if they have a level playing field, only if it is a fair fight. They can't win if the deck is stacked against them. That is precisely what is happening now. The deck is stacked against our producers in a way that is devastating. 
   It reminds me of the cold war, where we built up to build down. I believe we have to follow that same principle in  this trade confrontation with Europe. We have to add resources to force them to the table to negotiate to level the playing field so our producers are not at this extraordinary disadvantage where Europe spends $300 an acre on average to support their producers while we spend $30, where the Europeans account for 84 percent of all the world's agricultural export subsidy while we account for only 1.4 percent, outgunned 60 to 1. It is pretty hard to win a fight when you are outgunned 60 to 1 or 10 to 1. It makes it virtually impossible for our very efficient producers, very hard-working people, to have any kind of a chance. 
   These are the harsh realities of what is occurring in world agriculture. I hope next week, when that bill comes before the Chamber, we will stand up and vote aye. I hope when we start next year the debate and discussion about a new farm bill, we will recognize the harsh realities of what is happening in these world agricultural markets. 
   I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, we have just learned very tragic news that a young man from my home State of North Dakota is among those now listed as missing and presumed dead on board the U.S.S. Cole. 
   He is Petty Officer 2nd Class Kevin Shawn Rux. I want to express my deepest sympathies to the family. Our Nation honors this young man for his service and sacrifice. Our prayers are with his family in their grief today, and with all the fathers, mothers, spouses, sons, and daughters of those who lost their loved ones in this terrible attack. 
   I want to reassure the family this Nation will not rest until we find the criminals responsible for the death of Kevin Shawn Rux and his shipmates. This country will hold them accountable for these murders. Again, we share the grief of the family of this young  man. He was doing his duty. He was serving his country. We admire very much his service, and we deeply respect his sacrifice. 
   My colleague from North Dakota would also like to comment. We would appreciate that.

   Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I am pleased to be a cosponsor of the National Rural Development Partnership (NRDP) Act of 2000 introduced yesterday by my friend from Idaho, Senator CRAIG, and 25 of our distinguished colleagues. 
   The NRDP is a nonpartisan interagency working group whose mission is to ``contribute to the vitality of the nation by strengthening the ability of all rural Americans to participate in determining their futures.'' Today the NRDP is comprised of nearly 40 State Rural Development Councils [SRDCs]. The NRDP also brings to the task of developing rural America more than 40 agencies, in addition to state, local, tribal, for- and non-profit organizations. 
   The Partnership has thrived in recent years because of the hard work of thousands of dedicated Americans throughout the country who are committed to reinvigorating rural life through coordination of their efforts and those of the public and private sectors. However, the NRDP has never been formally authorized. The future of this important organization can only be secured if the NRDP, the National Rural Development Council, and the SRDCs are formally recognized by the Congress and authorized to receive appropriations. 
   Mr. President, that is exactly what this legislation would do. Additionally, the Craig-Conrad bill delineates specific responsibilities for each component of the NRDP while refocusing and reinvigorating many current activities. It does not, however, create any new bureaucracy. This legislation grew out of a hearing of the Agriculture Committee's Subcommittee on Forestry, Conservation, and Rural Revitalization that Senator CRAIG and I, as chairman and ranking member, held on March 8 of this year. The support expressed at that hearing for the NRDP was broad-based and considerable. 
   I cannot emphasize enough the importance of the NRDP's work. Every region of our nation has benefited. In my part of the country, the NRDP has been particularly valuable in bringing together previously independent rural development efforts, creating a synergistic effect. 
   As I have discussed on the Senate floor and in committee on numerous occasions, in the Upper Great Plains we are facing a crisis of staggering proportions, placing unprecedented stress on every aspect of economic and community life. This is a very serious matter for the entire country. The farms of the Dakotas and the surrounding states produce wheat, corn, and soybeans in abundance, but something much more important: good families and great kids. The rural way of life helps foster the values of hard work and fortitude that have made America great. 
   In my view, the ongoing crisis in agriculture represents as great a threat to our nation's future as any of the foreign threats we face today. As we work to combat this domestic national security threat and preserve the rural way of life, the NRDP is a truly vital asset. I hope all my colleagues will join the 27 of us on this bill in pressing for its passage and enactment at the earliest possible moment. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, today the Senate will complete action on one of the most important bills in the 106th Congress, S. 2045, the American Competitiveness in the 21st Century Act, legislation that will help ensure our nation's continued growth and leadership in information technology (IT). S. 2045 will authorize visas for 195,000 high-tech professionals to work in the U.S. to meet the growing demand for skilled IT workers throughout our economy. The legislation also authorizes long term initiatives to ensure that Americans of all ages are trained to fill critical IT positions in our Information Age economy. I am pleased to strongly support this legislation. 
   Senate action to increase the ceiling on H1B visas for the next three years, however, is also a warning that we are not providing sufficient incentives or education opportunities to encourage our young people, as well as individuals of all ages, to consider careers or retraining in information technology. In 1998, Congress passed legislation to increase the number of H1B visas for skilled workers to enter the U.S. At that time, the Department of Commerce reported a shortage of 600,000 skilled IT workers in the U.S. Since 1998, the demand for skilled workers has increased dramatically. 
   Earlier this year, the Information Technology Association released its most recent report, ``Bridging the Gap'', on the demand for skilled IT workers in the U.S. That report estimated a shortage of more than 843,000 skilled workers. Moreover, the Department of Labor projected that the U.S. economy will require more than 130,000 new IT workers every year for the next ten years. Clearly, with our rapidly expanding economy, and the critical need to maintain our leadership in information technology, we face an extraordinary challenge from this shortage of skilled high-tech workers. As economies throughout the world recover, particularly in Asia, we cannot continue to assume that we will meet our demand for high-tech workers by increasing the cap on HIB visa every few years. 
   Throughout this debate on the IT worker shortage since 1998, I have recommended incentives to encourage IT worker training and partnerships between businesses and the education community. Earlier in the 106th Congress, I introduced legislation, S. 456, to authorize a tax credit of up to $6,000 for employers who provide IT worker training. Unfortunately, the Senate has not yet adopted this legislation. I am, however, very pleased that Vice President GORE has recognized the importance of this IT worker training incentive and included this proposal as a priority on his information technology agenda. 
   More recently, I also introduced S. 2347, the Information Technology Act of 2000, to encourage IT training partnerships between universities or colleges and the information technology community through a program of matching Federal grants. I urged that these partnerships focus on training for Americans that have traditionally not participated in the growth in information technology--women, veterans, Native Americans, dislocated workers, seniors, and students who have not completed their high school diploma. I am especially pleased to have had such strong endorsements for this proposal from groups including the Disabled Veterans of America, National Education Association, American Association of University Women, Green Thumb and the Computing Technology Industry Association. 
   Mr. President, while I regret that we have not been able to authorize tax incentives for businesses who provide IT training for workers, I am very pleased that S. 2045 authorizes funding for high-tech partnerships, as I proposed in S. 2347, through the Department of Labor. Funding for the training would come from the fees collected under the H-1B visa program. S. 2045 also expands K-12 training for educators in IT through the National Science Foundation, including the professional development of math and science teachers in the use of technology in the classroom. Expanding opportunities for IT training for educators was another important objective in S. 2347. S. 2045 also helps our educational and research communities by exempting them from the cap on recruiting skilled academic professionals. 
   Finally, I would like to express particular appreciation to the managers of the bill for accepting my amendment regarding J-1 visa waivers. My amendment will improve underserved communities' access to physician services by ensuring the Conrad State 20 J-1 visa waivers do not count against the H-1B visa cap. 
   Mr. President, the shortage of skilled high-tech workers will continue to be a major issue during the 107th Congress, and I believe it will be necessary for us to provide additional training incentives in the coming years to meet the growing domestic demand for IT workers. As I noted earlier, as economies throughout the world continue to expand, and countries including Singapore, China, and Malaysia develop their own high tech corridors, it will be difficult to recruit high-tech workers from these Asian countries to fill positions in the U.S. 
   In my view, rather than continue our dependence on H1B visa holders to meet our skilled worker demand, we must expand our efforts to encourage young people to consider careers in information technology and to train current workers to enter the IT field. This will continue to be a top priority for me during the 107th Congress, and I look forward to working with my colleagues and the information technology community on this critical issue. I commend my colleagues on the Senate Judiciary Committee for reporting a measure that provides important incentives for IT training as well as expanded education and training opportunities for teachers through the National Science Foundation.

   Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise today as a senior member of the Budget Committee to talk about what I see as a breakdown in the budget process in the Senate. I think every member of the Budget Committee and every Member of the Senate ought to be concerned about what has happened the last several years but even more dramatically this year, in what can only be called a virtual meltdown of the budget process. 
   Those who are watching may say, well, what do we care what the budget process is. We care about the budget outcome. And that is exactly right. The most important thing is the budget outcome. But many times how you start has a lot to do with how you end up, and I am afraid we have now developed a disastrous operating procedure around here. 
   We start out with a fiction of a budget; we end up with no accountability, no control, and chaos at the end. That is where we are today. This is chaos. Every Member of the Senate knows that is true. 
   We have a circumstance now where bills are passed in committee, never come to the floor of the Senate, go to a conference committee, the Democrats are locked out of the conference committee, and Senators are denied their right to offer amendments to improve legislation. That is not the way the process is supposed to work. Together we have to mend it. If we don't, we are going to have a circumstance where someday, when the Democrats are going to be back in control, we can operate this way. And if you are in the minority and you are locked out and prevented from offering amendments, your ability to represent your constituents is badly diminished. 
   This is not just a Democrat issue or Republican issue. This is a question of how we function in this body. It is in all of our interests to have a process where Senators' fundamental rights are protected so they can carry out their fundamental responsibilities. 
   When I say we are in chaos, the story in the Washington Post yesterday, front-page story, tells us that is true. Here is the story: ``Spending Floodgates Open on Hill.'' Congress is moving to approve the biggest spending increase since Republicans took control in 1995. The binge is setting off alarms among fiscal conservatives and threatens to absorb a chunk of the future surplus. 
   ``It is just a free for all,'' said Senator MCCAIN. ``They are all equal opportunity pork-barrelers ..... This is the worst ever.'' 
   I agree with Senator MCCAIN. This is the worst ever. We have a process that is broken. The budget resolution is being paid no attention. That was predictable because the budget resolution made no earthly sense. It wasn't real. It was a fiction. As a result, we have no control, no accountability for what follows. Everybody is on their own. Every one of these committees is on their own. They are out there dividing them up, throwing it in. We are going to have--I predict today--a stack of paper on our desks, and we are going to be told: Take it or leave it; vote for it or the Government will shut down. 
   That is where we are headed. It is very clear to anybody who is watching. That should not be the way we conduct the people's business. 
   What is especially troubling about all this is that we have made enormous progress over the last several years, enormous 
   progress in getting our fiscal house in order. We should not put at risk that progress. We should not put at risk the prosperity that has followed getting our fiscal house in order. 
   I want to look at the last three administrations and their record on deficits. I think it is instructive as we go into this election season. I think it is instructive as we consider what is occurring in the Senate and the House of Representatives right now. 
   If we go back 20 years ago, 1981, President Reagan came in. He had the old trickle-down economics. It was a disaster in terms of deficits; the deficits skyrocketed. We went from a deficit of about $80 billion to over $200 billion and tripled the national debt during his years. Fiscally, it was a chaotic time. President Bush came in; the deficit was $153 billion. By the time he left, it was $290 billion--more than double. 
   That is the record. It is in the books. I know it makes tough reading for some of our friends on the other side, but that is their record on the fiscal health of this country. The fact is, they had a policy of deficits and debt, and those deficits and debt threatened the fundamental economic security of the country. 
   In 1993, we had a new administration. This is their record--not a question; these are the facts. I remember President Reagan used to say facts are stubborn things. He was absolutely right about that. Facts are stubborn things. 
   In 1993, the deficit was $255 billion. We passed a 5-year plan to reduce the budget deficit and to get it under control. Our friends on the other side said that if we passed that plan, it would crater the economy. That is what they said at the time. They said it wouldn't reduce the deficit. They said it would increase it. They said it wouldn't reduce interest rates; that it would increase them. They said it wouldn't reduce inflation; that it would increase inflation. 
   We can go back now and check the record. They were wrong on each and every count--not just a little bit wrong, completely wrong. Look at the record. 
   Every year of that 5-year plan, the deficit went down and went down dramatically, until we got to the fifth year of the plan and we were headed toward surplus. That is the record. We can look back and see who is right and who is wrong. It is just as clear as it can be. 
   The question is, Are we going to put all of this at risk? The President announced just the other day that we are going to have a $230 billion budget surplus, a $230 billion budget surplus for fiscal year 2000. Just 8 years ago, we had a $290 billion budget deficit. 
   The results from this fiscal policy have been very clear. Before I get to the results, let me show how it happened. How did we get into this position? We got into this position by, in 1992, passing a plan that cut spending and, yes, raised taxes on the wealthiest 1 percent--raised income taxes on the wealthiest 1 percent. The revenue line went up; the spending line came down. We balanced the budget. We created surpluses, and the economic results have been dramatic and extraordinarily positive. 
   We now have the longest economic expansion in our Nation's history. This was recorded on February 1, 2000, in the Washington Post, the headline, ``Expansion is Now Nation's Longest,'' 107  months of economic growth, the longest economic expansion in our Nation's history. 
   It is not just a record of economic expansion. It is the other positive results we obtained as well by getting our fiscal house in order: the lowest unemployment rate in 42 years; and on inflation, the lowest sustained level since 1965. We have the lowest level of sustained inflation in 35 years because we got our fiscal house in order. The welfare caseload has been cut in half; the percentage on welfare in the country is the lowest since 1967. This is the record. It is very clear. Those of us who supported welfare reform, those of us who supported the budget plan to get our fiscal house in order, those decisions have paid off for the country, and we should not put it all at risk. 
   Federal spending as a percentage of our national income is the lowest it has been since 1966. 
   Federal spending is the lowest as a percentage of our national income since 1966. These are the kinds of positive results we have developed as a result of a budget plan that added up, that made sense, that got our fiscal house in order. 
   Some say, gee, income taxes are the highest they have been in a generation. Not true. The reason we have expanded revenue--yes, we raised rates on the wealthiest 1 percent. That is undeniable. That is correct. That was part of the plan that got our fiscal house in order. But it is also true that we passed sweeping tax cuts, child care credit, expansion of the earned-income tax that dramatically reduced the income taxes of tens of millions of Americans. 
   On March 26 of this year, the Washington Post, on page 1, ran a story under this headline: ``Federal Tax Level Falls For Most; Studies Show Burden Now Less Than 10 percent'' on a significant part of the American public. 
   Most Americans, this year, will have to fork over less than 10 percent of their income to the Federal Government when they file Federal income taxes. The fact is, for many segments of our society, income taxes, combined with payroll taxes, have gone down. That is because of the expansion of the earned-income tax, and that is because of the child credit. In fact, if you compare the tax burden for working families--according to the Tax Foundation, this is for a family earning $68,000 in 1999--from 1975--this is both income taxes and payroll taxes--their tax burden declined from 10.4 percent to 8.9 percent. 
   That is not KENT CONRAD's numbers; those are the numbers from the Tax Foundation. 
   The Washington Post, in that same story, pointed out:  
   For all but the wealthiest Americans, the Federal income tax burden has shrunk to the lowest level in 4 decades, according to a series of studies by liberal and conservative tax experts, the Clinton administration, and two arms of the Republican controlled Congress.  
   This is the record and these are the facts with respect to what has happened to the income tax burden. Because we have gotten our fiscal house in order, we have seen a substantial reduction in the publicly held debt. We are in a position, if we make no other changes in law, to pay off the publicly held debt of the United States by the year 2009. We all understand there are proposals for additional spending and for tax cuts that will move that back. 
   The fact is, if we made no changes in current law, we could pay off the publicly held debt in the country by the year 2009. In fact, we are right here on this scale. We have already started paying down the debt. In the last 3 years, we have paid down, I think, over $300 billion of publicly held debt. That is a dramatic transformation, a huge improvement. 
   Let me just be clear. I give most of the credit to our side of the aisle which, in 1993, passed a 5-year budget plan that did most of the heavy lifting. We didn't have a single vote from the other side of the aisle. But it is also true that in 1997 we finished the job with a bipartisan effort. I say to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, that was good that we were able to come together in 1997 and do something together to finish the job. 
   Now the question is: Do we stay on this course or do we go off in some other direction and go back to what I consider the bad old days of debt, deficits, and decline? I hope not. I 
   hope we avoid going back in the deficit ditch. 
   Let's look ahead. Here is what we are told now. Over the next 10 years, the projections are--remember, they are projections, and projections can change--telling us we can count on $4.6 trillion of surplus. That is extraordinary, the turnaround that has been accomplished. First of all, remember that those are projections. They have improved by a trillion dollars in the last 6 months. They could go the other way in the next 6 months. Let's remember, they are projections. 
   Two, let's remember the $2.4 trillion--more than half of it--is from Social Security. I think both sides have agreed that we are not going to raid Social Security--at least we agreed rhetorically we are not going to raid Social Security. Another almost $400 billion is Medicare. So you add those two together, and that is $2.8 trillion of the $4.6 trillion, Medicare and Social Security, and that leaves about $1.8 trillion of non-Social Security, non-Medicare surplus. 
   When I look at the budget plan of Governor Bush, it doesn't add up. It just doesn't add up. This is what concerns me about derailing the progress we have made and going back into the deficit ditch. Let me go through the math. I don't think it can be challenged. 
   We have the projected surplus of $4.6 trillion. The Social Security surplus is $2.4 trillion. The Medicare surplus is $400 billion. That leaves a remaining non-Social Security, non-Medicare surplus of $1.8 trillion over the next 10 years that has been projected. The Bush tax cut is--his large main proposal costs $1.3 trillion. The other tax cuts that he has endorsed in the campaign are another $300 billion. The interest cost of those tax cuts is another $300 billion. So he has completely wiped out the non-Social Security, non-Medicare surplus. It is gone, poof. 
   Then he has an additional problem that is very big. He has recommended Social Security privatization. The transition cost of that proposal--or proposals like that one--is about $1 trillion. Where does that come from? Where does that $1 trillion come from? Is he going to take it out of the Social Security surplus? If he does, he has violated the pledge everybody has made here not to raid the Social Security surplus because that money is needed to meet the promises that have been made to existing Social Security recipients. If he takes that $1 trillion out of there, that undermines Social Security solvency because it is a transfer of money to allow people to set up private accounts. 
   Now, in addition to that, he has used every penny of the non-Social Security, non-Medicare surplus for tax cuts. Where is the additional money for defense? He made a big point in this campaign that we are not at the level of readiness we should have. Where is he going to get any money to deal with that when all of his money--non-Social Security and non-Medicare surplus--goes for tax cuts? Where is he going to get the additional money for education he has called for in this campaign? It doesn't add up. 
   What worries me very much is that we are going to go right back into the deficit ditch we just crawled out of. What a mistake that would be; what a tragedy for this country it would be to go back to deficits and debt and ultimate economic decline. I hope very much our colleagues will avoid that mistake. 
   Let me just say that it isn't just the Bush plan that threatens that, in my judgment. I am also worried about those who have massive new spending ideas because this fiscal responsibility, this course that we have embarked on to get our fiscal house in order, can be threatened in several different ways. One way is this Bush plan which, to me, is a financial disaster for the country if we ever adopt it. I hope very much that we do not. That would put us right back in the deficit ditch. But another way to threaten it is out-of-control spending. When you don't have a budget process that has any discipline to it, doesn't have any reality to it, you allow this kind of spending frenzy that is now going on in the committees to emerge. There is no accountability, no plan, and there is fundamentally no discipline. 
   I hope some colleagues are listening. We did a little calculation about what is out there going through the committees.  
   The $60 billion 1-year effect they are talking about in the Washington Post is dwarfed by the 10-year effect because we are talking about a 10-year effect of $450 billion by decisions that are being made in some closed room somewhere where one-half of Congress is being excluded. That is not the way to do business. 
   I hope very much that people on both sides who do not want to see us return to the bad old days of deficits and debt will get together in these final hours and agree that there has to be a better way of doing our business. I know it is not going to change this year, but I hope very much that next year we get back to a budget process that has some integrity to it and some discipline to it because if we fail, I fear very much that we are going to go right back to the bad old days of deficits and debt. That would be a profound mistake for the country. 
   As one considers how far we have come and the dramatic improvements that we have made, they weren't easy. I know about the votes in 1993 to put in place a 5-year budget plan to get our fiscal house back in order. People lost their political careers as a result. That is not the biggest sacrifice to make. I know that. But the fact is, it was hard. It passed by a single vote in this Chamber. It passed by a single vote over in the House. 
   We have had such incredible prosperity in part because of the result of those decisions that created the framework so that the American people's hard work, ingenuity, and creativity could lead this economic resurgence. But we see other people who are hard-working and creative living in a failed system. We see it in Russia. We see it in other parts of the world. The fact is that we have a system that works because the monetary and fiscal policy of the United States over the last 8 years has been a good one, has been a sound one, and has been an effective one. But it can all be lost. It can be jeopardized. We can go right back very easily to deficits and debt. All we have to do is pass massive tax cuts that do not add up and pass massive new spending plans in concert with those tax cuts, and we will be right back to deficits, debt, and ultimate economic decline. 
   This is a matter of choices. It is a matter of choices for those of us who serve in Congress. It is a matter of choices for the American people as they go to the polls. I trust the wisdom of the American people. I trust the wisdom of my colleagues in Congress. I think when people have both sides of the story, they make pretty good judgments. Part of our responsibility is to make certain that people get both sides of the story. 
   I think I have made the point that Governor Bush has most of his priority placed on tax cuts. That really jeopardizes the fiscal discipline that we have achieved. As I look at what he has proposed, and the $2.2 trillion, which is the surplus without Social Security, and you look at his plan and the additional tax cuts and the interest lost as a result of those tax cuts, you can see not only that he is using up the entire non-Social Security, non-Medicare surplus, he is using up almost entirely the surplus not counting Social Security. That is not a balanced plan. That is a plan that has enormous risk to it. 
   On top of that, his tax cuts aren't fair. He gives 53 percent of the benefit to the top 35 percent of the American 
   people. That is the analysis by the Citizens for Tax Justice. The lowest 60 percent of the income earners in America get 11 percent of the benefits. 
   Again, that is not just KENT CONRAD talking; that is not just Citizens for Tax Justice talking. 
   Senator JOHN MCCAIN in his campaign pointed out that 38 percent of Governor Bush's tax cut goes to the wealthiest 1 percent. That is Senator JOHN MCCAIN's analysis of Governor George Bush's tax plan. 
   What is the fairness in that? Thirty-eight percent of the benefit goes to the wealthiest 1 percent? 
   The Governor is fond of saying that the surpluses are not the Government's money; it is the people's money. He has that exactly right. This money is the people's money. Absolutely. The question is, what should be done with the people's money? His idea is to give 38 percent of that to the wealthiest 1 percent. What kind of a plan is that? Wouldn't it be better to take the people's money and pay off the people's debt? 
   That is what I believe ought to be the top priority. Let's dump this debt. Let's get rid of it once and for all, especially before the baby boomers start to retire. We have a window of opportunity that is going to last about another 12 years. This is the time to dump the debt. 
   I offered a budget plan to my colleagues that would use 72 percent of these surpluses for debt elimination, 12 percent for tax relief, 12 percent for high priority domestic needs such as defense and education and health care. That, to me, is a set of priorities for the American people. This plan of Governor Bush does not add up.

   Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Sustaining Access to Vital Emergency Medical Services (EMS) Act of 2000. This bill would take important steps to strengthen the emergency medical service system in rural communities and across the nation. 
   Across America, emergency medical care reduces human suffering and saves lives. According to recent statistics, the average U.S. citizen will require the services of an ambulance at least twice during his or her life. As my colleagues surely know, delays in receiving care can mean the difference between illness and permanent injury, between life and death. In rural communities that often lack access to local health care services, the need for reliable EMS is particularly crucial. 
   Over the next few decades, the need for quality emergency medical care in rural areas is projected to increase as the elderly population in these communities continues to rise. Unfortunately, while the need for effective EMS systems may increase, we have seen the number of individuals able to provide these services decline. Nationwide, the majority of emergency medical personnel are unpaid volunteers. As rural economies continue to suffer, and individuals have less and less time to devote to volunteering, it has become increasingly difficult for rural EMS squads to recruit and retain personnel. In my state of North Dakota, this phenomenon has resulted in a sharp reduction in EMS squad size. In 1980, on average there were 35 members per EMS squad; today, the average squad size has plummeted to 12 individuals per unit. I am concerned that continued reductions in EMS squad size could jeopardize rural residents' access to needed medical services. 
   For this reason, the legislation I introduce today includes two components to help communities recruit, retain, and train EMS providers. First, this proposal would establish a Rural Emergency Medical Services Training and Equipment Assistance program. This program would authorize $50 million in grant funding for fiscal years 2001-2006, which could be used by rural EMS squads to meet various personnel needs. For example, this funding could help cover the costs of training volunteers in emergency response, injury prevention, and safety awareness; volunteers could also access this funding to help meet the costs of obtaining State emergency medical certification. In addition, EMS squads would be offered the flexibility to use grant funding to acquire new equipment, such as cardiac defibrillators. This is particularly important for rural squads that have difficulty affording state-of-the-art equipment that is needed for stabilizing patients during long travel times between the rural accident site and the nearest urban medical facility. This grant funding could also be used to provide community education training in CPR, first aid or other emergency medical needs. 
   Second, the Sustaining Access to Vital Emergency Medical Services Act would help individuals meet the costs of providing services by offering all volunteer emergency medical personnel a $500 income tax credit. Volunteers could use this credit to cover some of the incidental expenses incurred in providing services, such as purchasing gasoline for the vehicles they use to respond to emergencies or to buy medical gear like safety gloves and clothing. It is my hope that this tax credit would provide an incentive for unpaid EMS volunteers to continue 
   providing services and for new volunteers to join rural emergency medical squads. 
   In addition to the provisions I have just described, this legislation also includes two other measures that would provide additional resources to EMS squads. The Balanced Budget Act (BBA) of 1997 reduced inflationary update payments to ambulance providers through 2002. This means that during this time frame, ambulance providers have not been given adequate resources to keep up with increasing service demands. To ensure ambulance providers receive appropriate resources, this legislation would eliminate the BBA market basket reductions and would instead provide a full inflationary update over the next two years. Also, this bill would provide an extra one percentage point increase in fiscal year 2001 to all EMS providers. 
   In addition, this proposal takes steps to fix the shortcomings of the newly implemented Medicare ambulance fee schedule. The negotiated rulemaking committee that developed the fee schedule voiced concern that the payment system does not adequately account for the costs of providing emergency care to low-volume rural areas. In response to this concern, the Committee included an add-on payment for services provided to rural areas. While this payment adjustment is a step in the right direction, we must go further in identifying low-volume areas and ensuring EMS providers are paid appropriately for serving these communities. This proposal would direct the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to conduct a study and provide recommendations to Congress on options for providing more appropriate payments to the nation's rural EMS providers. In conjunction with providing these recommendations, HHS would be required to implement any appropriate reimbursement changes by January 1, 2002. 
   It is my hope that the Sustaining Access to Vital Emergency (SAVE) Medical Services Act will help ensure EMS providers can continue providing quality medical care to our communities. I urge my colleagues to support this important effort.

   Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I wish to join my colleagues in expressing support for passage of Permanent Normal Trade Relations with China. This is the right thing to do for the country, and it is the right thing to do for my state of North Dakota. 
   I think it is important at the outset to make it clear what this vote is about--and what it is not about. This vote is about making sure that U.S. farmers, businesses, and workers receive the benefits of China's accession to the World Trade Organization. The agreement on China's accession is a clear win for the United States. China has made concession after concession, lowering tariffs and removing other barriers to U.S. exports. The U.S. has made no such concessions. But if we  fail to pass Permanent Normal Trade Relations, PNTR, we will not be able to take full advantage of these opportunities but will instead cede them to our competitors. 
   There has been a lot of misleading talk and innuendo about what PNTR really means. PNTR is not a special privilege, and it does not signify our approval of China's domestic or foreign policies. In fact, we continue to have many differences with China that we can and should work vigorously to resolve. PNTR would simply grant China the same trading status that the United States has with more than 130 other countries around the world: nothing more, nothing less. And it would grant China the same status going forward that it has had continuously for the last twenty years. The only change is that the Congress no longer would hold an annual vote on China's trade status, a vote that has never denied China Normal Trade Relations but that has set back our efforts to engage China on human rights and other issues. 
   The PNTR debate is primarily about trade, so let me start by talking about the trade benefits for our country. As my colleagues know, this vote is not about whether China should be part of the WTO. There is no question that China will join the WTO. The only question is whether the United States will reap the benefits of the many concessions China has made, or whether our farmers, businesses and workers will be left out. That would be a profound mistake. 
   China has the world's largest population: 1.3 billion potential customers for American products. For years, our market has been open to Chinese imports, but China's market has largely been closed to our products. This agreement will open China's market to our exports. And this is a market that has terrific growth potential. China's economy is the fastest growing in the world, and China's expanding middle class will demand more and more imports of American consumer goods. 
   The agreement reached last November allows us unprecedented access to this huge and growing market. On manufactured goods, tariffs will fall from a current average of nearly 25 percent to less than ten percent. On services, China has agreed to phase out a broad array of laws regulations and policies that have blocked U.S. firms from competing in this growing market. 
   But I am especially pleased at the prospects for increased agricultural exports. Around the world, average tariffs on U.S. agricultural exports are more than 40 percent. China is slashing its tariffs to far below this average: 17.5 percent. And on U.S. priority products--the products that 
   we produce for export--the average Chinese tariff will fall to just 14 percent. For bulk commodities the agreement establishes generous tariff rate quotas. For example, on wheat, a major export product for North Dakota, China will allow imports of 7.3 million metric tons initially (growing to 9.6 million tons by 2004) subject to a tariff of just 1 percent. In addition, China has agreed to changes in its administration of tariff rate quotas that will prevent state trading monopolies from blocking imports if there is private sector demand for wheat. 
   For my State of North Dakota, the agreement provides new export opportunities for wheat, for oilseeds, including canola, and for beef and pork products. The U.S. Department of Agriculture has estimated that this agreement could add $1.6 billion annually to U.S. exports of grains, oilseeds and cotton in just five years. Additional growth opportunities for North Dakota agricultural exports will come as China reduces its tariffs on beef (from 45 percent today to 12 percent by 2004) and pork (from 20 percent to 12 percent). Finally, the China agreement provides additional leverage for U.S. goals in the ongoing WTO negotiations on agriculture. China has agreed to eliminate export subsidies, to cap and reduce domestic subsidies, and to provide the right to import and distribute products without going through state trading enterprises. 
   There can be no question that this agreement will create expanded export opportunities for American workers, farmers and businesses. But the key word here is ``opportunities.'' This agreement creates wonderful opportunities for North Dakota agriculture, but it is not a silver bullet. This agreement will not solve all of our trade problems with China. Nor will the results come overnight. We will need to work aggressively year after year to take advantage of these opportunities and turn them into results. And we will need to closely monitor China's implementation of its commitments. 
   In that vein, I am very pleased that the legislation we are considering includes provisions I strongly supported to ensure that the Federal government monitors and enforces China's WTO accession agreement. And I am hopeful that the WTO's multilateral dispute resolution system will be more successful than our past unilateral efforts to hold China to its commitments. The simple fact is that the current system has not worked well. There has been no neutral arbitrator to resolve disputes. As a result, U.S. firms have been very reluctant for the U.S. to take action against China because of Chinese threats to retaliate against American business. With China in the WTO, we will have the advantage of a neutral dispute resolution system and rules to guard against Chinese retaliation. 
   In my view, the trade benefits alone are enough to conclude that we should support PNTR for China. But this debate is about more than just trade. It is about human rights and national security as well. I believe bringing China into the WTO and passing PNTR is the best way to improve human rights in China. Clearly, our current annual debate over Normal Trade Relations has had little effect on human rights in China. Bringing China into the WTO, though, will increase the openness of Chinese society. It will increase the presence of American and other Western firms in China. It will open China to the InterNet and other advanced telecommunications technologies that, over time, will expose average Chinese to our thoughts, values, and ideals on human rights, workers' rights and democracy. 
   This is not just my view. It is a view shared by numerous prominent Chinese dissidents and religious and democratic leaders. They believe that rejecting PNTR will only strengthen the iron hand of the hard-liners in the Chinese leadership. For example, Bao Tong, a prominent dissident, was quoted in the Washington Post saying that attempts to use trade sanctions on human rights simply do not work: ``I appreciate the efforts of friends and colleagues to help our human rights situation, but it doesn't make sense to use trade as a lever. It just doesn't work,'' Mr. Bao said. Similarly, Dai Qing, a leading Chinese environmentalist, argues that passing PNTR ``would put enormous pressure on both the government and the general public to meet the international standard not only on trade, but on other issues including human rights and environmental protection.'' Finally, the Dalai Lama has said that ``joining the World Trade Organization, I think, is one way to change in the right direction....... In the long run, certainly it will be positive for Tibet. Forces of democracy in China get more encouragement through that way.'' 
   Finally, I believe that passing PNTR will promote our national security interests. History teaches us that conflicts among trading partners are less likely than conflicts between countries that do not have strong economic ties. In contrast, rejecting PNTR could send a strong signal to China that the U.S. wants to isolate China. A hostile China is not in our national interest. A China integrated into the international system, obeying international rules and norms, is. 
   In conclusion, Mr. President, the arguments in favor of PNTR for China are very strong. Passing PNTR advances America's interests in Asia and the world. It is good for our national economy, and it is particularly good for my state's agricultural economy. I hope my colleagues will join me in sending a strong bipartisan message of support for China's accession to the WTO.

   Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, today I am pleased to be joined by Senator FRIST and Representatives CAMP and THURMAN in introducing the Medicare Renal Dialysis Payment Fairness Act of 2000. This legislation takes important steps to help sustain and improve the quality of care for Medicare beneficiaries suffering from kidney failure. 
   Nationwide, more than 280,000 Americans live with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). In my State of North Dakota, the number of patients living with ESRD is relatively small, just over 600. However, for these patients and others across the country, access to dialysis treatments means the difference between life and death. 
   In 1972, the Congress took important steps to ensure that elderly and disabled individuals with kidney failure receive appropriate dialysis care. At that time, Medicare coverage was extended to include dialysis treatments for beneficiaries with ESRD. 
   Over the last three decades, dialysis facilities have provided services to increasing numbers of kidney failure patients under increasingly strict quality standards; however, during this same time frame reimbursement for kidney services has not kept pace with the increasing demands of providing dialysis care. 
   Last year, Senator FRIST and I introduced legislation to ensure dialysis facilities could continue providing quality dialysis services to Medicare beneficiaries. I am happy to say that, based on these efforts, dialysis providers received increased Medicare reimbursement in fiscal years 2000 and 2001 as part of the Medicare, Medicaid, and S-CHIP Refinement Act of 1999. 
   While these efforts were a step in the right direction, a recent Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (MedPAC) report suggests that we must take further action to sustain patients' access to dialysis services. In particular, MedPAC recommends a 1.2 percent payment adjustment for Medicare-covered dialysis services in the next fiscal year. In addition, MedPAC recommends that the Health Care Financing Administration provide an annual review of the dialysis payment rate--a review that most other Medicare-covered services receive each year. 
   I believe these recommendations represent critical adjustments that must be addressed this year. For this reason, I have worked with Senator FRIST, Representative CAMP and Representative THURMAN to develop the Medicare Renal Dialysis Payment Fairness Act of 2000. This legislation would provide the payment rate improvements recommended by MedPAC and would establish an annual payment review process for dialysis services. This proposal would help ensure all dialysis providers receive reimbursement that is in line with increasing patient load and quality requirements. This is particularly important for our Nation's smaller, rural dialysis providers that on average receive Medicare payments to do not adequately reflect costs. 
   As the Congress considers further improvements to the Medicare Program, I urge my colleagues to support this important effort to ensure patients with kidney failure continue to have access to quality dialysis services. I thank my colleagues for working together on this bipartisan and bicameral proposal.

   Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Long-Term Caregivers Assistance Act of 2000, a proposal that would provide much needed assistance to individuals with long-term care needs and their caregivers. 
   Nationwide, more than 8 million individuals require some level of assistance with activities of daily living. Over the next 30 years, this number is expected to increase significantly as our nation experiences an unprecedented growth in its elderly population. 
   We know that for many people leaving their homes to obtain care is not their first choice--the cost of nursing home care can be prohibitive, and such care often takes individuals away from their communities. While federal support for long-term care is primarily spent on nursing home services, many people receive assistance with their long-term care needs in the home from their families, often without the help of public assistance or private insurance. 
   Nationwide, nearly 37 million individuals provide unpaid care to family members of all ages with functional or cognitive impairments. In my state, there are about 61,000 individuals providing informal caregiving services. 
   Unfortunately, the need for long-term care can cause substantial financial burdens on many individuals and their families. According to a recent study, almost two-thirds of those serving as caregivers suffer financial setbacks--setbacks that can total thousands of dollars in lost wages and other benefits over a caregiver's lifetime. This is a burden that caregivers and their families should not have to bear alone. 
   For this reason, I am introducing this proposal to provide a $2,000 tax credit that could be used by individuals with substantial care needs or by their caregivers. 
   Taxpayers who have long-term care needs, or who care for others with such needs, may not have the same ability to pay taxes as other taxpayers--a reasonable and legitimate concern in a tax system based on the principle of ability-to-pay. Providing a tax credit is an equitable and efficient way of helping caregivers and individuals with long-term care needs meet their formal and informal costs. 
   I recognize that this tax credit is only a piece of the long-term care puzzle--but I believe it is an important piece. This credit could be used to help pay for prescription drugs or other out-of-pocket expenses. It could be used to pay for some formal home care services. It could also be used to help family members offset some of the expenses they incur in caregiving. 
   We must act now to address the long-term care needs of our nation. I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation.

   Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to help our farmers fight back against the unfair trade practices of state trading enterprises. As many of my colleagues know, state trading enterprises are government sanctioned monopolies that control commodity exports. Their unfair practices allow them to undercut prices of U.S. commodities, both in our market and in overseas markets where we compete for exports. My legislation, the Export Enhancement Program Trigger Act of 2000, would direct our government to fight back against these unfair practices. 
   I am introducing this legislation in response to the experience of farmers in North Dakota, who have been forced to compete not just with foreign farmers, but with foreign state trading enterprises. Ever since the U.S.-Canada Free Trade Agreement (CFTA) took effect, North Dakota farmers have been flooded with a rising tide of imports of Canadian grains. 
   These imports are coming into our country not because Canadian farmers are more competitive, but because of flaws in the CFTA and the unfair actions of the Canadian Wheat Board (CWB). As negotiated by then-USTR Clayton Yeutter, the CFTA allows the Canadian Wheat Board to sell into our market at less than the total cost of acquiring and selling its grain. 
   The fact is that the Canadian Wheat Board is a government created and government supported monopoly. Because Canadian farmers are required to sell their grain to the Wheat Board, the Wheat Board gets its wheat at below market prices and can then tell its customers in this country or overseas that it will undercut U.S. prices. These practices amount to de facto subsidies, but because the Wheat Board operates in secret, these unfair practices are not subjected to the normal rules of international trade. 
   This unfair competition caused imports of wheat from Canada to increase steadily until, in 1993-94, they reached a record 2.4 million tons of total wheat and 575,000 tons of durum. These levels of imports caused unacceptable damage to North Dakota farmers, so I convinced the Clinton Administration to impose limits on Canadian imports. Under the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) negotiated with Canada, durum imports were limited to 300,000 tons and total wheat imports were limited to 1.5 million tons in 1994-95. 
   These limits worked. Imports of Canadian grain fell dramatically for several years. Unfortunately, however, the authority to impose these limits disappeared as a result of the Uruguay Round Agreements. As a result, our friends to the north are once again on the move, attacking our markets, using the monopoly power of the Canadian Wheat Board to undercut prices for our farmers. 
   Last year, imports from Canada again approached their 1993-94 peaks (2.2 million tons of total wheat and 560,000 tons of durum), and this year they are on track to stay far above the MOU level (2 million tons of total wheat and 480,000 tons of durum). This is unacceptable. It is far past time to send a clear and unmistakable message to our friends in Canada that the U.S. will not tolerate these practices any longer--that we will fight back. 
   The legislation I am introducing today will do exactly that. My legislation would require 
   USDA to use the Export Enhancement Program--EEP--in either of two circumstances. 
   First, if imports of durum or wheat into the U.S. from Canada exceed the  limits set in the MOU--300,000 tons for durum and 1,500,000 tons for total wheat imports--USDA would be required to use EEP to export wheat or durum into markets where we compete with Canada in a quantity equal to at least twice the total amount of Canadian imports into the U.S. for that year. 
   This will clearly tell Canada that it will lose far more in its overseas markets than it gains in our markets if it persists in exporting more than the MOU levels. As a result, I expect that Canada will again voluntarily comply with the MOU limits as it did in 1995-96 and 1996-97. Even if Canada does not comply, though, this legislation will ensure that U.S. farmers do not bear the costs of Canadian imports. By requiring the U.S. to export twice as much wheat as we are importing from Canada, this legislation will ensure that total supply will be reduced and prices will strengthen. 
   Second, if the Secretary of Agriculture determines that a state trading enterprise (STE) like the Canadian Wheat Board is using unfair trade practices to reduce our exports of any agricultural commodity to overseas markets, the Secretary is required to respond by using EEP in an amount sufficient to ensure that prices received by U.S. farmers are not reduced as a result of the STE's actions. Too often, we have heard from our industry and our USDA officials that Canada is arbitrarily undercutting U.S. prices in overseas markets. My proposal would require USDA to respond, to ensure that we do not give up our export markets without a fight. 
   Taken together, these two provisions will support the efforts of our trade negotiators to discipline STES as part of the World Trade Organization (WTO) negotiations on agriculture. Disciplining STEs is a top priority for our negotiators, and this legislation, by defining the marketing practices of STEs as unfair trade practices, will increase our negotiators' leverage to develop meaningful rules on STEs. 
   Moreover, I believe these provisions will support the efforts of North Dakota farmers, acting through the Wheat Commission, in bringing a trade case against Canada. I have always believed that, ultimately, Canadian agricultural trade issues will have to be resolved through negotiation. It is my hope that, in combination, this legislation and the trade case will provide short term relief for our farmers and help build sufficient pressure on Canada to negotiate a permanent resolution of Canadian grain issues. 
   I have no doubt that our friends to the north will not like this legislation. They do not like having a spotlight focused on their system, so they will complain about our use of EEP. I have a simple answer for them: If they do not want us to use EEP against them, they should stop dumping their grain into our market and stop using unfair trade practices in overseas markets. 
   I am pleased that this legislation has the support of every major farm group in North Dakota with an interest in these issues, including North Dakota Farmers Union, North Dakota Farm Bureau, North Dakota Wheat Commission, North Dakota Grain Growers, and the North Dakota Barley Council. 
   I hope that my colleagues will join me in supporting this important legislation.

   Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise, as well, in defense of this program. I rise in defense because I represent a State that is one of the most agricultural States in the Nation. The fact is, this program has helped stabilize an otherwise disastrous situation. 
   This chart shows what has happened to sugar prices since the most recent farm bill. This is what has happened to refined beet sugar prices. On this chart it looks like a cliff because it is. Prices have collapsed. If we did not have something to counter the cycle, we would see mass bankruptcy in rural America. That is a fact. 
   The Senator from Arizona comes out and he reads clippings from various news articles. Unfortunately, those people know virtually nothing about what they are writing about. They say, over and over, that the world price of sugar is 8 cents a pound. Absolute nonsense. The world price of sugar is not 8 cents a pound. The vast majority of sugar in the world moves under long-term contract at much higher prices than the 8 cents a pound. About 18 cents a pound--that is what most sugar in the world sells for. What the Senator from Arizona is talking about is what is reported in the popular press--repeatedly--which is flat wrong. 
   The price they are talking about is not the world price; the price they are talking about is the world dump price for sugar. It is what sugar sells for that is not under contract that is hard to sell. That is a dump price. It is far below the cost of production. It does not represent what sugar sells for in the world. It is an absolute fiction. 
   Every time we have ended the program, what has happened to prices? Let's ask that question. Because the suggestion from the Senator from Arizona is, if you would end this program--you phase it out--prices to consumers would go down. 
   Let's have a reality check. 
   What has happened in the times we have ended the program? Did prices go down or did prices go up? You know what happened? Prices skyrocketed. That is what happened when the program ended. The fact is, this is a program that stabilizes prices. And that is critical to the survival of thousands of family farmers. 
   The Senator from Arizona talks about one large interest as though that represents the totality of producers. Let me say to the Senator from Arizona, and to those who write these articles that attack the program and talk about one small group with large economic resources, what they are not doing is telling the whole story and telling the American people that literally thousands and thousands of family farmers are dependent on the stabilization this program provides. That is a fact. 
   Come to my State. Go farm to farm. Meet these families. They are not wealthy people. They are people trying to make it in an environment in which the prices of the products that they make have plunged. Without this program to stabilize prices, there would be financial ruination all across the heartland of America. Is that what the Senator from Arizona advocates? Is that what he wants to have happen? Because assuredly that would be the case. 
   One of the things that gets missed in this debate is this notion that somehow the United States is an island unto itself and that we do not have to worry about what the rest of the world is doing. If one would pay a little attention to what the rest of the world is doing, what one would find is that the United States is giving support to its producers at a level much lower than our major competitors. 
   This chart shows what our major competitors are doing in terms of support for their producers--$324 an acre.  Here is the support we are giving our producers--$34 an acre. By the way, these are not KENT CONRAD's numbers. These are numbers from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. 
   Our major competitors are outgunning us 10-1. I would suggest the Senator from Arizona is recommending unilateral disarmament for our agricultural producers in what is, in effect, a trade war. He would never do it in a military confrontation--never. If the other side had 50,000 tanks, and we had 10,000 tanks, would the Senator from Arizona be out here recommending we cut the number of our tanks in half? Would that be the first move? I do not think so.

   We are outgunned 10-1. If our opposition had 50,000 tanks and we had 10,000, would the Senator from Arizona advocate cutting our number of tanks in half? That is exactly what we 
   did in the last farm bill. They were supporting their producers at $50 billion a year. We were providing on average of $10 billion of support. And we cut our support in half. 
   I would be happy to yield to the Senator from Arizona.

   Mr. CONRAD. I just say that the Senator from Arizona says he would not do something, but that is precisely what he is doing on the floor of the Senate--precisely what he is doing--engaging in unilateral disarmament on behalf of our producers, when they are already being outspent 10-1 by our major competitors, the Europeans. 
   What the Senator from Arizona says is: Let's just abandon our folks. We are going to play by a different set of rules. We are going to be purists on this side of the Atlantic. On the other side of the Atlantic, they get to take these markets the old-fashioned way. They get to go out and buy them. The result will be exactly what is happening, I say to the Senator from Arizona, whom I respect and admire. 
   I disagree firmly with him on this point. I respect and admire the Senator from Arizona; I make that clear. We have a spirited debate and discussion going here, and that is in the best tradition of the Senate. This has no personal feeling attached to it. 
   I want the Senator from Arizona to know, I think this is precisely wrong. The fundamental reason it is wrong is because this is not the way world agriculture is working. What is happening in world agriculture today is our major competitors are going out and buying these markets. If we don't give some assistance to our producers, what will happen is the other side will take market share, as they are. The USDA now projects that this year for the first year the Europeans are going to surpass us in world market share. Why? Because they are going out in a very concentrated, calculated way and buying market after market from us. If we are going to throw in the sugar market, as we have thrown in the wheat market, as we have thrown in the barley market, pretty soon we will find an America that is second rate with respect to agriculture production. That would be a tragedy. It would be a mistake. 
   The Senator references the GAO report. GAO is not perfect. If we look at this report and study it objectively, USDA put a team together and looked at this report. They concluded the validity of the results are suspect and should not be quoted authoritatively. Here is a sampling of some of the words USDA career analysts used in describing the GAO report: naive, arbitrary, in error, inconsistent, inadequate, a puzzlement, inflammatory and unprofessional, not well documented, incomplete, unrealistic. In a nutshell, the instant experts at GAO compared the U.S. price--the same thing the Senator from Arizona has done, the 8 cents he quotes--to a world dump market price that is a fraction of the cost of producing sugar and assumed that if grocery chains and food manufacturers could have access to that dump market sugar, they would pass 100 percent of their savings along to consumers. 
   I have seen this over and over and over. It is an easy mistake to understand because people are writing about this industry who know nothing about it. They say over and over, the world price of sugar is 8 cents. That is absolute nonsense. It is not true. It is not accurate. That is the dump price for world sugar. It would be the same as talking about the world steel price and failing to look at all of the steel that sells to the automobile industry around the world under contract, instead to look at the dump market where just a fraction of world steel and world sugar sells. 
   It is economic know-nothingism, frankly, to make that reference. It is not reality. 
   We have very difficult issues to deal with in world agriculture. In our country, the No. 1 issue is right here. Are we going to let our producers get swamped by a flood of European money, by tough competitors who have made a determination that what they want to do is dominate world agriculture and they are going to do it the old-fashioned way. They are going to go out and buy these markets from us. That is what they are doing--$324 an acre of support on average versus our $34. If we want to continue to engage in unilateral disarmament and let American agriculture go right down the tubes, this is a good place to start, right here, today.

   Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I will go back to some of the things that were said here so the RECORD is crystal clear. When the Senator from Arizona says there are massive subsidies being paid to sugar producers, it is just wrong. That is not the way the sugar program works. There is not one nickel of payment made by the Federal Government to sugar producers--not one, not a penny. It is not a subsidy program here. That is not the way it works. 
   That is part of the problem we have. We have people who do not know the program--really do not know the economics of world agriculture, really know nothing about the sugar industry and the sugar program--out here trying to pass laws that would have draconian, dramatic effects. They really are ill-informed. I don't know a nicer way to say it. 
   When they say the world price of sugar is 8 cents, it is an absurdity. It costs 16 cents to 18 cents to produce sugar. How could the world price of sugar be 8 cents? It is not the world price of sugar, as has been said on the floor. The vast majority of sugar in the world sells under contract and those contract prices are not part of the calculation of what the Senator from Arizona calls the world price of sugar. That is excluded from those calculations. So when they talk about a world price of sugar, that is not the world price; it is a dump price. It is that sugar which is left over which is a small part of the world sugar supply that sells that was not part of a contract. It is not a world price. That is a misnomer. It is factually incorrect. 
   Now let's go to the underlying assumption. The underlying assumption is that somehow the rest of the world is engaged in free market economics with respect to agriculture production. False. That is not even close to being right. Our major competitors, the Europeans, are spending about $50 billion a year to support their producers--$50 billion. Here are the comparisons. This is from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. They are the ones who are in charge of keeping score on the question of who supports their producers at what level. Here is the European Union, our major competitor. They are supporting their producers on average $324 an acre. Here we are: $34 an acre. They are outgunning us 10 to 1. 
   What the Senator from Arizona says to us is we ought to cut this some more. We ought to cut our level of support even further. Let's engage in total unilateral disarmament in this world battle over agriculture markets. 
   What sense does that make? We tried that in the last farm bill. In the last farm bill, we cut our support for producers on average from $10 billion to $5 billion. We cut it in half on the theory that was going to be a good example for the Europeans and they would similarly reduce their support. 
   What happened? They did not cut their support by a nickel. Instead, they stayed steady on course, buying up world market after world market. The USDA tells us they are going to surpass the United States in world market share for the first time in anyone's memory. That is where we are headed. We are headed for a circumstance in which America, which has dominated world agricultural trade, is headed for the No. 2 position. And the Europeans believe, as they have told me, we are so prosperous that we will not fight back and, in fact, we will give up these markets.  
   I say to the Senator from Arizona, he would never engage in unilateral disarmament in a military confrontation. Why is he insisting on it in an agricultural market confrontation? It makes no sense. Here we are, outgunned 10 to 1, and he wants to make it an even greater disparity; to say to our producers: We abandon you. We wave the white flag of surrender; we want the Europeans to take over these world agricultural markets that have long been ours. 
   We have to quit being naive on what is going on in world trade. It is not free market. It is not free trade. It is managed trade; it is managed markets; it is a heavily subsidized battle over world market share. That is what is going on. We can choose to give up and run to the sidelines and give in or we can fight back. I hope the United States decides to fight back. I hope we decide we are not going to abandon our producers and allow our major competitors, the Europeans, to dominate world agricultural trade. In the long term, that would be an economic disaster for this country and certainly for the tens of thousands of farmers all across America who are dependent on the wisdom of this body to recognize what is happening, 
   and to stand by their side and be ready to fight because I can assure you, that is what the Europeans are doing. They are fighting for world market share. 
   As one of the top Europeans described to me: Senator, we believe we are in an agriculture trade war with the United States. We believe that at some point there will be a cease-fire in this trade war, and we believe that whoever occupies the high ground will be the winner. 
   The high ground is world market share. They have told me at some point they think there is going to be a cease-fire, and whoever occupies the high ground will be the winner, and the high ground is world market share. That is what this is all about. The Europeans are aggressively spending to gain world market share to be in a position of world dominance in agriculture, and that strategy and that plan is working. 
   If one looks at the trend lines over the last 20 years, one will find the Europeans have gone from being the major importing region in the world to the major exporting region today. They have done it in 20 years. They have done it by discipline. They have done it by a plan. They have done it by a strategy. They are counting on us not to be paying attention. They are counting on us to give up. They are counting on us to give in. They are counting on us to wave the white flag of surrender. 
   I pray this body does not go any further down this road of unilateral surrender in world agriculture because we have already given up too much. The Europeans support their producers $324 an acre. The United States supports its producers $34 an acre. 
   The Senator from Arizona said: Let's make this disparity even greater. That is a disaster. That is a disaster, and we have the chance to stop it by this vote at 2 o'clock. I hope we take the opportunity. 
   I thank the Chair and yield the floor.

   Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, might I first clarify that the $450 million that the Senator from Mississippi referenced is not for North Dakota. It is a national program to deal with disasters that have occurred in this most recent period of time. Some States have been hit by drought. Some States have been hit by flooding. 
   In reference to the question of the Senator from New Mexico, whether these are emergencies that could not have been dealt with in the normal process of the committee's work, the answer is affirmatively yes, they could not have been dealt with in the normal work of the committee. They could not have been dealt with in the previous supplemental because the disaster had not yet occurred--at least with respect to North Dakota. 
   Senator DORGAN indicated we had the most remarkable weather event since we saw the 500-year flood in 1997. In mid-June, our State got 20 inches of rain in 36 hours. This is the headline from the biggest paper in the State: ``Swamped.'' This was a week after the rain that I just referenced. 
   The rain that I just referenced occurred a week before this one. We have been hit by the most remarkable series of floods since the 1997 flood, which was a 500-year event. 
   On June 12, in North Dakota, we had rains that were up to 20 inches in a wide band in northeastern North Dakota. Seven days later we got hit with this rainstorm--8 inches in 6 hours. The devastation is stunning. 
   On the State university, this is the reference, NDSU, $50 million at the State university. 
   At the dome that is the large center, the activity center for the city: $10 million of damage. In surrounding farm areas as a result of these two floods: 1.7 million acres devastated. 
   The catastrophe in our State cannot be overstated: 1.7 million acres of land devastated, hundreds of millions of dollars of damage in the largest city in our State. This is an emergency by any definition. Unfortunately, it had not occurred when we dealt with the supplementals. It had not occurred  when the committee did its work. It is only now that we know the full extent of the damage. That is why we are here asking our colleagues not for a new program but to reinstate the program we had last year to deal with crop loss disasters. 
   Last year, we put in place a program that cost about $2 billion to deal with natural disasters. This year we are asking for $900 million not just for North Dakota but for the other States that have been hit as well. We know the devastation in North Dakota is stunning, but we are not alone. In other areas of the country disasters have ruined crops as well: 216 counties in Georgia, South Carolina, and Florida were declared disaster areas on July 14. 
   I might say to my colleagues, I spoke on this matter last Friday with Senator Coverdell, Senator Coverdell who was tragically lost to us earlier this week. Senator Coverdell had indicated that he would join in an amendment because Georgia has been devastated. South Carolina and Florida were declared agricultural disaster areas as well on that same day, July 14. 
   USDA has also declared agricultural disasters in parts of Alabama, Nebraska, New Mexico, Arizona, Mississippi, New York, Texas, Washington, and perhaps other States. These are the States that I know of that have had disasters declared. 
   The hard reality is these things have happened. The earlier package we dealt with was designed for economic disasters. That has been passed. That has been signed into law. This is to give back the program that was available last year for areas hit by drought or severe flooding. We are asking for $900 million. I can tell you, it is desperately needed, desperately needed. It is without question an emergency. 
   This series of events, at least in our State, had not occurred at the time of the supplemental appropriations bills, nor had it occurred so the full extent of the damage was known for the committee deliberations. That is the reality. 
   This responds also to the needs of producers in the Northeastern United States who have been hit, and the needs of producers hit by disasters in the South. 
   I ask my colleagues to very carefully consider their response to this request. We have always tried to be a United States of America in response to disasters, listening to the needs of every State in every condition. I regret very much that I am here asking again. We have had nine Presidential disaster declarations in the last 8 years in my State. I never remember something like this in my life. There is some 
   extraordinary weather pattern affecting my State. 
   As many of you know, we have a lake that has risen 25 vertical feet in the last 6 years, a lake that is the size of the District of Columbia, a lake that is devouring surrounding communities, roads, farms--that is another disaster. That lake missed having this extraordinary rainfall by 70 miles. If that lake would have been hit by this 20 inches of rain in 2 days, we would have been here dealing with a calamity of stunning proportion. 
   So I say to my colleagues, I know none of us like these surprise requests, but we could not have made the request until the disaster occurred. We could not have quantified the need, unfortunately, until FEMA and USDA had a chance to go in and do a review of the level of disaster. Again, the $450 million requested is not for North Dakota. It is a national response to all the States that have been affected to repeat the program we passed and put in place last year. I hope my colleagues' hearts will not turn cold simply because we have had to face disasters year after year. I can tell you, the people of my State need help. Mr. President, 1.7 million acres devastated, that is one-fifth, 20 percent of the crop base of my State, and the biggest city of my State, as the headline in the biggest newspaper in my State says: ``Swamped.'' 
   This is from the Grand Forks Herald, one of the four largest cities in the State, 80 miles to the north of Fargo: ``Area Flooding Continues.'' Here are additional reports, ``Weather Service Official Says Storm Worst He's Ever Seen.'' 
   It is hard to describe an event of this proportion--20 inches of rain in 36 hours. It is Biblical. I don't know any other way to say it to my colleagues. 
   This is from the Fargo Forum, again the biggest newspaper in our State, with officials there saying: ``It's the worst rain flood we've ever had''--in the history of our State. 
   Finally, this story kind of tells it all, again from the biggest newspaper in our State: ``Floods Finish Off Crops Hurt By Drought.'' 
   I just conclude by saying to my colleagues: It is perverse but it has happened. Hundreds of millions of dollars of damage in my State alone, with other States similarly affected. We ought to put in place the program we had last year to help those who deserve assistance. That is my plea to my colleagues tonight.

   Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I thank Senator STEVENS as well. I thank Senator COCHRAN and others who helped craft this agreement--Senator KOHL. Because the fact is, there are real disasters and real emergencies. In my State where, on June 12, 20 inches of rain fell in 36 hours, 1 week later 8 inches of rain fell in 6 hours. It gave us this headline in the biggest paper in our State: ``Swamped.'' It says it all. A disaster of stunning proportions costing hundreds of millions of dollars in the major city of our State--1.7 million acres of land, of cropland, devastated. This is an emergency. It is a disaster. It must be addressed. 
   Through this amendment we will begin the process of healing. I thank all those who participated in this agreement. 
   I do want to answer the Senator from Texas when he says we have had $14 billion of emergencies in the last 2 years. The underlying reason is a failure----

   Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Chair, and I thank very much my colleague from West Virginia. 
   The reason we have had to have substantial emergency spending is because of the failure of the last farm bill. The last farm bill represents unilateral disarmament. While our major competitors, the Europeans, are spending $50 billion a year to support their producers, we, on average, were spending $10 billion under the previous farm bill. We cut it in half on the notion that the Europeans would follow our good example. 
   What a foolish tactic. We would never do that in a military confrontation, engage in unilateral disarmament. But it is precisely what we did with respect to a trade confrontation. 
   Agriculture has been in deep trouble and we have responded. Congress, the administration, and we thank our colleagues, for that response. But now we have been hit by unprecedented natural disasters.

   Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleagues in mourning the sudden and untimely death of our colleague from Georgia, PAUL COVERDELL. 
   Senator COVERDELL had a long and distinguished career of public service, capped by his dedicated service in the United States Senate. Senator COVERDELL served his country in the United States Army in Japan, Taiwan and Korea. In 1970, he embarked on a career in politics in his native Georgia, serving as a state Senator and chairman of the state Republican party. In 1989 he was selected by President Bush to lead the Peace Corps. 
   We here in the Senate, though, knew PAUL COVERDELL as a friend and as a real gentleman. We did not always agree on the issues, but PAUL COVERDELL never took policy disagreements personally and never let them affect his relationships with other Senators. Senator COVERDELL was always very positive, very upbeat. On every issue, even when we disagreed, I found PAUL to be fair, decent, and, above all, honest. 
   In this body, some Senators are known as ``work horses.'' Others are known as ``show horses.'' There is no question that PAUL COVERDELL was a work horse. He was not flashy. He did not seek the media spotlight. PAUL COVERDELL worked tirelessly with the leadership on his side of the aisle on some of the toughest issues facing the Senate. He was interested in getting results, not credit. His focus, his determination, and his willingness to bring other Senators together to get things done served the Senate well, served Georgia well, and served our country well. His spirit and energy will be sorely missed in this body. 
   Put simply, I liked and respected PAUL COVERDELL. We will miss him. My thoughts and prayers go out to his wife, Nancy, his family and friends, and his staff.

   Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, this week the Senate was required to choose between two plans to correct the marriage tax penalty. Unfortunately, both of them were flawed. 
   Make no mistake. The marriage penalty is wrong. The tax code should not penalize people simply because they choose to marry. As our economy continues to thrive, we have the opportunity to address the unfairness in the tax code. But we must do so in a manner that is fiscally responsible. We must provide relief to those unfairly penalized, but avoid an unwarranted windfall to those who already receive favorable treatment. 
   I believe the only way to fully eliminate the marriage penalty is to allow couples to decide whether to file jointly, or as individuals. As we have heard throughout this debate, there are 65 different places in the tax code which can cause married couples to pay more tax than they otherwise would. By allowing couples to choose between filing singly or jointly, we allow each couple to choose the best outcome for their personal situation. That is the approach I favor. 
   And that is why I supported Senator MOYNIHAN's proposal. His plan takes the right approach, and would completely eliminate the marriage penalty for couples making $100,000 or less. However, I believe Senator MOYNIHAN's proposal did not go far enough to completely restore fairness for all couples, no matter what their income. 
   I did not support the plan proposed by Senator ROTH. It would deal with only three of the instances in the tax code that can result in a marriage penalty, and would direct even greater benefits to people who already experience a ``marriage bonus'' under current tax law. The Roth proposal carries a tremendous price tag, with costs ballooning out of control as the baby boomers begin to retire--and despite its costs, would provide only modest relief from the marriage penalty for the great majority of couples over the next ten years. 
   We have heard that this legislation faces a veto. We will have the opportunity to return to this issue, and find a better solution, one that is affordable, simple, and effective. 
   The plan I offered in the Finance Committee in April could, I believe, form the basis for a compromise. It provides a simple, elegant, and complete solution to the marriage penalty, based on the concept of optional single filing. 
   Optional single filing could not be simpler--taxpayers decide whether to file as a couple or as two single individuals, whichever method produces the smallest family tax bill. Optional single filing means that couples who actually pay the marriage penalty get the relief from it. 
   Let's review one more time why the marriage tax penalty happens. Under our system, marriage affects tax liabilities because married couples pay income taxes jointly rather than as two individuals. Because tax brackets, deductions, and credits for couples are not always set at exactly twice the levels for individuals, married couples do not always pay the same taxes as they would if the same two people were unmarried. As I said, experts have identified 65 separate provisions in the Internal Revenue Code that can affect taxpayers differently based on marital status. 
   About 42 percent of couples pay more filing jointly than if they were not married and filed as two individuals. This is defined as a marriage tax penalty. About half of all married couples pay less. This is known as a marriage tax bonus. The remainder see no significant difference either way. 
   The Roth proposal dealt conclusively with only one of the provisions that gives rise to a marriage penalty. If the difference in the standard deduction is responsible for your marriage penalty, the Republican plan has all the relief you need. 
   If the widths of the rate brackets causes you to pay more as a married couple than you would if you were two single individuals, the Roth plan will give you some help. Likewise, if your penalty stems from the structure of the earned income tax credit, the Republicans have a little something to offer. But for those two marriage penalty situations--and the 62 other provisions in the Internal Revenue Code that could result in a couple paying a marriage penalty--only optional single filing can provide complete relief. 
   That's why I so strongly support optional single filing. It's the best way of dealing with the marriage penalty--give people the flexibility to decide what's best for them. 
   And, because optional single filing would not give tens of billions of dollars in new tax breaks for wealthy individuals who already get a marriage bonus, it would allow us to pay down the national debt faster. Every time I visit with North Dakotans, they tell me that paying down the national debt should be a top priority. Paying down debt will strengthen our economy and reduce interest costs. And it will ensure that our children and grandchildren are not saddled with future tax increases to pay for the debt we ran up in the past three decades. 
   This plan is simple. It is complete. And it matches our nation's priorities. I hope that as this debate moves forward, we can use the plan as a basis for an effective compromise.

   Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to authorize the Army Corps of Engineers to construct a new water transmission line from the Missouri River to the city of Williston. This project is very important to the reliability of the water supply for the residents of Williston and is needed to mitigate long-term consequences from construction of the Garrison Dam. 
   The construction of the Garrison Dam and creation of Lake Sakakawea by the Corps forced the city of Williston to relocate its water intake and treatment plant to its present location approximately five miles upstream of the city. As a requirement of the new location, a large-diameter transmission line was constructed to convey the entire city's water supply from the treatment plant to the city. 
   All of the water for the city's residents and businesses must flow through this single transmission line. As a result, the existing transmission line is the only link between the water treatment plant and the city's water distribution system. 
   The existing transmission line has been in service for nearly 40 years with limited maintenance to date in part because the line runs through an area near the river that has become super-saturated due to the rising water table behind the dam. As the transmission line continues to age, it has become susceptible to failures, as demonstrated in April 1998. 
   On April 8, 1998, maintenance crews discovered a major leak in the transmission line near the water treatment plant. City officials immediately alerted residents of the problem and imposed water restrictions to essential water uses only. Through an emergency declaration, the National Guard was enlisted to install an overland pipeline to help provide temporary water for the city. The high water table from Lake Sakakawea made repairs difficult with extensive pumping and dewatering procedures needed to locate and fix the broken pipeline. It took more than two weeks to make the necessary repairs. If the failure had occurred during the winter, repairs and temporary water service would have been almost impossible to provide. This experience supports the need for Williston to have a second transmission line from the water treatment plant to the city's water distribution system. 
   The bill I am introducing today will authorize the Corps to construct a new transmission line. The city has identified a new route for the line that provides improved access, avoids unstable site conditions, provides potential service for future industrial sites, while minimizing the length and cost of the new transmission line. 
   Mr. President, I believe the Federal government has a responsibility to assist communities mitigate the adverse consequences resulting from the construction of the Garrison Dam and creation of Lake Sakakawea. The Corps of Engineers built the Garrison Dam which resulted in the need for this project, and in my view the Corps should be responsible for addressing the unintended consequences of building that dam. This bill will help the Federal government live up to its responsibility and ensure that the residents of Williston have a reliable water supply. I urge my colleagues to review this legislation quickly so we can pass it this year, before there is another disruption to the city's water supply.

   Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, perhaps it is useful to this debate and discussion to put in perspective what we are talking about in budget terms, and then to go to the specifics of the proposals that are before us. I think it is useful, first, to review where we are in terms of the projected surplus over the next 10 years because those numbers have just changed. We are now told we will have a total surplus, a projection of a surplus, of $4.2 trillion over that 10-year period. 
   I think it is also important to remember that two-thirds of that money is from Social Security and Medicare; $2.3 trillion represents surpluses from Social Security, $400 billion represents surpluses from Medicare. 
   Between those two, over $2.7 trillion of the $4.2 trillion projected surplus is from Social Security and Medicare. That leaves us over the next 10 years $1.470 trillion of non-Social Security, non-Medicare surplus. This is money that I argue is available for tax relief, is available for additional debt paydown, and is available for high priority domestic needs such as education, prescription drug coverage, additional expenditures on defense, and  other high priorities that we might have in this country. I also argue that Agriculture ought to be given additional resources to confront the Europeans, our major competitors, who are outspending us dramatically as they attempt to buy markets that were once ours. That is the money we have available over the next 10 years 
   The other day in the Washington Post, Secretary Summers, the Secretary of the Treasury, warned us that the proposal that has come out of the House, which is before us now as the Republican proposal, explodes in cost in the second 10 years. 
   I just reviewed our budget circumstance in the next 10 years according to the latest estimates. In the second 10 years, the Republican tax proposal on estate tax explodes in cost. It goes from $105 billion to $750 billion. Here is the Secretary of the Treasury alerting us that the tax cut will cost too much. He points out that the estate tax repeal measure passed by the House and now before the Senate would cost about $750 billion in the second 10 years, more than 7 times its cost in the first 10 years. He points out:  
   If it were to be enacted, it might be the most backloaded piece of tax legislation ever.  
   That is the Secretary of the Treasury. 
   The respected columnist, David Broder, wrote in the Washington Post the day before the Summers' column, Sunday, July 9, a recommendation to the President that he veto the Republican estate tax proposal. He points out that 98 percent of the inheritors in 1998 paid nothing in estate tax--nothing. The $28 billion in inheritance taxes came from 2 percent of very large estates. 
   He goes on to point out that under a 1997 law, a couple with a farm or business worth up to $2.6 million can give it to their heirs tax free. The Democrats raise that to $4 million for a couple, which means that only 1 of every 100 estates would face any inheritance tax. In fact, our proposal is to raise it to $4 million for a couple, and $8 million for those who own small businesses or farms. We are talking about a fraction of 1 percent that would have any liability under the plan we are offering. 
   These charts tell the story. The Republican plan explodes in cost in the second 10 years. It goes from $105 billion over that period in the first 10 years to $750 billion in the second 10 years. 
   There is also something very interesting about the estate tax proposal of our Republican colleagues. They talk a lot about eliminating estate taxes, but really what they do in the first 10 years is not eliminate the estate tax at all. In the first 10 years, they reduce the rates at the top end so the people they are helping are the people who are the very wealthiest in the country. Those are the people to whom they are providing the first relief. 
   It is, frankly, very odd. I have to ask my Republican colleagues why they would choose to provide estate tax relief in this way. Why don't they begin by helping the small business 
   owners and the farmers and the couples who just qualify for paying estate tax? Why not?

   Mr. CONRAD. I will be happy to yield for that purpose after I have gone a little further. I then will be happy to engage my colleague. Why do they have an estate tax plan that gives the first relief to the very wealthiest among us? Why not provide the first help to those who really need it: small business owners, the farmers who we think ought to be exempted from the estate tax because the estate tax structure, as it is, is out of date. 
   That is not what the Republican plan does. The blue line on this chart shows current law. The red line shows the GOP estate tax proposal. They reduce the rate starting at the top rate first. They reduce that and then create this incredible cliff effect when it goes into full effect supposedly 10 years from now. Frankly, because of the exploding cost, I doubt their plan would ever go into full effect. We would have the worst of all worlds. We would have the top rates reduced, nobody relieved from estate tax liability for the first 10 years, and then I believe because of the exploding costs, this cliff effect would never occur, and we would have the worst of all worlds. We would have lost the ability to plan, to manage estates; we would have lost the opportunity to take people off the rolls who really ought to be off the rolls, and we would have, as I say, the worst of all worlds. 
   If we look at the underlying facts, 98 percent of estates currently are exempt; 98 percent of estates pay no estate tax because of current law which provides substantial credits to exempt the vast majority of estates. Only 2 percent have some requirement to pay under current law. The Democratic proposal in the first year relieves 42 percent of those 2 percent of any liability. That is the Democratic plan. The Republican plan relieves 0 percent of estates from taxation in the first year. Let's go back and review what I have said. 
   Under current law, 98 percent of estates are exempt. Only 2 percent pay any estate tax. Under the Democratic plan, of those 2 percent who have some estate tax liability, in the first year we take 42 percent of them off the rolls completely, entirely. The Republicans take none of them off the rolls--none. 
   At the end of the 10-year period, the Democratic plan takes 67 percent of those 2 percent of estates that have a liability now off the rolls. We take two-thirds of them off the rolls entirely. The Republicans, by the year 2009, takes none of them off the rolls of liability. 
   There is an enormous difference between these plans, and the Democratic plan is far superior in the next 10 years to the Republican plan--far superior for couples, far superior for small business, far superior for farmers. 
   In this morning's New York Times on the front page of the business section, it says:  
   Two prominent experts on estate taxes said yesterday that the Democrats were offering a much better deal to small-business owners and farmers, because the relief under their bill would be immediate and the estate tax would be eliminated on nearly all of them. ``The fact is that the Democrats are making the better offer--and I'm a Republican saying that,'' said Sanford J. Schlesinger of the law firm of Kaye, Scholer, Fierman, Hays & Handler in New York. With routine estate planning, he said, the $4 million exemption could effectively be raised to as much as $10 million in wealth that could be passed untaxed to heirs. Only 1,221 of the 2.3 million people who died in 1997 left a taxable estate of $10 million or more, I.R.S. data shows. 
   Neil Harl, an Iowa State University economist who is a leading estate tax adviser to Midwest farmers, said that only a handful of working family farms had a net worth of $4 million.  
   Of course, we would permit $8 million by a couple to be passed untaxed to heirs.  
   Above that--  
   Above the $4 million he is referencing--  
   with very few exceptions, you are talking about the Ted Turners who own huge ranches and are not working farmers,'' he said. 
   Mr. Harl said he was surprised that farmers were not calling lawmakers to demand that they take the president up on his promise to sign the Democratic bill.  
   The Democratic plan, even according to Republican tax analysts, is far superior to the Republican plan in providing relief to taxpayers. 
   It is also true our proposal costs less--$64 billion over the next 10 years, instead of the $105 billion of the Republican plan. That means we could use that other money for other priorities. 
   We could use it for an additional paydown of the debt. That happens to be my favorite priority. I would like to have an even more rapid paydown of the debt because of the enormous benefits that flow from that policy. 
   But there are other things we could do. We could provide tax incentives for health care with the additional money. We could provide for college tuition deductibility, which would help millions of American families who are sending their kids to college. We could have retirement savings proposals. Those cost in the range of $30 to $40 billion. We could have a long-term care tax credit. That costs $32 billion. 
   As I say, we could have additional debt reduction of $40 billion under the Democratic plan, in addition to dramatic estate tax relief that would immediately remove people from the rolls of having to pay estate tax. We could have a paydown on a prescription drug benefit. 
   This is a question of priorities. Our priority has been to give real relief, immediate relief, to those estates that  ought not be taxed, in our judgment, to give real relief to thousands of families who would pay no estate tax under our plan and have that relief immediate, starting this coming year, allowing 40 percent of the small number of estates that are currently taxable --only 2 percent of the estates are currently taxable, and we take 40 percent of them off the first year. They owe nothing. The Republican plan takes none of them off the rolls. It gives their relief at the top end, top down, rather than bottom up. That is the fundamental difference between our plan and their plan. 
   We have, as I say, in the New York Times this morning prominent tax experts saying the Democratic plan is better for small business owners. It is better for farmers. There is really no question about it. 
   In the first 10 years, people are much better off under the plan we have offered. I go back to the point I made earlier. Under the Republican plan, you get to the second 10 years and the 
   cost explodes, right at the time the baby boomers start to retire, and put additional pressure on the budget of the United States. 
   I believe the Republican plan will never go into effect. They will find some other way to circle back and impose a tax on those assets because the cost of their plan explodes in the second 10 years to $750 billion right at the time the baby boomers start to retire. 
   I tell you, this is the time to have estate tax relief that is real, not to wait 10 years but to start now, taking people who should not be there off the rolls, giving relief to small business owners and farmers. That is what the Democratic plan does. 
   Mr. President, I would be happy to yield to the Senator from Arizona who had an answer to a question. I yield on his time.

   Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, as my colleagues may be aware, in recent  years there has been discussion within the military about modifying or equipping B-52 aircraft with advanced electronic jamming equipment that would allow them to perform a dedicated electronic warfare, or EW, mission.

    Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise to congratulate the City of Fargo, North Dakota, on its recent selection with neighboring Moorhead, Minnesota, as an All-American City by the National Civic League. 
   This is a prestigious but well deserved honor. The Fargo-Moorhead metro area is one of the most vital and fastest growing in the Upper Great Plains. The region is home to three highly respected colleges and universities. It is a major medical and commercial center. And in recent years, the area has seen remarkable growth in high technology. 
   But modern infrastructure and economic vitality are only part of the story of this award. Fargo was recently ranked the best medium-sized city in America in which to raise children. It offers the sort of civil society with safe streets, strong families, and functioning and responsive government that comes to mind when people all over this country think of what it means to live in America's heartland. 
   It was pleasant news but no surprise that Fargo-Moorhead was one of 10 communities that were winners in the national All-America City competition, hosted by the National Civic League. The league could not have chosen better. 
   As I have discussed on the Senate floor, recent storms dumped over seven inches of rain on Fargo in just over seven hours, inundating the city and causing hundreds of millions of dollars of damage. These torrential rains have also meant something else, however--another chance for the area's residents to show their resilience, compassion, and community spirit. Already, Fargo-Moorhead is coming back, stronger than ever. 
   Mr. President, I would like to pay special tribute to the cooperation between Fargo and its sister city to the east, Moorhead. Rather than a basis for rivalry, the proximity and common experience of Fargo and Moorhead have proven compelling rationales for cooperation. The joint award to Fargo and Moorhead of All-America City honors recognizes the daily cooperation and friendship that characterizes relations between these neighboring communities. 
   Numerous volunteers invested thousands of hours of work in preparations for the recent competition, and deserve sincere thanks. Let me make special note of the efforts of Fargo Mayor Bruce Furness and Moorhead Mayor Morris Lanning for their leadership and vision. In helping to make this award a reality, they are allowing the nation to see what we in North Dakota and Minnesota have known for years--that Fargo-Moorhead is shining example of the American dream made reality, a truly All-America City. 
   Again, on behalf of the United States Senate, I offer my most sincere congratulations to Fargo and Moorhead for being recognized as an All-America City.

   Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise today to offer a lockbox amendment with Senator LAUTENBERG and Senator REID designed to protect Social Security and Medicare. 
   This amendment is simple but important. 
   First, it says we must protect Social Security surpluses each and every year. The budget has finally been balanced without counting Social Security, and we must make sure it stays balanced without counting Social Security and Medicare. 
   Second, my amendment takes the Medicare hospital insurance trust fund surpluses off budget to prevent those surpluses from being raided for anything but Medicare. 
   According to the Office of Management and Budget, the Medicare trust fund will run a surplus of over $400 billion from the year 2001 to 2010. Taking these surpluses off budget and locking them away will ensure that they are used only for Medicare and to pay down the debt. Taking the Medicare trust fund off budget, as in Social Security off budget, will ensure that these payroll taxes that workers pay will be used to meet the future demographic challenges Medicare and Social Security face. 
   We have reached a bipartisan agreement that Social Security belongs off budget and that its surpluses should be preserved solely for Social Security. For seniors, Medicare is just as critically important for financial independence in their golden years. It is now time to give the same protection to Medicare that we already accord to Social Security, by taking Medicare off budget, too. 
   Medicare is absolutely critical to the health and economic well-being of nearly 40 million senior citizens. Before Medicare, many of our senior citizens were one major medical event away from poverty. Today, our seniors enjoy the security of knowing Medicare is there for them. We should not put at risk Medicare because of a failure to protect Medicare from raids for other purposes. We have been through this on Social Security. 
   The amendment I am offering says we are going to treat Medicare the same as we are treating Social Security. Unfortunately, the amendment of the Senator from Missouri fails to do that. It suggests it is a Medicare lockbox, but it really isn't. When we examine the amendment of the Senator from Missouri, we find there is a fatal flaw. The fatal flaw is that the Senator from Missouri has no enforcement mechanism for its provision taking Medicare surpluses off budget. In fact, it does not move Medicare off budget. It only removes Medicare surpluses off budget. 
   The result is, under the Ashcroft amendment, no point of order would apply against legislation that uses Medicare surpluses for other reasons. Under the Ashcroft amendment, the Medicare trust fund could be depleted for any purpose, as long as the overall budget remained in balance. Unfortunately, because of the way the amendment of the Senator from Missouri has been drafted, it is opening Medicare to raids for other purposes. That is a fatal flaw. That is what my amendment corrects. My amendment takes Medicare trust fund surpluses off budget, protecting them with points of order so there could not be a raid on Medicare. 
   Let me make my point as clearly as I can. If we look at the fiscal year 2000, we have a unified surplus projection of $224 billion. Social Security is in surplus by $150 billion. We will not permit that to be raided. 
   Medicare is in surplus by $24 billion. We will not permit that to be raided under my amendment. But under the amendment of the Senator from Missouri, one could take every penny of the $24 billion in surplus in Medicare because the overall budget would still be in balance. That is the fatal flaw of the amendment of the Senator from Missouri. The Senator does not protect these Medicare funds if the overall budget is in balance. I don't know if that was realized by the other side, but that is a fatal flaw. That is why the amendment of the Senator from North Dakota, my amendment, the amendment I am offering with Senator LAUTENBERG and Senator REID, is critically important; we would prevent any raid on Medicare funds. 
   Our lockbox is simply stronger. We establish points of order that protect the integrity of the Medicare trust fund in each and every year. Our plan was drafted to make the Medicare trust fund status exactly the same as Social Security. For some reason, the amendment of the Senator from Missouri has been drafted differently. It does not give the full protections to Medicare that we have given to Social Security. Why not? 
   If we look at the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, and I direct my colleagues to page 17, on the bottom of  that page are laid out the specific protections we provide for Social Security. We provide them for Medicare in the amendment that I am offering. The Senator from Missouri has failed to do so. He has left them out. For some reason he is giving lesser protection to Medicare than we give to Social Security. My amendment solves that fatal flaw that is in the amendment of the Senator from Missouri. 
   In our plan, we treat Medicare similar to Social Security by excluding all receipts and disbursements of the Federal Hospital Insurance trust fund from budget totals. We exclude the Medicare trust fund from sequestration procedures and create parallel Budget Act points of order to protect the surplus in the Medicare trust fund in each and every year. 
   Our plan also creates a new point of order against legislation that would cause or increase an on-budget deficit. So it protects the integrity of the Medicare trust fund and the on-budget surplus for debt reduction. Our plan also strengthens existing protections for Social Security by enforcing points of order against reducing Social Security surpluses in each and every year. 
   The Ashcroft amendment is silent on Social Security. It has verbiage there, but there is no new protection for Social Security in the amendment of the Senator from Missouri. Our amendment adds a point of order against violating the off-budget status of Social Security and requires Social Security revenues and outlays to be set forth for every fiscal year in a budget resolution rather than for only the 5 years under current law. 
   In addition, we strengthen existing points of order protecting Social Security by enforcing points of order against reducing the Social Security surplus in every year covered by the budget resolution rather than only in the first year and the total of all years covered by the budget resolution as current law provides. 
   The amendment I am offering with Senator LAUTENBERG and Senator REID is very clear: We are protecting Social Security and Medicare in a lockbox that has real protections, and we treat them in the same way. Unfortunately, the proposal of the Senator from Missouri creates a difference between the protection we provide Social Security and the protection we provide Medicare. The Senator from Missouri provides much less protection for Medicare than we provide Social Security. It has a fatal flaw: no enforcement mechanism. The result is, under the Ashcroft amendment, the Medicare trust fund could be depleted for any purpose as long as the overall budget remained in balance. That is a profound mistake. 
   The amendment of the Senator from Missouri would allow the Medicare trust fund surplus in the year 2000 to be raided of every penny. We should not allow that. That is not a lockbox; that is a ``leakbox.'' We are trying to construct a lockbox here to protect Medicare, not a figleaf that will make people believe we protected Medicare but really open up a gigantic loophole that would allow for raids on Medicare as we used to see on Social Security. 
   This is a defining vote. Those who care about protecting Social Security and Medicare, and are serious about it, will support our amendment. Those who want a figleaf and a press release will be in opposition. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. CONRAD. I say to my colleague and my friend from New Mexico, his last reference is to a provision that says you can spend Medicare money for Medicare programs. That is so we can have a BBA add-back, a balanced budget add-back, for Medicare, as we did last year. There is nothing mysterious about that. 
   The Senator from New Mexico asked why we weren't supporting the lockbox proposal he made previously. There are two reasons: No. 1, we got a letter from the Secretary of the Treasury saying that could threaten default on the debt of the United States; No. 2, our analysts indicated that could threaten Social Security payments to those who are eligible for Social Security. Those are the reasons we have not accepted that lockbox proposal. 
   I didn't just come here today proposing a lockbox. For 2 years, I have proposed a Social Security and Medicare lockbox as a senior member of the Senate Budget Committee. Frankly, our friends on the other side of the aisle have resisted. 
   If the choice is between the lockbox proposal I have made today and the lockbox proposal of the Senator from Missouri on the question of which is stronger, there is no question which is stronger. The amendment I have offered is stronger. That is because there is a fatal flaw in the amendment of the Senator from Missouri. He provides no enforcement mechanism for the provision taking Medicare surpluses off budget. 
   Under the amendment of the Senator from Missouri, no point of order would apply against legislation that could use Medicare surpluses for other purposes. Under the Ashcroft amendment, the Medicare trust fund could be depleted for any purpose as long as 
   the overall budget remained in balance. That is the fact. That is the reality. 
   I notice the chairman of the Budget Committee never referenced the amendment the Senator from Missouri has before the Senate today. Never referenced it. He talked about a lockbox proposal they have had previously--not about the lockbox proposal before us today. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I am running out of time. The Senator from Missouri informs me he has 20 minutes left. I have 2 minutes left. Under the rules, if neither of us uses time right now, the remaining time of each of us is used equally, which means I would run out of time. He has indicated that is what he would do. If I do not take this time for my final argument, we just lose the time. Those are the rules of the Senate. That is fair. 
   I say this. I am saying this for the benefit of colleagues on my side who are wondering if there is additional time available. Clearly, there is not. 
   The Senator from Michigan and the Senator from New Mexico have again raised the question of the lockbox they offered previously; not the lockbox on which we are about to vote, but what they offered previously. The reason our side resisted that lockbox approach is because we received a letter from the Secretary of the Treasury from which I quote:  
   Our analysis indicates that the provisions Senators Domenici and Abraham and Ashcroft were previously offering could preclude the United States from meeting its financial obligations to repay maturing debt and to make Social Security benefit payments, and could also worsen a future economic downturn.  
   That is the reason we resisted those plans, because they were flawed. That is the same reason I believe the amendment I have offered today, to have a Social Security and Medicare lockbox--something I have proposed for 2 years--is superior to the option we are actually voting on today. The reason our proposal is superior, I believe, is because it protects Medicare. It protects it in the same way we protect Social Security: by points of order to make certain that it is not raided. 
   Unfortunately, the amendment of the Senator from Missouri does not have that level of protection. He has less protection for Medicare than for Social Security. He does not have a point of order that can apply against legislation that would use Medicare surpluses for other purposes. The problem with that is under the Ashcroft amendment the Medicare trust fund could be raided, could be depleted for any purpose as long as the overall budget remained in balance. 
   I thank the Chair.

   Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I will not take 5 minutes at this point. I want to make the point that I appreciate the Senator from Missouri. He is serious and sincere about an effort to provide a Social Security and Medicare lockbox, but when you look at the specifics of what he has proposed, it falls short. There is a fatal flaw. 
   Let's look at fiscal year 2000. There is projected a $150 billion Social Security surplus. That is protected. There is a $24 billion projected Medicare surplus. Under the proposal of the Senator from Missouri, every penny of the Medicare surplus could be taken for other purposes because the protection he provides is aimed at the overall budget being in surplus, not at the Medicare component being in surplus. So he has a lockbox that leaks. That is the problem. 
   The reason the amendment I have offered, along with Senator LAUTENBERG, the ranking member of the Budget Committee, is superior is that it solves that problem. We do not have a leak. We have a budget point of order that prevails. 
   In addition, the Senator from Missouri does not have Social Security protection. We do. We have additional points of order that apply to make sure nobody raids Social Security. 
   Our colleagues are going to have a defining vote in just a few minutes: Do you want to have the strongest protection for Social Security and Medicare, or do you want a weak tea version? That is going to be the choice, and all of us are going to be held accountable for our votes. That is the point. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, first, I assure my colleague that my amendment was not in response to his. I had filed for an amendment yesterday. I offered this amendment in the Finance Committee yesterday. I have offered a lockbox for Social Security and Medicare for 2 1/2 years--a different Medicare-Social Security lockbox than is advocated here today by the Senator from Missouri because I believe there is a fatal flaw in the amendment of the Senator from Missouri. 
   That fatal flaw is that his protection does not work. It does not work because, under the Ashcroft amendment, no point of order would apply against legislation that would use Medicare surpluses for other purposes. The result of that is, under the Ashcroft amendment, the Medicare trust fund could be depleted for any purpose as long as the overall budget remained in balance. That is the problem with the amendment of the Senator from Missouri. 
   That is the reason the amendment that I have offered is superior. It is stronger. It provides real protection for Medicare, by way of special points of order against a budget resolution that would violate the off-budget status of Medicare Part A. 
   The fact is, the amendment of the Senator from Missouri does not provide the same protection to Medicare that we provide 
   to Social Security. 
   Now, why would we do that? If we are serious about protecting Medicare, wouldn't we have the same points of order apply to protect Medicare in the same way that we protect Social Security? I would hope so. Because if we do not, the hard reality is the amendment of the Senator from Missouri would permit us to go and raid every penny of the Social Security surplus or every penny of the Medicare surplus this year and use it for another purpose. That is a mistake. 
   In addition, the Ashcroft amendment is silent on Social Security, while the amendment that I have offered adds a point of order against violating the off-budget status of Social Security. 
   I hope my colleagues will vote for the Conrad-Lautenberg-Reid amendment so we really protect Medicare in the same way we protect Social Security. That is what we ought to do here today. That is the opportunity we have here today. We ought to take it. We ought to protect Medicare and Social Security. We ought to adopt this lockbox proposal. 
   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator FEINGOLD be added as a cosponsor of my amendment.

   Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I wanted to draw the attention of the Senate to an important funding issue that is pending in the Senate version of the Labor/HHS Appropriations bill. The funding level for Social Security administrative expenses doesn't receive much attention, but it is critical to the effective delivery of Social Security benefits to those who are entitled to them. 
   Social Security administrative expenses are actually partially funded from the Social Security trust funds, and they ensure that the programs administered by the Social Security Administration are delivered to the American public in an efficient, timely, and professional manner. In addition, SSA maintains records of the yearly earnings of over 140 million U.S. workers and provides them with annual estimates of their future benefits. The agency will also administer the Ticket to Work Program, and the administrative workload associated with the Retirement Earnings Test. 
   I am concerned that the level of funding contained in the Labor/HHS Appropriations bill is not sufficient, and does not recognize the administrative challenges Social Security will be facing in the near future. Last year the Social Security Administration provided service to 48 million people. In 2010 SSA will be providing services to 62 million people, due to the retirement of many baby boomers. During this same period, the SSA will lose nearly half of its staff to retirement, including many individuals who staff the offices located in our states and who work directly with the public. 
   In North Dakota, there have been large staff reductions in some of my state's main SSA offices. These shortages have affected timely completion of continuing disability reviews, and service delivery has been difficult to maintain for those who live in rural areas. 
   The Social Security Advisory Board--a bipartisan Congressionally mandated Board--recently issued a report on ``How the Social Security Administration Can Improve Its Service to the Public,'' which stated that ``there is a serious administrative deficit now in that there is a significant gap between the level of services the public needs and that which the agency is providing. Moreover, this gap could grow to far larger proportions in the long term if it is not adequately addressed.'' 
   The Senate Labor/HHS bill includes a funding level that is $123 million below the President's request. I hope that as the appropriations process moves forward, the Congress will work to ensure an adequate level of funding for SSA administrative expenses.

   Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise today to alert my colleagues that another series of national disasters have hit my home State of North Dakota. This newspaper headline from the largest paper in our State says it best with the headline on the front page, ``Swamped.'' The newspaper goes on to say NDSU, the State university, suffered millions in damage. In fact, I talked to the president of the university hours ago. He believes the damage is in excess of $20 million just at North Dakota State University. This newspaper indicated that the flood filled the Fargo dome where NDSU plays the football games. The dome was filled with over 8 feet of water. 
   This monsoon that hit Fargo, ND, on the night of June 19, absolutely flooded the entire town. It was an incredible series of circumstances. This is a picture that shows cars under water. We saw this all over the city of Fargo. Basements are flooded. Every kind of structure is flooded with 2 to 3 feet of water in the streets of the city of Fargo, the biggest city in my State. 
   We also saw massive flooding on the outskirts of town. This is the interstate. This is I-94 that connects Fargo to the rest of North Dakota. It is a major east-west highway in North Dakota. It was under water. Every part of town saw massive flooding. Homes and trailers are under water all across the city of Fargo. 
   North Dakota State University is one of the two major universities in our State. They suffered millions in damage, with very little flood insurance. The president of the university told me their insurance carrier tells them for this kind of event they only had $10,000 of insurance coverage--with losses of over $20 million. Even the president's house was wet. The newspaper says the president of the university was among many people dealing with the soggy conditions after fighting battles throughout the night, with 2 inches of sewage that entered the basement of the president's house through the failure of the sewer system. 
   This disaster was not confined to the city of Fargo, unfortunately. It spread throughout the area. Probably one of the great ironies is that until June 11 we were in a drought in much of eastern North Dakota. On June 12, 13, and 14, we had heavy rains in the northeastern part of the State. 
   I was there last week with FEMA officials assessing the damage. In that part of the State, they received 20 inches of rain in 2 days--absolutely Biblical. I have never seen anything like it--20 inches of rain in 2 days. The entire annual precipitation we receive in the State of North Dakota came in 2 days. 
   Over 150,000 acres of prime farmland flooded in that series of incidents. Of course, that was followed a week later, last Monday night, by this devastation hitting Fargo, ND, the largest city in the State. The mayor of Fargo said it perhaps best: ``It's the worst rain flood we've ever had.'' 
   This is an event unparalleled in North Dakota history. There is something very odd going on with the weather pattern. I can only say in my State we have had eight Presidential disaster declarations in the last 7 years. We fully anticipate we will have number nine as a result of this series of incidents in northeastern North Dakota and then in southeastern North Dakota. Hundreds of thousands of acres of farmland were 
   flooded. The major  city of my State was very badly hurt by this massive flooding. 
   I have come before with requests for disaster assistance. I was very hopeful we weren't going to have a disaster this year. Until these devastating events, the worst thing happening was that we appeared to have a drought in part of the State. It is truly stunning to get 20 inches of rain in 2 days. 
   The damage is incalculable. In North Dakota State University, there wasn't a building on the campus that was not flooded. The president informed me today that the basement of the library was badly flooded where some of the archives were kept. They were in the basement because that is the safest place in a tornado. Fargo is a town that has previously been hit by tornadoes--not frequently, but on occasion. So the most valuable materials were stored in the basement. Then we get hit by these massive monsoon rains that flooded every building on that campus, including devastating and destroying some of the archives of the State. 
   This is, again, a disaster of stunning proportion. Tomorrow, top officials of FEMA and I will be going to North Dakota, accompanied by top officials of the USDA, to further assess the damage. I talked to the Governor today. He tells me he is readying a request for disaster assistance. Without question, we will be coming to this body once again to ask for assistance for a remarkable set of what can only be described as almost unimaginable occurrences. It does make me wonder if there is something going on with global climate change that we don't fully understand, to have these extraordinary sets of circumstances 8 years in a row. That is the fact. That is the circumstance that we face. 
   I wanted to draw my colleagues' attention to it. We in North Dakota have expressed our thanks to our colleagues on repeated occasions for the assistance provided North Dakota in the face of these remarkable natural disasters. I regret very much standing here today again drawing my colleagues' attention to what has occurred in my home State. I think it is important for colleagues to know this has occurred, and that, once again, we will be asking for assistance. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, last Friday I was necessarily absent from the Senate to survey recent flood damage in North Dakota. For a period of three days, rain, hail and tornadoes inundated northeast North Dakota and, sadly, four people lost their lives. My duty was to my constituents who were in the middle of another devastating natural disaster. As a result, I missed one vote Friday morning. 
   For the record, had I been present, I would have voted yes on adoption of the conference report to S..761, the Electronic Signatures Act. The legislation will have an important impact on the electronic marketplace and how business is conducted via the Internet. My vote would not have changed the outcome of this vote.

   Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, this is clearly a Federal responsibility. A Federal project created Lake Sakakawea and flooded a significant portion of the reservation, thus creating the need for this bridge. In 1992, Congress accepted the recommendations of the Joint Tribal Advisory Commission, which studied the impact of the Garrison Reservoir, created by the Pick-Sloan Missouri River Project, on the Three Affiliated Tribes. The Commission found that the Three Affiliated Tribes are entitled to replacement of infrastructure lost by the creation of the Garrison Dam and Lake Sakakawea. The Federal Government has a responsibility to the Three Affiliated Tribes to play a major role in providing for the infrastructure necessitated by the permanent flood created by this project. 
   Mr. President, will the Chairman of the Subcommittee also support funding this bridge as recommended by President Clinton?

   Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, today, I rise to introduce the Health Care Access and Rural Equality Act of 2000 (H-CARE). 
   This proposal is the result of a bipartisan and bicameral effort. I am proud to be joined by several cosponsors, including Senators GRASSLEY, DASCHLE, THOMAS, HARKIN, BAUCUS, KERREY, JEFFORDS, ROCKEFELLER, ROBERTS, JOHNSON, LINCOLN, and COCHRAN. I would also like to thank our House companions for joining me as supporters of this proposal. In particular, would like to recognize Representatives FOLEY, POMEROY, TANNER, NUSSLE, MCINTYRE, STENHOLM, BERRY, and LUCAS for their efforts. Working together, I believe we are taking important steps toward improving health care access in our rural communities. 
   Also, I would like to thank the National Rural Health Association, the Federation of American Health Systems, and the College of American Pathologists for their support of this effort. 
   Last year, we received information that 12 of my State's 35 rural hospitals were in jeopardy of closing. In North Dakota, many areas do not have hospitals within their county borders. This means that in some areas of my State, many communities depend on having access to one specific rural health care facility. If this facility were to close, this would leave residents in these areas without access to vital health care services. 
   We know that in many rural communities, Medicare patients make up the majority of the typical rural hospitals' caseloads--in N.D., more than 70 percent of most rural hospitals' patients are covered by Medicare. This means that Medicare funding and changes to the program greatly impact our small, rural providers. 
   Unfortunately, while our rural facilities may serve a disproportionate number of Medicare patients, they are often forced to operate with merely half the reimbursement of their urban counterparts. For example, Mercy Hospital in Devils Lake receives on average about $4,200 for treating a patient with pneumonia. In New York City, we know that some hospitals receive more than $8,500 for treating the same illness. This disparity places our providers at a clear disadvantage. 
   Against the backdrop of this funding disparity, we know that rural providers  were particularly hard hit by reductions in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. Last year, N.D. hospitals were losing at minimum 7 percent on every Medicare patient they serve. In some of our smaller communities, hospital margins fell as low as negative 21 percent. How can our hospitals be expected to survive at a 20 percent loss? 
   Recognizing the challenges that our communities were facing, I fought hard last year to 
   offer relief to our rural providers. I am happy to say that the Balanced Budget Refinement Act of 1999 (BBRA) brought more than $100 million to our ND providers--but we must do more. 
   Even though the BBRA improved the outlook for our hospitals, N.D. facilities are still in financial trouble--they are still projected to have negative 4.9 percent margins by 2002. Continued funding shortfalls have made it, and will continue to make it, impossible for our smallest rural hospitals to make needed building improvements; impossible for them to provide patients access to updated technologies; and difficult for them to competitively recruit and retain health care providers, particularly to the most isolated, frontier areas. 
   For this reason, I rise to introduce H-CARE. This legislation offers targeted relief to our most vulnerable rural providers, including: our sole community, critical access, and Medicare dependent hospitals. 
   In particular, H-CARE would offer a full inflation update to all rural hospitals. The BBA limited hospitals' inflation updates through 2002. This has meant that our providers have not been allowed to receive payments that are in line with the costs they incur for serving Medicare patients. H-CARE would close the gap on this funding shortfall. 
   Also, H-CARE permanently extends the important Medicare dependent hospital program, which is due to expire in 2006, and would offer these providers more up-to-date funding. Currently, they are reimbursed based on 1988 costs. As providers that serve at least a 60 percent Medicare caseload, it is important that they receive appropriate Medicare payments. 
   In addition, H-CARE addresses several flaws in last year's Medicare add-back bill that have adversely impacted our rural providers. For example, many rural hospitals entered the Critical Access Hospital (CAH) program under the promise that they would receive adequate resources to keep their doors open. The BBRA inadvertently limited these hospitals' ability to receive funding for providing lab services to their patients. H-CARE fixes this problem by ensuring CAHs once again receive the funding they need to provide lab services. 
   For our sole community hospitals, H-CARE corrects an error in the BBRA which excluded some of these hospitals from receiving higher reimbursement rates based on more recent costs. H-CARE fixes this mistake by letting all sole community hospitals receive more up-to-date payments based on 1996 costs. This is particularly important for N.D. since 29 of my state's 36 rural facilities are sole community hospitals. 
   Lastly, H-CARE would establish a loan fund that rural facilities could access to repair crumbling buildings or update their equipment--eligible facilities could receive up to $5m to make repairs and an extra $50,000 to help develop a capital improvement plan. H-CARE also includes grants, in the amount of $50,000 per facility, that hospitals could use to purchase new technology and train staff on using this technology. 
   In summary, this year, I will fight to enact these and other measures that are vital to improving our rural health care system. I urge my colleagues to support this important effort.

   Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise to introduce, along with my colleague, Senator GORDON SMITH of Oregon, legislation that we call the Combined Fund Stability and Fairness Act. 
   The Coal Act of 1992 represents an unbreakable commitment to retired miners, their spouses, and their dependents. But it is clear today that if we do not address the shortcomings of the 1992 Act, we will fall short of keeping that promise. 
   Simply put, the Combined Benefit Fund needs to be put on a firm financial footing so that the miners and their family members--who depend on the health benefits the Fund provides--can stop worrying about when their benefits might be cut. 
   The Coal Act of 1992 cast a wide net in identifying companies that would be obligated to pay into the fund. Not only were companies then in the coal mining business included, but the Act also brought in companies that were no longer in the bituminous coal mining business as well as successor companies. Nearly eight years later, we know that Congress overreached. 
   Two years ago, the Supreme Court in Eastern Enterprises versus Apfel, held that the so-called ``super reachback'' companies should not have been included among Combined Benefit Fund contributors in the first place. 
   The logic of the Court's decision in Eastern appears just as applicable to the reachback companies. They should not have been included either. 
   The bill the Senator from Oregon and I are introducing today is not a bailout for the reachback companies. In fact, the reachbacks will not receive one penny under this legislation. It provides relief to the reachbacks on a prospective basis only. 
   There are a limited number of companies that will receive payments under this bill. One group--what we refer to as the ``final judgment'' companies--are companies in the same situation as Eastern Enterprises. However, they had been unsuccessful in litigation decided before the Eastern decision, and were barred from recovery by the doctrine of res judicata. The other group--the ``stranded interim'' companies--are companies that were assessed following the enactment of the 1992 Act but were never assigned any beneficiaries. 
   The total of the refunds to be paid to these two groups of companies amounts to about $28 million. That is the only money under this bill that would not go retired miners and their dependents. 
   I think this is a fundamental question of fairness and equity. Those companies ought to be treated the same way as those companies that were relieved of the obligation because of the Eastern decision. That is just basic fairness. 
   To help ensure the solvency of the Combined Benefit Fund into the future, the legislation would extend the Abandoned Mine Reclamation Fee program beyond its current expiration date of 2004 through 2010. The interest earned on the Abandoned Mine Lands Fund would be made available to the Combined Benefit Fund. This is similar to  the approach Congress took with respect to the AML fund in the 1992 Act. 
   It is important to stress that the AML fees would be lowered substantially from current levels. The rate on surface-mined coal would drop from 35 cents per ton to 20 cents per ton; the rate on underground-mined coal would drop from 15 cents per ton to 5 cents per ton; and the rate on lignite coal would drop from 10 cents per ton to 5 cents per ton. 
   The legislation also authorizes the transfer of $38 million in general fund revenues every year to cover any shortfall in the fund. 
   The combination of the AML Fund interest money, the premium adjustment mechanism, and the annual general fund transfers will ensure that all Combined Benefit Fund obligations will be fully met. 
   The fundamental purpose of the Combined Fund Stability and Fairness Act is to provide a secure, sound and fair financial foundation for the benefits miners have been promised. It is my hope that Congress will not delay in addressing this issue. Too many people are depending on us.

   Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I am pleased to rise today to offer with my colleague from Missouri, Senator ASHCROFT, an amendment which increases the appropriation for a new, more advanced cruise missile for the B-52 from $20 million to $43 million. 
   As my colleagues are aware, the B-52 is the sole carrier of the Conventional Air Launched Cruise Missile [CALCM], a conventional variant of the nuclear-capable Air Launched Cruise Missile [ALCM]. Our nation has relied on the CALCM in all recent conflicts and it has become the weapon of choice for theater commanders. The CALCM offers range, payload, and accuracy that are superior to any other conventional stand-off munition in service today, including the Navy's Tomahawk. 
   A year ago, as Operation Allied Force was underway, we had a tremendous problem. The United States had expended more than 200 CALCMs against Iraq and Yugoslavia and we had less than 100 remaining. 
   I asked the Pentagon what they were going to do about this situation and they recommended that we convert the remaining, ALCMs not needed by the United States Strategic Command for nuclear missions to CALCMs. I was pleased to work with the Air Force and the defense committees to secure funding to do just that. Today, the remaining unneeded 322 ALCMs are being converted to CALCMs. 
   However, conversion will only give us around 400 CALCMs, and to meet future threats our nation will require around 1,000 of these missiles. In May 1999 I was informed that there was no plan to make up the shortfall. 
   I went to Senators WARNER and LEVIN, the chairman and ranking member of the Armed Services Committee, and asked them to adopt my amendment requiring the administration to come up with a plan to replace the CALCM. That amendment passed on May 27, 1999, and I was pleased to have my friend from Missouri, Senator ASHCROFT, as an original cosponsor. 
   The result of the Air Force's study was inclusion in General Ryan's unfunded priority list of $86.1 million in fiscal year 2001 and $689.7 million throughout the future years defense plan for research and development and production of more than 600 extended range cruise missiles (ERCMs), also referred to as extended range CALCMs (CALCM-ERs). The ERCM will offer all of the advantages of the CALCM and dramatically extend its range, to beyond 1,000 miles. 
   I am pleased that both the Senate and House Defense authorization bills fully support General Ryan's request for $86.1 million in Fy01. However, the Senate Defense appropriations bill provides only $20 million and the House Defense appropriations bill includes no funding. 
   Consequently, I am very pleased that the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, Senator STEVENS, and the ranking member of the Defense Subcommittee, Senator INOUYE, have agreed to support the amendment that Senator ASHCROFT and I have brought to the floor today. This amendment will increase the ERCM appropriation to $43 million, enough for the Air Force to begin work on this important program during the coming fiscal year. 
   A quick start to ERCM program will ensure that the B-52 remains relevant and our nation retains the capability to strike vital targets with tremendous accuracy at long range in the coming years. I appreciate the cosponsorship of Senators BOND and BREAUX and look forward to continuing to work with Senator ASHCROFT, the Senate's defense committees, and the Air Force to make the ERCM a reality. 
   I thank the chairman and ranking member again for their support, and yield the floor.

   Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I am pleased today to join my good friends from Maine and Virginia, Ms. COLLINS and Mr. ROBB, in introducing the Gray Market Cigarette Compliance Act of 2000. The growth in this gray market in cigarettes represents not only an economic threat, but a significant public health menace as well. This legislation will provide law enforcement with better and more effective tools to fight this dangerous intrusion into our marketplace. 
   This bill concerns itself with cigarettes manufactured for overseas markets that nevertheless find their way into our domestic stream of commerce. Even if they have been manufactured in the United States, they are not required to comply with U.S. content disclosure and health labeling requirements. Thus, when they are brought back into the U.S. by gray market profiteers, they represent a serious public health concern. And because they are often sold at prices below those of products manufactured to comply with our tough cigarette marketing laws, they become more attractive and available to children. 
   The gray market is unfair competition, plain and simple. Consumers often purchase gray market products thinking they are the same as the legitimate products manufactured for sale in the U.S. When gray marketers bring in cigarettes that are not manufactured in full compliance with U.S. law, they mislead unwitting consumers. 
   Consumers are not the only ones affected. Gray marketers also harm the legitimate wholesalers and retailers who work hard and play by the rules by exploiting gray areas in the law in order to gain this unfair competitive advantage. 
   It is important to stress as well the implications of the gray market in cigarettes for states under the tobacco Master Settlement Agreement (MSA). One of the major components of the MSA provides that payments to states are based on a formula that takes into account the annual volume of tobacco sold in each state. Gray market cigarettes are not counted under that volume adjustment formula. Therefore, to the extent that gray market sales displace sales of cigarettes that are counted in the volume adjustment, states could lose a portion of the amounts they would otherwise receive under the MSA. 
   The Gray Market Cigarette Compliance Act will help consumers, retailers, wholesalers, and federal and state governments. It will strengthen the hand of law enforcement to combat the sale of gray market cigarettes and close loopholes that gray markets have been able to exploit. But most importantly, it will help keep cheap cigarettes out of the hands of children.

   Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, as a member of the conference on the disaster bill and the crop insurance bill, I am pleased to give strong support to the conference report. 
   First, I thank the chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee, Senator LUGAR, for his leadership, his patience, and his very gracious treatment of all of our colleagues. All of us understand this particular bill was not Senator LUGAR's first preference. Once again, he responded to the concerns of colleagues on the Senate Agriculture Committee and in the larger body and did so in a most gracious way. For that, I thank Senator LUGAR. He has once again demonstrated the way we ought to do business in the Senate. He has certainly set a high standard. 
   I also thank our ranking member, Senator HARKIN, who has been indefatigable in advancing the cause of American agricultural producers. Senator HARKIN has been a forceful advocate. Time after time, he has stood in the breach and insisted we do what is right by farmers and ranchers all across the country. I thank Senator HARKIN for his exceptional leadership. We would not be here today without him. 
   I also thank Senator KERREY and Senator ROBERTS who were the primary sponsors of the legislation before us. Without their steadfastness right to the bitter end, we would not be here today. We faced a threat as late as last night when it was proposed we put the bankruptcy bill on this legislation. All of us know what that would have meant. That would have meant endless delay. That would have meant sinking into a bog of controversy that extends not only to the bankruptcy bill, but unrelated issues attached to it. Special thanks to those who stood firm and  said, no, this needs to be a bill that deals with the critical problems facing farmers and ranchers in the United States. 
   I also thank my close friend and colleague, Senator GRASSLEY, who, as a member of the Budget Committee, worked with me to secure the $8.2 million in the budget that makes possible crop insurance reform. 
   Finally, I recognize the work of the House committee chairman, Congressman COMBEST, for conducting what was a very fair and open conference committee. That is the way a conference committee should function. It was give and take, it was a debate, it was discussion, and at the end, it was a coming together around legislation that is, I think, outstanding. I again single out the House committee chairman, Congressman COMBEST, for his leadership. 
   We have developed, I believe, the right bill at the right time with the required budget support. In one bill, we have managed to bring together emergency farm relief for the families who are faced with the lowest prices, in real terms, in 50 years and a reform of the crop insurance system to make it more affordable at every level. 
   In addition to that, we are righting a wrong done to Durum farmers a year ago. This bill provides emergency relief in the form of 100-percent AMTA supplemental payments. For wheat farmers, that means instead of getting 64 cents a bushel, as they did last year in an AMTA payment, they will get 64 cents in addition to the regular AMTA payment, which this year will be 57 cents. So they will get an AMTA supplement--this is on wheat now--of 64 cents a bushel that is equivalent to last year's AMTA payment, married to the AMTA payment we will be getting this year. 
   In addition, we have a crop insurance reform bill that is a dramatic improvement. When I go home and have meetings all across North Dakota, one of the most agricultural States in the Nation, what I am told, and told repeatedly, is that crop insurance is not working. It does not work because we do not have the right levels of support at the levels of coverage that farmers are buying, and they have a very serious problem if they have multiple years of disaster. 
   Oddly enough, the way the formulas work, when farmers have multiple years of disaster, the base that calculates the support 
   they receive is diminished--it is reduced, and it is reduced dramatically. The irony is, at the very time farmers need help the most, we have a formula that gives them the least help. It makes no sense. We have adjusted that in this legislation. 
   I know there are those who are critical of using the AMTA payments as a basis for the economic disaster assistance. I understand that. AMTA payments are not countercyclical. That is, they are not designed to help those commodities that are the exact ones that are being hurt by this downturn. 
   In addition, AMTA payments are not based on current production. AMTA payments, as a result, can go to producers and landowners who may no longer be producing the crop on which their payment is based or who are no longer growing a crop of any kind. Those are legitimate criticisms. Most of us recognize that. 
   The question is, Do we make the perfect the enemy of the very good? I say to my colleagues, could we have done better? Yes, we could. We could have adopted a countercyclical program. But I say to my colleagues, at some point we have to make a decision: Are we going to delay support for producers who are in very deep economic trouble, faced with a circumstance in which USDA informs us, absent our action, farm income will drop $8 billion this year; or do we act? 
   I urge my colleagues to join us in acting. Let's not delay. Let's not wait. Let's not make the perfect the enemy of the very good. The fact is, this package is going to make the difference for tens of thousands of farm families all across America between economic survival and economic death. That is the reality. That is what motivates the urgency of our action. 
   I am very proud of the package that is before us. Many people labored hours and hours to produce this result. I salute not only the Members who worked hard and provided the leadership, but I thank the staffs on both sides who exhibited a dedication to public service because they did not work just 9 to 5. I know there are some people who think the Senate is kind of an easygoing place and people work leisurely hours. That is not the truth. 
   The truth is people here work very hard. No one works harder than the staffs. The staffs in this circumstance have given us a perfect example of how to function to produce a result. They worked together harmoniously--well, not always harmoniously. Sometimes there was friction, sometimes there were real differences of opinion, but they kept at it, and they produced a result, and it is a result that is good for the country. They worked very long hours, many times late into the night, through the weekends repeatedly, to help achieve this result. I salute them today on both sides of the aisle because this was a bipartisan product. That happens, unfortunately, not as frequently as it should happen in this Chamber. I can tell you, this package is a product of coming together in a bipartisan effort. I salute all those who helped produce it. 
   In addition to the disaster package we have, in addition to the crop insurance reform which is wide sweeping and incredibly important to America's farmers and ranchers, this bill also includes provisions that effectively resolve a lawsuit brought by an unfair action by USDA regarding the 1999 durum crop revenue coverage level in contracts that were offered in various parts of the country. This means that both parties to that lawsuit--farmers and USDA--have a reason to settle that lawsuit, with every policyholder who received a claim getting additional per-bushel assistance. 
   More importantly, the bill language makes it clear that actions on the part of USDA that change the conditions of crop insurance policies retroactively are not acceptable for any commodity. 
   Whatever were they thinking of, to put out a contract--however flawed that contract might be--to have farmers sign up to it, and then to withdraw it? These contracts are contracts. That means there is a two-way bargain. You cannot have a circumstance in which the Federal Government puts out a contract, gets people to sign up to it, and then changes its mind and withdraws it. That is not fair. That is not right. In this legislation, we have sent that clear signal. 
   I close by suggesting to my colleagues that we now have a moment in time that we can act together in the best interests of the farmers and ranchers of America. I urge my colleagues to support this conference report. I again say how proud I am to have been a part of this conference that functioned the way a conference should in a bipartisan effort to produce a result that is good for America. 
   I thank the Chair and yield the floor. 
   Several Senators addressed the Chair.

   Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, as I listened to my colleague, I thought some things said required a response. 
   As we look back at how we achieved balance in our budget and how we turned massive deficits into massive surpluses, let me explain how it was done. This chart covers 1980 through 1999. The blue line is the outlays or expenditures of the Federal Government; the red line is the revenue line. We had massive deficits when we were following the Republican economic prescription for the country, which was trickle-down economics, because the outlays far exceeded revenues. The result was massive deficits and massive growth of the debt. 
   In 1993, we got a new administration and a new economic plan. We passed a proposal without a single vote from the other side that reduced spending as a percentage of our national economy and raised revenue. That is how we balanced the budget. That is how we stopped the raid on Social Security. That is how we stopped the economic decline the country was experiencing under their plan, under their proposal. 
   In fact, at the time we passed the new budget plan in 1993, which was a 5-year plan reducing the deficits each and every year as we brought spending down, we brought revenues up until the two lines crossed and we moved into surplus. Our friends on the other side of the aisle said it was a huge mistake. They said it would increase the deficit. They said it would increase unemployment. They said it would increase inflation. They were wrong on every count. They were not just a little bit wrong, they were completely wrong. 
   Now they come with a new economic prescription to go back to the bad old days--back to debt, back to deficits, back to decline. Are we going to take that path? Haven't we learned anything about what works? Haven't we learned the best course is one of fiscal discipline? Haven't we learned the best course is to stay on this plan that has turned massive deficits into massive surpluses, that has led to the longest  economic expansion in our country, that has led to the lowest unemployment in more than 30 years, the lowest inflation in more than 30 years? Are we going to jeopardize this with a risky tax scheme that our friends on the other side propose? 
   My friend from Iowa says we have the highest tax rates ever. No, we don't have the highest taxes ever. This chart shows the revenue line, and indeed it came up; that is absolutely correct. It was that combination of reduced spending and increased revenue that led to this result. However, that does not translate into higher tax rates on the American people. A key reason we have higher revenues is because we got the economy moving again. This extraordinary economic expansion--again, the longest economic expansion in our history--has generated more revenue. That is what helped balance the budget, coupled with reduced spending. 
   The question of what has happened to individual taxes is quite a different story. This was a story on the front page of the Washington Post: ``Federal Tax Level Falls for Most. Studies Show Burden Now Less Than 10 Percent.'' 
   The story tells the truth.  
   For all but the wealthiest Americans, the Federal income tax burden has shrunk to the lowest level in four decades.  
   We don't have the highest taxes on individual American taxpayers that we have ever had, as the Senator from Iowa asserted. That is just not the case.  
   For all but the wealthiest Americans, the Federal income tax burden has shrunk to the lowest level in four decades.  
   That is the truth according to a series of studies by both liberal and conservative tax experts. Each of the studies shows the bottom line is the same. Most Americans this year will have to fork over less than 10 percent of their income to the Federal Government. The Congressional Budget Office estimates the middle fifth of American families with an average income of $39,000 paid 5.4 percent income tax in 1999, compared with 8.3 percent in 1981. Their taxes have gone down. That is the middle-income people in America. 
   The Treasury Department estimates that a four-person family, with a median income of $54,900, paid 7.46 percent of that in income tax, the lowest since 1965. And the median two-earner family making $68,000 paid 8.8 percent in 1998, about the same as 1955. 
   If we are going to have a debate, let's have a debate on facts and not make up things. 
   The fundamental problem with the legislation offered by our colleagues: They have more of a tax cut than there is non-Social Security surplus available for a tax cut. It is a question of priorities. What do we want to do with the surpluses available? Remember, these are projected surpluses. We can take the money and use it all for a tax cut that disproportionately goes to the wealthiest. That is what the Republicans want to do. 
   Our side believes we ought to reserve every penny of 
   the Social Security surplus for Social Security. Republicans agree with that. On the non-Social Security surplus, the Republicans want to use it all for a tax cut that disproportionately goes to the wealthiest; 60 percent goes to the wealthiest 10 percent. 
   Our side thinks the highest priority should be further paying down of the debt because that is what every economist has said is in the highest interests of this country. This is what will most assure our economic future. 
   Second, we believe we ought to provide for tax relief; 29 percent of the non-Social Security surplus under our proposal goes for tax relief. Part of that goes to address the marriage tax penalty. However, we are addressing those who suffer the marriage tax penalty. 
   Our friends on the other side want to give a big tax cut to folks who do not have the marriage tax penalty. In fact, for people receiving the marriage bonus--they pay lower taxes as a result of being married than if they were filing individually--they want to give them a tax cut, too. 
   When they say we are limited to 10 amendments on our side, the underlying legislation deals with many more issues than just the marriage tax penalty. They want to restrict our right to offer alternatives. That is not fair. That is not the way the Senate was designed to operate. Not surprisingly, we don't intend to go along with that. That is not the way the Senate is designed to work. 
   We offered legislation in the Senate Finance Committee to give people a choice. They file as married couples; they file as individuals; file the way that helps the most, that gives families the least tax liability. That is what Democrats are proposing. We do it in a way to not use all of the non-Social Security surplus for a tax cut that goes predominantly to the wealthiest. Instead, we put the highest priority on reducing the debt; the second highest priority on tax relief; the third highest priority on using money for high priority domestic needs such as defense, education, and agriculture, which are in very deep trouble.

   Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, this is one of the most important decisions we make every year: the question of the budget outline for the United States; what are our priorities; where is the money going to be spent; what are the revenue sources for the United States. The fundamental question is, Are we going to maintain fiscal discipline? Are we going to maintain a strategy that has produced the longest economic expansion in our country's history? 
   This article appeared in the Washington Post in the business section announcing that the expansion was, at that time, the Nation's longest. This is back in February. Of course, the expansion has now been extended even further. But even then, we had created the longest economic expansion in our country's history. I say when ``we'' created; I am talking about all of us as Americans. 
   Part of it is a result of Federal policy: the fiscal policy of the country, which is controlled by the Congress and the President of the United States, and the monetary policy, which is controlled by the Federal Reserve. The two work hand in glove to produce economic results for this country.  
   Obviously, the underlying strength of America is the people of this country. Their hard work, their innovation, their creativity, their entrepreneurial spirit and drive makes this country the greatest economic power on the face of the globe. 
   It is important to remember the economic strategy and the economic plan that brought us to where we are today. If we look back at the last three administrations and look at the question of the budget deficits that are so important to the fiscal policy of this country and the monetary policy, this is what one finds: The Reagan administration inherited a deficit of about $80 billion and promptly ran it up to over $200 billion and dramatically expanded the Nation's debt over the period of that administration. In fact, they more than tripled the national debt during this period. 
   Then we had the Bush administration, which inherited a deficit of $153 billion and promptly ran it up to a $290 billion deficit. It actually was somewhat worse than that because this is counting the Social Security surplus. The true deficit, at least as I define it, was well over $300 billion. 
   The Clinton administration came in, and in 1993, we passed a 5-year budget plan that was designed to reduce the deficit dramatically to take pressure off interest rates and to get this economy moving again. That plan passed without a single Republican vote in either the House or the Senate. These are the facts. 
   That 5-year plan was put into place, and here are the results. They are clear; they are unambiguous. They show that each and every year that 5-year plan reduced the budget deficit, first, to $255 billion; then to $203 billion; then to $164 billion; then to $107 billion; then to $22 billion. By the end of the 5-year plan, we had done what was perhaps thought impossible when we started. We had balanced the Federal budget. 
   Now we anticipate a $176 billion budget surplus in this year. This is a plan that worked. 
   This shows the trend in receipts and outlays, the expenditures of the Federal Government that made this plan work. The blue line shows the spending of the Federal Government; the red line shows the receipts of the Federal Government. This is over a 20-year period. 
   What it shows is obviously our spending was higher than receipts for an extended period in the eighties. That is why we were running massive budget deficits. When Democrats voted for a 5-year plan to get our fiscal house in order, spending came down each and every year in relationship to the size of our economy, revenue went up each and every year because, in part, we raised taxes on the wealthiest 1 percent in this country, and spending was cut. 
   That is what allowed us to balance the budget, get our fiscal house in order, and kick off the longest economic expansion in our history. That is the record. Those are the facts. 
   The question is, Are we going to put all this at risk and go back to the old, bad days of ``debt'' and ``deficits'' and ``decline,'' what I call the three Ds? I very much hope we do not return to those policies and those plans and that set of results: debt, deficits, and decline. That would be a profound mistake. Why would we ever turn our back on an economic strategy that has worked so well? 
   Let's look at the results. 
   Federal spending is now at its lowest level since 1966. We cut spending with that 5-year plan in 1993. Democrats cut spending because we did not have any help from the other side of the aisle--none. We cut spending because it was necessary to get our fiscal house in order. 
   The results of reducing those deficits has been the virtuous cycle: Reduced deficits, reduced debt, and reduced interest rates that helps spur investment in the private sector, that helps spur private growth in the private sector, that led to the creation of over 20 million jobs, that gave us the lowest level of inflation since 1965. The virtuous cycle does not end there because it also gave us the lowest rate of unemployment in 42 years. 
   These are the results of an economic plan that was put in place in 1993. It has also brought down the debt. What a remarkable circumstance. But we have actually started bringing down the publicly held debt. We are in a position to nearly pay it off by the year 2010. We are in a position to pay off the publicly held debt of this country by the year 2013, if we stay on course. 
   Alan Greenspan, who is in charge of monetary policy--the Congress and the President are in charge of fiscal policy; the Federal Reserve is in charge of monetary policy--the head of monetary policy for our country says: Pay down the debt first. That is what he is urging us to do. 
   He is not alone because virtually every economist of whatever ideological persuasion who has come before the Budget Committee and the Finance Committee, on which I sit, has told us: The highest priority ought to be to continue to pay down the debt, to put us in a position to deal with the baby-boom generation when it starts to retire and puts enormous demands on Medicare, on Social Security, on veterans programs; that the best way to prepare for the day when they retire is to build this economy, to grow this economy. And the best way to grow this economy is to lift the debt burden that is on this economy. 
   That is what will hold down interest rates. That is what will keep the Government out of competition in private markets for scarce resources. That will allow additional resources to go into private investment. 
   This plan, this strategy, has been working. Now, all of a sudden, our friends on the Republican side, who opposed putting in place that strategy that has worked so well, tell us: Ah, well, we were wrong then, but trust us, let's go back to that failed strategy we were pursuing before, and let's try it again. 
   Why would we do that? It makes no earthly sense. 
   What will happen if we take this risky approach they are proposing? I submit to you, in their plan they use all of the non-Social Security surplus--all of it--for a tax cut, a tax cut that goes to the wealthiest among us. Senator MCCAIN said 
   it well during the campaign. He questioned the Bush plan to take 60 percent of the benefits of their tax plan and to give it to the wealthiest 10 percent. 
   Mr. Bush has said, over and over, in his campaign: What they don't know in Washington is, this is the people's money. He is right about that. It is the people's money. The question is, What should be done with the people's money? Should it be given to the wealthiest 10 percent--disproportionately given to the wealthiest 10 percent--or should our top priority be to use the people's money to pay down the people's debt? I submit to you, the highest priority ought to be to pay down the people's debt. But that is not the Republican priority. 
   It is true they take all of the Social Security surplus and reserve it for Social Security. We do the same thing in our budget. That is the right thing to do. I applaud them for it. But on the non-Social Security surplus, they have quite a different approach. 
   I think, objectively stated, the non-Social Security surplus is most likely to be about $170 billion over the next 5 years. The Republican plan has a $150 billion tax cut, a $25 billion reserve for tax cuts, and costs another $21 billion in interest. So they have $196 billion reserved for a tax cut that goes primarily to the wealthiest among us when we have only $171 billion available in a non-Social Security surplus. 
   Where is the rest of the money going to come from? I think it is going to come right out of the Social Security trust fund. We are going to go back to the old, bad days of raiding the Social Security trust fund surplus. I hope not. I do not know how else it happens. 
   Our priority on the Democratic side is to use the vast majority of the projected surpluses over the next 10 years for debt reduction. In fact, we use 82 percent of the projected surpluses for debt reduction. That is, every penny of the Social Security surplus for Social Security, since it is not used for that purpose immediately, goes to pay down the debt. The Republicans do the same thing. But, in addition, we take 36 percent of the non-Social Security surplus and use that for further paying down the debt. 
   We also have a chunk of money for tax relief--not nearly as much as they do; we will stipulate to that. Their priority is a big tax cut to the wealthiest among us. Our priority is to pay down the debt.  
   As I indicated, we take all of the Social Security surplus and use that to pay down debt. But, in addition, we take, of the non-Social Security surplus, 36 percent of it for debt reduction. We take 29 percent of it for tax cuts because we, too, believe tax relief is important. 
   We would like to solve the marriage tax penalty. We would like to ease the estate tax burden. We would like to deal with some of the other inequities in the Tax Code. 
   We also reserve 23 percent for high-priority domestic needs such as defense, education, agriculture, and, yes, a prescription drug benefit. 
   We believe these are the priorities of the American people. 
   Let me conclude by saying there are some on the Republican side who have argued over and over that the tax burden on the American people is the highest it has ever been. 
   The tax revenues are high, but the tax burden, the tax rates, on individual taxpayers are not high. That is odd. How can the revenues be high but the tax rates on individuals not be high? The reason is, we have a booming economy that produces lots of revenue. That is part of the virtuous cycle we have created by getting our fiscal house in order. 
   But if we look at the individual tax burden, what we find is, contrary to what our friends on the Republican side say so often and so repeatedly, the Federal tax level has fallen for most people in this country. 
   Let me quote from the Washington Post of March 26 of this year:  
   Studies Show Burden Now Less Than 10% 
   For all but the wealthiest Americans, the federal income tax burden has shrunk to the lowest level in four decades, according to a series of studies by liberal and conservative tax experts.......  
   What we see is that the tax burden on individual Americans has been reduced, and reduced dramatically. 
   The article further states:  
   The Congressional Budget Office estimates the middle fifth of American families, with an average income of $39,100, paid 5.4 percent in income tax in 1999, compared with 8.3 percent in 1981. The Treasury Department estimates a four-person family, with a median income of $54,900, paid 7.46 percent of that in income tax, the lowest since 1965. 
   The article continues: The Conservative Tax Foundation figures that the median two-earner family, making $68,000, paid 8.8 percent in 1998, about the same as 1955. 
   This is a question of priorities. We ought to reject this budget and pass the alternative.

   Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Farm Relief and Economic Development Act of 2000. We have farmers who are in the deepest trouble they have been in in 50 years: the lowest prices in 50 years, a series of natural disasters in many parts of the country, and an economic environment in which our major competitors are outgunning us 60 to 1 in agricultural export support, by 10 to 1 in internal support. The result is tens of thousands of farm families are faced with failure unless we respond. 
   The Department of Agriculture has told us that farm income will drop $8 billion if we fail to act. As part of an overall response, today I am introducing legislation that I term the ``Farm Relief and Economic Development Act of 2000.'' There is no question in my mind that the best action Congress could take on farm policy would be to rewrite the farm bill. But that is unlikely to happen this year. 
   There are parts of the Internal Revenue Code that create unnecessary problems for farmers that we can address. The essential elements of this bill are provisions to address farm and ranch risk management accounts. This proposal would allow farmers to make contributions to tax-deferred accounts, which would be known as farm and ranch risk management accounts. Those accounts would provide farmers with a valuable new tool for managing money in a way that best benefits each farmer's own operations. 
   The second key element of this legislation is clarifying the self-employment tax that applies to farm lease income. A farm landlord should be treated no differently than small business operators and other commercial landlords when it comes to cash rent income. 
   As a result of a 1996 Tax Court decision, the IRS has now expanded the reach of the self-employment tax to include all farm landlords, whether or not they are active participants in the farming activity. My proposal would restore the pre-1996 status quo, turning back this unilateral action by the IRS. My proposal also includes language to clarify the Conservation Reserve Program payments are not subject to the self-employment tax. Again, we have an interpretation by the Internal Revenue Service that we think is badly flawed and ought to be reversed. 
   This legislation provides capital gains relief on the sale of farm residences and farmland. Farm families frequently cannot take full advantage of the $500,000 capital gains tax exemption that we provide nonfarm residents. That is because the IRS separates the value of a farmer's house from the contiguous land. The value of the home often turns out to be negligible because the IRS often judges homes located far out in the country to have very little value. In fact, it is often the case it has very little in the way of market value when it is detached from the land that surrounds that farmstead. My proposal would allow the exclusion of $500,000 that we currently allow homeowners to be applied to the sale of a farmer's home and up to 160 acres of surrounding farmland. 
   The next element of my legislation is Aggie bonds. Finding ways to encourage people to start farming is not easy. Aggie bonds are helping by reducing the cost of credit and stimulating investment in agriculture. This proposal would exclude Aggie bonds from the State volume cap. It would not change the loan limit, nor would it affect any additional limitations or qualifications imposed by the 16 States which participate in the 
   program. 
   My proposal provides capital gains tax relief for farmers leaving farming. The farmer who decides to leave under enormous financial pressure today often finds the IRS waiting with its hand out. When property is sold at auction in order to satisfy debt, the farmers will often realize a very significant capital gain, even though they really have losses because the value of the property has gone up while the debt may have gone up even more dramatically. This proposal would provide a once-in-a-lifetime capital gains exclusion for farmers who decide or are pressured to leave agriculture. 
   Next, this proposal addresses net operating losses of farmers. My proposal would lengthen the carryback period for net operating losses for farmers to 10 years. Because of the volatility in the income of farmers, we believe it makes sense to allow them a net operating loss over an extended period. 
   Next, this proposal I am offering today deals with estate valuation. We  have the special use valuation, in order to help farmers keep their farms intact. The definitions that trigger the recapture, unfortunately, are too rigid. If the farm can remain a going concern by renting some portion of it to other family members, I believe the family should be able to still enjoy the benefits of special use valuation. My proposal would provide that an heir could rent the family farm to family members for the purpose of farming without triggering the recapture provisions. 
   Next, my proposal deals with farmer cooperatives. This proposal would provide cooperatives with the same declaratory relief procedures available to other tax-exempt entities when their tax-exempt status is denied. 
   Finally, my proposal deals with income averaging for farmers and the alternative minimum tax. Because of interaction between the income averaging provisions of the code and the alternative minimum tax, some farmers who elect to take advantage of income averaging are finding themselves subject to alternative minimum tax. That was never intended. This outcome should be changed so farmers receive the full benefit of income averaging. This proposal would provide that a farmer who elects income averaging would not then face an increase in AMT liability. 
   With that, Mr. President, I send the bill to the desk and ask for its referral. I hope colleagues will support this legislation.

   Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, this amendment is designed to safeguard both Social Security and Medicare. We have, on a bipartisan basis, achieved consensus now that we should not spend the Social Security surplus for other programs. That is an enormous advancement. That is a commitment to fiscal responsibility. We ought to take the next step now and protect Medicare as well. That is what this lockbox amendment does. It protects every penny of Social Security for Social Security in each and every year, and it commits one-third of the non-Social Security surplus to Medicare. So we are taking care of our two major programs that are most at risk, Social Security and Medicare. 
   I hope my colleagues will support this lockbox amendment so we can leave this Congress with a full commitment to Social Security and Medicare.

    Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to Michael Dobmeier and to recognize him as a member of a distinguished group of North Dakotans who have demonstrated extraordinary leadership in their military careers and civilian life. 
   Michael was recently elected National Commander of the million-member Disabled American Veterans, a group with a historic tradition of advocating responsible legislation to assist disabled veterans, their families and survivors. Speaking of the DAV recently Michael said, ``I soon discovered the critical role the DAV serves in the lives of disabled veterans and their families in my community and communities nationwide.'' I wholeheartedly agree with this statement and attest to the fact that Michael has exemplified through his many significant achievements the great importance of the Disabled American Veterans. 
   Michael Dobmeier is a native of Grand Forks, North Dakota. After graduating from high-school, he enlisted in the navy in 1969. Following boot camp in San Diego, he trained as an engine man in Great Lakes, Illinois, attended Submarine School in New London, Connecticut, and, later Diver's School in San Diego. 
   While serving off the coast of Washington in April 1972 aboard the U.S.S. Trigger, Michael was severely burned when an engine crankcase oil heater exploded. It sprayed him with flaming oil and caused him 2nd and 3rd degree burns over more than 30% of his body. 
   Following this accident, Michael received a military discharge and joined the Grand Forks' Disabled American Veterans Chapter 2. Since then, he has held almost every local, state, and national leadership position in the organization and has held all chapter and department leadership positions. At the 1994 DAV National Convention, Michael was chosen to serve on the National Executive and Finance Committee, was elected 4th and 3rd Junior Vice Commander consecutively at the 1995 and 1996 DAV National Conventions, and at the 1997 National Convention was elected 1st Junior Vice Commander. In 1998, Michael was elected Senior Vice Commander at the National Convention in Las Vegas, Nevada. He was also the president of the North Dakota Veterans Home Foundation and was chosen the 1985 DAV Outstanding Member of the Department of North Dakota. 
   Michael Dobmeier resides in Grand Forks with his wife Sandra Jo and their two children. As owner and President of Dobmeier, Inc., an independent insurance company, Michael has also found success in the business world. 
   I am proud to honor Michael Dobmeier as a person who has served his country with distinction and accepted the challenges and risks associated with this service. As Michael recently stated, ``taking risks means moving forward while others are waiting for better times, while others are waiting for proven results, and while others are waiting for applause for their past performance. The greatest risk of all, however, is to take no risks ..... make no changes.'' We thank Mr. Dobmeier today for taking those risks. The world is truly a better place because of him.

   Mr. CONRAD. Absolutely. That would reduce interest costs over time. Of course, we are burning up a lot of money in the Federal budget in interest costs. 
   The other thing I think is often missed in this whole question of debt reduction, Lloyd Bentsen when he was Secretary of the Treasury came to a meeting of the Finance Committee and said the best bang for the buck, the biggest bang for the buck is to take measures that reduce debt, that reduce deficits, that as a result take pressure off of interest rates. 
   For every 1 percent we save on interest rates, we lift a $128 billion debt burden off this economy, every year--every year. That is bigger than any tax cut anybody has come up with, in terms of relief to our economy, by lifting the debt burden on this economy. 
   The proof is in the pudding. What happened in 1993, when we cut spending and, yes, raised income taxes on the wealthiest 1 percent so we could reduce the deficits, balance the budget, and get us on a course that could be sustained financially? We triggered reduced interest rates, increased rates of savings, societal savings that made more money available for productive investment that kicked off the longest economic expansion in our history. That is what is working. We ought to continue that course. 
   We ought to stay the effort, continue the effort to pay down this debt, relieve the debt burden on the economy, take Government out of competition for scarce resources so the private sector has more money to invest, so we are better able to grow the economy, so we have a bigger economy when the bills of the baby boom generation start to come due. That is what every economist has told the Finance Committee. It is what they have told the Budget Committee. We have the Chairman of the Federal Reserve telling us that is the wisest course. Let's do it. Let's take some of this tax cut, half of it, and use it to reduce the debt. That is the wisest course. 
   We know there are things that need to be done on tax relief. I mentioned the marriage tax penalty. We ought to eliminate the marriage tax penalty. We ought to eliminate that. We have enough money in our proposed tax cuts to take care of that problem and also to address other serious needs in the tax arena. But when I talk to my constituents, they say to me: Senator, pay down the debt. That is really the crying need in this economy. 
   We know; we have seen the reports in the Washington Post, that individuals' taxes have gone down. That is the finding of the Congressional Budget Office. That is the finding of the Tax Foundation, that taxes on individuals have gone down because we have expanded the earned-income tax credit; we provide the $500 tax credit for children. As a result, we have provided tax relief, very meaningful tax relief. That is one reason people are not clamoring for the additional tax relief. 
   What they are clamoring for is a continuation of the economic strategy that has made us the wonder of the world. It has created the longest economic expansion in our history. Whatever we do, we should not put that economic expansion at risk. And the best way to foster a continuation of this economic expansion is to continue the strategy of paying down debt. 
   Might I inquire how much time I have remaining?

   Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, first let me thank my colleagues. We are glad to split the remaining time. 
   I think the point has been made and hopefully clearly made. I am offering a second-degree amendment to the amendment of the Senator from Colorado. Let me just speak, if I may for a moment, about the amendment of the Senator from Colorado because there is something in his amendment that also should concern my colleagues. 
   Right at the beginning of the amendment of the Senator from Colorado, he defines a balanced budget as one that includes all budgeted outlays and budgeted revenues. He says, ``budgeted outlays shall not exceed budget revenues.'' That sounds like a balanced budget but, unfortunately, under the legal terms to which we have to hold, that is a definition of a balanced budget that includes the Social Security surpluses. 
   We have all pledged here not to do this. We have all pledged not to use Social Security surpluses to balance the budget. Now the Senator from Colorado comes in here and defines a balanced budget as one that uses Social Security revenues to balance. That is precisely----

   Mr. CONRAD. No, I will not. That is precisely what we should not do. That is going back to the bad old days around here of using Social Security money to balance the budget. That is going back to the bad old days of raiding Social Security, of looting Social Security to make it look as if we have balanced 
   the budget. 
   Why ever would we want to go back to that approach? We have just spent years convincing our colleagues and the American people that we should not count Social Security surpluses to balance the operating budget of the United States. Now we have an amendment from a colleague that suggests we ought to go back to the bad old days and we ought to raid Social Security to balance the budget. 
   I hope we will not go in that direction. I hope we will continue on the path of reserving every penny of Social Security for Social Security. Let's not, please, colleagues, go back to defining a balanced budget as one that raids the Social Security surpluses in order to achieve balance. That would be a profound mistake. 
   Instead, I hope we take the second-degree amendment I have offered that says let's make the top priority debt reduction, let's take every penny of the Social Security surplus and dedicate it to Social Security, and let's take the biggest chunk of the non-Social Security surplus and use it to pay down debt. That is the best game plan for maintaining economic prosperity in the country, for extending this remarkable period of economic expansion, for broadening and deepening economic opportunity in this country. 
   Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.

   Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I say to my colleague from Colorado, I read his amendment. His amendment defines a balanced budget as one that includes all receipts and all outlays. That includes the Social Security surplus funds as a definition of a balanced budget. That, in my judgment, is not a balanced budget. It is exactly the mistake we made around here for 30 years. Defining a balanced budget as one that includes Social Security surpluses is to set up the circumstance in which we could go back to the bad old days of raiding and looting Social Security for operating expenses, and that is something we have all pledged not to do. 
   Maybe the intention of the Senator from Colorado is to protect Social Security, but when he defines a balanced budget in the amendment he has offered as one that raids Social Security surpluses to accomplish balance, he has turned back the clock to the bad old days. That is a mistake. That should not happen. We should not vote for it. 
   Instead, I say to my colleagues, we should vote for the second-degree amendment I have offered that says let's put debt reduction as the first priority of this Government; that says we are going to reserve every penny of the Social Security surplus for Social Security; and that says of the non-Social Security surplus, instead of making a tax reduction, a tax-cut scheme virtually the only priority of the non-Social Security surplus, we ought to adopt a plan that says, no, we ought to make the top priority of the non-Social Security surplus debt reduction. 
   That is the proposal before the Senate: to cut in half the proposed tax cut and dedicate the money to debt reduction. That is what the economists have told us should be the highest priority for these funds. I believe that is the case. I reserve the remainder of my time.

   Mr. CONRAD. I will respond briefly to my colleague from New Mexico on the question of our plan and what it can accommodate and what it can't. I start by saying I have great respect for the chairman of the Budget Committee. 
   With respect to the marriage tax penalty, we do have sufficient resources to address the marriage tax penalty. The tax cuts we have provided out of the non-Social Security surplus are net tax reductions of $265 billion over 10 years. The plan we offered to address the marriage tax penalty in the Senate Finance Committee costs $150 billion. It is a very simple plan. It says we are going to give people the choice of filing as a married couple or filing separately. They can file and pay whichever is less.

   Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, my second-degree amendment is very simple. Instead of using $150 billion for a tax cut over the next 5 years, we take half of that money and dedicate it to further debt reduction. Every economist who has come before the Finance Committee and the Budget Committee has said the highest priority is to pay down the debt. 
   The question is, What do we do to best secure a continuing economic expansion in our country? Every economist who has come before the Budget Committee and the Finance Committee, as well as the Chairman of the Federal Reserve, has said the highest priority is to continue to pay down this debt. We take half of the proposed tax cut and use it for further debt reduction. That ought to be our priority. That is what this amendment does. 
   I hope my colleagues will support the second-degree amendment and oppose the underlying Allard amendment which defines a balanced budget as one that raids Social Security. Let's not go back to the bad old days. Let's pay down the debt.

   Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, we are now in the very happy circumstance, as a nation, to be on the longest economic expansion in our country's entire history. As this headline shows from the February 1 edition of the Washington Post, ``Expansion Is Now Our Nation's Longest.'' This 107 months of economic growth beats the record of the 1960s. 
   This is a remarkable circumstance as we meet to discuss the budget resolution this year. The question before this body and the other body and the President is, What is the budget policy to pursue to keep this economic expansion going? What is the best set of policies we can adopt? 
   Perhaps, to make a judgment on those questions, we ought to refresh ourselves on the history of how we got to where we are. This chart shows a comparison of the last three administrations with respect to the budget deficit. It shows, going back to 1981, 20 years ago, that the deficits were rising and rising dramatically, and we embarked on a period of not only expanding deficits but expanding debt in this country--taking on enormous debt. In fact, during this period, we quadrupled the national debt. That fundamentally threatened the economic security of our country. We saw, in the Bush administration, that the deficit absolutely skyrocketed. It went from an already high level of $153 billion all the way up to $290 billion. 
   Then President Clinton came into office. In 1993, we passed a plan to reduce budget deficits, to start getting our fiscal house in order. That was a 5-year plan. We can look at the 5 years of that plan and we can see that each and every year the deficit was coming down and coming down quite sharply. Those  were very important decisions that were made in 1993. If my colleagues will permit me to sound a partisan note, not a single Republican voted for this plan of reducing the budget deficit. It was a controversial plan that cut spending and, yes, raised income taxes on the wealthiest 1 percent in this country. But let's remember what worked. It worked. It brought the deficits down. It got our country back on sound financial footing. 
   Then, in 1997, we passed a second plan. This time, it was bipartisan. This time, we worked together and it finished the job so that we are now running substantial surpluses. In fact, as shown here in 1998, a $70 billion unified surplus; in 1999, there was a $124 billion unified surplus. In the year 2000, we anticipate a $176 billion budget surplus. These are surpluses, the last 2 years, even counting Social Security as a separate trust fund. In other words, not including Social Security in the calculation, we balanced 2 years ago, last year, and will balance again this year. So we have made enormous progress in this country. 
   What a difference it has made. Because we got on a sounder financial footing, that took pressure off of interest rates. Lower interest rates contributed to making our economy more competitive. It took Government out of the position of competing with the private sector for funds, so interest rates came down. That made room for more productive investment. What we saw was an explosion in jobs. Over 20 million new jobs were created during this period. But the good news didn't stop there. We saw the unemployment rate drop to its lowest level in 42 years. 
   The point I am making is that we are pursuing an economic strategy that is working. It is working well for our country. We should not abandon it for risky schemes that some might propose. The unemployment rate is the lowest in 42 years. The inflation rate is at the lowest sustained level since 1965. These are facts. 
   These tell us the economic game plan and strategy we embarked on in 1993 is working and working well. We have talked about deficits--and, of course, the deficits are the annual difference between the spending of the Federal Government and the revenue of the Federal Government. We also need to talk about the national debt. The debt is the cumulative total of the deficits. People often get confused about this question. But that is the difference. The deficits are the annual difference between spending and revenue. Of course, we don't have deficits anymore. We are in surplus, very significant surplus. The debt is the cumulative total of all those annual deficits. Even that debt is starting to come down. You can see we are right here on the line, so we have turned the corner. 
   We are actually starting to pay down the national debt. That is a course we must continue. It is absolutely critical for our economic future to keep paying down this debt. In fact, we are now in a position where we could pay off the national debt, completely retire the publicly held national debt, by the year 2013. 
   That is precisely what we should do to put our country in a strong position for when the baby boomers start to retire. We all know what is going to happen then. We are going to see a substantial increase in pressure on Social Security, Medicare, and other Federal programs. The best way to prepare for that day is to grow the economy so that it is best positioned to take that burden. How can we do that? Well, central to doing it is to get rid of this debt, dump this debt. That ought to be on the top priority list of every Member in this Chamber. 
   That is the record--a very positive record--of what has occurred. It doesn't end there because not only have we seen extraordinary periods of economic growth, not only have we seen the lowest unemployment, the lowest rate of inflation in many, many years--in fact, in decades--we have also seen Federal spending put under control. We now see that Federal spending is at the lowest level since 1966 as a share of our national income. This is as a percentage of our gross domestic product. We can see that we got to a period back in the 1980s where Federal spending was over 23 percent of our gross domestic product. Look where we are now. We are down below 19 percent and headed lower if we stay on this course. It is remarkable what has happened. 
   If we look at what the priorities are now of the various budget resolutions before us, this is what we see by way of comparison. Over the next 5 years of this budget resolution, we project a non-Social Security surplus of $171 billion. That is based on the assumption of no real growth in the Federal budget. That is what is called a real spending freeze. It adjusts for inflation, but nothing more. So over the next 5 years, we would have $171 billion under that set of assumptions--a real spending freeze and adjustments for inflation, but no more. Our Republican friends believe we ought to use nearly all of that money for a tax cut. This is the Senate plan, a $150 billion tax cut. With the $18 billion in interest that would cost, it would be a total of $168 billion. 
   On the House side, you can see their plan: $223 billion, a tax cut of $150 billion, plus they have a $50 billion reserve for a tax cut, plus the $23 billion of interest costs that would be entailed in that plan, for a total of $223 billion. 
   You see that the problem with the plan is they use more than the surplus than is available. Where is the money going to come from? I think we all know what will happen. They will be right back to the bad old days of raiding the Social Security trust funds. That is what they will do. That would be a profound mistake. We can't let them do it. 
   That is why these votes that are to come are so important. 
   It is one reason you see these headlines that the Republicans have avoided the vote on the Bush tax cut. They avoided it in the House, and they avoided it in the Senate because they know the Bush plan is even more skewed than the plans they have passed. The Bush plan has a much larger tax cut. There can be no question that his plan must raid Social Security in order to add up. There is no money left over under his plan for further reduction of the debt. There is no money under his plan to extend the solvency of Medicare. There is no money under his plan for other high priority domestic needs because he is taking all the money and all the non-Social Security surplus and much more and giving it in a tax cut to the wealthiest among us. 
   That is the question before us as a people. What are we going to do with these forecasts of surpluses? 
   Let's remember their projections are over an extended period of time--5 years. Many of us believe these projections will change and that they are not something on which we can count. 
   We look at the plan Mr. Bush has put before all of us as a people. We can see that over 5 years he proposes $483 billion in tax cuts. But we only have $171 billion available in non-Social Security surpluses. Where is the rest of the money going to come from? It can only come from one place: He is going to have to raid Social Security. He is going to have to go back to the bad old days of dipping in the till on Social Security. That is a profound mistake. It is no wonder they have avoided votes on that tax cut plan on both the House and Senate sides. 
   Beyond that, the Bush proposal is unfair because he is saying take 60 percent of the benefit of his massive tax cut and give it to the wealthiest 10 percent in the country. That is his plan. Senator MCCAIN said it very well during his campaign. He said over and over again that 60 percent of the benefit in the Bush tax cut goes to the wealthiest 10 percent. I even heard Senator MCCAIN make the statement that 36 percent of the benefit goes to the wealthiest 1 percent. Mr. Bush has made the point over and over that these surpluses belong to the American people. They do not belong to the Government. He is exactly right about that. 
   These surpluses belong to the American people. The question is, What do we do with them? Do we give them to the wealthiest among us, or do we put the highest priority on taking a significant chunk of those funds and pay down the people's debt? I submit to you the better approach is to take the significant majority of these funds and pay down our national debt. That is what we ought to do. That is in the best interests of the American people--not take the big chunk of this non-Social Security surplus--in fact, under the Bush plan take more than there is in the surplus--and hand it out to the wealthiest among us. It is much better to pay down the people's debt.  
   If we look back and remember the history of what occurred, if we go back to the 1980s when we had those massive deficits, the blue line shows the outlays, the expenditures of the Federal Government. The red line shows the revenue of the Federal Government. It is not hard to figure out why we had massive deficits. The spending line was much higher than the revenue line. 
   It wasn't until 1993--we passed a 5-year plan that took down 
   the spending line and raised the revenue line--that we were able to balance the budget. That is the history of what has worked. We should stay on this course. We shouldn't go out and go on a big new spending binge. We shouldn't go out and have a massive, risky tax scheme that threatens this economic expansion and this economic success story. Why would we do that? We have a plan that is working. We have a plan that is producing results for this country. 
   As we look ahead, some say because the revenue line has gone up that we have the highest taxes in our country's history; not true. We have the highest tax revenue. We don't have the highest taxes. I know that seems odd to people. How can that be? How can you have high revenue but not high taxes? The reason is this economic boom has generated dramatic revenue. We are in a virtuous cycle where good fiscal policy and good monetary policy have helped this economy grow. And the genius of the American people has developed the circumstance in which our economic expansion is extraordinary. Because we have this revenue, we are in a situation that has allowed us to actually reduce taxes on individual taxpayers. 
   That is not just KENT CONRAD's statement. That is a review of the Federal tax system that shows that the Federal tax level falls for most people. The studies show the burden now less than 10 percent. In fact, as this newspaper story says, for all but the wealthiest Americans, the Federal income tax burden has ``shrunk'' to the lowest level in four decades. 
   Those who come out here and say we have the highest tax ever--no, no. We have the best tax revenues ever. We have the most income ever. We don't have the highest taxes ever. Tax rates for individual American taxpayers have gone down. That is not the result of some study by some liberal think tank. This is a result of the work of the Congressional Budget Office. This is the work of the Treasury Department. This is the work of the conservative Tax Foundation. These are their conclusions--that tax rates have actually gone down. 
   Let's look at what those studies reveal. This is for a family of four earning $39,000 in 1999. This is according to the Congressional Budget Office. This is their total tax burden for Federal income taxes. You can see their Federal income taxes have gone down from 8.3 percent to 5.4 percent from 1981 to 1999. It is not just a family earning $39,000, but this is what happened to the income tax burden for a median-income family earning $68,000 in 1999. Their tax burden has gone from 10.4 percent in 1957 to 8.9 percent in 1998. This is according to the very conservative Tax Foundation. 
   Mr. President and colleagues, this is the history. This is how we have gotten to where we are today--by getting our fiscal house in order; by cutting spending; yes, by raising revenue on the wealthiest 1 percent in this country and lowering taxes on the vast majority of the American people through expansion of the earned-income tax; by the $500 child care credit; lowering taxes on the vast majority of the American people; and now we are in this position of being able to actually retire the publicly held debt by the year 2013. 
   Virtually every economist that has come before us on the Budget Committee and on the Finance Committee said this is exactly what you should do--make the priority paying down the debt. 
   Alan Greenspan, the head of the Federal Reserve, says pay down debt first. 
   ``The best use of surplus is to reduce red ink, the Fed chief says.''

   Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Chair. I thank Senator MCCONNELL. 
   Madam President, I rise today to support the McConnell-Bennett-Dorgan-Conrad effort to pass a statute to protect the flag, rather than to amend the Constitution of the United States for that purpose. 
   It seems to me that anybody who advances an amendment to the Constitution has to clear a very high threshold. I personally believe the Constitution of the United States is one of the greatest documents in human history. It is not to be amended lightly. It is certainly not to be amended when there are other ways of addressing a problem. 
   I believe in this circumstance the issue is really quite clear. Flag burning and flag desecration are unacceptable to me and I think unacceptable to a majority of Americans, certainly unacceptable to the people of the State that I represent. But the first answer cannot and should not be to amend the Constitution of the United States. 
   In our history, more than 10,000 amendments to the Constitution have been proposed. Only 27 have been approved. Since I have been in the Senate, more than 850 constitutional amendments have been offered. Thank goodness we have not adopted them. Many of them would have made that document worse. Many of them would have taken positions that are really things that ought to be done by statute. 
   The Constitution is a framework. It does not deal with specifics. It deals with the larger framework of how this Government should operate. Individual laws, individual statutes are meant to deal with the specific problems that we encounter as a society within the framework provided by the Constitution. Some would have us change that basic organic document to deal with this problem. I believe that would be a mistake, and we would look back on it in future years and say: My, that was an overreaction. 
   Yes, it is unacceptable to engage in flag desecration. Yes, it is abhorrent to desecrate the flag. Those are obviously true statements and those are genuine feelings. But we have an alternative. The alternative is to pass a statute. 
   The proponents of the constitutional amendment will say to you: But that will be ruled unconstitutional, as has the previous attempt to pass a statute. 
   This statute has not been ruled unconstitutional, and the American Law Division of the Library of Congress tells us it would be upheld as constitutional.

   Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, these are resolutions in support of the Flag Protection Act of 1999 by AMVETS of North Dakota, by the AMVETS Ladies Auxiliary of North Dakota, and by the North Dakota State Council of the Vietnam Veterans of America. All of these veterans organizations, some of the finest in my State, have said this is the proper approach; that we ought to attempt to pass this statute rather than amend the Constitution of the United States. 
   I just got word, moments ago, that the editor of the 164th Infantry Association Newsletter, of my State, has contacted my office and agrees with the position that I am taking, that it is not necessary to amend the Constitution of the United States. 
   I think he is exactly right. I would just conclude by saying, not only do veterans organizations back home support the position I am taking, but many who are in the American Legion have contacted me and told me they support the position that I am taking. 
   Finally, Gen. Colin Powell was quoted at length in a full page ad of a major newspaper in my State today as saying that he does not believe that the appropriate response is to amend the Constitution of the United States. Gen. Colin Powell, former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the man who led us in Desert Storm, a man for whom I have profound respect, saying to us, yes, it is abhorrent to desecrate the flag, yes, it is abhorrent to burn the flag, but that flag is going to survive long after, as he describes it, these miscreants who desecrate the flag are long gone. Long after they are gone, that flag is still going to be flying proudly over this great Nation. 
   One of the reasons this is a great Nation is because of the Constitution of the United States. What a brilliant document. I doubt very much anything we are going to be doing in the next 2 days would improve upon that Constitution that is the organic law for our country. 
   I urge my colleagues to take a look--take a serious look --at the work Senator MCCONNELL has done and that the four of us, on a bipartisan basis, are offering our colleagues as an alternative to taking the very drastic step of amending the Constitution of the United States. 
   I hope my colleagues will support this approach. 
   I commend my colleagues who have joined in offering this--with a special thanks to Senator MCCONNELL, who has drafted this approach--Senator BENNETT, and Senator DORGAN. 
   I believe this is the wiser course. It is the right course. It is one that will stand the test of time. 
   I thank the Chair and yield the floor.

   Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I am pleased the Senate is taking action on the H.R. 5, the Senior Citizen's Freedom to Work Act of 2000. This legislation eliminates the earnings test for Social Security recipients between the full retirement age (currently 65) and age 69. The measure will be retroactive to January 1, 2000. 
   I have long supported changing the Social Security earnings test, which the amount of income recipients may earn before their benefits are reduced. Under current law, recipients aged 65 through 69 can earn up to $17,000 per year without penalty. But beyond that, benefits are reduced by $1 for each $3 of earnings. This year, approximately 800,000 seniors will lose benefits. Repealing the earnings test will allow older Americans who have skills and expertise to continue working and making a contribution to society and to our economy. 
   I am concerned about the Social Security earnings test and realize the difficulties that many older Americans experience because of it. For many seniors, working beyond the age of 65 is necessary just to make ends meet. Changing the earnings limit will allow them to earn extra income without losing hard-earned Social Security benefits. They have spent a lifetime working for these benefits and they should get them, whether they choose to continue to work or not. 
   I have supported past legislation to raise the earnings test limit. Today, I fully support this legislation to eliminate the earnings test for all individuals who have reached full retirement age. 
   This bill is especially important to North Dakota because we have one of the highest rates of seniors receiving Social Security benefits. 
   I am also pleased because this bill is fiscally responsible. In the long term, it will not have any financial impact on our Social Security trust fund.  
   I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this important piece of legislation.

   Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise to strongly endorse the crop insurance bill that is before us. It is a product of a bipartisan effort. 
   I especially want to congratulate my colleague, Senator KERREY of Nebraska, who has labored hard and long in order to produce this result. Senator ROBERTS of Kansas is a cosponsor. We are all indebted to them for their leadership on this issue because this bill brings a new measure of stability to rural America. From the Northeast, to the great heartland, to the South, this bill is going to make a difference in the lives of farmers who we know are too hard pressed. 
   For those who are listening, crop prices are the lowest they have been in 50 years. We have just had a rally on the Mall that went on for 2 days with thousands of participants from all over America with farmers telling us they simply have to have help or they are going to go under in unprecedented numbers. That is the message that has been delivered. 
   Our first response is the crop insurance reform bill--to say we are ready to help and this Congress is prepared to respond. 
   I also want to thank my colleague, Senator GRASSLEY, a member of the Budget Committee and the Agriculture Committee, who joined me on the Budget Committee to reserve the funds so that this bill could go forward. We achieved $6 billion in funding last year for crop insurance reform. That is what this bill provides. This bill reforms crop insurance by making coverage more affordable, by fixing an unintended consequence of our effort to reform crop insurance in 1994 that unfairly lowered coverage for producers facing unexpected circumstances with repeated natural disasters. 
   It requires USDA to implement new quality adjustment procedures. It eases qualification for noninsured crop disaster assistance. It provides for the development of improved specialty crop policies and brings livestock into the crop insurance system.  
   This bill also provides a pilot program to test an alternative risk management approach. 
   With respect to the question of multiple years of disaster, let me explain, in brief, the problem. 
   In areas of the country that have experienced multiple years of disasters, under the current crop insurance law, the formula under which they recover damages is dramatically altered by repeated years of disaster. This legislation offered by our colleagues, Senator KERREY, Senator ROBERTS, and a number of other of us on a bipartisan basis, addresses that problem. I am grateful for it. 
   My State has been affected by multiple years of disaster. I pray that our time of suffering is over. But other States may have a similar experience. They shouldn't have to suffer unduly. Crop insurance should work for them. That reform is included in this bill. We can be proud of it. 
   I want to respond, if I can, to an editorial that was in the Washington Post this morning. That editorial, which makes the assertion that crop insurance promotes production on marginal acres, or so-called ``environmentally sensitive lands,'' requires a response. 
   I believe the facts do not support that claim. I believe the Washington Post in their editorial is precisely wrong about the effect of crop insurance. The fact is meaningful crop insurance did not exist until 1994. Has crop acreage increased in that period? Let us review the record because I think the facts speak in direct contradiction to the fundamental assertion in the Washington Post editorial. 
   This chart shows the number of acres being planted in this country from 1996 to 1999. One can see the blue bar. Those are the acres farmed. You can see the acreage hasn't expanded. The acreage has been reduced under an expanding crop insurance program. 
   The fundamental assertion by the editorial writers in the Washington Post is wrong. They may assert, well, it is not fair to look at just acres planted and acres taken out of production. You have to look at insured acres. 
   Let's do that. This chart, again, is from 1996 through 1999. Again, the acres that are insured are the blue bars. You can see that we are down from 1996. We have not had an increase. The acres insured are down. 
   One has to ask this question: If farmers are taking acreage out of production, are they taking out their most productive acres? Is that what they would do? I don't think so. I think just the opposite would occur. 
   As farmers take acres out of production, they would take out their most marginal acres. They would take out those acres that are most environmentally sensitive. That is the record. 
   I wish our friends who write editorials down at the Washington Post knew a little more about agriculture because I frequently find them in error, but they are never in doubt. 
   I say to my friends that they need to get out in the heartland of America. They need to get out of Washington. They need to get outside the beltway to find out what is really going on in agricultural America because over and over, as I read their editorials, they have almost no relationship to the reality of what the people I represent are experiencing. 
   We had a breakthrough today in terms of an agreement with our colleagues from the Northeast. The fact is they had an unfair result in the disaster bill of last year. I acknowledge that. I regret that occurred. I can say my own State has been dealt with generously in disaster programs. We had a horrible disaster in 1997. We had the worst winter storm in 50 years, the most massive flood in 500 years, and the largest mass evacuation of American cities since the civil war. This Congress responded generously to the needs of the people I represent. I will be forever in the debt of my colleagues. 
   When similar disasters hit the Northeast last year, they were not dealt with as generously. I think we must all acknowledge that. Hopefully, this is a step toward recognizing the very real economic hurt that occurred there. 
   I conclude by thanking the chairman and the ranking member of our committee. Especially, I direct my comments to the chairman. This is not a bill he favored. He had an alternative approach. But he graciously allowed Members to debate and discuss in the committee. He was eminently fair in the consideration of this bill in the committee. When his side did not prevail, he was a gentleman, and he has come out on the floor of this Senate to help pass the final product of a democratic process. 
   I thank the chairman very much for his fairness and also his patience. His patience is quite remarkable as we fight and joust about issues that matter an awful lot to Senators as individuals representing different parts of the country, many from States in very deep financial trouble. 
   Let me finish by again thanking my colleagues, Senator ROBERTS of Kansas and Senator KERREY of Nebraska, for truly outstanding leadership in bringing this reform bill to the floor. I urge my colleagues to support it. I think it is something of which they can be proud. 
   I thank the Chair.

   Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I am pleased the Senate today will take action on the H.R. 1000, the Wendell H. Ford Aviation Investment and Reform Act for the 21st Century. The Federal Aviation Administration has been without a long-term authorization for some time, and airports in my state need to be able to move forward with construction projects soon. 
   There are three components of this bill that I strongly support: the increase in funding for the Airport Improvement Program (AIP), the budgetary treatment of the Aviation Trust Fund, and a provision to stabilize essential air service (EAS) in Dickinson, North Dakota. 
   I am very pleased that this conference report provides for $3.2 billion in 2001 for the AIP program, and that funding will increase by $100 million each year. As air travel continues to increase, it is important that we invest in our nation's airports to ensure the safety of the traveling public and expand capacity for the future. This program provides federal grants for airport development and planning and these dollars are usually spent on capital projects supporting operations such as runways, taxiways, and noise abatement. This substantial increase in funding will go a long way in maintaining the quality of air travel in North Dakota and across the country. 
   In addition to the increase in funding, the fact that we now have long-term FAA reauthorization instead of the extensions our airports have been operating under is an important improvement. Short-term extensions had the effect of leaving airport managers and community leaders unable to develop and move forward with airport improvement projects. Because in North Dakota the construction season is short, the ability to plan and schedule projects is critical to maintaining our state's aviation system. 
   Secondly, this conference report contains a very important provision for Dickinson, North Dakota. This legislation will allow this small community to retain essential air service without paying a local share. Currently, Dickinson and Fergus Falls, Minnesota are the only communities with this requirement. EAS is vital to smaller communities, and the difficulties encountered by many of the communities in retaining EAS warrant increased federal attention. The report also requires the Department of Transportation to report on retaining essential air service, focusing that report on North Dakota. This is an extremely serious problem in my state and I believe it needs greater attention. The residents and businesses of small communities, especially in a rural state like North Dakota, depend heavily on this service and we need to find a way to consistently serve these small markets. 
   Finally, I am pleased that conferees agreed to budgetary guarantees of increased funding for aviation. The conference report provides for a budget point of order against any legislation that fails to spend all of the Airport and Airways Trust Fund (AATF) receipts and interest, and does not appropriate the total authorized levels for capital programs (AIP and Facilities and Equipment). After allocations to the capital programs occur, remaining AATF funds can be used for general operations, and can be augmented by monies from the general fund. 
   I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this important and long overdue legislation.

   Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the amendment offered by Senator ROBB. During consideration of S. 1134, the Affordable Education Act last year in the Finance committee, I joined my colleague in offering a similar amendment during the markup. Regrettably, that amendment was not adopted. 
   Under the Robb amendment, an allocation of $24.8 billion in bonds would be authorized to permit states and local school districts, over the next 5 years, to issue bonds to modernize and renovate approximately 6,000 schools. Sixty-five percent of the bond authority would be allocated to states based on their title I allocation, and 35 percent to the 100 school districts with the largest number of low-income students. Additionally, $1.3 billion would be authorized for a new grant and zero-interest loan program to fund the most urgent school repair needs in local schools. There is also $400 million set aside for Bureau of Indian Affairs schools. 
   Today we are considering our first major education measure of the 21st century. It is critical that we weigh carefully the direction of that education policy. What should our priorities be as we enter the 21st century? How should we allocate our limited Federal resources in education? How do we respond to growing concerns about the digital divide, and what is the role of education in that debate? 
   Under S. 1134, the major provision of the bill would expand tax-free expenditures from the current higher education individual retirement account to permit student expenses for elementary and secondary education including private, parochial, or public education. S. 1134 would increase the limit on the annual contribution for an education IRA for a four-year period (2000-2003) to $2,000. 
   Expenses authorized for IRA expenditures would include traditional expenses including tuition, books, supplies, computer equipment, tutoring services, as well as student expenses for room, board, transportation and supplementary items. Additionally, S. 1134 makes a number of important changes, which I support, in prepaid tuition plans, employer-provided educational assistance, and student loan interest deduction. 
   There is no question, of the merits of encouraging families to save to meet the educational needs of their children. Education IRA's are one way to encourage this savings, and we know it  has been very helpful to families planning for higher education expenses. As we debate this legislation, however, it is critical that we define our national education priorities, and allocate our limited Federal resources to meet those objectives. Does an expansion of education IRA's respond to our national education priorities? Does the allocation of limited Federal resources for education IRA's respond to the education needs of our children into the 21st century? 
   In the past 5 years, a number of very respected organizations have alerted us to the critical elementary and secondary school infrastructure needs. In 1995, the GAO reported that $112 billion was needed to bring the nation's schools into good overall condition. The report cited that one-third of schools--about 25,000--were in need of extensive repairs. More recently, the National Center for Education Statistics released a report stating that the average public school in America is 42 years old. Many of these schools are also lagging in technology infrastructure and 
   their effort to connect to the Internet. 
   I know the need for repairs in our schools is great from my visits to North Dakota schools and conversations with educators, and state officials. North Dakota State Superintendent of Schools, Wayne Sanstead, informed me last year during consideration of the markup of S. 1134, that costs associated with school modernization in the North Dakota would exceed $420 million. 88 percent of schools reported need to upgrade or repair facilities, and 62 percent reported unsatisfactory environmental conditions.

   Mr. CONRAD. It is critical that we ask whether an expansion of education IRA's for elementary and secondary education expenses is the best use of our limited Federal education dollars and responds to our national education priorities. We need to examine who will benefit from this IRA expansion as opposed to who will benefit from meeting school infrastructure needs. 
   According to the Department of Treasury, 70 percent of the proposed education IRA benefit would go to 20 percent of all taxpayers. Higher income families would derive the most benefit. Many families with incomes less than $55,000 would receive little benefit. Additionally, according to the Joint Committee on Taxation, the average annual benefit for children attending private and parochial schools would be limited to approximately $37. 
   On the other hand, 90 percent of our children attend public schools, and public school enrollments are increasing. According to the National Council on Education Statistics, a record 52.7 million children are enrolled in public schools, and that number is expected to increase to 54.3 million by 2008. It is estimated that at least 2,400 new school facilities will be needed to meet this student enrollment increase. Studies also show that building conditions and overcrowding in school facilities are linked to student achievement. 
   There is no question where our education resources should be directed. Although it is important to encourage families to save for their children's education, we have a more urgent need to ensure that a majority of our children have the best educational environment for learning. Regrettably, that is not the case in too many of our local school districts. Local school districts face many challenges in school modernization efforts. Interest payments on bonds are already a major expense for local taxpayers. Additionally, taxpayers are burdened with many unfunded Federal mandates and it becomes difficult to finance new construction or repairs through an expansion of bond authority. Also, many of our rural communities across the nation, including North Dakota, are experiencing declining enrollments in local school districts leaving many of these smaller, rural schools with more limited education resources, and very limited ability to undertake bond initiatives. 
   It is clear where Federal support for education should be directed. The importance of school modernization is underscored by the emphasis on technology in our economy in the 21st century. Information technology will play a key role in our continued economic growth. The condition of our public school facilities, including technology infrastructure and the ability to connect to the Internet, is critical in sustaining our current economic growth. It is also important in ensuring that our children are equipped to enter the job markets in the 21st century, and able to benefit from the extraordinary growth that we have experienced in recent years. 
   School modernization is critical for our children's success, and should be one of our key national education priorities as we enter the 21st century. Local communities cannot face the task of funding the necessary school building and technology infrastructure improvements on their own. They urgently need our help. I strongly urge my colleagues to vote in support of the amendment offered by Senator ROBB.

   Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise today to recommend the confirmation of Kermit Bye for the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals, and I ask my colleagues to join me and Senator DORGAN in supporting his nomination. 
   Kermit Bye is a native North Dakotan. He was born in the middle of a North Dakota blizzard, in a railroad section house in Hatton, North Dakota. He has distinguished himself in his career, and is widely recognized as one of the best trial lawyers in our state. Kermit Bye will be an excellent addition to the federal judiciary, and he has my strong support. 
   Kermit Bye would bring a wide range of experiences to the bench. Before receiving his law degree from the University of North Dakota in 1962, he worked as a milk truck driver, a radio advertising salesman, and in catalog sales at Montgomery Wards. 
   Soon after completing law school, Mr. Bye worked as North Dakota Deputy Securities Commissioner, and later served as Assistant United States Attorney for the District of North Dakota. 
   Since 1968, Mr. Bye has worked for the Vogel Law Firm and was named President of the firm in 1981. Mr. Bye has over 30 years of experience in Federal and state trial and appellate litigation. His long and distinguished career includes representing individual and corporate clients. He has tried more than 100 cases, representing both plaintiffs and defendants. He has also argued numerous appeals, including more than 20 before the Eighth Circuit. Mr. Bye has served on the Board of Governors and as the President of the State Bar Association of North Dakota. 
   Through his broad experience and success he has earned an excellent reputation. As an experienced litigator, Mr. Bye also has a full understanding of the appropriate role of the judiciary. 
   My colleague, Senator DORGAN, and I have heard from individuals across our home state, from both sides of the aisle and from all sections of the legal community, recommending Mr. Bye for this position. According to his colleagues and fellow bar members, Mr. Bye is a man of great character and qualifications. 
   One of his supporters is Judge Frank Magill, who Mr. Bye has been nominated to succeed on the Eighth Circuit. Judge Magill has been on senior status since April 1, 1997, and was appointed to the Eighth Circuit by President Reagan in 1986. He states in a letter to Senator HATCH: ``I have had a longtime professional association with Kermit Bye. His professional competence and integrity are of the highest order. He has several decades of trial experience. I know from personal experiences that he will be an easy fit for your criterion of judicial temperament.'' 
   Mr. President, I am confident that Mr. Bye will be an outstanding addition to the federal bench. I support his confirmation and yield the floor.

   Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, we have now reached a milestone in our economic history with the report the other day that our economic expansion is now the Nation's longest. We have now enjoyed economic expansion of 107 months. That is the longest economic expansion in our Nation's history. I thought it might be useful to reflect on some of the policies that have contributed to that success.  
   First and foremost is the fiscal policy of the Nation. The policies that determine our economic success are the fiscal policy of the United States and the monetary policy of the United States. 
   The fiscal policy of America is controlled by the President, working with the Congress of the United States. That is the spending policy and the tax policy of America. 
   The monetary policy is controlled by the Federal Reserve Board. Of course, we had a vote this morning on the question of the continued leadership of Chairman Greenspan over the monetary policy of our country. 
   With respect to the fiscal policy of the country, I thought it would be useful to compare and contrast the records of our last three Presidents. 
   Under President Reagan, starting in 1981, we saw a dramatic increase in Federal budget deficits. In fact, they nearly tripled from $79 billion a year, when he came into office, to over $200 billion a year. Then we saw some improvement in the final 2 years of his administration. 
   Then, with President Bush, we saw a dramatic increase in our Federal budget deficits, going from $153 billion in his first year to $290 billion in his final year in office. At that point, we were advised that we could expect red ink for as far into the future as anybody could project. In fact, they were expecting, at that point, this year we would have budget deficits of over $600 billion if there was failure to act. 
   Thank goodness we did not fail to act because in 1993 President Clinton came into office, put forward an ambitious 5-year plan to reduce the budget deficit, and we were able to pass that plan. We were able to pass that plan; and for the next 5 years, under that 5-year plan, each and every year the budget deficit came down, and came down sharply, to $22 billion at the end of that 5-year plan. 
   At that point, we passed, on a bipartisan basis--unlike in 1993, where nobody on the other side of the aisle in either Chamber supported the 5-year plan put forward by President Clinton--but in 1997, we joined hands, on a bipartisan basis, to finish the job. 
   Indeed, we did finish the job, so that in 1998 and 1999 we saw unified budget surpluses. In fact, in 1999, we had a surplus of $124 billion, on a unified basis--that means counting all of the accounts of the Federal Government. And even better news; we were able to balance that year without counting Social Security. 
   This year, the year we are currently in, we anticipate a $176 billion unified budget surplus, again, without counting Social Security. 
   Those are very dramatic improvements that we have had in the fiscal policy of the United States. 
   I will go to this chart first because it shows the changes that were made in the two key elements in determining whether or not you have a budget deficit. The blue line is the outlays of the Federal Government; that is, the spending. The red line is the revenues. You can see, we had a big gap between the two for many years. That is why we had a budget deficit. We were spending more than we were taking in. 
   In 1997, when we passed that 5-year plan to close the gap, you can see from the chart we reduced expenditures and we raised revenue. That combination has eliminated the budget deficit. That is why we are in surplus today. 
   Let's go back to the chart that shows, on the spending side of the ledger, how things changed. 
   We are now at the lowest level of Federal spending in 25 years as measured against our gross domestic product, as 
   measured against our national income, which is the fairest way to measure these things so you see changes over time, so that you are able to put in context the time value of money. 
   What you see is, we are now spending 18.7 percent of our national income on the Federal Government. That is, again, the lowest level since 1974, 25 years ago. If we stay on this course, you can see we will continue to see declines down to about 17 percent of our national income going to the Federal Government. That is a dramatic improvement over where we were back in 1992, when we were spending over 22 percent of our national income on the Federal Government. 
   Some have said: We have the highest taxes in our history. 
   Let me go back to the chart that shows revenue and spending. This, again, is measured against our gross domestic product, our national income. 
   The red line is the revenue line. It is true that the revenue line has gone up, just as the spending line has come down. That is how we balance the budget. We cut spending and we raised revenue so we could eliminate the deficit. 
   One of the key reasons we have more revenue is because the economy is doing well. It has been revived because we got our fiscal house in order in this country. Some say that translates into the highest taxes individuals have paid. That is not the case. 
   The fact is, the tax burden is declining for a family of four. This is not the Senator from North Dakota's analysis. This is the respected accounting firm of Deloitte & Touche, that compares the tax burden for a family earning $35,000 a year in 1979 to 1999. This chart shows their overall tax burden. This includes payroll taxes, income taxes. It shows that their tax burden has declined. The same is true of a family income of $85,000 a year. Their taxes have not gone up. Their taxes have gone down. Their taxes have been reduced. 
   Overall, revenue has increased because the economy is strengthened. Goodness knows, anybody who looks around at America's economy understands we are in the best shape we have been in in anybody's memory. 
   How do we keep this successful economy going? I think it is useful to reflect on how very important the successful economic policy we have been pursuing has been. It has produced the lowest unemployment rate in 41 years. This chart shows the dramatic improvement in the unemployment rate in this country. We have also experienced the lowest inflation rate in 33 years. 
   You remember we used to talk about the misery index. We used to combine the unemployment rate and the inflation rate and look at the so-called misery index. The misery index would be as favorable as it has been in almost anybody's lifetime because we have seen unemployment and the inflation rate come down dramatically. 
   The fact is, this economic policy has been working--a policy of balancing the budget and getting our fiscal house in order. 
   Now the question is, What do we do going forward? We have these projections that say we are going to be experiencing substantial surpluses in the future. 
   Chairman Greenspan, who we voted for overwhelmingly on the floor of the Senate, has given his recommendation. As recently as January 27, he told Congress: ``Pay down the debt first.'' That is what he is urging. He is saying: Continue the policy that we have pursued to eliminate deficits, reduce debt because that lifts an enormous burden off of the American economy. We reduce the interest costs; we reduce the competition for funds; we reduce the Government's call on money that is available in this economy; and there is more money available for the private sector at lower interest rates. That means higher rates of investment. That means stronger economic growth. We ought to pay attention to what Chairman Greenspan is telling us: ``Pay down the debt first.'' 
   I wish to talk a little about these projections of surpluses we have heard about. When the Congressional Budget Office released their projections, they put out three different calculations of what the surpluses might be over the next 10 years. 
   The first one was based on an assumption that we have a so-called capped baseline; that is, we go back to the 1997 agreement. That would mean very sharp cuts in spending this year over the spending we had last year. In fact, this baseline assumes that we would cut spending this year by $66 billion over last year's spending. 
   Now, that is not going to happen. We have had a Republican-controlled Congress the last 2 years. They have not been reducing spending from the previous year. They have been increasing the spending, even though the caps existed. In fact, we shattered the caps last year. So it is an unrealistic expectation to suggest that all of a sudden we are going to start following them this year. In fact, that would require a $66 billion cut in spending to get the projection of a non-Social Security surplus over the next 10 years of $1.9 trillion.  
   The second estimate put out by CBO was, if we froze all domestic spending for the next 10 years, that would give us a non-Social Security surplus of $1.8 trillion. Again, how realistic is that? Are we really going to freeze for the next 10 years all the spending on education? Are we going to freeze for the next 10 years all the spending on defense? Are we going to freeze for the next 10 years all the spending on law enforcement? Are we going to freeze for the next 10 years all the spending on parks in this country, roads, and highways? That is not a realistic projection. That is not an honest projection. 
   The third estimate put out by the Congressional Budget Office is if we adjusted for inflation each of the years going forward for the next 10 years. That resulted in a non-Social Security budget surplus of $838 billion. In order to evaluate how reasonable that forecast is, I think you have to look at what has happened the last 2 years. This Republican-controlled Congress has been increasing spending by higher than the rate of inflation, which would reduce this number even further. That means instead of a $1.9 trillion Social Security surplus that has been bandied about in the press, or a $1.8 trillion surplus over the next 10 years that has been discussed in some circles, we are much more likely to face a surplus over the next 10 years in the non-Social Security accounts of about $800 billion. That is reality, that is facing the most likely prospect, instead of the kind of dreamworld anticipations we have had in the first two scenarios. 
   In the proposal of Governor Bush and the Republican side over the next 10 years, he is proposing a tax cut of $1.3 trillion, when we only likely will have a non-Social Security surplus of $800 billion. That means Governor Bush would have to take $500 billion out of Social Security to pay for his tax cut scheme, a tax cut scheme that gives 60 percent of the benefit to the wealthiest 10 percent in this country. That is a dangerous plan for this Nation's economy. 
   Instead of further reducing the debt with this non-Social Security surplus, he would devote every penny of it to a tax cut disproportionately going to the wealthiest 10 percent in this country. That is a dangerous plan. 
   It is especially dangerous in light of what Chairman Greenspan has told us, which is that the highest priority ought to be to pay down the debt--not to have a massive tax cut scheme, not to have a massive new spending scheme, but to have our first priority being to pay down the debt. Goodness knows, our generation ran up this debt. We have a responsibility to pay it down. Not only do we have a moral obligation, but it is the best economic policy for this country. It will take pressure off interest rates. It will mean greater economic growth. It will mean we are preparing for the baby boom generation, which all of us know is coming. 
   I am a baby boomer; many of us are. We know there is a huge bulge in the population. When these baby boomers start to retire, they are going to put enormous pressure on Social Security spending, on Medicare spending, and we ought to get ready for that day. We ought to be responsible. The responsible thing to do is not to engage in some big new spending scheme, not to engage in some massive tax cut scheme, but to have a balanced approach, one that puts the priority on paying down this debt, one that puts a priority on strengthening Social Security, extending the solvency of Medicare, and also addressing certain high-priority domestic needs such as education and defense, which I think many of us in this Chamber believe needs to be strengthened. 
   I come from agriculture country. I come from a farm State. Agriculture needs attention. That is a domestic priority for many of us. 
   Finally, yes, we can have tax reduction as well, but we certainly shouldn't put that as the highest priority. We certainly should not take all of the non-Social Security surplus and devote it to that purpose. We absolutely must not take money out of Social Security to provide a tax cut. That is irresponsible. That is dangerous. That threatens our economic security and our economic expansion. 
   Over 5 years, the Bush tax cut plan is even more dramatic in terms of its effect on Social Security. I talked about a non-Social Security surplus over 10 years of just over $800 billion. Over 5 years, it is about $150 billion. Yet the Bush tax cut plan over 5 years approaches $500 billion. Let me say that again. Over the next 5 years, the most realistic projection of surpluses is just under $150 billion. Yet the Bush tax cut plan over 5 years is over $480 billion. Where is the difference coming from? It can only come from one place. That is the Social Security surplus. That is profoundly mistaken, profoundly wrong. That is exactly what we should not do in terms of the fiscal policy of this country. The last thing we should do is put this thing back in the old ditch of deficits and debt. 
   I end as I began. Chairman Greenspan has advised us that what we ought to do as the highest priority is pay down this debt--$5.6 trillion of total debt, $3.6 trillion of publicly held debt. Let us keep our eye on the ball. Let us put as our highest priority the paying down of this national debt. Our generation ran it up. We have an obligation to pay it down. 
   I thank the Chair and yield the floor.

   Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, during the recent congressional adjournment, I had many opportunities to meet with veterans across North Dakota and medical care professionals within the Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Fargo regarding issues relating to veterans medical care and the VA budget. 
   One concern raised repeatedly by veterans and VA health care professionals related to the lengthy waiting periods for service-connected, non-emergency speciality medical care. In many cases, the waiting period for a veteran between the initial consultation by a VA health care professional, and the scheduled appointment with a medical specialist was 6 to 10 months, and in some instances up to a year. 
   Last year, Mr. President, the Independent Budget For Fiscal Year 2000 prepared by the Disabled American Veterans, AMVETS, Veterans of Foreign Wars and Paralyzed Veterans of America, called attention to the specialized care concerns, particularly the impact of funding shortfalls on staffing to provide specialized medical services. The Independent Budget emphasized the need to provide adequate resources for veterans with speciality needs. More recently, surveys of VA medical facilities by the Disabled Veterans of America confirmed no significant improvement in waiting periods for medical care at VA facilities. 
   Mr. President, veterans requesting speciality care at a DVA medical facility are entitled to speciality care within a reasonable period of time. They should not be required to wait months and months for this essential medical care. In response to these speciality care concerns, and the recommendations in the Fiscal Year 2000 Independent Budget, I am introducing legislation to make certain that service-connected veterans requesting speciality care at VA facilities receive that care within a reasonable period of time. 
   Under this legislation, the VA would be required to automatically review a service-connected veteran's request for non-emergency speciality care if scheduling the appointment exceeds a three week period beyond the initial VA consultation. If an appointment for specialty care could not be provided at a veteran's VA facility in the local area, the VA would be required to provide the service-connected veteran with an appointment for care at another VA facility, or offer the veteran the opportunity for speciality care through a private physician in the veteran's home community. 
   Additionally, the VA would be required to report to Congress annually  on the waiting periods for various types of non-emergency speciality medical care for service-connected veterans, 
   especially on any critical problems and staffing shortages that contribute to these waiting periods. The report also requires the VA to include recommendations for addressing waiting periods, any staffing shortages, including special pay adjustments, or any other modifications in pay authority that might be necessary to retain and recruit speciality medical personnel. 
   Mr. President, I know that DVA officials and medical center personnel are very concerned about the waiting periods that veterans experience for certain speciality medical care. D.A. personnel are also acutely aware of speciality care staffing shortages. As reported in the Independent Budget for Fiscal Year 2000, it's critical that Congress provide the essential funding resources to ensure that these speciality care services are met promptly. I urge the Senate Committee on Veterans Affairs to conduct hearings on VA speciality care and to incorporate the recommendations in my legislation in appropriate veterans medical care legislation that will be considered by the Senate in FY 2001.

   Mr. CONRAD. I also appreciate the Senator's continued willingness to work with us. We will continue to work in good faith to develop a bill that can be passed by the Congress. 
   I want to be absolutely clear that it is not our intent or that of anyone in North Dakota to harm any of our neighbors. This legislation significantly reduces the amount of irrigated acreage from that authorized by current law and completely eliminates any irrigated acreage from this project in the Hudson River drainage. We have significantly increased the levels of review by both the State Department to ensure compliance with the Boundary Water Treaty and by EPA to ensure compliance with the Clean Water Act on any trans-basin diversion that might occur. There is no guarantee that such a diversion will actually occur. I also want to make it clear that we are willing to discuss the timing, amount, and source of any diversions to ensure that the legitimate needs of our neighboring Basin States are met. The Chairman's offer is helpful and I hope that with a full and frank discussion we will be able to fully resolve all concerns.

   Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss an important piece of legislation for my State of North Dakota. S. 623, the Dakota Water Resources Act, is legislation I introduced in the last Congress and early in this Congress to re-direct the existing Garrison Diversion project. This bill is designed to meet the contemporary water needs of the State of North Dakota, substantially reduce the cost of the project, and require compliance with environmental laws and our international treaty obligations with Canada. 
   North Dakota has significant water quality and water quantity needs that must be addressed. In many parts of my state, well water in rural communities resembles weak coffee or strong tea. It turns the laundry gray after the first wash, and in many places is unfit even for cattle to drink. This bill is designed to address those situations and help provide clean, reliable water to families and businesses across North Dakota. 
   This bill was favorably reported from the Senate Energy Committee earlier this year, after hearings were held in this Congress and in the previous Congress. During consideration in the Energy Committee, several amendments were adopted that reduced the cost of the bill by $140 million and strengthened environmental protections in the bill. I should also note that this bill reduces the cost of constructing the currently-authorized project by about $1 billion. 
   The bill is now pending on the Senate calendar, and was packaged with a group of other bills reported by the Energy Committee to be considered by this body. Unfortunately, when the Senate attempted to consider this legislation in recent days, objections to its consideration were registered by other Senators from another state who had concerns about the bill. In response, Senator Dorgan and I have worked with those Senators to address their concerns. We have engaged in those discussions in good faith, believing that if we continued to work with other states we would be able to address their concerns. 
   Unfortunately, those discussions have not yielded the results we were hoping for that would have allowed the bill to pass the Senate. Enacting this legislation will help my state overcome the tremendous water needs that are well documented, and I will continue to work in good faith with other Senators to pass this important bill. I am willing to address the concerns of other states, but it must be a two-way street. I look forward to our discussions under the auspices of the Energy Committee in February to resolve those issues. 
   I thank the Chair and yield the floor.

    Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise to address an oversight in the Employment Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) brought to my attention by a constituent of mine in Grand Forks, North Dakota. 
   On October 14, 1997, Betty Rambel disappeared. Two days later, the burnt-out shell of her car was found. Inside the trunk was an unrecognizable body. On October 24, 1997, using dental records, the body was identified as Betty. That day, her husband, Steve, was arrested for her murder. 
   Steve Rambel's trial took place in November of 1998, roughly a year ago. After a week-long trial the jury found him guilty of murder in the second degree, assault with a deadly weapon, and arson. Steve was sentenced to life in prison on March 5, 1999. 
   Even once is too often, yet this sort of situation occurs more frequently than that: people are killed by people they trust. We read the headlines, are bombarded with the lurid details, and our thoughts move to other matters when the killer is convicted and sentenced. However, for the other victims of these crimes--the family and friends of the victim--the nightmare drags on. In the midst of the shock, the anger, the inconsolable sorrow of their loss, these victims have to pick up the pieces of their lives and go through the business of getting back on their feet. I rise today to speak about the ``business'' of moving on. 
   With her sister gone and her brother-in-law in jail, Phyllis Marden assumed responsibility for the care of her minor niece and nephew. In the midst of settling her deceased sister's estate, Phyllis was notified that she was named as the second beneficiary to Betty's pension benefits. When coming to agreement with her sister's employer on the award of benefits, Ms. Marden was upset to find that, although it is prohibited by state law, under ERISA her sister's killer can lay future claim to her pension benefits. Justifiably disturbed by this oversight in federal law, Phyllis contacted my office. 
   ERISA preempts state laws that govern the award of pension benefits, even clear-cut rulings like those made against Steven Ramble. To correct this situation and others like it, we have drafted a bill which would waive the ERISA preemption in cases where a state's ``slayer statute'' applies to the application of benefits. This bill simply provides that individuals will not have access to ERISA benefits as a result of crimes they commit causing the death of pension plan participants. While many insurance plans already have language to this effect, ERISA does not. The aim of the bill is to codify the direction of the court in recent decisions of this issue and the Internal Revenue Service decision made on this matter in February 24, 1999, private letter ruling. 
   While no one thinks that killers should benefit from their victims' pension plans, some suggest that waiving the ERISA preemption in these cases might start us down a ``slippery slope,'' where we begin waiving the ERISA preemption to support and enforce social policy. They would prefer to deal with these matters on a case-by-case basis. I understand this line of reasoning; however, I strenuously disagree. I side with the Phyllis Mardens of America. 
   Individuals subjected to these tragic, uncommon circumstances have been through enough both emotionally and financially; they should not be responsible for added legal costs on a clear-cut issue. At a time like this, they should not be expected to realize that they need a lawyer familiar with the intricacies of ERISA. 
   I have alluded to the fact that not all lawyers are familiar with the available legal remedies to these problems; ERISA is notoriously complex. A bright line should be drawn that--without affecting the ERISA preemption on the whole--allows survivors of this specific sort of crime relief from further emotional and financial hardship at the hands of the perpetrator. I feel that this bill makes that sort of clear distinction. 
   A day does not pass that Betty is not on Phyllis's mind. Phyllis understands that this bill will not affect her situation--she is already paying her legal bills. However, she knows that someone else will have to go through the legal process she has been through. This bill will remove an obstacle from their path and get them on their way home.

   Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I would like the opportunity to respond to statements that have been made about the Dakota Water Resources Act over the last several days by the Senator from Missouri. Yesterday we were told that North Dakota is seeking somehow to steal water from our neighbors to the south. That is factually incorrect. It is untrue. We are not making any claim on anybody's water but our own. 
   Under the current law, North Dakota has a right to water flowing through the Missouri River. That is in the law today. In the law today there is authorized a very large water project for North Dakota called the Garrison Diversion Project. The reason it is authorized is because North Dakota accepted the permanent flood of 550,000 acres of the richest farmland in North Dakota--permanently inundated to provide flood protection to downstream States, including Missouri. We have saved billions of dollars of flood damage in those States because North Dakota has accepted this permanent flood of over half a million acres. That is the fact. 
   The new legislation before us is designed to substantially alter what is currently authorized in the law to reduce its costs by $1 billion to reduce dramatically the number of irrigated acres, and instead to have water supply projects for cities and towns that desperately need it. 
   The assertion has been made that this would somehow deplete the water going to Missouri. 
   The fact is, the flow of the Missouri River in Missouri is 50,000 CFS. We are talking about 100 CFS to meet the legitimate water needs of the State of North Dakota, water needs that are already recognized in the law. 
   Today, in order to respond to the legitimate concerns of the Senators from Missouri, we offered to go even further and to put into law an assurance that they would not lose water at their key navigation time, during this key period when they are concerned with losing even half an inch. That is what this translates into: A reduction of one half an inch, the water level of the Missouri River in the State of Missouri. We are prepared to assure them they don't even lose that half an inch. This is in response to the documented need for water that is so desperately required in my State. We have people who are turning on their tap right now in North Dakota and what comes out looks filthy. It looks filthy because it is filthy. 
   North Dakota was made a promise that, if you accept the permanent flood to provide flood protection for downstream States, we will compensate you by allowing you to improve the water supply for your citizens. That is what this bill is about. It is not designed in any way to hurt the State of Missouri. We are prepared to make changes in the legislation to make that clear. 
   Let me conclude by saying we received a letter today that totally confuses this project with the Devil's Lake outlet which is required to solve another problem in another part of the State. These two projects are not the same. We hope officials in Missouri will get it straightened out in their own minds that these are two totally distinct projects. An outlet from Devil's Lake has nothing whatever to do with the Dakota Water Resources Act Project. 
   I thank my colleagues for their patience, and I yield the floor.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, the amendment Senator GRASSLEY and I are offering is to set the negotiating objectives for agriculture for our trade negotiators at the next round of trade talks. I don't think anybody in this Chamber appreciates any more than the current occupant of the chair how serious the crisis in agriculture is in our part of the country. We have seen what I call a triple whammy to American agricultural producers: bad prices, bad weather, and bad policy. That triple whammy has threatened literally tens of thousands of farm families. 
   Certainly, in my State, where we had a special crisis team at USDA analyze the circumstances when the Secretary of Agriculture was coming to North Dakota a year ago, that team said that if something dramatic did not happen in the next 2 years, we would lose 30 percent--and perhaps more--of the farm families in North Dakota. That is how serious the circumstances are. 
   I will put up a couple of charts to demonstrate the problem we face. 
   The key determinant to farm income is farm prices. Farm prices, as this chart shows, are at a 53-year low in real terms. This chart depicts wheat and barley prices from 1946 to 1999, and it shows these prices in constant dollars. So we are comparing apples to apples. What one can see is that prices have had a long-term downward trend over this 53-year period, with one major interruption that occurred back in the 1970s. I think we all recall those times, when we saw a tremendous spike in virtually all commodity prices. But over the long term, when we compare on a fair basis, what we see is constantly declining prices, and we see now the lowest prices in 53 years in real terms. That is why we see so many serious concerns in farm country about what the future holds. 
   This chart represents a little different way of looking at what faces our producers because this looks at not only the prices farmers receive--that is the red line--but also what the farmers are paying for the inputs to produce their crops. This looks at over a 10-year period. One can see that the prices farmers are paying for their inputs have escalated rather dramatically during this 10-year period. That is not true about the prices farmers are receiving. Those prices peaked at the time we were discussing the last farm bill, in 1996. 
   It was very interesting that, at the time we were told farmers were going to have a remarkable situation--they were faced with what we were told at the time was permanently high farm prices because of export demand--those permanently high prices lasted about 90 days. That was just about the time we were passing the last farm bill. After that, prices collapsed and collapsed on a continuous basis. We have had nothing but one way for prices, and that is down, down, down. That is the reason we have seen a collapse of farm income. 
   This chart is another way of looking at what is happening. This shows a comparison of the prices farmers receive--the red line--to the cost of their production, which is the green line. This is for wheat. Wheat is the dominant commodity in my State. You can see the cost of production is about $5 a bushel. But ever since the last farm bill passed, we have been well below the cost of production. In fact, now we are down to about $2.50, $2.60, $2.70 a bushel, depending on the day and market conditions at the time--far below the cost of 
   production. This is what is undermining financial security for American producers. 
   It is not just wheat. If I had put up the chart on corn, or barley, or on virtually any commodity, one would see the same pattern. It is not just in crops; it is also in livestock. Last year, we saw hogs go down to 8 cents a  pound. It costs 40 cents a pound to produce a hog. So this combination of high input costs for farmers yet low prices for what they sell has put farmers in a cost/price squeeze. That squeeze is getting tighter and tighter. It is eliminating farm income. 
   That is why this next round of trade talks is so critically important because, very frankly, we have been playing a losing hand in agriculture. I think anybody who has really studied the matter understands that our chief competitors--the Europeans--are outspending us, outhustling us, and, as a result, they are winning markets all across the world that were once ours. 
   If we just pierce the veil here and look below the surface, I think what we see is very revealing. This shows what Europe has been doing in terms of agricultural support over the last 3 years; that is the red box. That is what Europe is spending per year, the average for the last 3 years. The blue box is what the United States is spending under the last farm bill. You can see that the disparity is enormous. The Europeans are spending $44 billion a year, on average; the United States, under the terms of the last farm bill, is spending $6 billion a year--a 7-to-1 disparity. 
   It is very hard to be successful or to have a level playing field when the opponents are outspending you 7-to-1. We would never permit this in a military confrontation. Why we permit it in a trade confrontation eludes me. It is a guaranteed path to disaster. That is precisely what has happened. 
   If we look at this in a somewhat different way, if we look at it in terms of export subsidy for agricultural commodities, and we look at various regions of the world, we see another interesting picture emerge. This shows in the last year for which we have full figures, 1996, who was doing what with respect to agricultural trade subsidy. There are our European friends again. They are the blue hunk of the pie; 83.5 percent of all world agricultural export subsidy belongs to the Europeans. Here is the U.S. share, at 1.4 percent, this little piece of the pie right here. 
   I know a lot of my colleagues think we are spending too much on agriculture. I hear it all the time from some of our colleagues from more urban areas. 
   I say to them that you have to look at what is happening in the rest of the world. You have to look at what our competitors are doing. If you look at what our competitors are doing, it is dramatic and it is clear. 
   Here are the Europeans. Nearly 84 percent of all world agricultural export subsidy is accounted for by the Europeans. The United States is 1.4 percent. 
   These aren't KENT CONRAD's figures. These aren't the figures from the Governor of North Dakota. These aren't figures from the agriculture commissioner of North Dakota. These are the statistics from the U.S. Department of Agriculture. They show Europe is outspending us on agricultural export subsidies by 60 to 1. How are you going to win a fight when you are outgunned 60 to 1? This is totally unfair to our farmers. They don't have a level playing field from which to compete. They have a playing field that is totally distorted. We have to change this playing field. We have to level it out. We have to make it possible for our farmers to compete fairly. 
   We are willing to compete against anybody at any time. But it is not fair to say to our farmers: You go out there and take on the French and German farmers, and while you are at it, take on the French and German Governments as well. That isn't a fair fight. 
   We shouldn't abandon our farmers to that kind of circumstance. But that is precisely what we have done because in the last farm bill we cut our support to producers in half. Under the previous farm bill, we were spending, on average, $10 billion a year to support our producers in the face of the competition from the Europeans who were spending $50 billion a year during that period. 
   What did we decide to do? Did we decide to level the playing field? No. We engaged in unilateral disarmament on the pretext that if we cut somehow we would set a good example for the Europeans and they would follow right along. 
   Guess what. We cut our support in half for agricultural producers under the new farm bill, down to $5 billion a year on average. What did the Europeans do? Did they follow suit? Did they take our ``good example''? I put that in quotes, our ``good example.'' No. The Europeans kept right on spending. 
   Do you know why? Because they have a strategy and they have a plan. Their strategy and plan is to dominate world agricultural trade. They are doing it the old-fashioned way. They are buying these markets. 
   I have spent a good deal of time talking to the European negotiators. What they have shared with me is as clear as it can be. They have said to me: Senator, we believe we are in a trade war with the United States on agriculture. We believe at some point there will be a cease-fire in this trade war. We believe there will be a cease-fire in place, and we want to occupy the high ground. The high ground in this contest is world market share. That is exactly the strategy and plan of our European friends. 
   They have said to me: You know, Senator, we have much higher levels of support in our country than you have in yours, and we believe in all of these negotiations instead of leveling the playing field, and instead of closing the gap, that we will be able to secure equal percentage reductions in the level of support on both sides. 
   If you think about it, they have much higher levels of support in Europe, as I have demonstrated, than we do in this 
   country. They seek to get equal percentage reductions from those unequal bases leaving Europe always on top. That is their strategy. That is their plan. Oh, how well it is working. 
   In the last trade talks, although the levels of support were dramatically uneven, was there any closing of the gap? Not at all, not any closing of the gap. They didn't come down. We didn't go up. Both of us did not engage in a pattern and practice that would narrow the differences. Instead, what they won were equal percentage reductions from those unequal bases maintaining European dominance. 
   If we let that happen again, shame on us, because we will be consigning our farmers to the dustbin of financial failure. There is no other way this can come out. That is going to be the absolute assured result if we come back with another failed negotiation. 
   Some people blame our negotiators. I personally do not. I blame us because we have sent unarmed negotiators to the negotiations. 
   In my previous job, mostly what I did was negotiate. One thing I learned very early on in my previous life was that you don't win in negotiation unless you have leverage. You have to have leverage in order to prevail in a negotiation. 
   Our negotiators have no leverage. What leverage do they conceivably have when we send them in there and the other side is outgunning us on export subsidies 60 to 1? How are they going to win a negotiation with that sort of fact? How are they going to win when Europe has 84 percent of the world's export subsidy and we have 1.4 percent? How are we possibly going to prevail in that kind of negotiating climate? I say there is very little chance that we are. 
   That is why I have introduced the FITEA bill, Farm Income and Trade Equity Act, to try to level the playing field, to rearm our negotiators to give us a chance to prevail in these negotiations. 
   That bill is gaining steam. It has gotten broad support in my own home State of North Dakota. I believe it is going to get even greater support around the country. 
   Earlier this week, I went to meet in Baltimore with the State presidents of the National Farmers Union. I gave them an outline of the FITEA plan. I hope they will endorse it. 
   The national rural electric service areas have before them at their regional meetings opportunities to endorse the FITEA plan. It has already been endorsed by eight or nine of the national rural electric service areas. 
   We have to give our negotiators leverage. But at the same time we have to also give them instructions. We have to tell them what their negotiating objectives are in this next round of trade talks. It is our responsibility. We can't leave it to the President. Certainly, it is his obligation as well. But Congress has a role to play. I believe we ought to take the opportunity to send a clear  message to our trade ambassador and her assistants as to what their negotiating objectives are with respect to agriculture. 
   That is what we have before us in the amendment offered on a bipartisan basis by Senator GRASSLEY of Iowa and myself. Senator GRASSLEY and I serve on both the Agriculture Committee and the Finance Committee. We have a special responsibility. We have taken it seriously. That is why we have come forward with a set of negotiating objectives for our trade ambassador in this next round of trade talks. 
   This amendment sets out seven principal negotiating objectives for agriculture: 
   No. 1, we should insist on the immediate elimination of all export subsidy programs worldwide. The elimination of all export subsidies worldwide should be the negotiating objective. 
   No. 2, we should insist that the European Union and others adopt domestic farm policies that force their producers to face world market prices at the margin so they do not produce more than is needed for their own domestic markets. 
   It is one thing for a country to adopt domestic policy that supports higher prices to meet domestic demand. It is quite another thing for them to have higher prices domestically and, therefore, develop greater production than they need for the domestic market and then dump that surplus on the world market at fire sale prices depressing prices for everyone. 
   Objective No. 2 is to insist that the E.U. and others adopt domestic farm policies that force their producers to face world prices at the margin. 
   No. 3, we should insist that State trading enterprises, such as the Canadian Wheat Board, are disciplined so that their actions are transparent and so they do not provide de facto export subsidies. 
   Sometimes we fool ourselves with our own rhetoric around here. We talk about free markets. Many are strong supporters of free markets. In agriculture, there are no free markets. We can see, through what the Europeans are doing and spending to buy these markets, that we are not dealing in a free-market circumstance in world agricultural trade. 
   We are certainly not dealing with it with respect to our neighbors to the north in Canada. There, individual farmers don't market their commodities; they have a wheat board that markets for them. A very significant portion of production goes to the wheat board, and they market on behalf of all of their farmers. Does anyone think that gives them all kinds of opportunities to play games in world markets? Absolutely, because the prices they charge are not transparent. Anyone can learn our prices any minute of any day by going to the Chicago Board of Trade and seeing what commodities are selling for. Try to find out what our friends to the north are selling for. They don't have a transparent market. They are not advertising their prices, except to the major buyers in the world. The few times we have a glimpse of what they are doing, we find they go to buyers before other countries and say: Whatever the United States is selling for, we are selling for 5 cents less a bushel. That is what they are doing in order to take markets that have traditionally been ours. We have to wake up and smell the coffee. 
   No. 4, we should insist on the use of sound science when it comes to sanitary and phytosanitary restrictions. Too often, these are hidden protectionist trade barriers. On genetically modified organisms, we should insist foreign markets be open to our products, but obviously we can't force consumers to buy what 
   they don't want. We have to give consumers the ability to make an informed choice on whether they want to buy these products without letting inflammatory labels be used as hidden trade barriers. 
   No. 5, we should insist our trading partners immediately reduce their tariffs on our agricultural exports to levels no higher than ours, and then further reduce these barriers on a cooperative and comprehensive basis. 
   No. 6, we should seek cooperative agricultural policies to avoid price-depressing surpluses or food shortages. My own long-term view for agriculture is, we desperately need to have among the major producers a common set-aside policy, a common conservation reserve policy, and a common food reserve policy. 
   No. 7, we should strengthen disputes settlement and enforce existing commitments. The United States honors its international obligations, but all too often our trading partners refuse to live up to their commitments and use the dispute settlement process to delay our efforts to call them to account. That is totally unacceptable, and we need to send that message very clearly. 
   These are the seven principles we believe we should send as an instruction to our trade ambassador. We should say very clearly that we believe these are the things they need to accomplish in this next round of trade talks. I also think we should say: Don't bring back under any circumstances equal percentage reductions in support from these unequal bases. Don't do that. That way lies permanent inferiority in the position of world agricultural trade. If we want to fritter away our long-term dominance, that is the path for such a result. 
   I urge my colleagues to give very careful consideration to this amendment. Senator GRASSLEY and I have worked in a bipartisan way in consultation with other colleagues. We believe these are the appropriate negotiating objectives for our trade representatives in the agricultural sector. 
   Let me end where I began. American agriculture is in crisis. We desperately need a victory in the next round of trade talks, and we need it soon. Our farmers simply cannot survive year after year in a circumstance in which our major competition outspends us 7-1 on domestic support and 60-1 on export subsidies. 
   I believe our farmers can compete against any producer anywhere in the world but they have to have a level playing field. They have to have a country that is fighting for them when our chief competitors are fighting for their producers at every set of trade talks. 
   I hope very much our colleagues will support this amendment that lays out clear negotiating objectives for our trade representatives in this next round of trade talks. I believe this amendment is a first step in that process. I urge my colleagues to support it. I welcome cosponsorship, as I know Senator GRASSLEY would, from other Members who are concerned about these issues. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. CONRAD. That is not correct from our standpoint because our understanding was we were going to get 10 minutes on our side. As the Chair has stated it, it would be 10 minutes total debate on our amendment. So if you could just amend that unanimous consent request to be that on amendment No. 2359, there be up to 10 minutes on a side--and we will endeavor not to use that full time--it would be fully agreeable.

   Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to give full consideration to this amendment. I consider this a fairness amendment because this amendment, which would extend trade adjustment assistance to farmers, says we ought to be giving them the protection we already give other folks who work for a living. 
   Right now we have trade adjustment assistance on the books. It is law. If you are working on a job, and you lose your job because of a flood of unfairly traded imports, you have a chance to get back on your feet. But farmers are left out. Farmers are excluded because farmers do not lose their job when they are faced with a flood of unfairly traded imports. Instead, they are faced with a dramatic drop in income. 
   Instead, I would like to run through a number of charts that show the conditions facing American farmers today. 
   This shows what has happened to prices over the last 53 years. These are wheat and barley prices. These are in real terms, inflation adjusted, constant dollars. We have the lowest prices in 53 years. One reason is a flood of unfairly traded Canadian imports. 
   This is the result. This chart shows what the cost of production is. That is the green line. The red line shows what prices for wheat have been over the last 3 years. 
   Colleagues, wheat prices are far below the cost of production and have been for over 3 years, again partly because of a flood of Canadian imports unfairly traded. 
   The question is, Are we going to help farmers the same way we help other workers who are faced with this condition? I hope we say yes. I hope we recognize that it is simple fairness to extend the same protection to farmers we extend to other folks who are working for a living in this country. 
   This amendment is carefully crafted. It is limited to $10,000 per farmer per year with an overall cap cost of $100 million that is fully and completely paid for. We have an offset. 
   Interestingly, it is one of those rare circumstances where our offset is supported by the industry that would be paying. We have an offset that affects the real estate investment trust. It is supported by the real estate industry. They are willing to pay a little something more to get what they consider is a fair result. It is the same provision that was in the President's tax bill. It is the same provision that has had support on other matters before the Senate but not included in any final packages. 
   This matter is completely and fully offset. It simply allows that in a circumstance where the price of a commodity has dropped by over 20 percent as certified by the Secretary of Agriculture and where imports contributed importantly to this price drop, farmers will then be eligible for trade adjustment assistance. 
   This is the same standard the Department of Labor uses to determine whether workers are eligible for trade adjustment assistance when they lose their jobs. In order to be eligible, farmers would have to demonstrate their net farm income has declined from the previous year, and they would need to meet with the Extension Service to plan how to adjust the import competition. 
   If all of those conditions are met, training and employment benefits available to workers would then be available to farmers as an option. 
   My colleague, Senator GRASSLEY, is the cosponsor of this amendment and has played a key role in its development. I know he has words he would like to say about this measure as well.

   Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I thank the chairman and ranking member for their support of the amendment. We appreciate it very much. 
   I think this amendment is a matter of fairness. I deeply appreciate the response today. I hope this will prevail through the conference. I have the utmost confidence in the chairman's ability to persuade our colleagues over on the House side of the merits of this amendment. 
   I again thank the chairman. I thank our ranking member, who all along has recognized that this is a logical extension of trade adjustment assistance we provide other workers in our economy. 
   I thank also my cosponsor, Senator GRASSLEY from Iowa. He and I have worked together closely not only on this amendment but many other matters as well. I thank him very much for his leadership and support. 
   I thank the Chair.

   Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise to discuss the trade bill which is before us, and to register some disappointment with the path the leader has chosen to pursue because at this point the leader has indicated that he is not going to permit amendments to this trade bill. He has brought the bill to the floor, but he has what we call around here ``filled the tree.''  
   I am certain people who are listening to this out across the country must wonder what this language we use around here means. Very simply, it means the Republican leader has constructed this bill and amendments to the bill that preclude other Senators from offering amendments to this legislation. I regret that. I think it is a mistake. 
   One of the reasons we are bogged down around here is because the leader keeps doing this and keeps bringing up bills and keeps filling the tree. He keeps filing cloture and doesn't let the Senate legislate. I understand from time to time that may be necessary to move business in the Senate. But I think it has now happened so frequently that it is actually stopping business in the Senate. I believe that is a mistake. 
   Hopefully, this will change and we will be given an opportunity to offer amendments. I have several amendments that I believe should be considered by the body on this legislation. They are directly relevant to trade. In fact, I can't think of amendments any more relevant than the amendments I would like to offer. 
   The first amendment I would like considered is one to give direction to our trade negotiators as they go into the WTO Round in Seattle next month. We are just weeks away from our negotiators going into talks with all of the other countries that are involved in these discussions. We have not taken the opportunity to give direction to our trade negotiators on the policies they ought to pursue in these talks. 
   I believe it is very important that we set out what the goals should be. What should we ask our negotiators to have as their negotiating priorities? 
   I also would like to offer an amendment that would give trade adjustment assistance to farmers because right now they are left out. If they are adversely affected by a trade agreement that we reach, tough luck. They are left out. They are not helped. They ought to be included. Certainly, there ought to be restrictions as to how it would apply. But trade adjustment assistance ought to be provided for farmers. That is an amendment that I would like to offer to this bill. Right now I am precluded from doing so because, as I indicated, the Republican leader is denying other Senators the opportunity to present amendments. 
   I am willing to live by the will of this body. I am willing to offer an amendment and have votes taken. If I win, I win. If I lose, I lose. But I would at least like to have the opportunity to see where the will of the Senate lies on these questions. What are the negotiating instructions we give to our delegation to the WTO talks? Should farmers be included in trade adjustment assistance just as every other worker in this country is eligible? I believe the answer to those questions is a firm yes. 
   Let me first indicate that the reason I believe it is so critically important that we give instructions to our negotiators with respect to agriculture and what they do in terms of pursuing an agricultural policy in the WTO talks is because we are getting skunked in these discussions. 
   We have been getting skunked and skunked repeatedly in these international trade talks. 
   Not so long ago I was visiting with the chief negotiator for the Europeans who told me: Senator, we believe we are in a trade war with the United States on agriculture. We believe at some point there will be a cease-fire in this conflict and we want to occupy the high ground. The high ground is world market share. Our European friends have engaged in a strategy and a plan to dominate world market share in agriculture. They have succeeded brilliantly. They have gone from being the largest importing region in the world to being one of the largest exporting regions in 20 years. They have done it the old-fashioned way: They have done it by buying these markets. They have spent, and spent profusely, in order to win this world agricultural trade battle. 
   Over the last 3 years, they have averaged $44 billion a year in support for producers versus our $6 billion. They have been outspending America 7 to 1 in terms of support for producers over the last 3 years. That is part of their strategy. That is part of their plan. They want to go out and buy these markets. The way they have done it is very interesting. They have developed a structure of agricultural support that pays their producers more within European boundaries to produce the same crops we produce, and then they take the surplus production that results and sell it for fire sale prices on the international market, driving prices down for them, driving down prices for us, driving down prices for everyone. That is also part of their strategy as they increase their market share--again, with the notion they are going to be in a position when a cease-fire is declared in this trade conflict to extract concessions. Oh, how well that strategy and plan has been working. 
   Their level of support is much higher than ours--3 times as high in some measures, 7 times as high under total support measurement, 60 times as high looking at world agricultural trade subsidy--and we are being outgunned. How do we win a fight when we are being outgunned on world agricultural export subsidy by 60 to 1? That is what the latest figures reveal. Europe accounts for almost 84 percent of all world agricultural trade subsidy; 84 percent. The United States, 1.4 percent. They are providing 60 times as much to go out and buy these markets as we are doing. Not surprisingly, they are winning. 
   Their trade negotiator said: Senator, we have a higher level of support than you do. In the last trade talks, instead of closing the gap, they were able to get equal percentage reductions from these unequal levels of support. Again, that is part of their strategy and plan. They don't want to see this gap closed. They don't want to see the United States go up and theirs go down. They don't want to see any movement in this relationship where they are now dominant. Instead, they want to secure equal percentage reductions from these unequal levels. 
   If they are able to do that, they will push us closer and closer to the brink of losing tens of thousands of farm families all across this country. That is why I believe it is critically important we offer negotiating objectives for agriculture to our delegation that will begin with the WTO Round in November. 
   If I were able to offer the amendment, I would offer the following negotiating objectives. The amendment I have crafted, and it is cosponsored by Senator GRASSLEY of Iowa, lays out seven principal negotiating objectives for agriculture: 
   No. 1, we should insist on the immediate elimination of all export subsidy programs worldwide. Export subsidies only depress world market prices. I think this is something we could agree on in the Senate. It is not in our interests to have world agricultural export subsidies. It is certainly not in our interests when the Europeans are outspending the United States in this regard 60 to 1. 
   No. 2, we should insist that the European Union and others 
   adopt domestic farm policies that force their producers to face world prices at the margin so they do not produce more than is needed for their domestic markets. Every economist I have spoken to has told me that is something that makes sense to them, that every country ought to face world market prices at the margin. It is one thing for countries to adopt domestic food security policies to ensure they can feed themselves; it is entirely another matter to subsidize excess production and then dump this surplus on the world market, depressing prices for everyone else. 
   No. 3, we should insist that the State trading enterprises, such as the Canadian Wheat Board, are disciplined so their actions are transparent and they do not provide de facto export subsidies. 
   No. 4, we should insist on the use of sound science when it comes to sanitary and phytosanitary restrictions. Too often these are used as hidden protectionist trade barriers. On genetically modified organisms--which is a very hot issue in Europe--we should insist that foreign markets be open to our products, but we should also recognize we can't force consumers to buy what they don't want. We have to give consumers the ability to make an informed choice on whether they want to buy these products without letting inflammatory labels be used as hidden trade barriers. 
   No. 5, we should insist that our trading partners immediately reduce their tariffs on our agricultural exports to  levels that are no higher than ours and then further reduce these barriers. 
   No. 6, we should seek cooperative agricultural policies to avoid price-depressing surpluses or food shortages. 
   No. 7, we should strengthen dispute settlement and enforce existing commitments. We honor our commitments. All too often, other countries that are party to these agreements fail to follow what they have pledged to do. 
   I think these are seven commonsense negotiating objectives we ought to lay out for our delegation to the WTO talks. I hope at some point we are able to offer that amendment. 
   I have indicated I want to offer an amendment allowing our farmers to qualify for trade adjustment assistance. The amendment I want to offer--and again, this is cosponsored by Senator GRASSLEY--makes farmers eligible for trade adjustment assistance similar to what is provided to other workers in other industries who suffer as a result of unfair imports. When imports cause layoffs in manufacturing industries, workers are eligible for trade adjustment assistance. But when imports cause the same kind of problem to farmers, they are not eligible because the test is job loss. 
   Of course, farmers don't work for a paycheck, they get their living by selling the commodities they produce. When they are faced with a circumstance in which they are unfairly impacted by trade imports, they lose their income but not their job. So when it comes to trade adjustment assistance, they are out of luck. They don't qualify for trade adjustment assistance. Farmers lose their income, and there is nothing to help them. In fact, this may be something we do to them ourselves. We may negotiate away certain sectors of our industry as we did in the so-called Canadian Free Trade Agreement. Yet we come back and do absolutely nothing for the sector of our economy that was traded away--in this case, farmers. 
   We have a case in my State where certain loopholes were negotiated in the Canadian Free Trade Agreement that allow Canadians to flood our market with Canadian durum. 
   We can't send a bushel north, and yet there is nothing to help our farmers who were basically sold out in that negotiation. There is not one thing to be done to help them. We have lost hundreds of millions of dollars a year, and nothing is being done to provide assistance to those farmers. The least we could do is provide trade adjustments as we do for every other industry. 
   That is why I believe we must act on an amendment such as the one Senator GRASSLEY and I have crafted. Trade adjustment assistance for farmers can not only provide badly needed cash assistance to a devastated agricultural economy; it can reignite support for trade among many family farmers. 
   The Conrad-Grassley amendment would assist farmers who lost income because of unfair imports. Farmers would get a payment to compensate them for some, but not all, of the income they lose if increased imports affect commodity prices. The maximum any farmer would receive in any one year is $10,000, and the maximum cost of this amendment would be $100 million a year. 
   Under our amendment, the Secretary of Agriculture would decide whether the price of a commodity has dropped more than 20 percent and whether imports contributed importantly to this price drop. The ``imports contributed importantly'' standard is the same standard the Department of Labor uses to determine whether workers are eligible for trade adjustment assistance when they lose their jobs. 
   In order to be eligible for benefits under this program, farmers would have to demonstrate their net farm income has declined from the previous years. This was a criticism leveled at the amendment in the Finance Committee, and we have added this provision to try to respond to that criticism. 
   Farmers would also need to meet with the USDA's Extension Service to plan how to adjust to the import competition. This adjustment could take the form of improving the efficiency of the operation or switching to different crops. 
   Training and employment benefits available to workers under trade adjustment assistance would also be available to farmers as an option. In most years, the program would have a very modest cost because very few commodities, if any, would be eligible. But in a year comparable to last year, when hog prices collapsed and wheat prices tumbled, the program would offer modest support to compensate farmers for the harmful effect of imports. 
   These are two amendments that I believe are totally relevant to the bill before us. One of these amendments I offered in the Finance Committee to this very bill. Now this legislation is on the floor and we are precluded from offering an amendment here. Again, I hope the leader will relent. I hope he will open it up so those of us who have serious amendments, amendments that deserve consideration, can at least get an up-or-down vote. 
   The second amendment I discussed, dealing with WTO negotiating objectives, I also think is directly relevant. Frankly, we are not going to have another chance to give instructions to our delegation before they go to the WTO Round. Before they commence these trade talks, we ought to have an opportunity to give negotiating guidelines to our negotiators. That is part of our responsibility, part of our role. If we do not have a chance here, we are not going to have a chance. 
   Finally, I have a third amendment on agricultural sanctions that I would hope could be considered. 
   I very much hope before this is done we will have a chance to offer amendments, amendments that are serious, that are relevant to trade, so our colleagues may pass judgment on them, so we may consider and vote on them. 
   I yield the floor.

    Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the achievements of a true public servant, a fellow North Dakotan, and a man I am proud to call my friend. 
   Wally Beyer has served this nation as Administrator of the Rural Utilities Service, the former Rural Electric Administration, for 6 years now. 
   Wally is the 12th administrator of the agency originally created by Franklin Roosevelt; an agency that has developed as we've developed as a nation: from providing basic electric and telecommunications needs for America's rural areas, to making sure rural America takes its rightful place in the new communication age. 
   Wally has helped steer the RUS toward not only providing the critical continuing need for clean water and waste water facilities, but into new territory of critical distance-learning and medical links for areas that otherwise might not have access to these important services. 
   Since he was first nominated by President Clinton and confirmed by the Senate in late 1993, Wally's steady hand, professional skill and patience has served our Nation well. 
   Whether it was to guide the refinancing of electric borrowers through the high interest years of the 1970's and 80's, or to lead the modernization and stream-lining of rules and regulations at the RUA, Wally Beyer managed the agency with a careful balancing of the needs of rural America and the needs of the American taxpayer. 
   Wally Beyer has served this nation well. As a crew chief for the U.S. Air Force air rescue squadron in the Caribbean in the 50's, as an engineer for the Verendrye Electric Cooperative bringing electricity to north central North Dakota, and as head of the reinvigorated RUS. 
   Wally plans to return to our native North Dakota, along with his wife Pat. With three married children and three growing grandchildren, he says he will stay active and involved in public service. Washington's loss will be North Dakota's gain as Wally Beyer returns home to the land we both love. 
   In a recent speech announcing those plans, Wally said, ``My season has come. I feel good about it. I've got to get back to North Dakota where the air is sweet. You won't miss me when I'm gone.'' 
   Well Wally. Your legacy at the RUS is in tact, and thanks to your hard work is, as you said, ``humming along.'' 
   But you are wrong to say you won't be missed. Your selfless service to the public good will be missed by many, who will have to continue the restructuring of the electric utility industry without your sure hand. 
   You will be missed by those electric consumers in 46 States that were well aware that you, as a rural resident, understood their needs. 
   And you will be missed by those who relied on your friendship and good judgement when seeking to solve the long term problems continuing to plague rural America. 
   So, as you take your leave, I know my colleagues in the Senate join me in wishing you and your family the very best in what ever path you choose. 
   You have made a lasting impact and a worthwhile contribution to your country. Wally Beyer, you have made a difference and we are all better for it. Thank you, Mr. Administrator.

   Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise this morning to respond to a series of ads that are being run in my State by the National Republican Congressional Campaign Committee. These ads are false. They are what can only be charitably termed misleading, and they diminish the credibility of the National Republican Congressional Campaign Committee. 
   That is not just my conclusion, Mr. President. That is the conclusion of the major newspaper of my State, the Fargo Forum, which has written an editorial in which it says:  
   Politics is often a down and dirty business, but the National Republican Congressional Campaign Committee's early TV ads 13 months before the election, and even before State Republicans have an endorsed congressional candidate, are a new low in the campaign gutter. They're false on every level. Decent North Dakota Republicans should tell the national group to clean up its act.  
   Well, amen to that because the National Republican Congressional Campaign Committee ought to be ashamed of the ads they are running in North Dakota. They are claiming that Democrats are raiding the Social Security trust fund here in Washington. They must have forgotten they are in control in the House of Representatives and they are in control in the Senate. It is not Democrats who are determining the spending priorities in the House of Representatives. The Republicans are in control. They are deciding the budget outcome in the House of Representatives. If ever there was a case of the pot calling the kettle black, this is it because we know that the majority party themselves are, in fact, raiding Social Security. 
   That is not just the conclusion of the senior Senator from North Dakota. That is the conclusion of the Washington Post which had a major news story with the headline ``GOP Spending Bills Tap Social Security Surplus.'' It is the Republican Party's plan that is tapping the Social Security surplus. 
   For them to then run ads claiming the Democrats are doing it is just a giant diversionary tactic. They are trying to avoid responsibility for what they are doing. It is not only the Washington Post that has made this point. We also have the Congressional Budget Office. The Congressional Budget Office, which they control, has sent a letter which says very clearly that the Republican spending plans have tapped Social Security for $18 billion. In other words, they are raiding the Social Security accounts for $18 billion. That is their plan, that is their responsibility, and to avoid accountability apparently they have decided, or their campaign consultants have decided, that the best defense is an offensive attack. 
   So in my State of North Dakota, 13 months before the election, they are running ads that the major newspaper in my State says are ``a new low in the campaign gutter. They are false on  every level.'' And, indeed, they are. They are false on every level. The people of America who are being subjected to these ads ought to know exactly what is going on and who is doing what with respect to the budget of the United States. 
   One of the things I find most ironic is that the National Republican Congressional Campaign Committee which is sponsoring these ads are the very same folks who sponsored a constitutional amendment a number of years ago that had as its base that they would raid the Social Security trust fund in order to balance the budget. These folks who trumpeted this constitutional amendment to balance the budget had as a definition of a balanced budget the raiding of the Social Security trust fund. 
   Now they have the chutzpah to come before the American people and run ads saying the Democrats are raiding the Social Security trust fund surplus. And the Democrats are not in control. We don't control the U.S. House of Representatives. We don't control the Senate. 
   Again, the major newspaper in my State has called these ads false on every level. 
   Maybe it is helpful to review the record of who has done what with respect to budget policy. 
   I am on the Budget Committee. I am on the Finance Committee. I am known in the Budget Committee as the ``deficit hawk.'' 
   I have been involved in every effort to get our fiscal house in order. I believe deeply in the need for fiscal discipline. That is primarily why I ran for the Senate. I saw back when I ran in 1986 that things were running amuck; that the deficits were growing; that we were getting deeper in debt, and this country was in real trouble. I believed then and I believe now that it is threatening the national security of the United States. 
   If we go back and review the record of the Reagan years, he inherited a deficit of about $80 billion. Very quickly, under Reaganomics the deficit exploded up to over $200 billion a year. In fact, during this time we tripled the national debt. This trickle-down economics was a disaster. 
   Then we saw in the Bush years, again, the deficit took off like a scalded cat. It went from $150 billion a year up to $290 billion a year. 
   That is the record of our friends on the other side of the aisle. They were in charge. They were in control. Reaganomics was carrying the day. 
   We saw headline after headline about how the Republicans in the House and the Senate in conjunction with boll weevil Democrats were passing Reaganomics and Reaganomics exploded the deficit and exploded the debt. That is the record. 
   When the Clinton administration came in in 1992, we passed a plan in 1993 that reduced the deficit--a 5-year budget plan. We can go back and check the record. It is not a matter of running television ads. It is a matter of fact. Facts are very clear. 
   The deficit under that 5-year plan declined each and every year. The deficit went down from $290 billion in the last year of the Bush administration to $255 billion. And each year that deficit was reduced in the 5 years of that budget plan. 
   By the way, we passed that budget plan without a single Republican vote--not one, not one. In 1997, we agreed on a bipartisan plan to finish the job. 
   There I commend our colleagues on the other side of the aisle because we did join together in 1997 for a balanced budget plan to finish the job. But the truth is most of the heavy lifting had been done by the 1993 plan. But we didn't have a single Republican vote--not one. 
   I heard another ad this morning, this time attacking Bill Bradley and AL GORE. This was run by some committee called the National Republican Council. I never heard of it. But they were running ads attacking Bill Bradley and AL GORE saying they had voted for increased spending and increased taxes. 
   Do you know they were here and they were fighting for the 1993 plan that eliminated this deficit? That is the fact. The fact is Federal spending in real terms, as measured as a 
   percentage of our national income, is at its lowest level since 1974. Back in 1993 when we passed that plan, Federal spending was 22 percent of our national income. It is now down to 19 percent of our national income. 
   So the truth about Mr. Bradley, who voted for that 1993 plan, and the truth about Mr. GORE, who was Vice President and argued for that 1993 plan, is that in real terms they supported a reduction in Federal spending. That is the truth. That is the truth of the matter. 
   But I guess political consultants don't have to worry about the truth. They are more interested in scoring rhetorical points. They don't have to worry apparently about the factual record. 
   Let's look at the factual record. Here is the history going back 20 years in Federal receipts and Federal outlays. 
   The blue line shows expenditures of the Federal Government. The red line is the income of the Federal Government, the receipts. You can see during the Reagan years there was an enormous gap between the two. That is why we had these budget deficits because we were spending more than we were taking in. 
   In 1993, right here when we passed the plan, again, without a single Republican vote, that cut spending. You can see the blue line--the spending line--is coming down, and it raised revenue. Yes, it did. We raised taxes on the wealthiest 1 percent in this country; raised income taxes on the wealthiest 1 percent. And it was that combination of cutting spending and raising revenue that eliminated the deficit. 
   That is how we balanced the budget. Thank God we did. Thank God there was a Bill Bradley who was courageous enough to stand on this floor and cast a tough vote to get our fiscal house in order. Thank God there was an AL GORE as Vice President of the United States who had the courage to stand up and support a plan to get our fiscal house in order after the disasters of the Reagan and Bush administrations when it was all talk about fiscal responsibility and it was all deficits and debt. That is their legacy. 
   If we want to debate, I am ready to debate this anytime anywhere with anyone about what happened and when and what the results have been. But they have these smear ads running in my State and smear ads running nationally that distort the truth. 
   That is going to get a response because we are not going to allow people to tell falsehoods about what occurred. Too many people took real risks in order to get the fiscal house of our country back in order, and the record is abundantly clear about who did what. 
   This is the reality. In 1993, a 5-year budget plan was passed that worked, that cut spending in real terms, that raised revenue, and that balanced the budget. The result is a dramatically strengthened economy--the longest record of economic expansion in our history, and an economic performance that is the envy of the world. 
   The inflation rate is the lowest in 33 years. Here we went. In 1993, the plan was passed. Inflation came down. The unemployment rate is the lowest in 41 years. The central reason was the budget plan that was passed in 1993 that moved us toward a balanced budget and towards fiscal discipline to getting our fiscal house in order. 
   Debt held by the public is coming down dramatically. In 1993, the first year of the plan, publicly held debt in comparison with our gross domestic product was 50 percent. If we stay on the course that we have set now, we will have this debt down to 9 percent of our gross domestic product in 2009. We can eliminate publicly held debt in 15 years. 
   That is the course we are on. That is the course the Democrats established. That is the course which is the result of the 1993 plan that brought fiscal discipline back to this government and led to an incredible economic expansion. 
   Welfare caseloads: Another benefit of getting our fiscal house in order. 
   This is also not only a result of a good economy, but it is also a result of welfare reform, which in fairness I should say was done on a bipartisan basis. We had help from our Republican friends, and many of us felt strongly that welfare reform was required, and, indeed, it has produced incredibly positive results. Welfare caseloads are the lowest they have been in 29 years. 
   Republicans, this year, have engaged the Congress in a series of what I can  only call sort of baffling gimmicks, 
   in order to try to make it look to the American people that they are not raiding Social Security. 
   They are running ads that the major newspaper in my State has described as ``a new low in the campaign gutter. They are false on every level.'' That is what the Republican Congressional Campaign Committee is instituting in my State. The facts show something quite different. 
   The Congressional Budget Office says the non-Social Security surplus for the year we are working on, fiscal year 2000, is $14 billion. What does that mean? That means if we take out the Social Security surplus, we have $14 billion of what I call a true surplus in fiscal year 2000. If we take the House and Senate committee actions to date, the Budget Committee directives to CBO spent $18 billion of that. 
   Emergency spending: The Republicans have labeled a whole series of spending initiatives ``emergencies'' to avoid the requirements of fiscal discipline--$13 billion is declared emergencies, including the census. The census is provided for in the U.S. Constitution. We have been instituting the census for 200 years in this country, and they declare it an emergency. They declared the low-income heating program in this country an emergency--a program we have had for 24 years. That is absolutely nonsense. 
   Social Security administrative costs: They have taken those and don't want to count them, debt service costs and others. Add this up, and they are into Social Security by $21 billion. They are raiding Social Security by $21 billion and are trying to hide the raid by running television ads that some clever campaign consultant told them is their best strategy for avoiding their own responsibility. To try to avoid their own accountability, they are claiming the Democrats are instituting it. The problem with that: Democrats are not in control. Republicans are in control, and this is what they are instituting. They are raiding Social Security. The record is abundantly clear. 
   One of the last times I came to the floor was when the Republicans came up with the gimmick--and they have come up with a whole series of them to try to avoid the charge that they are instituting precisely what they claim Democrats are instituting--of having a 13th month. They came up with kind of a clever idea to get around the problem by declaring a 13th month in this country. The last time I checked the calendar, there were only 12 months. But the Republicans decided they would come up with a 13th month to make it look as though they were not raiding the Social Security trust fund surplus. That is a novel idea. I came to the floor and wondered, what would they call it? ``Spend-tember''? Would they call it ``Fictionary''? What would we call a 13th month? 
   Why stop there? Why not have 14 or 15 months? What would be the additional month that would be added? Would we have two Augusts or two Decembers? I favored two Octobers because I enjoy baseball; we could have two World Series. Maybe we could have two Decembers so we could celebrate Christmas twice. 
   I know it sounds far fetched, but this is the headline in the Washington Post: ``GOP Seeks to Ease Crunch with 13-Month Fiscal Year.'' That is the length to which they go to avoid accountability and responsibility. That is what happened. 
   That is not the only gimmick they came up with. They got the 13th month. They have the census emergency--the census we have been instituting for 200 years they claim is an emergency. 
   They declared LIHEAP an emergency, the low-income heating program. We have had that program for 24 years. They proposed delaying earned-income tax credit payments to people. They were even chastised by their own leading Presidential candidate. He made it very clear they were way out of tune with the American people when they proposed that gimmick. 
   That is what is going on to cover this mismanagement and to cover this fiscal irresponsibility. The National Republican Congressional Campaign Committee is running television ads in my State claiming Democrats are raiding Social Security. That dog doesn't hunt. That is not going to fly. We are going to respond very forcefully when people try to misrepresent the record. 
   As I began, I conclude: The major newspaper in my State called these ads ``a new low in the campaign gutter. They are false on every level.'' 
   That is the truth. I hope the National Republican Congressional Campaign Committee will stop running these ads because they are false. They are irresponsible. They are misleading. They ought to be stopped. That is the record. That is the fact. I hope people, as they evaluate candidates in this next election, will inquire: What is the record of candidates on the question of spending Social Security surpluses, on raiding Social Security trust funds? 
   I am prepared to answer that question. Every budget plan I have offered, every budget plan Senate Democrats have offered, has maintained the Social Security surplus. We haven't touched the Social Security surplus. We wouldn't engage in a raid of the Social Security surplus. That is true of the plan Senate Democrats offered in the Finance Committee. That is true of the plan Senate Democrats offered in the Budget Committee. For anyone to say anything else is an absolute falsehood. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, it is with great sadness I rise to mourn the passing of Senator John Chafee. Senator Chafee was much more than a colleague to me. Senator Chafee was a very close friend as well. The Senate has lost a giant, and I assuredly have lost a friend. 
   John Chafee will go down in history as one of the best U.S. Senators to ever grace this Chamber. Senator Chafee was one of those rare people who was able to rise above partisanship and work constructively with others on both sides of the aisle to achieve important things for the American people. 
   John Chafee always had a smile, he always had a feeling of the possible, and even in the darkest times when it seemed as if there was no way to bring people together in this Chamber, John Chafee had the confidence that if we just reached out, if we were rational and reasonable and talked to each other, we could accomplish great things. That was the spirit of John Chafee, and it will be in this Chamber long after he has left us. 
   I look at his desk now and I see the bouquet of flowers there. What a fitting tribute to John Chafee because he graced any room he entered. That is the way I remember John. When I learned yesterday that he had died, I was thinking of my last encounter with John, which was on the floor last Thursday. I was exiting the Chamber with a group of Senators. I walked past him and he said: Hey, don't you talk to me anymore? Because I hadn't exchanged our usual greeting. 
   I came back and I reached out to him. We shook hands, had a brief conversation, and I told him: John, you know I'll always talk to you. We had a little conversation about what was occurring in the Senate and what might be done to improve things. That was John Chafee. That was quintessential John Chafee. How are we going to make things better? 
   He never spent a lot of time ruminating and worrying. Instead, he spent time figuring out how we were going to make things better. That is what I so admired about John Chafee, that and his basic human decency. You could not find a more decent person to work with in this Senate or in any other forum than John Chafee. I admired him so much because he really gave a life of dedication to public service. 
   John Chafee, we all know, was very fortunate. He grew up in a family of means. He did not have to spend his life in public service. He could have been on ``easy street.'' But that is not the way John Chafee chose to lead his life. Instead, John determined he would take on one public challenge after another, whether it was serving in the Marine Corps, of which he was very proud, or whether it was serving his State as Governor, or serving as Secretary of the Navy, or serving here in the Senate. John Chafee had a life dedicated to public service. His State of Rhode Island and our country are the richer for it. 
   I served on the Finance Committee with John. It was the only committee assignment we shared. But I soon became a partner and ally of John Chafee's on the Senate Finance Committee because we thought about issues in much the same way. John Chafee was somebody who believed deeply in fiscal responsibility. He felt very strongly that was something we 
   should pursue. But at the same time, he had a progressive agenda. He was really the leading advocate for the mentally ill, the disabled, and the retarded. As the Finance Committee considered changes to Medicare and Medicaid, I was honored to work closely with John to make sure that changes did not negatively impact those groups. 
   Together, I remember well, we sponsored an amendment to ensure that disabled children would not be removed from the Supplemental Security Income Program. As a result of John's leadership, more than 100,000 disabled children were able to maintain critical benefits to help their families afford the costs associated with their disability. That was John Chafee. He cared about other people--and really cared, not that superficial ``just talk the talk.'' John Chafee cared enough to take risks and to make a difference in people's lives.  
   We all know John was also a strong advocate of health care. In many ways, he became the leader on the Finance Committee on issues of health care and especially health care as it related to low-income Americans. He wanted to make certain people had a chance, an opportunity. Oh, yes, John believed in personal responsibility; there was no question of that with John Chafee. But he also believed there were people who were less fortunate in life who also deserved a hand up--not a handout but a hand up. That, too, was John Chafee. 
   I especially remember back in the early 1990s when we had a series of very thorny health care issues to work out. A group was formed on the Senate Finance Committee, the Centrist Coalition. That group worked under the leadership of John Chafee and JOHN BREAUX on a series of budget questions. That group was preceded by what we called the Mainstream Coalition, a group of Senators, Democrats and Republicans, who worked together to try to rescue health care reform when it looked as if it was going down the tubes. 
   In fact, the Senate Finance Committee recessed and gave the Mainstream Coalition a chance to try to bring together the diverse interests in this Chamber so we could have a chance for health care reform to work. I remember spending hundreds of hours with John Chafee and that group down in John's hideaway working on health care reform--hour after hour after hour. John did not want to give up. Even when it seemed as if there was absolutely no hope, John Chafee urged us to continue to work together, to talk together, and to try to come up with a plan that would make a difference in the lives of the American people. That was John Chafee. 
   Later, with the Centrist Coalition, we focused on the budget. I remember the day we brought a budget resolution to the floor that the Centrist Coalition had put together. It was a very close vote. There were 20 of us in the Centrist Coalition: 10 Democrats, 10 Republicans. We met during the Government shutdown. We met throughout the spring. Even those of us on the Budget Committee separately debated the budget resolution. But when we entered S-201 of the Capitol, Senator Chafee's hideaway, we left all partisanship at the door. That was the rule. We debated numbers and entitlements and discretionary spending. We considered alternatives and options. We voted and we made decisions. We put together a budget package that received 46 bipartisan votes in the Senate despite the opposition of the leaders on both sides. We had the leader of the Democrats and the leader of the Republicans both in opposition to our plan, but we got 46 votes. 
   I think it shocked many people--24 Democrats and 22 Republicans. I remember John's reaction. He was proud. He was proud we had come forward with a plan that commanded that kind of support on the floor of the Senate, even in the face of leadership opposition. 
   Do you know what. I believe that plan helped form the basis for what came later. I believe that plan helped demonstrate to the leaders there really was support for balancing this budget, for getting our fiscal house in order and for making a difference. John Chafee was a leader in that effort, and he was proud of it. He deserved to be proud of it because he was making a difference. 
   The vote on the Centrist Coalition budget and the effort that went into putting it together was public policy at its best. It could not have happened and would not have happened had it not been for Senator Chafee. He demonstrated extraordinary patience, always moving forward, always keeping the debate focused until consensus could be reached. 
   I remember so well, John, your admonition to us: Steady as she goes. That was one of John's favorite sayings: Steady as she goes. His strong, steady leadership allowed the centrist coalition to be successful. 
   That is how I will remember Senator Chafee, and that is just one of the reasons we will miss him so terribly in the Senate. 
   I say to our dear friend, John Chafee, this afternoon as he said so many times to us: Steady as she goes, John, steady as she goes. We will miss you very, very much. 
   I thank the Chair and yield the floor. 
   I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, some of our colleagues have denounced the Agriculture appropriations conference report as inadequate. I must agree. Without a doubt this bill is deficient. 
   It fails to acknowledge the full impact of natural disasters that have been experienced by agricultural producers 
   across the country. 
   It fails to include adequate funding for the drought that has hit the Northeast. 
   It fails to provide adequate funding for the hurricane damage to the Southeast and the Northeast. 
   It fails to include adequate funding for flooded farmland in my own part of the country. 
   This bill is also deficient in the way it got here because in the conference committee when it became clear that there were going to be steps to change the sanctions regime of this country, the minority, the Democrats, were simply shut out. That is wrong. That should not happen. But it did happen. 
   So we are left with that result. As a result partly of that lockout, this bill fails to provide the kind of sanctions reform that ought to have occurred. 
   In 1996 when we passed the last farm bill, the Republican leadership promised American farmers that what they lost in domestic supports they would make up through expanded export opportunities. That was a hollow promise. The harsh reality is that now the prices have collapsed, farmers are in desperate trouble, and there must be a Federal response. 
   I wish this bill were better. I wish it contained adequate assistance for  those who have been hit by hurricanes. I wish it had adequate assistance for farmers who have had their acreage flooded. I wish it had sanctions reform. 
   Food should not be used as a weapon. It is immoral; It is ineffective; and it is inhumane. But the harsh reality is we are where we are. We have a conference report that is flawed. Indeed, it is badly flawed. 
   The easy thing to do would be to vote against this conference report. But it would not be the right thing to do. This bill is not just about responding to natural disasters. It also responds to the price collapse that has occurred and threatens the livelihood of tens of thousands of farmers in my State and across the country. 
   The need for emergency income assistance could not be more clear. 
   I can say that in my State many farmers are relying on this bill as their only chance for financial survival. 
   I don't say that lightly. It is the reality. 
   If this assistance is not passed and distributed immediately, literally thousands of farmers in my State are going to go out of business. It is that simple. A way of life and the tradition of farming will be lost in dozens of communities across my State. The funding in this bill only meets the most basic needs of our producers. Make no mistake, it is absolutely essential. Prices for agricultural commodities are at their lowest levels in 50 years in real terms. Wheat and barley are the lowest they have been in real terms in over 50 years. Farm bankruptcies are rising; auctions are being held on an unending basis. If nothing further is done, thousands of our farmers will go out of the business. That is the stark reality in farm country. 
   If we fail to pass this bill, we are going to mortgage the future of literally thousands of farm families. I think we should keep in mind this is not our last chance to get something done for those who have been so badly hurt, whether it is my farmers who have flooded acres, whether it is people in the Northeast and the Southeast hit by hurricanes, whether it is farmers in the Northeast hit by drought. There is another chance this year to get additional assistance. I sympathize with my colleagues from the Northeastern and Mid-Atlantic States. They are not alone. In my State this year, we have been hit by severe storms, flooding, extreme snow and ice, ground saturation, mud slides, tornadoes, hail, insects, and disease. It is unbelievable what has happened in my State. 
   Growing up in North Dakota I always thought of my State as dry. I now fly over much of North Dakota and it looks similar to a Louisiana rice paddy. There is water everywhere. Millions of acres are inundated and were never planted this year. Our farmers planted the lowest level of spring wheat since 1988, the year of intense drought. Yet prices remain very low--in fact, record lows. Barley production in North Dakota is down 42 percent. Yet prices remain very low. 
   Things have gone from bad to worse this fall. Farmers were anxious to get into the field for harvest but were forced to stay at home and watch the rain. North Dakota farmers suffered through 2 weeks of rain at the end of August and early September, the key time for harvest. As a result, the completion of harvest has been delayed. Damage resulting from a delayed harvest is deducted from prices farmers receive for their crops. At this point, there is absolutely no way some farmers will come anywhere close to matching their expenses for this year. We simply must pass this bill to allow entire communities to survive. 
   I was called by a very dear friend of mine 2 weeks ago describing what had happened to him. He was just beginning harvest when the rains once again resumed in our State. He had just cut his grain. It was on the ground and the rains came and continued day after day after day. As a result, that grain that was on the ground sprouted. He had 30-percent sprout in his fields. He took a sample into the elevator and the elevator said: Don't even bother trucking that in; we aren't going to buy it at any price. 
   That happened all over my State. I know it has happened in other States, as well. 
   Passing this bill and releasing this funding is absolutely critical for those farmers who have been so hard hit. Remember, passing this bill does not bar Congress from doing more in the 
   future. We have other opportunities this year to help those who have been hit by a hurricane. There is other legislation moving through this body that has funds for those hit by hurricanes. That package can be improved upon. When we passed the emergency supplemental bill last May, we agreed to revisit agricultural emergency spending once the extent of the price disaster was known. We have done that. We can pass this bill now and assess future needs in response to natural disasters while this assistance is distributed. 
   The statement of the managers on this bill made several references to the need for additional Federal spending for 1999 disasters. They have recognized the reality. I hope colleagues on the floor will understand there are additional opportunities to achieve the result they seek. The answer is not to kill this bill. This bill, however flawed, is a step in the right direction. It would be a profound mistake to defeat it. 
   I close by urging my colleagues to support this conference report. We had an overwhelming vote in the Senate yesterday. It was an important vote to send the signal that this legislation ought to pass. 
   My colleagues in the Northeast are not alone. In many ways, we are in the same circumstance. We desperately need those farmers who have flooded acres to have legislation that addresses their needs. We will have another chance. We will have another opportunity. That is the great thing about the Senate; there is always another chance. 
   I close by looking at a picture that shows what is happening in my State. This is several sections of land in North Dakota. Everywhere you look is water, water, water--water everywhere. I have flown all over my State. It is truly remarkable; places that were dry for 30 years are now saturated. 
   I talked about the price collapse. I want to visually show what it is farmers are contending with. This chart shows clearly what has happened to spring wheat and barley prices over the last 53 years. The blue line is spring wheat; the red line is barley. These are two of the dominant crops of my State. Today the prices in inflation-adjusted terms, in real terms, are the lowest they have been in 53 years. That is the reality. 
   This chart shows the cost of wheat production with the green line; the red line shows what prices are. Prices have been below the cost of production the last 3 years. This is a disaster scenario of its own. This is the reality of what is happening in my State. This threatens the economic future of virtually every farmer in my State. The price is far below the cost of production. There are not many businesses that survive when it costs more to produce the product than is being received--not for a few months but for 3 years. 
   The next chart shows a comparison of the prices farmers paid for their inputs--the green line that keeps going on--versus the prices that farmers received. We can see there is a gap and it is a widening gap. In fact, the closest we came to having these two on the same line was back at the time of the passage of the 1996 farm bill. Since that time, the prices farmers pay have gone up. Thank goodness they have stabilized somewhat in the last couple of years, but the prices they have received have collapsed. 
   That is the hard reality of what our farmers confront. These are, by the way, statistics from the U.S. Department of Agriculture. 
   I want to conclude by saying we ought to pass this bill. It is not perfect. In fact, in many ways it is deeply flawed. But it is far better than the alternative of nothing. It is far better than to take the risk of sending this bill back to conference and having it come back in much worse shape. At least we can take this and put it in the bank because this does address the question of price collapse. It does not do a good enough job on the disaster side, but we have other opportunities that will come our way before this session of the Congress concludes. 
   I will end by thanking the Senator from Mississippi, the chairman of the subcommittee, and Senator KOHL, his counterpart, for the good job they have done under very difficult circumstances. Make no mistake, there are 100 Senators and there are probably 100 different opinions of what agricultural policy should be and what an Agriculture appropriations bill should  look like. But we do respect and admire the work they have done. We again thank them for their patience and perseverance bringing this bill to the floor. It deserves our support. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Chair. 
   Mr. President, I rise to urge my colleagues to support the cloture vote this afternoon. I acknowledge the work of our colleague, Senator COCHRAN, and our colleague, Senator KOHL, who are the chairman and ranking member of this committee. I have found in my time in the Senate that Senator COCHRAN is a very fair man. He is somebody who keeps his word. He always has time to listen. I appreciate that very much. I also appreciate the difficulty he has, along with Senator KOHL, in bringing this bill to the floor. This is not easy to do. It is a very difficult thing year after year, to deal with all of our colleagues on these very contentious issues. I thank my colleague, Senator COCHRAN, for his patience more than anything else because he has certainly demonstrated that. I also thank Senator KOHL because he has also listened carefully to the needs of our colleagues from around the country. 
   I represent one of the most agricultural States in the Nation. My producers there have been hit by a triple whammy of bad prices, bad weather, and bad policy. The prices are the lowest they have been in real terms in over 50 years. There is a price collapse occurring that is putting enormous financial pressure on our producers. 
   Bad weather. I guess the simple fact that we had 3 million acres in the State of North Dakota not even planted this year tells a story, not because it was too dry but because it was too wet. What an extraordinary circumstance. Back in 1988 and 1989, we had the worst drought since the 1930s. Now we have the wettest conditions in 100 years. Everywhere you go in North Dakota, at least in a big chunk of our State, there is nothing but water. Who could have believed this dramatic change? And we are hurt by bad trade policy and bad agriculture policy that has further burdened producers. 
   There are several parts of this package that I think are critically important. The 100-percent AMTA supplemental payment is going to mean that a North Dakota wheat farmer, instead of getting a transition payment of 64 cents a bushel on wheat, is going to get $1.28. It may not sound like much to many of my colleagues, and it isn't much in the great scheme of things. That is going to make the difference between literally thousands of farm families having to be forced off the land and being able to survive for another year. That is critically important. 
   Second, there is a 30-percent crop insurance discount. That is very important because we have not devised a crop insurance system that can work for the farmers of this country. 
   So those are two important provisions. They deserve our support. 
   As soon as I am positive about this bill, I also want to point out those parts of the bill that are deficient 
   because there is inadequate disaster assistance in this bill. There is not enough money for those who are victims of Hurricane Floyd; there is not enough money for those who are the victims of the drought in the eastern part of the United States; there is not enough money for those farmers in my State who have been flooded out. These are farmers who didn't take a 30-percent loss or a 40-percent loss; they took a 100-percent loss because their land is under water. 
   Mr. President, we have to do better. We will have a further opportunity to do so in the legislative process later this year. I hope very much we will do that. But right now, the right vote is to vote for cloture. 
   I thank the Chair and I yield the floor.

    Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, October is ``Co-op Month,'' and today I would like to stress the importance of cooperatives to the nation and especially to my state of North Dakota. Cooperatives are pure examples of good business--companies formed, owned and democratically controlled by the people who use its services and who receive benefits from patronage. Cooperatives are institutions that demonstrate people making their lives better through hard work and their knowledge of the American economic system. 
   In fact, the notion of cooperation is an ideal--people working together to accomplish a task and provide products and services for the public good. It is this basic philosophical idea, which so many find difficult to achieve, that the citizens of my state have been particularly adept at making a reality. North Dakota farmers have been leaders when it comes to improving their economic and social positions through cooperative community enterprise. From the great traditions of early political movements that created cooperative momentum--the American Society of Equity, the Nonpartisan League, and the Farmers Union--an educational base was formed that today still influences the drive for cooperative development. As a result, electricity and telephone service, pasta, sugar, bison and scores of other marketing and service cooperatives cover North Dakota today. Income is distributed, products and services are supplied, and employment and opportunity are spread throughout the state. 
   Cooperatives are formed to protect the way of life for independent producers and provide essential services for rural communities. Member education, one-member, one-vote equity in business decisions, and relying on neighbors to form and maintain the institution are all cooperative principles that underpin the success of these ventures. The legendary hardships that have been overcome in my state's pioneering history required cooperation among neighbors for everything from food and shelter to aid in farm labor and human companionship. Cooperation and the formation of cooperative enterprise were logical means of ensuring rural survival. We have long known that through organization, we can accomplish any goal, and through cooperation we can work together to benefit all. Therefore, during October, the month designated to recognize the importance of cooperatives, I thank the members of cooperatives for taking the initiative to direct their economic futures and for contributing to the unique economic heritage of North Dakota and this nation.

   Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise to talk about the budget gridlock we are now facing. We are considering a continuing resolution today because Congress has failed to do its job. Congress is supposed to pass the 13 appropriations bills by the new fiscal year. The fiscal year starts October 1. To date, only 1 of the 13 appropriations bills has been signed into law--1. 
   This is failure on a grand scale. If you look back over the last several years, in 1995, 5 appropriations bills had not been acted on and had to be wrapped into a year-end omnibus measure. In 1996, it went to 6 appropriations bills that had to be wrapped in one package, put on the desk of Members with no chance for review and voted up or down. In 1998, it was 8 appropriations bills that had not been acted on in a timely fashion, that had to be wrapped together. This year maybe we are headed for 12. I do not know. Maybe we can get some others done. But so far, only 1 of the 13 appropriations bills has been signed into law. 
   Does anyone see a pattern here? Does anyone see we have gone from 6 appropriations bills in 1996 not enacted to 8 in 1998 and now we have only 1 done on the eve of the new fiscal year? Our Republican colleagues who are in charge here, in the House and the Senate, bear responsibility for this failure to get the job done. 
   I must say, the other side promised very clearly three things. They said they would get the budget done on time this year. They failed. They said they would hold to the spending caps that were put in place by the 1997 bipartisan budget agreement. They failed. They said they would not raid Social Security. They failed. On each and every one of these counts, our Republican colleagues have gone back on what they promised. In each and every case, they have said one thing to the American public and done another thing in Congress. 
   I understand today they are getting really creative. Today, the Senate Appropriations Committee came up with $15 billion for the Labor-HHS bill. Where did they get it? They borrowed it from the defense bill. That is a new tactic. We have already passed the Defense bill. That is not signed either, by the way. Now they decide to go and borrow from that bill, they will put it over in the Labor bill, they will spend it there, and then they will come careening back and say they need emergency spending for the Defense bill. All of a sudden everything is an emergency with our colleagues on the other side of the aisle. 
   There are things that really are emergencies. The agriculture situation facing this country, that is an emergency. Hurricane Floyd, that is an emergency. But our Republican colleagues are calling everything an emergency. They are calling the census an emergency--the census. We do that every 10 years. We have done that since we started as a country and now they are calling that an emergency; something that was not foreseen, an emergency, something we did not know was coming. 
   I must say, the former House Appropriations Committee chairman, the former Speaker-to-be, Bob Livingston, said:  
   ..... the census has been with us since the conception of the Constitution of the United States. This is not an emergency.  
   He is right. This is not an emergency. Nor is it an emergency as they have now designated the LIHEAP program, that is low-income heating assistance. We have had that program for 20 years. Now they say that is an emergency. 
   Mr. President, we have heard a lot in the last few days. We heard we were going to a 13th month; that was going to solve the problem.

   Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, the other point that should be made is now our friends on the other side have started the raid on the Social Security trust fund. That is wrong. I had a reporter ask me: Senator, didn't you put them in this box a number of years ago during the balanced budget debate by insisting we not raid Social Security? 
   I said:  
   Absolutely, I am proud of it. We should not raid Social Security. If they want additional spending, they ought to pay for it. And they ought to do it without raiding Social Security. That ought to be a litmus test for any budget.  
   I thank the Chair and yield the floor.

   Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, last Friday, the Senate passed the VA-HUD appropriations bill. I first want to commend the chairman and ranking member of that subcommittee for the superb job they did in managing that legislation as it went through the Senate. 
   I do want to indicate a concern about what was missing in that bill because there is one program that was not funded which I believe is very important to the country, certainly to my State, which is the Community Builders Program. It is my hope that this problem can be corrected in the conference committee. I asked the chairman and the ranking member of the VA-HUD appropriations subcommittee to pay special attention to attempting to provide the resources necessary to keep the Community Builders Program going. 
   Despite HUD's successful efforts to reduce staff and provide better service, the committee bill will result in the termination of more than 400 community builders across the country. That is a program that is working. This program is designed to bring new blood into that agency. It has been called a prototype for the new type of public servant in the 21st century. HUD, in recruiting for those 400 positions, had over 9,000 applications, including lawyers, academics, and economic and community development experts. These are people who were asked to come and give 2 years to helping revitalize HUD. We signed them up. We recruited them. We signed contracts with them, and now we tell them, sorry, we have changed our minds--even though the program is working. I don't think so. 
   The individuals who were selected to participate in community builders are experts in community outreach and development, who agreed to a 2-year term of service with HUD. They don't sit at a desk in Washington. They work in the 81 field offices doing face to face contact with people in the communities in which they serve. This is a program that has received accolades from every independent source that has looked at the program, including evaluations conducted by Booz, Allen & Hamilton, the respected private firm, PricewaterhouseCoopers, one of the major accounting firms in the country, and the public strategies group--all who made independent reviews of the Community Builders Program and all of whom said it was a significant improvement for HUD. 
   If the community builders are now eliminated, some HUD field offices will drop below the minimum staffing level and will have to close. That includes the only office in my State. We have only one and it is going to close. Some people say: North Dakota is a small State, a rural State, you don't have many housing problems. Well, I can tell you that is not the case. We do have serious housing problems. Go to the Indian reservations in my State and you will see housing problems that are enormously serious. 
   But more than that, when disaster strikes, HUD is absolutely critical. We saw that in 1997 when the flooding disasters hit eastern North Dakota. Let me say that HUD's presence in the State was critically important to the recovery in North Dakota. Secretary Cuomo, in particular, was absolutely 
   superb in his response to the crisis. He understood the very human impact this devastating flood was having on the people of Grand Forks and the people of eastern North Dakota, and he responded. He went out of his way to make certain that HUD's response took into account the unique circumstances of this event. 
   Rarely have I seen public servants respond in the way we saw in the 1997 flood disaster in North Dakota. I have heard lots of criticisms of HUD over the years, but I can tell you firsthand that their response was extraordinary, and I will never forget it. 
   Let me give one example. After the disaster bill passed Congress, top HUD staff, including the Secretary, stayed and worked all weekend at HUD headquarters in order to get the money out to North Dakota. That is a level of commitment we rarely see. They were there Saturday, Sunday, from morning until night, to get the money flowing. Indeed, we were able to get $50 million into the hands of the Grand Forks community within 48 hours after the legislation passed. That is the kind of performance one would like to see from public servants on a routine basis. That is what we saw from HUD. They delivered, and they delivered in a way I think makes us all proud. 
   Because of HUD's quick work, Secretary Cuomo was able to provide that $50 million in disaster recovery funds to the city to meet the immediate needs shortly after the bill was signed by the President. Without those funds and the dedicated work of countless HUD staff, Grand Forks would not have been able to recover from that devastating flood. I toured Grand Forks with the head of FEMA, James Lee  Witt. We were there during the August break, and we saw the resurgence of that community. It is remarkable. This is a town where more than 90 percent of the homes were affected by flood. This is a community that was also hit before the floods by the worst winter storm in 50 years. Then the floods came. In the midst of floods came fire. It was an extraordinary series of events, but there was also an extraordinary Federal response, and I am here today to thank my colleagues who stepped forward and were willing to assist. But I also want to recognize the extraordinary work of HUD, and specifically Secretary Cuomo, because rarely have I seen the kind of response we saw during our period of crisis. In part, it was because he had this new mechanism, these community builders across the country who were infusing new energy and new ideas into the agency that made that response possible. 
   In Washington, we hear over and over that government needs to be more responsive to people's needs and that government needs to be more flexible and work similar to the private sector. I can say that in Grand Forks, HUD did just that. Grand Forks is not an isolated example. We saw it up and down the Red River Valley. It wasn't just in Grand Forks; it was in Fargo; it was in Wahpeton; it was in Grafton; it was in Menoken. Town after town that was threatened had a full Federal response, and no agency was more responsive than HUD; no people were more helpful than those community builders. 
   That is why I thought it important to come to the floor and say restore the Community Builders Program, restore it in the conference committee. Let's not recruit some of the top people from all across the country, asking them to serve for 2 years, and then, after a year in a program that has been deemed successful by every independent entity that has examined the program, say to them: Forget it; go home. 
   The amazing thing is, they won't go home because we have signed contracts with them. If we don't fund it, we are still going to have to pay for those positions. 
   I hope very much the conference committee will restore the funding to the Community Builders Program, to say to those 400 people who have given so much, we recognize their contribution; we intend to keep them as part of a new HUD, a HUD that has been reformed, a HUD that is responding in a splendid way to disasters such as the one we faced in North Dakota.

   Mr. CONRAD. The Senator is exactly right. I think back to the time when we were in the midst of that crisis and what a splendid response we got from HUD. 
   I think people are often critical of Federal agencies. Certainly HUD, especially in the past, has received lots of criticism--well deserved, unfortunately. However, this new Secretary, Mr. Cuomo, has done a remarkable job of transforming that agency. We saw it firsthand in the flood disaster of 1997. Not only did they stay in all weekend down at HUD to get the money out to the affected communities, which was a splendid performance, but they were with us every step of the way in revitalizing and rebuilding that community. 
   We have just seen the result. The Senator from North Dakota was with me and with James Lee Witt as we toured Grand Forks to see how that community is coming back. It would not have happened, the mayor of Grand Rapids said to me when we were at the League of Cities meeting Saturday night in North Dakota, without the assistance from the Federal Government that was received by the community of Grand Forks. 
   The key agencies were obviously FEMA and HUD, also SBA. All of those were major contributors, as well as the Commerce Department and EDA. Those four agencies made a profound difference. The mayor said to me flatly, without the contribution made by HUD and Secretary Cuomo, that town would not have come back in the way it has in just this short period. 
   It is truly amazing to drive through the streets of Grand Forks now, to see the schools that have been rebuilt, to see the downtown that is under construction--a new corporate center, a new county facility--to see other buildings that are being rehabilitated, to drive through the neighborhoods and see the new homes that have been constructed, hundreds of new homes, to see the devastated homes that have been taken out, to see the new greenway that is being created, and to go across the river and see a brand new superstore that is being built and will attract hundreds of thousands of people a year. This is a testimony to programs that work. 
   We all know there are Federal programs that don't work. We all know there are times when Federal money is not well spent. This is an example of when the Federal Government proved its worth and proved its mettle, performed, and made a difference in the lives of tens of thousands of people. 
   I want to publicly commend Secretary Cuomo and the people at HUD and to say this Community Builders Program ought not to be thrown over the side. We have 400 people who were recruited from 9,000 who applied to come to work for the Government for 2 years--in and out--to add their expertise and energy. We ought to continue the experiment. We know from every independent analysis this is a program that has worked.

   Mr. CONRAD. Today the Office of Management and Budget announced the unified budget is in surplus for fiscal year 1999 by at least $115 billion. That is significantly higher than the unified surplus of $70 billion for fiscal year 1998 and, in fact, is the largest dollar surplus in the history of the United States. 
   This is a good day. This is a good day for the country, and this is a good day for the Congress. It is certainly a good day for the President and the administration. 
   In 1992, the budget deficit was $290 billion. The forecast then was that the deficit for this year would be over $400 billion. That was the forecast in 1992 for where we were headed if we didn't change course. We did change course. The President proposed, and the Congress passed, a plan in 1993, a 5-year plan, that has worked splendidly. In each and every year of that 5-year plan, the deficit came down. In 1997, we passed a bipartisan addition to that plan. That addition closed the gap, made the difference, and finished the job. Now we can report we have budget surpluses.  
   The job is not fully complete because while we are reporting a $115 billion surplus this year, the Social Security surplus is $124 billion. In this year, we are still using $9 billion of that $124 billion Social Security surplus for other things. We shouldn't do that. It ought to stop. 
   But what dramatic progress we have made. We have gone from budget deficits of $290 billion just 7 years ago to a $115 billion budget surplus this year, and we are within hailing distance of stopping the raid on the Social Security trust fund. The Social Security trust fund is a $124 billion surplus in fiscal year 1999, and we are running a surplus of $115 billion. So we are very close to stopping the raid on the Social Security trust fund. 
   I hope very much we are able to stay on that course. We know that is in real jeopardy for fiscal year 2000. We know that if everything plays out as is currently contemplated in the Appropriations Committees, we will be using between $30 billion and $40 billion of the Social Security surplus next year. We will be going backwards. Let's not do that. Let's not go backwards. Let's keep moving forward. Next year, let's be able to report that we are not using any of the Social Security surplus for any other purpose. That ought to be our goal. 
   We are now in this remarkable position of being able to say that if we stay the course, if we don't go out on some big, new spending binge, if we don't have some radical, reckless tax scheme, we will be able to balance the budget without counting Social Security and we will be able to eliminate the publicly held debt of the country in the next 15 years. 
   Every economist who has come before the Senate Budget Committee and every economist who has come before the Senate Finance Committee has said the highest and best use of these surpluses is to reduce the debt. What we did in 1993 confirms that view. 
   Remember that in 1993 we took action on a 5-year budget 
   plan to reduce the deficit each and every year. The idea was, that would take pressure off interest rates and that would give the greatest lift to the economy, that by reducing deficits and debt, we would reduce pressure on interest rates, that lower interest rates would help our economy perform more strongly, and we would improve our competitive position in the world. 
   How well that strategy and plan have served this country. Each and every year of that 5-year budget plan passed in 1993 we reduced the budget deficit. Each and every year we were moving towards lower spending as a percentage of our gross domestic product. Every year of that 5-year budget plan we were moving towards the point at which we could start reducing the national debt. That plan worked. 
   Now we are able to see the longest economic expansion in our history, the lowest inflation in 30 years, the lowest unemployment in 30 years, and the lowest welfare rates in 30 years, with total spending of the Federal Government being reduced. We have gone from 22.7 percent of our national income, our gross domestic product, going to the Federal Government to this year it being down to 19 percent. We are headed in the right direction. Let's keep that up. 
   Let's move to a circumstance in which we will be able to report next year that we have stopped raiding the Social Security trust fund. Let's be able to report that we are on schedule to eliminate the publicly held debt of the United States in 15 years. What a great thing that would be for our country. How well that would position us for the baby-boom generation, because pretty soon we baby boomers are going to start to retire. We are going to add dramatically to the burden on the Federal Government from Social Security and Medicare, and the single best way to prepare for that eventuality is to reduce publicly held debt. We can do it. It is within our grasp. But we have to avoid new spending schemes and we have to avoid risky tax schemes if we are going to deliver on that promise. 
   I hope very much that together we will stay the course and put America in a circumstance in which it is able to announce in 15 years that there is no publicly held debt in America. What a great circumstance that would be for our Nation. I can't think of anything that would be a better present to our children and our grandchildren than to be able to eliminate the publicly held debt in the next 15 years. 
   I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.

    Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce the Graduate Medical Education Fair Technical Amendment Act of 1999. This legislation will take important steps to sustain and improve the availability of medical professionals in communities in my State. 
   Mr. President, as you know, the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (BBA) included many measures to control rising health care spending, including provisions that reduced the level of resources for graduate medical education. In particular, the BBA set a limit on the amount of medical residents for which teaching hospitals can receive reimbursement. This cap was set according to the number of medical  residents on staff as of December 31, 1996. While this reimbursement limit has helped to contribute to the overall savings generated by the BBA, I am concerned that it has unfairly limited the ability of certain programs to adequately train future health care providers. 
   Over the last few years, we have heard much discussion about the issue of physician oversupply. As you may know, various experts suggest that the true problem regarding physician supply is an unequal distribution of physicians across the country. In my State of North Dakota, for example, more than 85 percent of the counties are in health professional shortage areas. There certainly isn't a physician oversupply in my state--we are grateful for the health care providers serving our communities and we are grateful to have facilities with the capability to train medical residents. 
   Recently, it came to my attention that one of the teaching hospitals in my State had committed to training an increased level of medical residents. This situation arose because another facility in my State was no longer able to offer these residents an adequate training experience. The facility's decision to take on the new residents was important--while we cannot guarantee that physicians trained in my State will pursue permanent practice in the State, we know that providers are more likely to serve where they are trained. And it is important to note that the University of North Dakota produces a higher percentage of graduates who practice in rural settings than any medical school in the Nation. 
   The facility took on these residents assuming that they would receive adequate Medicare graduate medical education reimbursement to train these individuals. Unfortunately, retroactively set BBA limits capped the allowable reimbursement level just prior to the time the residents in question came on board. Thus, the facility was already committed to training these residents but the funds they depended on to do so were no longer available. The result of this situation is that the entire graduate medical residency program is suffering and I am concerned tat this could result in reduced services for beneficiaries. 
   The legislation I introduce today will correct the unintended consequence of the BBA by allowing a technical adjustment to medical resident caps in certain situations. I am confident this legislation will help ensure we have adequate resources to meet our health care needs well into the future. I urge my colleagues to support this important effort.

    Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, today, I would like to recognize a very important organization in my state, the North Dakota Stockmen's Association. I would also like to congratulate them on their 70th anniversary as an organization. Over the years, the North Dakota Stockmen's Association has been an invaluable asset to their members and to me. In particular, after 70 years of representing North Dakota family farmers and ranchers, the Stockmen have made great contributions to the cultural and economic heritage of North Dakota. Their successes have been accomplished through hard work and their consistent ability to produce the highest quality beef in the world. 
   Cattle provide an essential source of income for North Dakota farmers. Based on that fact alone, it is easy to understand the importance of the Stockmen's Association to my state's producers. While keeping the interests of cattle producers in the minds of elected officials, the members of this organization also provide valuable stewardship to the land, send their children to rural schools, support businesses, and help their neighbors through difficult weather and tough economic times. I would like to express my deep appreciation for their enduring efforts to support my state's communities, and again, I congratulate them for 70 years of service to the cattlemen of North Dakota.

   Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, today I was informed of the concern of two North Dakotans who have distinguished themselves on behalf of veterans and their families regarding FY' 2000 funding for VA medical care-incoming National Commander of the Disabled Veterans of America Michael Dobmeier of Grand Forks, North Dakota and Lorraine Frier, National President of the Ladies Auxiliary to the Veterans of Foreign Wars of West Fargo. Let me take this opportunity to warmly congratulate Mike and Lorraine on their recent election to these important national offices, and to thank them for their many years of distinguished service to our country. 
   Yesterday, the Senate VA-HUD Subcommittee reported an appropriations measure for the Department of Veterans Affairs that will provide $18.4 billion for medical care for veterans. This figure is $1.1 billion above the Administration's budget request of $17.3 billion earlier this year, however, more than $600 below House appropriations recommendation of $1.7 billion for veterans medical care. The House action would increase VA medical care funding to $19 billion. 
   While the House action does not meet the recommendations from the Independent Budget, Fiscal Year 2000 of $20.2 billion, the funding level does come closer to ensuring that the VA may not have to curtail medical services, close community-based clinics or layoff critical health care workers. Earlier this week, the Veterans of Foreign Wars warned that unless the Senate approves funding close to the House level of $19 billion, ``scores of community-based clinics will have to be closed, veterans will wait longer for care and some 8,500 health care workers laid off''. 
    Mr. President, the crisis in funding for veterans medical care is shameful, particularly in light of the strong economic news that we have received almost daily over the past few months. How can a nation that has experienced such strong economic growth during the past few years, witnessed stock market growth beyond all expectations and discussed how to spend the Federal surplus, deny veterans the very best health care. How can we justify making veterans wait for months for specialized health care, closing outpatient clinics or reducing VA staffing levels. In my state of North Dakota, we have been working for several years to secure funding for $10 million in critical patient privacy and environmental improvements at the Fargo VA Medical Center--a medical center more than 70 years old. 
   Earlier this year when the Senate, during consideration of the budget resolution, failed to increase funding for VA medical care as recommended in the Independent Budget, Senator DORGAN and I introduced legislation, S. 1022, to authorize an emergency appropriation of $1.7 billion, above the Administration request, for veterans health care. In view of VA-HUD Subcommittee action in the Senate this week, we must work together to find additional funding for VA health care to bring that level closer to the recommended level in the Independent  Budget. We must do better for our veterans; we can do no less for the sacrifices they and their families have made on our behalf.

   Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, this morning I got up and, as is typically my habit, I opened up the Washington Post to see what was there. I turned first to the sports page to see how my Baltimore Orioles performed. I got good news there. That was a welcome addition to my morning. 
   On the front page of the Washington Post I was very surprised to see this headline: ``GOP Seeks to Ease Crunch with 13-month Fiscal Year.'' 
   I have heard of some gimmicks in my time. Now we see our friends on the other side, who are not able to meet the legal requirement that they pass the appropriations bills on time by October 1, have resorted to a new concept. Instead of having a 12-month year, we will have a 13-month year. 
   I think our friends are going off on a tangent that should not be pursued. I think this would be a profound mistake. The last thing we need to do is solve our fiscal problems by creating a fiction of a 13-month year. That isn't what we need to be doing. We need to address directly and forthrightly the problem we face in trying to avoid raiding the Social Security trust fund. Let's do it honestly. Let's do it directly. Let's not engage in the fiction of creating a 13-month year in order to resolve the fiscal challenges facing this country and this Senate. 
   That is what the Republicans have come up with. They point out in the story:  
   By creating this fictitious 13th month, lawmakers would be able to spend $12 billion to $16 billion more for labor, health, education and social programs than they otherwise would be permitted under budget rules.  
   What are we doing? We are going to create a 13th month to deal with the fiscal problems of the country? I don't think so. 
   Senator SPECTER is apparently one of the backers of this idea.  
   ``We all know we engage in a lot of smoke and mirrors,'' said Senator ARLEN SPECTER, chairman of the Senate Appropriations subcommittee, ``But we have to fund education, NIH, worker safety and other programs. It's a question of how we do it.''  
   I agree with it being a question of how we do it. The last thing we ought to do is create a 13-month year. If we want to cause a lack of respect of people in the country for the Congress, this is the way: Adopt the Republican proposal that the way to solve our fiscal problem is to create a 13th month. 
   I began looking at the calendar to try to figure out where we would add this 13th month, what we would call it. One thought that we had is that maybe we could have January, February, and then ``Fictionary''--kind of a fictional 13th month. Maybe that could be the month: January, February, and Fictionary. 
   Or maybe we ought to have ``Spend-tember,'' after September, or maybe before September. We could have ``Spend-tember'' for the 13th month. 
   There is something wrong with what our colleagues on the Republican side have come up with. Thirteen months? I don't think the American people are going to buy this. Everybody knows there are 24 hours in a day, 7 days a week, and there are just 12 months in a year. Search as we might, here is the calendar; there are only 12 months; there is no 13th month. That is not the solution to our problem. 
   If we started thinking of where we would add this month, some would advocate two Decembers. That would have a certain attractiveness. We would have two Christmases, all the retail sales twice. That is not a bad idea. 
   On this idea the Republicans have come up with for 13 months to solve our fiscal problems, my choice is to see 2 Octobers. I am a baseball fan. I could have the World Series twice. Others might have a different idea of where we could add a month. 
   I must say to our Republican friends, why stop at 13 months? If this is the way we are going to solve the fiscal problems of our country, let's go to 14 months, maybe add 15. Somebody in my office suggested we go to 24 months. That way, we would be able to double everybody's income in a single year. We would be able to have twice as much spending in a single year if we went to 24 months. I think we have real opportunities. If we keep adding enough months, we can completely avoid the Y2K problem altogether. Now this is a real opportunity, and I don't think we want to miss it.

   Mr. CONRAD. There are lots of good ideas coming out on this idea to extend the concept that our Republican friends have come up with to go to 13 months in a year in order to solve our budget problems. The last time we made a major change in the calendar, it was made by the Pope. I am not sure what that says about those putting forward this proposal, other than I can't wait to see what they come up with next. 
   I don't think this is the solution to the fiscal problems of America; 13 months is not the answer. 
   Going back to the headline, it really is kind of stunning: ``GOP Seeks to Ease Crunch with 13-month Fiscal Year.'' 
   One person who has commented on this in this morning's paper is Robert Bixby, head of the Concord Coalition, a budget watchdog group. He says they are degrading themselves and we degrade the budget process by resorting to these budget gimmicks. 
   The only disagreement I have with that is, this goes way beyond gimmick when all of a sudden we are going to take a 12-month year and make it 13 months to address the budget problems of the country. I think our Republican friends have gone off in the weeds. I hope they reconsider. This is a mistake. 
   If we start going in the direction of adding months, where is this going to stop? We have 12 months. Thirteen months? Fourteen months? Are we going to be able to solve all the problems of the country if we start to engage in fiction? That is not the direction we ought to take. Does my colleague from North Dakota agree?

   Mr. CONRAD. The Wall Street Journal, back in July, had this headline: ``The GOP Uses Two Sets Of Books.'' Now we are going to have a new headline: ``The GOP Uses Two Calendars.'' We have the one with 12 months, which I guess will run all the rest of our lives, but for budget purposes we will have 13 months. 
   The second part of the story in the Washington Post today said: Senate Republican leaders embrace a longer fiscal year to ease spending woes. They want to spend the money, but they want to make it appear as though there is less spending in this year, so they add a 13th month. I don't think that is going to fool anybody. It certainly should be outside the rules of this body, if we are going to be serious about maintaining the fiscal discipline that has done so much to restore the fiscal integrity of this country. 
   For the first time in 30 years, we have been able to balance the budget, largely as a result of the 1993 budget plan we passed. We received no help from our friends on the Republican side--not a single Republican vote, not one. That was a plan which put us on a path to reduce the deficit each and every year of the 5 years of that plan. In 1997, we added a little bit. That was done on a bipartisan basis. That was good. We did something together. 
   But now our Republican friends are retreating to the notion that the way to solve the fiscal problems of the United States is to add a 13th month. That cannot be a serious proposal. I cannot believe our colleagues are going to engage in that kind of charade and that kind of game and that kind of gimmick in order to address the serious fiscal problems facing the country. After all, this progress has been made--getting our fiscal house in order--having the lowest inflation rate in 30 years, the lowest unemployment rate in 30 years, the longest economic expansion in our history. We are now going to resort to budget gimmickry to address the additional challenges that we face? That is not the way a great country does its work.

   Mr. CONRAD. Microsoft month. That might be a lucrative thing, to auction this off. That might be a way to solve the budget problem, instead of going to the 13-month plan the Republicans have, is to actually auction off a month.

   Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Washington. She is exactly right. We do face a problem  this year, and the problem is we have these budget caps that were agreed to in 1997, and now things have gone better than anybody anticipated. We have been able to get our fiscal house in order. The question is how we maintain that discipline and at the same time fund the urgent priorities of the American people, especially education. 
   As was said by budget expert, Robert Reischauer, the former Director of the Congressional Budget Office, this notion the Republicans have come up with to just add a 13th month does not solve the problem; it avoids the problem. We will have spending caps in 2001 and 2002 as well, so all we have done is postpone and magnify the problem. We will have actually made the problem worse. 
   There is humor in this. I think we all see almost a theater of the absurd in the notion that our Republican colleagues have come up with as a way to solve the problem, which is to add a 13th month. 
   I say on a serious note, let's not do that. We have had success in getting our fiscal house in order by being straight with the American people, by passing legislation that fits our spending to our income. Let's not create a fix such as this in order to support a massive, risky, radical, reckless tax cut scheme which our friends on the other side have come up with that threatens the fiscal discipline that has been put in place, that has put us in such a strong position. 
   I thank the Chair and yield the floor.

   Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, today I am pleased to be joined by Senators FEINGOLD and CHAFEE in introducing the Fairness in Medicare Home Health Access Act of 1999. I am proud to say that the Governing Board of the North Dakota Home Care Association, as well as the Visiting Nurse Association of America, have endorsed this legislation as a crucial step toward ensuring beneficiaries retain access to vital home care services. 
   As you know, home health care has proven to be an important component of the Medicare package because it allows beneficiaries with acute needs to receive care in their home rather than in other settings, such as a hospital or nursing home. In my state of North Dakota, home health care has been particularly important because it has allowed seniors living in remote, frontier areas to receive consistent, quality health care without having to travel long distances to the nearest health care facility. 
   Over the last three decades, we have witnessed significant increases in home health utilization as medical practices have shifted care from an inpatient to outpatient setting. To help address rising health care spending, the Congress included targeted measures in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (BBA) to reduce costs and give providers incentives to become more efficient. In particular, the BBA directed the Health Care Financing Administration to implement an interim payment system for home health care until which time a prospective payment system could be instituted. While the interim payment system has allowed agencies to become more cost-effective, there are also concerns that it may be having some unintended consequences on agencies' ability to deliver quality, appropriate home care services to Medicare beneficiaries. 
   Mr. President, this legislation takes definitive steps to address various unintended consequences of the interim payment system and of the BBA in general. 
   Home health providers serving rural beneficiaries have been particularly affected by the interim payment system. As you know, home health care delivery is unique because unlike most other services, the health care provider must travel to the patient. Compared to urban agencies, rural home care providers must travel longer distances to serve beneficiaries and they often face poor weather and road conditions. Due to these constraints, agencies serving rural beneficiaries must visit patients less frequently; but during an isolated visit aides tend to spend more time with beneficiaries to ensure that they are receiving appropriate levels of care. Unfortunately, the per visit limits included in the interim payment system do not adequately account for the unique challenges of serving rural beneficiaries. This legislation revises the per visit cost limit to ensure agencies have the resources to deliver care to beneficiaries living in rural and underserved areas. 
   It also appears that the interim payment system does not adequately account for the needs of medically-complex beneficiaries. Various reports have  suggested that the interim payment system has resulted in restricted access to home health services for high-acuity, high-cost patients. In a recent survey conducted by the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission, nearly 40 percent of agencies reported that they are less likely to admit patients identified as those with long-term or chronic needs. In addition, many beneficiary advocates have raised concerns that home health agencies are denying access to care because they believe Medicare will no longer cover the high costs of providing services to medically complex individuals. When it is implemented, the prospective payment system will include a measure to account for the 
   treatment of medically-complex beneficiaries. In the interim, this legislation will allow agencies to receive more appropriate payments for treating high-acuity, high-cost beneficiaries. 
   In addition, this legislation includes provisions to further ensure home care agencies have the appropriate resources to serve Medicare beneficiaries. To help slow the growth of home health expenditures, the BBA includes a provision to reduce home health cost limits by 15 percent, beginning October 1, 2000. There is significant concern that the timing and level of the scheduled 15 percent reduction will result in reduced beneficiary access to health care. To address this concern, various industry representatives have requested a complete elimination of the scheduled reduction; however the cost of this reduction is estimated to be nearly $17 billion over ten years. Against the backdrop of impending insolvency of the Medicare program and the overall needs of the health care community as a whole regarding BBA-related relief, it will not be possible to completely eliminate this scheduled reduction. For this reason, this legislation suggests a middle-ground approach to this issue to ensure the scheduled reduction does not result in a reduction in beneficiary access. 
   Primarily, this legislation would ensure that agencies receive adequate reimbursement by delaying the scheduled 15 percent reduction until the prospective payment system is fully implemented. This means that if implementation of the prospective payment system is delayed, the scheduled reduction would be delayed accordingly. In addition, to allow agencies to transition to the prospective payment system, and ensure they retain the necessary resources to serve beneficiaries, this legislation would reduce the scheduled reduction to 10 percent and would phase-in a further 5 percent reduction three years after the prospective payment system is implemented. These responsible measures will provide home health agencies additional resources to continue serving Medicare beneficiaries. 
   In addition, this legislation would offer home health agencies relief from a particularly burdensome regulatory requirement. The BBA requires home health agencies to record the length of time of home health visits in 15-minute increments. This requirement is burdensome for agencies because time for travel and administrative duties related to this requirement are not compensated. Also, it is not clear that the collection of this data has a defined use. This provision eliminates the 15-minute reporting requirement and directs that any data collection regarding direct patient care have a defined purpose and not be unnecessary labor-intensive for home care providers. 
   This bill would also take steps to address concerns regarding the provision of durable medical supplies to Medicare beneficiaries. The BBA requires implementation of consolidated billing for home health services. As part of consolidated billing, the BBA requires home care providers (rather than durable medical equipment suppliers) to provide durable medical equipment (DME) to Medicare beneficiaries during any episode of care by the home health provider. When a beneficiary seeks home health care, there is concern that they may experience a break in the continuum of care as they shift between receiving medical equipment from a DME supplier to receiving these supplies from a home health agency. In addition, many home health agencies are not currently equipped to provide and be reimbursed for the provision of durable medical equipment. This provision would ensure beneficiaries do not experience a break in serve with regard to durable medical equipment by allowing DME providers to continue delivering services to beneficiaries regardless of their home health status. 
   Lastly, this legislation includes a provision that directs the establishment of a nationally uniform process to ensure that fiscal intermediaries have the training and ability to provide timely and accurate coverage and payment information to home health agencies and beneficiaries. This provision will be particularly important to home health reimbursement transitions to a new prospective payment system. 
   I am confident that this legislation will ensure home health agencies can continue providing critical health care services to Medicare beneficiaries. I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation.

   Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, this is an editorial that appeared in the New York Times on August 2. It says: ``Here we go again.'' That is exactly what this tax bill is all about. Here we go again.  
   Back in 1980 Ronald Reagan assured one and all that he could cut taxes sharply, increase defense spending substantially and balance the Federal budget.  
   That is the promise he made. It did not work out that way. The deficits exploded. George Bush at the time:  
   ..... famously derided Mr. Reagan's supply side fantasies as ``voodoo economics.''  
   We all remember that. The veteran Washington Post reporter Lou Cannon, in his book ``President Reagan, the Role of a Lifetime'' described the reaction of James Baker, Mr. Reagan's own chief of staff, to the transformation of economic fantasy into national policy. He wrote:  
   Though not particularly well-versed in economics, Baker suspected there was something screwy about the idea that massive tax cuts would increase government revenues. Later, he would privately express regrets that the deficits had `gotten away' from the administration and wished he had paid more attention to the consequences of the tax cuts.  
   Here we go again. Again, we have the fantasy being held out to the American people that somehow you can have a massive tax cut, you can have a big defense buildup, domestic needs will not be hurt, and somehow it is all going to add up. The problem with it is it is highly unlikely to happen. Let's just check the record. It shows very clearly what happened in the Reagan administration when they had this fantasy that they were going to cut taxes dramatically, 
   have a big defense buildup. Somehow it was all going to add up. It did not add up and this plan does not add up. 
   This is what happened back then. President Reagan inherited a deficit of just under $80 billion and he promptly shot it to $200 billion. That is what happens when we just put our head in the sand and get wedded to an ideology and do not care about the economic results, or the economic fallout. This plan is a disaster. I do not know how else to say it. It is risky; it is radical; it is reckless. We would make a profound mistake to pass it today. 
   We then went into the Bush administration and the deficits went up, up, and away again. It went up to $290 billion in 1990. 
   In 1993, President Clinton came into office and we passed a 5-year budget plan to cut spending and, yes, raise income taxes on the wealthiest 1 percent. That plan worked. Each and every year of that 5-year plan the deficit came down until finally we have achieved a balanced budget. Why would we ever want to go back? Why would we ever want to repeat the incredible mistakes this country made in the 1980s that threatened the economic security of this country, that put this country's economy in a ditch, that led to recession, that led to job loss, that led to an extinguishment of economic growth? Why would we want to repeat that tragic mistake? Yet here we are. ``Here we go again.'' Goodness knows, don't we have more common sense than this? 
   This is not just my view. This is the view of economist after economist who has looked at this proposal. Mr. Samuelson, the columnist, wrote:  
   The wonder is that the Republicans are so wedded to a program that is dubious as to both policy and politics.  
   He went on to say:  
   As Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan noted the other day, tax cuts might someday be justified to revive the economy from a recession or to improve the prospects of a sweeping program of tax simplification. But there is no case for big tax cuts based merely on paper projections of budget surpluses.  
   That is what this is. These are plans based on projections of what might  happen over the next 10 years. What a risky way to run the economy. What a reckless way to run economic policy, to run out here and shovel $800 billion out the door before the money is collected. That puts this entire economy at risk. That puts this entire period of bringing down the deficit at risk. That puts this entire successful economic policy of improving economic growth, reducing unemployment, reducing inflation at risk. It is a mistake we should not make. 
   This columnist points out:  
   Suppose that spending exceeds projections by one percentage point of national income and that tax revenues fall below projections by the same amount. In today's dollars, these errors ..... not out of line with past mistakes ..... would total $170 billion annually. Most of the future surpluses would vanish.  
   That is the reality. We are betting the farm on projections of what is going to happen over the next 10 years. Does anybody believe these projections are going to come true? 
   I used to be responsible for projecting the income of the State of North Dakota. That was my job. I can tell you, projecting 5 years out is very risky. Frankly, it is hard to project 1 year out. Projecting 10 years out is a total crapshoot and we are basing the economic security of this country on a 10-year projection? Are we really going to do that? 
   I ask my colleagues, are we really going to do that? Is this what you are seriously proposing for the United States, after the economic success we have enjoyed by reducing the deficits, by reducing debt? 
   Some of the very same people who said the 1993 plan would not work are here today, advocating this risky scheme. The 1993 plan, as I showed, worked. That 5-year deficit reduction plan, in fact, reduced the deficit each and every year. But when we passed it in 1993, the other side said it would crater the economy; it would ruin us. 
   This is what Senator GRAMM, who is on the Budget Committee and on the Finance Committee, said back in 1993:  
   I want to predict tonight that if we adopt this bill the American economy is going to get weaker and not stronger, the deficit 4 years from now will be higher than it is today and not lower......When all is said and done, people will pay more taxes, the economy will create fewer jobs, government will spend more money, and the American people will be worse off.  
   That is Senator GRAMM in 1993 when we passed the plan that did just the opposite. Let's look at the record. We passed that plan in 1993, and here is what happened: Unemployment went down to the lowest level in 41 years. 
   Senator GRAMM and the advocates of opposition to the 1993 plan, who are the very ones who are the advocates of this plan today, were wrong. They said it was going to increase unemployment. They were wrong. We have the lowest unemployment in 41 years. They said that that economic plan would increase inflation. They were wrong. That plan reduced inflation to the lowest level in 33 years. 
   Mr. President, it does not stop there. Look at the economic growth. They said the 1993 plan would retard economic growth. They were wrong. Look at the record. We have the strongest economic growth during the last 6 years of any administration going back to the administration of Lyndon Johnson. 
   Friends, people who are listening across the country, let's think a minute: Is the economy in good shape or is the economy in bad shape? I think every one of us knows we have the strongest economy in anyone's memory. That was built on a plan of reducing the deficits, relieving pressure on interest rates, making America more competitive, reducing home interest loans, reducing car loans, reducing student loans, because there was less deficit, less debt. Now we are on the brink of completely changing that policy and going back to the bad old days of deficits and debt and decline. Are we really going to turn back the clock to those days? I hope not. I hope we do not make as foolish a mistake as that. 
   Because of the 5-year plan put in place in 1993, not only have we gotten the lowest unemployment, the lowest inflation in decades, the strongest economic growth in decades, we have also seen welfare caseloads decline dramatically. That is the record. That is the fact. 
   The other side says: Oh, but wait a minute. Taxes are the highest they have been in 20 years. 
   They are not telling the whole story. Here is what has happened. Remember when we had deficits, we had a gap between the revenue of the United States and the spending of the United States. The blue line is the spending; the red line is the revenue. 
   Go back to 1993. There was the gap. That was the deficit, $290 billion. We cut the spending line, and we raised the revenue line. That is how we balanced the budget. We cut spending; we raised the revenue line. 
   When they say the taxes are the highest they have ever been, again, they are not telling the whole story. Revenues are strong because the economy is strong, but individual taxpayers are not paying more in taxes; most are paying less. That is not the Senator from North Dakota speaking, that is the respected accounting firm of Deloitte & Touche. They analyzed the tax burden, including payroll taxes and income taxes, of a family earning just under $20,000 a year. They looked at 1979, and they looked at 1999. 
   In 1979, that family was paying 8.6 percent of their income in taxes--payroll taxes and income taxes. That burden has been reduced to 5 percent. Why? Because when we raised taxes on the wealthiest 1 percent in the 1993 plan, we also cut taxes on 28 million Americans by increasing the earned income tax credit. So we reduced taxes for individuals. 
   The same is true for a family of four earning $35,000 in 
   1999. Again, the respected accounting firm of Deloitte & Touche went out and looked at their tax burden: 1979, 11.2 percent. That has been reduced to 10.5 percent in 1999. It is also true of a family earning $85,000 a year. In 1979, they had a total tax burden of 17 percent; in 1999, 16.3 percent. 
   Does that mean there should not be any tax relief? No. We should have tax relief, but we ought to have a responsible package of tax relief, not one that threatens to put us back in the economic ditch of deficits and debt. Unfortunately, that is what the Republican plan does. 
   On the question of the fairness of this proposal, if this is fair, I do not understand fairness. They are going to give to the top 1 percent in this country with an average income of $837,000 a $46,000 tax cut. They are going to give to the bottom 60 percent of the income earners in this country, the vast majority of people on average, a tax reduction of $138. That does not strike me as very fair. 
   Let's check their math. We have heard over and over they are just giving 25 percent of the money that is available in surplus back in a tax cut. That is interesting math they are using. Let's check it. 
   The total surplus is $2.9 trillion. That is the CBO estimate. 
   I ask for 3 additional minutes.

   Mr. CONRAD. Look at what CBO is projecting--and I emphasize projecting--as the surplus over the next 10 years, $2.9 trillion. But $1.9 trillion of that is Social Security. If you take that out, you have $1 trillion left. Republicans are proposing nearly $800 billion of tax cuts. When you do that, you add interest costs of $141 billion. That only leaves $63 billion left for debt reduction, for strengthening Medicare, for domestic needs. They are using not 25 percent of what is available; they are using 94 percent of what is available, because we have all agreed that none of the Social Security money is available. 
   The only way they get this number of 25 percent being used for a tax cut is when they include Social Security in the base. Are they proposing we are going to use 25 percent of the Social Security money for a tax cut? No. So they are using phony statistics. They are applying this 25 percent to two-thirds of the money that is Social Security money. They are taking 94 percent of the money that is truly available for this risky tax cut. 
   Here are the choices: Republicans say $800 billion of tax cuts; nothing to strengthen Medicare; nothing for domestic needs; they have $63 billion unallocated. 
   Our proposal in the Senate was balanced. We said save every penny of Social Security for Social Security and  then one-third for tax relief; one-third to strengthen Medicare--and, by the way, this money is not needed immediately so it can be used for the next 15 years to pay down debt--and one-third of the money for high-priority domestic needs, such as education, defense, and agriculture. 
   That leads our friends on the other side to say: There go the Democrats again; they just want to spend money. 
   Let's examine that notion. This blue line shows constant buying power of what we do with Federal spending now for domestic needs. That is what would happen if we had constant buying power. The Democratic plan is represented by this red line. It is a cut from current buying power. Here is the Republican plan down here. They have a massive cut, $770 billion over the next 10 years from what current buying power would permit. 
   They do not want anybody to talk about this, but the reality is, they are advocating deep cuts in education, in defense, in agriculture, and in all the rest--parks, law enforcement--because there is no way to avoid this mathematical reality. They came to this Chamber with a chart that said, yes, you could accommodate this tax cut if you froze all domestic spending for 10 years. 
   It has never been done. What is amazing about it is that it is not what they are doing in the Appropriations Committees that meet every day. They are spending additional money. 
   I ask for 1 additional minute.

   Mr. President, let's be honest with the American people. This plan does not add up. It threatens to take us back to a period of growing debts. It fails to meet high-priority domestic needs such as education and agriculture and defense. It does not do anything to secure Medicare for the future. It is not real. It is not balanced. It is not responsible. This plan is not conservative.

   Mr. CONRAD. I remember so well. I remember being on the floor of the Senate the day we passed the 5-year plan that got us back on track. I remember Republican leaders saying if we passed the plan, it would crater the economy. I remember Republican leaders telling us if we passed the plan it would increase unemployment, it would increase inflation, that it would cost jobs, that it would wreck the economy. They were wrong, and they were wrong on every single count. They said: If you raise taxes on the wealthiest 1 percent, and you cut spending, it is going to create a nightmare. They were wrong. They were absolutely wrong. 
   Maybe we are not reminding people enough. Maybe we are not learning the lessons of the past, but we have to because we should not go back to the days of deficits and debt that put this economy in the ditch. 
   So I am very hopeful we will learn from the past and we will recognize that to come out here, based on a projection over the next 10 years, to justify a massive tax-scheme giveaway that blows a hole in the budget, blows a hole in the deficit, leads 
   us back to the path of debt and is a profound mistake. 
   It makes us all feel good. I would love to have a tax cut. I have two kids in college, and it is expensive. But I care more about their long-term future. I care about them inheriting a world that is less debt-laden than what we have done to them so far. Because our generation--and here it is--has taken the debt from 1980, and here we are today. This is what we have done with the national debt. We have run up the debt from less than $1 trillion to nearly $4 trillion.

   Mr. CONRAD. That is what we have done in our generation. We have taken this national debt of less than $1 trillion and run it up to nearly $4 trillion. That is the publicly held debt. Gross debt is even higher. But this is publicly held debt. 
   Is that the legacy we want to leave, that we ran up the debt on our watch? I do not think so. This is what could happen if we stay the course. This is what the Congressional Budget Office tells us could happen if we stay the course. We could actually eliminate publicly held debt over the next 15 years. But it will not happen with this plan because we apparently all have our hand out. We want to take care of ourselves first and forget about the future. I hope that is not the legacy we leave.

   Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, we are making progress. I can feel the concrete breaking. I don't think we are quite there yet because at this point this is not a bipartisan proposal before us. There has not really been a negotiation between the two sides. There has been a negotiation on the other side. 
   There are a number of things I believe are deficient in terms of the proposal that is before us. We do not keep the promise of the disaster package of last year. We devised a formula. We didn't fully fund it. The result was that people got 85 percent of what was promised. 
   No. 2, there is not sufficient money for the crop losses that are occurring now. Some say, well, we don't know the full amount. That is true. But I can tell you that we know enough to know that $400 million is not going to solve the problem. In my State alone, we know the flooded land losses. We absolutely know what has occurred there. Three million acres have not even been planted and millions more planted late. 
   In the Democratic alternative, we have $250 million for flooded lands. I don't see anything specifically set aside in this proposal--not $1 is set aside--specifically to address the problem of flooded lands. That is just not acceptable. Partly because of the way this came about, I suppose it is the result. 
   We have not had a true discussion. We basically had the other side saying this is it, take it or leave it. On that basis, we don't have much choice but to leave it because it does not address the needs of the people we represent. 
   I say that as a preface to the remarks that are more positive; that is, there are some very good parts of the proposal the Senator has advanced, the chief being the crop insurance of $400 million. That goes in exactly the right direction.

   Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, it is kind of fun to have these debates. I look forward to a chance to once again talk about how the world sugar industry works. 
   The Senator from Arizona indicated that we are having to pay three times the world market price because of the sugar program. It is just not right. That isn't the case. It appears to be the case, but it is wrong. Here is the reason it is wrong. 
   The vast majority of sugar in the world doesn't sell on the world market. The vast majority of sugar in the world sells under contract. Those contract prices are much higher than the so-called world market price. The world market price is a dumping price. It is what happens when producers produce more than they contracted for. They take that excess and they dump it on the market and sell it at fire sale prices. 
   The world market price they talk about is, in fact, not a world market price. It does not represent what sugar sells for. It is totally misleading. As a result, you come to a wrong conclusion. 
   The truth is that the last time we took away the sugar program, what happened to the price of sugar? Did the price of sugar go down? Does anybody remember? The price of sugar shot up. My, what a surprise. 
   This sugar program is supposed to be producing higher prices. Yet when it was removed the last time, sugar prices  did not go down; they went up. In fact, they went up dramatically. 
   It is because people do not understand how the sugar market works. This program in effect stabilizes prices. 
   Every country has a sugar program. In fact, every country that is a producer has a program. Our major competitors spend much more on theirs than we do on ours. 
   This program helps stabilize prices for consumers and for producers. 
   When sugar prices fall, do candy prices fall? Let's go back and look. Let's check the record. Interestingly enough, the last time we saw sugar prices fall we also saw candy prices go up. We saw cereal prices go up. The fact is there is almost no relationship between the price of sugar and the finished products that some are talking about. 
   In fact, this program stabilizes prices for consumers and for producers. 
   Finally, on the question of who benefits, those who are producers clearly benefit from stabilization. I believe those who are consumers benefit from stabilization. In my State, we are not talking about a bunch of rich folks; we are talking about family farmers who are in deep trouble right now. If we take away this program, they will be in even deeper trouble.

   Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, this is an attempt to have a pure compromise between the two sides on the question of disaster relief for agriculture. The Democratic plan previously proposed was at $10.8 billion. The Republican plan that we started with was $6.9 billion. This is for $8.8 billion. First, it compromises on the money. 
   Second, on the payment methodology, it adopts what the Republicans have insisted on, the use of enhanced AMTA payments for income support. This is a sincere attempt to compromise on the question of disaster relief. 
   Beyond that, there are significant differences. This is a disaster bill that actually has disaster aid. Our amendment has $500 million set aside for 1999 crop income losses. There is nothing in the underlying amendment. Let me repeat that for people who are listening, and for our colleagues. Our amendment has $500 million for 1999 crop income losses from droughts and floods. The underlying amendment has zero. We are talking about a disaster bill that, on the Republican side, does not have disaster provisions. It has provisions to offset the dramatic loss from the plummeting crop prices, but it does not have provisions to address drought or flooded lands. 
   In addition, the underlying amendment has no money for the unmet 1998 disaster assistance promise that was made. Last year, the government came up short. We gave farmers compensation based on a formula. They got 85 percent of what Congress had promised. My amendment improves on that. It closes the gap between what was promised and what was delivered. The underlying amendment has no money for dairy. Our proposal has $200 million for dairy. The underlying amendment has no money for price reporting. We have a modest amount of money for that. The underlying amendment has no money for agricultural mediation. We have a small amount of money for that. 
   In addition, the underlying amendment has no money for section 32 commodity purchases to address the drought and the livestock price collapse that we have seen for hogs. Our amendment does.  
   The underlying amendment, the Cochran amendment, is at $7.5 billion. Our amendment is at $8.8 billion. It represents a pure compromise on the dollars. It represents an acceptance of the Republican payment mechanism--all AMTA payments. As I have indicated, the other differences are as follows: The underlying amendment has about $200 million for specialty crops; we have $300 million. The underlying amendment has $325 million for livestock assistance and section 32; we have $550 million. The underlying amendment has nothing for 1999 crop income losses; we have $500 million. The underlying amendment has nothing for dairy; we have $200 million. The underlying amendment has nothing for the unmet 1998 disaster promise; we have $162 million. The underlying amendment has money for tobacco farmers; so do we. 
   We also have some miscellaneous provisions and deal with raising payment limits. We have the same approach as in the Republican proposal. 
   This is an attempt to have a straightforward compromise between the two positions. I hope very much our colleagues will accept it. I reserve the remainder of my time.

   Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I wanted an opportunity to talk about the farm crisis that is now facing our country, and certainly facing my State. I represent North Dakota, which is one of the most agricultural States in the Nation. There is no question that our farmers are facing a crisis of really unprecedented proportion. 
   As I go around my State, every place that I have a farm meeting, farmers have a sense of hopelessness. One of the reasons is that is happening to farm income. I have just come from a hearing where the Secretary of Agriculture is testifying. We were talking there about the pattern of farm income. It is very interesting, if you back out Government payments, which have been increasing now in the last several years in response to this economic calamity--in 1996, farm income absent Government payments was $46 billion. 
   This year farm income, absent Government payments, is estimated to be $27 billion. Farm income from the prices that farmers receive for the commodities they sell is in a virtual free-fall. 
   This chart shows headlines from the newspapers back home talking about what is happening to farm prices. The first one is from the major paper in our State: ``Going down, down, down. USDA sees lower prices for wheat, corn, soybeans, and other major crops.'' 
   Another major story: ``Lower crop prices predicted.'' 
   Again, the story is the same--collapsing farm prices. 
   Farmers have been hurt by more than low prices. They have been hurt by what I call the ``triple whammy'' of bad prices, bad weather, and bad policy. 
   The bad prices are right at the heart of what is causing this farm collapse. This chart shows farm prices of two major commodities, wheat and barley, for a 53-year period. It really tells the story. 
   These are inflation-adjusted prices. So we are comparing apples to apples. 
   These are what farmers have been receiving for these major commodities from 1946 to 1999. You can see that the blue line is wheat. Wheat has gone from almost $18 a bushel back in the 1940s to about $2.50 a bushel today--a long-term price decline without many real interruptions, although we saw a major one back in the 1970s. We all remember that period when farm prices skyrocketed. But absent that, we have really been in a long-term price decline for wheat, barley, and many other commodities as well. 
   I think this chart tells a very important story because it compares the prices farmers receive for what they sell and the prices they pay for what they buy. 
   The green line goes back to 1991 and shows what prices farmers are paying for the inputs that they must buy to produce crops. You can see that the prices farmers pay have been going up very sharply. On the other hand, prices that farmers have been receiving went up to a peak in 1996--interestingly enough, right at the time we passed the last farm bill. In fact, we were told at the time we would see permanently high farm prices. That proved to be absolutely wrong. Those permanently high prices lasted about 90 days. Since then, we have seen a virtual price collapse. 
   Just as I indicated before, prices farmers have been receiving have been dropping dramatically, and the prices for the things they pay have been rising inexorably. That creates this enormous gap between the prices they are paying and the prices they are receiving. That is what has led to that reduction in farm income I talked about in my initial remarks. This is a crisis by any definition. 
   If we look at what is happening to individual commodities in relationship to the prices farmers receive and the actual costs of producing those commodities, we can see it very clearly. 
   This is what has happened with respect to wheat prices. The green line is the cost of production. The red line is the prices farmers are receiving for their product. You can see the prices farmers receive are far below the costs of producing the product. That is what has led to this cash flow crunch. That is why farmers are telling us: If you do not take dramatic action, tens of thousands of us are going to go out of business. 
   In my State, the estimates are that we will lose 20 or 30 percent of our farmers in the next 18 months unless we act. Let me repeat that. In North Dakota, we are being told by the experts at the State university and major farm organizations that unless we act we will lose 20 to 30 percent of the farmers in my State in the next 18 months. That is a crisis. 
   It is not just in wheat. You see the same pattern. This is soybeans. We don't grow many soybeans in North Dakota. Soybeans are grown further south and to the east. But you can see the same kind of pattern. 
   Here is the cost of production. Here is what the farmers are receiving. Since 1997, farmers are well below the cost of production with respect to soybeans. In wheat, the pattern is the same, and in soybeans. But there are other crops as well that are critically important. 
   This shows what has happened in corn. The red line again is the price. The green line is the cost of production. Since 1997, we have been below the cost of production in corn. 
   You can't stay in business very long in that circumstance. You can't stay in business very long when you are getting less in terms of a price for your product than what it costs you to produce that product. You can hang in there a while as you give up equity and as you go backwards on your balance sheet, but at some point the banker comes calling. He says: Mr. farmer, you are out of business. You can't continue to lose equity. 
   The result has been that we have started to lose farm families in my State in a very dramatic way. Back in 1989 we had over 28,000 family farmers in our State. We can see that we held that in 1990, and in 1991 we saw a drop of about a thousand farmers. Then, in 1992, we actually got some recovery. In 1993, we dropped down to about 26,000. Since then, it has been a constant erosion, so that now we are down to about 22,000 family-sized farms in our State. It is really a dramatic decline in the last 20 years--almost a 20-percent drop. 
   Remember what I said. The experts are telling us now that we could see another 20-percent drop in just the next 18 months--perhaps even more than that; perhaps even as much as a 30-percent loss unless we act. 
   What are the reasons for this? Part of the reason is the financial collapse in Asia and the financial collapse in Russia because those were major customers for our farm commodities. But there are other reasons as well. 
   I believe one of the key reasons is the budget decisions that were made at the time of the last farm bill. The last farm bill had some strengths to it, some pluses. The biggest strength, I believe, is the flexibility it provided to farmers to plant for the market rather than a farm program. But we also made some budget decisions at the time that made it very difficult to write any kind of reasonable farm bill. 
   This chart shows what I am talking about. It shows the resources that were provided to agriculture under the previous farm bill. That averaged $10 billion a year. The new farm bill provided $5 billion a year. In other words, the support for agriculture was cut in half at the time of the last farm bill. 
   That has special implications because if we look at what was happening  with our major competitors, we see that they were doing something quite differently. While we were dramatically cutting our support for producers, our European competitors--our major competitors--were maintaining very high levels of support. The Europeans were spending, on average, $44 billion a year--on average, $6 billion for us. This is from 1996 to 1999, just those 3 years. You can see that the Europeans really have us whipsawed. They are outspending us seven to one. They are winning their competition the old-fashioned way. They are buying these markets. That is what the Europeans are up to. 
   Unfortunately, we are engaged in unilateral disarmament. We are cutting in the face of massive superiority on the other side. One of the chief trade negotiators for the Europeans told me several years ago: Senator, we believe we are in a trade war in agriculture. We believe at some point there will be a cease-fire. We believe there will be a cease-fire in place, and we want to occupy the high ground. The high ground is market share. 
   That is exactly what they are up to. And how well it is working. They have gone, in 20 years, from being major importers to being major exporters. 
   In fact, they have surpassed the United States in terms of agriculture exports. One of the ways they have done it is to spend enormous sums of money to put themselves in a position of superiority. 
   This chart shows how the European Union is flooding the world with agricultural export subsidies. This is the European share of world agricultural export subsidies, accounting for nearly 84 percent of all world agricultural export subsidies; the United States' share, this little red piece of the pie, is 1.4 percent. They are outgunning the United States 60 to 1. 
   It is no wonder farm income is declining. It is no wonder exports are declining. It is no wonder our farmers are under enormous pressure. They are under enormous pressure because our European friends have a plan and a strategy to dominate world agricultural trade. Again, they are doing it the old-fashioned way: They are buying these markets. They think the United States is asleep. They think we will not fight back. They have told me: Senator, we think you are so prosperous in so many other areas, you will give up on agriculture. 
   So far, we are proving them right. We are engaged in unilateral disarmament in a trade confrontation. We would never do it in a military confrontation. Why are we doing it? Why are we giving up and letting them dominate world agricultural trade? What are the implications this fall when we go to negotiate with them? I can tell you what I believe the implications are. I believe we are headed for a guaranteed loss. 
   I was referring to the trade negotiator for the Europeans saying to me they believe we are in a trade war. They believe at some point there will be a cease-fire. They believe there will be a cease-fire in place, and they want to occupy the high ground. The high ground is market share. He is right. That is the high ground. We are headed into negotiations with them this fall, and we have no leverage. How will we possibly get a good result when they have America outspent 7 to 1 in overall support, 60 to 1 in export subsidies? How are we going to win that negotiation? What is our leverage to change this relationship? There is no leverage. We are going to lose unless we do something. 
   I personally believe we have to rearm in agriculture, to put more resources into the fight, to send the Europeans a clear and unmistakable message that the United States is not going to roll over; we are not going to surrender; we are not going to wave a white flag and turn over world agricultural trade to them; we will insist on a level playing field. 
   In the last trade negotiation, that gap existed as well. The Europeans have a much higher level of support than we have. Did that gap close? Did our level of support go up? Did the European level go down? Did the gap close? No, it did not. Instead, we got equal percentage reductions on both sides from an unequal base, leaving the Europeans in the superior position. 
   If we look back at the last trade negotiation, we got a 36-percent reduction in export trade subsidy and a 24-percent reduction in internal support on both sides. But the Europeans were at a much higher level. When there are equal percentage reductions from unequal bases, the Europeans remain in a superior position. It does not take a whole lot to figure out that if we continue that pattern of equal percentage reductions from an unequal basis, we will continue to leave the Europeans in a superior position; we will continue to leave our farmers at a competitive disadvantage; we will continue to sign the death warrant of tens of thousands of family farmers. 
   That is the hard reality of what we confront. We have before the Senate a disaster response. It is clearly called for. It is clearly necessary to meet this collapse of farm income and to meet these adverse weather conditions. 
   With respect to weather, in my State there are 3 million acres of land not even planted this year. There are millions more planted very late because of overly wet conditions. It may sound strange out here on the east coast. I saw a story in an east coast newspaper that in one location they are out painting the grass green because of the drought. We can't paint a crop; we can't go out and paint wheat and somehow make it healthy. We can't paint corn. It doesn't work. Maybe one can paint a lawn. I have never seen that done. It sounds rather bizarre to me, but that is what they were doing in New Jersey the other day. They were painting the lawn green, trying to respond to this drought. That is an unusual response. But it is not going to work in agriculture. Farmers in West Virginia, in Delaware, and in Maryland cannot go out and paint a crop. That will not do the job. The fact is, they don't have a crop. 
   In my part of the country it is not drought; it is overly wet conditions, 5 and 6 years of incredibly wet conditions. You cannot even get into the fields to plant. There has to be a disaster response. It has to deal with the bad weather. It has to deal with these ruinously low prices. Yes, it has to deal with the bad policy of putting our farmers at a severe disadvantage to their European competitors. 
   We are telling our farmers: Go out there and compete against the French farmer, the German farmer; and while you are at it, take on the French and German Governments as well. That is not a fair fight. We have to help level the playing field. 
   Yes, there has to be a disaster response, absolutely. But there has to be more than that. There has to be a long-term policy response. We have to be able to say to our European competitors that the United States is not going to roll over; we are not going to surrender; we are not going to give up the agricultural markets; we intend to fight. 
   That is why I have introduced legislation we call the Fight bill, Farm Income and Equity Act, to level the playing field. If the Europeans are going to play the game this way, we will play it that way. We will fight back. We will put our farmers in a place that they can compete. That is fair. That puts us in a position to go to the next trade talks and have a chance to come out winners rather than losers.

    Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise today to celebrate the Icelandic heritage of our country and of the state of North Dakota. 
   For a century it has been North Dakota's custom to set aside time to honor the contributions of Icelanders to North Dakota. In order to honor the thousands of people of Icelandic descent that reside in my state, the Governor has proclaimed July 30 to August 2 as Icelandic Heritage Days. 
   Icelandic Heritage Days culminates with a celebration of the historical presentation of a new constitution to the Icelandic Parliament. This occurred on August the second, or ``August the Deuce,'' as many Icelanders call it, 1874 by King Kristjan the Ninth. This action formally freed Iceland from hundreds of years of Danish rule. 
   In 1878, people of Icelandic descent first settled in northeastern North Dakota. Since this time, Icelandic-Americans have been instrumental in the development of their communities and my state. One settler, E.H. Bergman, was a member of the Territorial Legislature, which passed legislation enabling the establishment of the states of North and South Dakota. Since Bergman's time, many more people of Icelandic descent have represented  their constituencies in the ND Legislature and state government. 
   Mr. President, this year's celebration is especially noteworthy because an honored dignitary, the Honorable Olafur Ragnar Grimsson, the President of Iceland, will be in attendance. This visit will mark the first time that an Icelandic head-of-state has visited North Dakota. 
   It is a pleasure to have President Grimsson visit North Dakota, and a privilege to honor Icelandic-Americans for all they have done for North Dakota and this great country.

   Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, this amendment, I believe, addresses a critical national need. The Commerce Department tells us we have a shortage of information technology workers of 34,000 and that that will grow by 130,000 a year every year for the next 10 years. This amendment seeks to deal with that situation by providing for a tax credit of 20 percent, up to a limit of $6,000 per worker per year. 
   This means that the Federal Government would be in partnership with businesses training high-technology workers. The company would have to put up 80 percent of the cost, the Federal Government, through a tax credit, 20 percent. This is a reasonable response to a critical national need. 
   This amendment is cosponsored by Senator REID of Nevada, Senator ROBB of Virginia, and Senator ABRAHAM of Michigan. It is endorsed by the Information Technology Association of America, the Software Information Industry Association, the American Society for Training and Development, Cisco Systems, EDS, Intel, Microsoft, Texas Instruments, and many others.

   Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Community Development Financial Institutions Fund Technical Corrections Act. 
   This legislation will make the CDFI program more responsive to low-population rural areas. It will allow the program to fulfill its mission of building the capacity of financial institutions in parts of the country that have experienced chronic, sustained out-migration in recent years. 
   As many of my colleagues know, the CDFI Fund was established by the Riegle Community Development and Regulatory Improvement Act of 1994. This program is intended to stimulate the creation and expansion of diverse community development financial institutions. The fund invests federal resources in--and builds the capacity of--private, for-profit and nonprofit financial institutions, leveraging private capital and private-sector talent and creativity. The fund invests in CDFI's using flexible tools such as equity investments, loans, grants, and deposits, depending upon market and institutional needs. 
   The Core Component is the CDFI Fund's main program. In order to be certified for funding, an entity must demonstrate that it has a primary mission of promoting community development, principally serves an underserved investment area or targeted population, makes loan or development investments as its predominant business activity, provides development services, maintains accountability to its target market, and is a non-government entity. 
   In order for a geographical area to be eligible for investment, one of a number of objectively-defined economic distress criteria must be met. 
   The problem, Mr. President, is that the objective measures of economic distress as currently defined by the CDFI Fund do not fully reflect economic distress in low-population areas. Allow me to share just a couple examples with my colleagues. 
   First, significant parts of low-population rural states like North Dakota have historically low unemployment rates and therefore cannot qualify on that basis. In many rural areas unemployment remains statistically nearly non-existent despite--and in fact because of--a lack of non-agricultural jobs. In rural North Dakota, the unemployed have little choice but to leave for urban areas. 
   The result is unemployment rates as low as two or three percent in rural parts of my state and the misleading  impression of a strong economy. It is also worth noting that such rural areas often suffer from high underemployment, rather than high unemployment. 
   Additionally, the CDFI Fund program considers an area economically distressed if median family income is at or below 80 percent of the national average, or if the percentage of the population living in poverty is at least 20 percent. Here again, Mr. President, these criteria do not accurately capture the level of economic distress in low-population rural areas. Prolonged out-migration in many rural areas due to the loss of family farms and a shortage of non-agricultural jobs keeps median incomes at higher levels. 
   There are other economic distress criteria in the CDFI program, Mr. President, but they all share one thing in common: they all fail to fully register the unique economic distress found in a good part of rural America. 
   This leads me to the most frustrating aspect of the CDFI program for many low-population rural areas. Current CDFI guidelines consider an area economically distressed and suffering from out-migration if county population loss between 1980 and 1990 was at least 10 percent. This effort to utilize out-migration figures as a measure of economic distress is laudable. However, the CDFI program does so in a manner that does nothing for many parts of rural America, including my state. 
   Mr. President, change in the size of a population has two components. One is what demographers term natural population growth. This is computed by subtracting deaths from births. The other variable is migration, which is determined by subtracting departures from arrivals. 
   If you assumed that out-migration-related economic distress was determined under the CDFI program by looking at out-migration numbers, you would be mistaken. In fact, birth and mortality rates are effectively factored into calculations of out-migration. 
   Instead of net migration loss, the determinate criterion under current CDFI guidelines is the change in the overall sum total of the population from 1980 to 1990. Consequently, many counties that have experienced a continual hemorrhage of population to the cities, but also which have robust birth rates and long life expectancies, have not qualified for the CDFI program. 
   Mr. President, this makes no sense. Natality and mortality rates have nothing to do with out-migration. 
   Just a couple of statistics illustrate why this problem needs to be fixed. Nearly every non-metro county in North Dakota experienced a more than 10 percent net migration loss between 1980 and 1990. However, today only slightly more than two thirds of rural North Dakota counties qualify for the CDFI program because the program's guidelines measure overall population change, not net migration loss. Birth rates have been high enough and lifespans long enough to hide the real story of out-migration in a dozen counties in my state. 
   Mr. President, instead of wheat or sunflowers, the top export in many parts of farm country is people. Unless they can find work in the shrinking agriculture industry, increasing numbers of Americans who were born and raised in the rural Upper Great Plains are being forced to the cities to find work. They become statistics in a continuing and under-recognized exodus driven by economic depression, one that is destroying two of our nation's greatest assets: its small towns and family farms. 
   Mr. President, I want to see the CDFI program work for rural America, to help save our rural communities and keep people on the land. Today, I am introducing legislation that will help it do just that. 
   Mr. President, my bill is very simple. It amends the Riegle Community Development and Regulatory Improvement Act of 1994 to allow non-metro counties to qualify for the CDFI program if net migration loss--rather than just overall population loss--was at least 10 percent during the years 1980 to 1990. 
   Let me be clear: my bill does not strike any part of the Riegle Act and does not make major revisions to that landmark legislation. Rather, my bill makes a technical, perfecting correction that will help make the CDFI Fund work as intended for rural America. Consequently, I have entitled this measure the CDFI Technical Corrections Act. 
   Eighteen states and the District of Columbia, had populations of fewer than two million people during the 1990 Census, Mr. President. That is roughly one-third of the states. Yet of all the Core Component loans the CDFI Fund has made over the past three years, only about 12 percent have been to entities in these low-population states. The CDFI economic distress criteria need to be changed to more accurately reflect the level of economic distress in much of rural America. I urge my colleagues to join me in fixing the CDFI economic distress criteria by passing my technical corrections bill.

   Mr. CONRAD. I thank the distinguished Senator from New York. 
   I rise to urge my colleagues to resist the move to waive the budget procedures. I think it is important to remember the history. The budget reconciliation process was devised to expedite consideration of deficit reduction measures. That was the purpose. 
   The bill before the Senate now perverts that process by using expedited procedures to secure enactment of a measure to increase the deficit. Fortunately, Senator BYRD crafted the Byrd rule to prevent abuse of reconciliation's expedited procedures. He did that to protect the fiscal integrity of the United States. This move to waive that rule is a move to undermine the fiscal integrity of the process. It ought to be resisted by every Member, especially those who profess to be conservative. 
   Section 313(b)(e) of the Byrd rule provides that any provision in the reconciliation bill that would decrease revenue in years beyond the budget window violates the Byrd rule and would be automatically stricken from the bill upon a point of order being waived. 
   It is clear this measure, this risky tax cut scheme, explodes in the second 10 years. 
   This chart shows what happens with the tax scheme being proposed. It starts out modestly, but it grows geometrically. In the second 10 years, it absolutely explodes. It goes from being an $800 billion tax cut over the first 10 years to being over a $2 trillion tax cut in the second 10 years.

   Mr. CONRAD. The Senator is exactly right. The tax cut alone in the second 10 years is nearly $2 trillion. Obviously, there are additional costs. Because of additional interest costs, if you spend the money or run it in tax cuts, you lose the interest earnings. So you add to the interest costs of the United States. That is why Senator BYRD put in place this very wise rule, so we would not undermine the fiscal integrity of the United States. Now there is a move to waive that rule. It ought to be resisted. It ought to be defeated. 
   This morning a column in the Washington Post by Robert Samuelson addressed this issue in ``The Reagan Tax Myth.'' He pointed out the danger, the riskiness, the radical nature of the tax proposal before the Senate, and pointed out that it is all based on projections that very well may not come true. 
   In fact, he pointed out:  
   ..... there is no case for big tax cuts based merely on paper projections of budget surpluses.  
   He pointed out:  
   The projections, for example, assume a steep drop in both defense spending and domestic discretionary spending that may be unwise, particularly for defense.  
   He goes on to say:  
   Suppose that spending exceeds projections by one percentage point of national income and that tax revenues fall below projections by the same amount. In today's dollars, these errors--not out of line with past mistakes--would total about $170 billion annually. Most of the future surpluses would vanish.  
   They would vanish. 
   Mr. President, I think it is very important. We have heard repeatedly from our friends on the other side of the aisle that they are only providing 25 percent of the surplus in tax cuts. They are not telling the whole story. They are being very selective about what they tell the American people. They say we have $3 trillion of projected surpluses--projected. Let's remember they are projected; they may  not happen. And they say they are only providing $800 billion of tax relief. 
   I ask for 1 additional minute.

   Mr. CONRAD. If we check their math, we find the story is quite a bit different from the way they are telling it. Of the total surplus over the next 10 years, $2.9 trillion, nearly $2 trillion of it is Social Security surplus. Are they talking about spending some of this Social Security surplus? Are they talking about once again raiding the Social Security surplus? If they are not, then this should be taken right out of the calculation. 
   Then we have to take out an additional amount, about $130 billion, because if you provide tax cuts, or you spend the money, interest cost goes up. So now you are down, instead of $3 trillion, to $870 billion. And they are talking about a $800 billion tax cut. They are not using a quarter of the money, unless they intend to use Social Security funds. Fairly described, they are talking about using 94 percent of the non-Social Security surplus for a risky tax cut scheme based entirely on projections, projections that might not come true, and in the second 10 years those tax cuts explode, endangering the fiscal integrity of this Government. 
   My God, after the progress we have made to eliminate the deficit and create surpluses in the last 6 years, to turn our back on that and take the risk of putting this economic expansion in jeopardy? It is wild. It is risky. It should not happen. And the move to waive the budget rules that protect the fiscal integrity of this country ought to be defeated.

   Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Chair and the ranking member, the Senator from New York. 
   The Senator from Missouri misspoke. He said that those of us on this side have not supported saving every penny of the Social Security surplus for Social Security. He is simply wrong. The budget we offered on our side not only saves every penny of the Social Security surplus for Social Security; in addition, we proposed saving an additional $300 billion over the next 10 years to strengthen and preserve Medicare.  
   So not only did we propose saving every penny of the Social Security surplus for Social Security, we also proposed taking another $300 billion and using it to preserve and protect Medicare. 
   The thing that is really jolting about this discussion is what is in this column that I referred to earlier by Robert Samuelson in the Washington Post today. He says:  
   The wonder is that the Republicans are so wedded to a program that is dubious as [to] both policy and politics. As Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan noted the other day, tax cuts might someday be justified to revive the economy from a recession or to improve the prospects of a sweeping program of tax simplification. But there's no case for big tax cuts based merely on paper projections of budget surpluses.  
   Members of the Senate, that is what is so radical about this proposal--radical, risky, dangerous. This proposal not only has massive tax cuts--94 percent of all the non-Social Security surplus over the next 10 years--but it absolutely explodes in the outyears. A tax cut that is $800 billion in the first 10 years becomes $2 trillion and costs an additional $1 trillion of interest. That is exactly what the Byrd amendment was designed to prevent. The whole reason there are expedited procedures in budget reconciliation is to reduce deficits. 
   Our friends on the other side are trying to use those expedited procedures on a measure that would increase deficits--blow a hole in the budget, potentially a hole of over $3 trillion. That is dangerous. That is not conservative. It is radical. It is risky. It is reckless. 
   When they say they are only using 25 percent of what is available--nonsense, absolute nonsense. Of the $3 trillion that is projected--and, remember, just as Mr. Samuelson points out--if these projections just change a little bit, as they have over and over and over in our history, these projections of surplus could change to projections of deficit, and we will rue the day when we have undermined the dramatic moves we have made toward fiscal responsibility in getting this country back on track.

   Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Chair and thank the Senator from New York. 
   I thought it might be helpful to review the record on how we got to where we are today as we put in context the choices that Senators have to make. 
   I think it is helpful to go back to 1981, the Reagan administration, and look at what happened to deficits and debt during that period, and compare it to the Bush administration and the Clinton administration, so that we understand how we got to where we are today and what the implications are for the proposals before us. 
   If we go back to the Reagan administration, I think we all recall the economic history. We had, then, a major tax cut. The results were clear. The deficits exploded. The debt exploded. 
   Then, in the Bush administration, we saw a further explosion of deficits, until in the last year of the Bush administration we reached a budget deficit of $290 billion. The national debt had tripled under the Reagan administration. 
   In 1993, we passed a plan, on the Democratic side, without a single vote from the Republican side, a 5-year plan to reduce the deficits and restore our economic health. 
   That plan worked and worked beautifully. We saw reductions in the deficit in every year of this plan. We saw in the first year the deficit go down to $255 billion, and then we saw declines in the deficit until we reach surplus. 
   That is the record of these three administrations. 
   In 1993, when we passed a 5-year plan that put us on the path to deficit reduction, we had increased taxes on the wealthiest 1 percent of taxpayers on income taxes and cut spending. That is how we achieved balance. 
   If we look at it from another vantage point, debt held by the public, we can see during the 1880s the debt held by the public grew dramatically. It was only after we passed the 1993 5-year plan that debt held by the public started coming down. 
   In fact, here we are today; we have seen significant progress made on debt held by the public being reduced. If we have the wisdom to stay on this course, we will see further declines in the publicly held debt. In fact, we can be on a course to eliminate the publicly held debt in 15 years. 
   What have been the results of this economic policy? The results have been a resurgence in our national economic lives--the lowest inflation rate in 33 years, the lowest unemployment rate in 41 years, and we have seen the best economic performance since the Johnson administration back in the 1960s. 
   We can see the rates of growth of various administrations. In the Clinton administration we see an economic growth rate of nearly 4 percent. We compare that to the Bush administration, 1.3 percent; 3 percent under Reagan; the Carter administration, and so on. So we have seen a period of sustained economic growth--in fact, the longest economic expansion in our history. 
   In addition to the other positive benefits, we have seen a dramatic reduction in the welfare caseload. This is largely a result of the economy. It is also a result of the welfare reform proposal that we passed a number of years ago. The percentage on welfare is the lowest in 29 years. 
   All of this is jeopardized. All of this is jeopardized by the risky, radical, reckless proposal that is before us from our friends on the other side of the aisle. Interestingly enough, the very people who are advocating this proposal said, about the 1993 plan that has formed the basis of the deficit reduction and the economic resurgence of this country, that that plan would not work. 
   The distinguished chairman of the Finance Committee said about the 1993 plan:  
   It will flatten the economy.  
   Senator GRAMM of Texas, a member of the Finance Committee, said:  
   We are buying a one-way ticket to recession.  
   The truth: The economy has reached a new milestone--the longest peacetime expansion on record.  
   We had a former President who said: Facts are stubborn things. Indeed, they are. The fact is the 1993 5-year plan, that passed without a single vote on the Republican side, reduced the deficit and formed the basis for an economic resurgence in this country. 
   Our friends on the other side of the aisle, the very ones who are here with a radical, risky plan, were the ones who were wrong about the 1993 plan. In fact, Senator GRAMM, who was just speaking, said at the time about the 1993 plan:  
   I want to predict here tonight that if we adopt this bill the American economy is going to get weaker and not stronger, the deficit four years from [now] will be higher than it is today and not lower ..... when all is said and done, people will pay more taxes, the economy will create fewer jobs, Government will spend more money, and the American people will be worse off.  
   Senator GRAMM was wrong on virtually every count. 
   The fact is, the 1993 plan reduced the deficit and kicked off this extraordinary economic expansion: the lowest unemployment rate in 41 years, the lowest inflation rate in 33 years. The fact is, the very folks who are now advocating this radical, risky plan were wrong in 1993, and not just a little bit wrong; they were dead wrong. 
   Now, let's check their math. It is fascinating what I have heard on the floor today. Over and over the message is that we have a $3 trillion surplus and we are only using one-quarter of it for tax relief. Let's check that. 
   The truth is, the total surplus that is projected over the next 10 years is $2.9 trillion, according to the Congressional Budget Office. But what they haven't been saying on the floor is that $1.9 trillion of that, nearly two-thirds, is Social Security surplus. So you have to subtract that. That leaves a surplus of $1 trillion. When you take out the additional interest cost that will accrue, if you are going to give a tax cut of $130 billion, you are left with $870 billion that is available of non-Social Security surplus. 
   What do our friends on the other side of the aisle want to do with this $870 billion? They say, let's take $800 billion, or nearly that, and give it in a tax cut, a risky tax cut that has the potential to blow a hole in the fiscal discipline we have established--$800 billion of tax cut out of $870 billion that is available. That is not 25 percent, that is 94 percent, 94 percent of the non-Social Security surplus being used for a tax cut--not 25 percent, 94 percent. 
   It is very interesting, the choices that leaves us with. We have nothing for Medicare under the Republican plan, nothing to strengthen Medicare, nothing for domestic needs over the next 10 years, and they have got unallocated $63 billion. 
   Compare that to the Democratic plan that saves every penny of the Social Security surplus for Social Security and then, in equal thirds, one-third for tax relief, $290 billion--$500 billion less than our friends on the other side--$290 billion to strengthen and protect Medicare, and $290 billion for high-priority domestic needs. 
   I think it is critically important that people understand when we talk about domestic needs, what are we talking about for the next 10 years? This chart shows what happens if we just have constant buying power over the 10 years, which is represented by this blue line. That is constant buying power. 
   Our friends on the other side say the Democrats just want to spend money. Let's look at the Democratic plan. 
   I have just indicated we want $290 billion for domestic needs. That represents this red line. That is a cut in buying power for the Federal Government from what we now have. If you just take last year's spending and add inflation, that is the blue line, constant buying power. 
   The Democrats are proposing cutting the buying power of the Federal Government. They are proposing cutting spending. 
   Here is what our Republican friends are talking about in terms of spending cuts, this green line. This green line means dramatic, radical cuts in education, in defense, in parks, in law enforcement. That is what they are talking about. Does anybody believe this is going to happen? Does anybody believe it? It is not even happening this year. 
   The Wall Street Journal reported yesterday that they are cooking the books on the Republican side because they want to 
   spend more money and want to act as if they are not breaking the caps. At some point we have to face reality and face facts. Facts are stubborn things. 
   This blue line is constant buying power. The Democratic plan proposes cutting Federal spending in real terms. The Republican plan proposes dramatic, draconian cuts, cuts that cannot be sustained, will not be sustained. In fact, they won't support them for defense, and they shouldn't. They are living with a fiction, and it is a fiction that is being revealed every day as the committees of Congress do their work. 
   Not only should we check their math but we should check the whole basis for the projections that are being made to sustain a tax cut. Let's remember, the money is not in the bank. The money is projected to come in. 
   I used to be in charge of projecting the revenue for my State of North Dakota. I can tell my colleagues, there is no 10-year projection that anybody can have great confidence in. 
   Robert Samuelson, in today's Washington Post, said:  
   The wonder is that the Republicans are so wedded to a program that is dubious as to both policy and politics. As Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan noted the other day, tax cuts might some day be justified, but there is no case for big tax cuts based merely on paper projections of budget surpluses.  
   In fact, he went on to indicate, if there was just a 1-percent change in revenue and expenditure from what is projected, these surpluses would vanish. That is very much in line with what mistakes have been in the past. 
   This tax cut scheme is not conservative; it is radical. It is risky. It is reckless. It poses the threat of undermining all of the work we have done to restore the fiscal integrity of this country that has played such a large role in restoring our fiscal health. This is not conservative. It is radical. It is risky. It is reckless. It ought to be stopped. 
   Now, our friends on the other side of the aisle say tax revenue is the highest it has been in a long time, but they are not telling the whole story. Here is what the revenue and expenditure line of the Federal Government looks like going back to 1980 and carrying through to today. 
   The blue line is the outlays of the Federal Government, the spending. The red line is the revenues. What we can see is, it has been pretty constant over time. The reason we had a deficit was that the spending line was above the revenue line--pretty basic stuff. 
   In 1993, when Democrats, without a single Republican vote, passed a plan to balance the budget, we reduced the spending line and we raised the revenue line. That is how we balanced the budget. We cut spending and, yes, we raised income taxes on the wealthiest 1 percent in this country. That is how we balanced the budget. That is how we got the deficit under control. That is how we got the lowest unemployment in 41 years. That is how we got the lowest inflation in 33 years. That is how we got 18 million jobs created. That is how we restored this country to economic health--by cutting spending and raising the revenue to balance the budget. 
   There is one thing they don't tell us much about because I don't think they want to deal with these facts. They are saying the taxes are the highest they have ever been. The tax revenue is the highest it has been in a considerable period. That is what helped us balance the budget, along with cutting spending. But what they have not talked about is what has happened to individual taxes. Most individual taxes in this country have gone down. It might surprise you to hear that after all the rhetoric on the other side. 
   These are not KENT CONRAD's calculations; these are the calculations of the respected accounting firm, Deloitte and Touche. These are the combined tax rates of income tax and Social Security taxes. It is very interesting. This is for a working mother, the tax burden, with a family income of just under $20,000 a year. In 1979, their tax rate----

   Mr. CONRAD. I would. I thank the Senator from New York. 
   It is very interesting; if we study what has happened to the individual tax  rates and tax burden of people in this country over 20 years, they have gone down. The Republican rhetoric suggests everybody's taxes are at record highs. It is not true. 
   It is not true. This is the accounting firm of Deloitte & Touche. They point out that for a working mother with an income of just under $20,000, in 1979, her combined tax rate was 8.6 percent. That has dropped to 5 percent today. Why? Because when the Democrats passed that budget balancing plan in 1993--it is true we raised taxes on the wealthiest 1 percent, but we cut taxes on the vast majority of Americans by expanding the earned-income tax credit. 
   Look at what happened to a middle-income family earning $35,000 a year. Their taxes have not gone up. They have gone down. Again, this is according to the respected accounting firm of Deloitte & Touche. In 1979, their combined tax rate--income tax and Social Security taxes--was 11.2 percent. That dropped to 10.5 percent in 1999, again, because when the Democrats passed the plan to balance the budget in 1993, we expanded the earned-income tax credit. 
   Look at a tax burden of a family of four earning $85,000, and look at the last 20 years. Again, their tax burden has been reduced. In 1979, it was 17 percent; it is 16.3 percent today. 
   Don't get me wrong. I am not suggesting that people don't deserve further tax relief. I believe they do. The Democratic proposal provides it. It provides it in a fair and balanced way, in a fiscally responsible way. 
   That is not the case of the risky, radical scheme of our friends on the other side. Their tax break explodes in the second 10-year period. We have just stopped that, at least momentarily. But this program that they have outlined of $800 billion in tax cuts explodes to $2 trillion, with the additional interest costs that would add another trillion to $3 trillion in the second 10-year period. That is risky. At the very time the baby boomers start to retire, they are going to undermine the fiscal stability of the country. 
   Those aren't the only issues that need to be addressed. We have already seen how their tax cut explodes in the outyears, just as the baby boomers retire. But we should also ask ourselves how fair is the tax cut scheme of our friends on the other side. 
   This shows the House bill that has already passed. Their idea of fairness is to give the top 1 percent of the people in this country 32 percent of the benefit. The top 1 percent get 32 percent of the benefits of the tax cut proposal of the Republicans in the House of Representatives, which has already passed. So for people earning under $38,000 a year, they would get, on average, $99. If you are earning over $300,000 a year, you get $20,000. That is not fair. That should not be the policy of the United States--a tax cut plan that is skewed to the richest and wealthiest among us, that gives 32 percent of the benefit to the richest 1 percent. That is not fair. It is not wise. It is radical; it is risky; it is reckless. 
   There is a better way. The Democratic alternative says save Social Security first--every penny of Social Security surplus for Social Security. And then for the non-Social Security surplus, to split it in equal thirds: one-third to protect Medicare, to extend its solvency, and to provide prescription drug coverage; one-third, tax reductions for working families, targeted squarely at the middle-income people in this country, the very ones who need tax relief; and one-third for high-priority domestic needs such as education, agriculture, defense, and law enforcement. 
   Again, that $290 billion doesn't even keep pace with inflation. We are cutting Federal spending, in real terms, in the Democratic proposal. 
   I might add that we have more debt reduction than the Republican plan. Let me make that as a final point. The Democratic plan has over $2 trillion of debt reduction. The Republican plan has just under $2 trillion. 
   I suggest to my colleagues that the Democratic plan is superior in every way--greater debt reduction, preserving the Social Security surplus for Social Security, preserving and protecting Medicare, providing for our high-priority domestic needs, and, yes, tax relief targeted at those who deserve it the most--not the wealthiest among us, but middle- and lower-income people who richly deserve some tax relief. 
   I thank the Chair and yield the floor.

    Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, today I am pleased to join Senator FRIST to introduce the Medicare Renal Dialysis Fair Payment Act of 1999. This legislation takes important steps to help sustain and improve the quality of care for Medicare beneficiaries suffering from kidney-failure. 
   Nationwide, more than 280,000 Americans live with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). In my state of North Dakota, the number of patients living with ESRD is relatively small, just over 600 per year. However, for these patients, and others across the country, access to dialysis treatments means the difference between life and death. 
   In 1972, the Congress took important steps to ensure that elderly and disabled individuals with kidney-failure receive appropriate dialysis care. At that time, Medicare coverage was extended to include dialysis treatments for beneficiaries with ESRD. 
   Over the last three decades, dialysis facilities have provided services to increasing numbers of kidney-failure patients under increasingly strict quality standards. However, it has come to my attention that reimbursement to dialysis facilities does not reflect the more stringent quality requirements placed upon dialysis providers. 
   Since 1983, reimbursement to dialysis facilities has actually declined. Today, according to the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (MedPAC), dialysis facilities receive on average $122 per treatment, compared with $138 per treatment that they received in 1983. Adjusting for inflation, this means that dialysis providers are only receiving about $42 per treatment (in 1983 dollars) to provide nursing, social work and dietitian care, as well as the actual dialysis treatment. 
   I am concerned that a continued erosion in Medicare payments to dialysis facilities could jeopardize beneficiaries' access to dialysis services. According to MedPAC, ``without an increase in the payment (i.e. composite rate) the quality of dialysis services may decline. Therefore, an update to the composite rate is recommended.'' Further, MedPAC has concluded that the majority of dialysis facilities now lose money on Medicare reimbursement and the problem is especially acute for small, rural, and non-profit dialysis facilities. In my state, we simply cannot afford to lose rural providers--including providers of dialysis services. 
   This legislation will ensure dialysis facilities have the resources to continue offering critical dialysis services to individuals with kidney failure. I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation.

   Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise to introduce new, permanent farm legislation. I think virtually everyone from farm country understands that our farmers have been hit by a triple whammy--the triple whammy of bad prices, bad weather, and bad policy. The results are catastrophic. 
   In my home State of North Dakota, one of the most agricultural States in the Nation, our farmers are being pressured as never before. They are in a cost price squeeze that is almost unprecedented. The results will be the loss of thousands of farm families unless there is a Federal response. 
   I think most of us know we need to have a disaster response because prices have collapsed, and adverse weather conditions continue across the country. So it is critically important that we take short-term steps to address what is happening in farm country. 
   A disaster bill is not enough. We need more than that. We also need to respond with a long-term change in farm policy. 
   If I could direct the attention of my colleagues and others who might be watching to this chart, when I talk about the triple whammy of bad prices, bad weather, and bad policy, this shows what has happened to prices over the last 53 years. The blue line shows what has happened to wheat prices; the red line to barley. As a viewer can see, we are now at the lowest level for these commodities in constant dollars in 53 years. 
   We are witnessing a price collapse that is almost unprecedented. That is putting enormous pressure on our producers. 
   In addition to that, in my State we have been hit by almost a 5-year pattern now of bad weather--weather that is overly wet in my State; other parts of the country it is overly dry. In North Dakota, we have 3 million acres that have not even been planted this year. On top of bad prices and bad weather, we are also hit by bad policy because the last farm bill put us at a very severe disadvantage with our major competitors, the Europeans. 
   The EU trumps the U.S. in farm support. This chart shows just with respect to wheat and corn for 1999--the red bar is what the Europeans provide their producers on wheat; the blue bar what we are doing in the United States. You can see, they are trumping us by 38 percent. In other words, their support is 38 percent higher in wheat, 46 percent higher in corn. 
   It does not end there because the Europeans are also badly outspending us with respect to export subsidy. This shows for 1998--the last year for which we have full figures--this is the European Union in red: $5 billion a year of support for subsidies. This is the United States: $104 million. 
   For that 1 year alone, the Europeans are outspending us, are outgunning us, 50 to 1. It is no wonder that our farmers are at a disadvantage. We, in effect, are saying to our farmers: You go out there and compete against the French farmer, the German farmer; and while you're at it, you take on the French Government and the German Government, as well. 
   That is not a fair fight. 
   If we look worldwide at agricultural export subsidies, what we see is that the European Union accounts for 84 percent of agriculture subsidies worldwide. The United States has 1.4 percent. We are outgunned 60 to 1 by that measure. 
   Whether it is 50 to 1 or 60 to 1, the hard reality is, the U.S. producers are not in a fair fight. Something must be done to respond. 
   If we look back at the policy change that was made in the farm bill--our last farm bill--what we see is there was a dramatic cut in the level of support for our producers. 
   Under the previous farm bill, the 1990 farm bill, we were getting on average $10 billion a year of support for our farmers. That was cut in half to $5 billion--that at the very time our major competitors are spending $50 billion a year to support their producers. So $50 billion for Europe; $5 billion for the United States. 
   It is not a fair fight. The result is, our farmers are losing the battle. I call this ``unilateral disarmament.'' We would never do that in a military confrontation. 
   Why have we done it in a trade confrontation? The results are the same: They win; we lose. The chief negotiator for the Europeans told me several years ago: Senator, we believe we are in a trade war in agriculture with the United States. He said: Senator, we believe at some point there will be a cease-fire. We believe there will be a cease-fire in place, and we want to occupy the high ground. And the high ground is market share. 
   How well that strategy and plan are working, because the Europeans, in just the last few years, have moved from being major importers to being major exporters. They have gone from being the biggest importing region in the world to being the biggest exporting region in the world, and they have done it the old-fashioned way--they have gone out and bought these markets. 
   In the last 10 years alone, they have spent $500 billion, and now they are starting to get a return on that investment, because in the last trade negotiation, what happened? Europeans have a higher level of support than we do. They are at a higher level. We are at a lower level. Was there a closing of the gap? Not at all. Instead, the conclusion was equal percentage reductions on both sides--36 percent in export subsidies, 24 percent in domestic support. The result is that our farmers were again left in a second position. 
   If it happens again in the trade talks that are to begin this fall, our farmers will be put in a position of perhaps falling off the cliff, being put in a position that they cannot possibly survive. 
   Some say let's let the market work. I am all for letting the market work. But that is not what is happening in world agriculture. What is happening in world agriculture is, the Europeans are spending enormous sums of money  to win a dominant position. They believe that is a position they can preserve because they think the United States is unwilling to fight back. 
   We have to prove them wrong. We have to demonstrate that the United States is not going to roll over, is not going to surrender, is not going to give up, that we intend to fight for these markets to achieve a level playing field so our farmers have a chance to compete. Our farmers can compete against anyone anywhere, but they can't compete against the governments of the European Union. That is not a fair fight. 
   We can see the pattern because while we have cut support for our producers and the Europeans have had a 50- to 60-to-1 edge on us with respect to export subsidy, the value of our farm exports has dropped like a rock. We have gone from $60 billion a year as recently as 1996 to, this last year, $49 billion. At the same time, if we look at the European pattern, we see they have gone from being a major importer to a major exporter. They have a strategy; they have a plan. It is working. If we don't fight back, we are going to wake up after this next round of negotiations and we are going to find that the United States is falling off the cliff. We are going to find literally thousands of our farm families consigned to failure. That is the message I have received in farm meeting after farm meeting all across my State. 
   I asked our Trade Representative: What is our leverage in the next round of trade talks? The truth is, we have no leverage because the Europeans are occupying the high ground. They are waiting for the cease-fire, the cease-fire in place. They are waiting to win this victory. They are confident the United States will not fight back. We have to prove them wrong. 
   We have to demonstrate that the United States is not willing to cede these markets. 
   This chart shows what has happened to just one commodity, wheat. This blue line is European exports; the red line is American exports. You can see the trend line for the United States is down, down, down--lots of zigzags along the way, but the trend line is straight down; the European trend line, straight up. They have had a little setback recently, but you can see they have gone from being in a totally inferior position, a more than two-to-one gap between us to our advantage, to their now being in the dominant position, and they have accomplished this in less than 20 years. 
   That is what my FITE legislation is all about. It says: Let's fight back. Let's send a message the United States is not going to wave the white flag of surrender. The United States intends to fight for these markets. The United States intends to give our farmers a fair chance to compete. That is what this legislation does. 
   These charts show it. FITE levels the playing field for wheat. Under our proposal, as I described before, Europe is at $5.20 in wheat, we are at $3.22. We would level the playing field. If they are going to provide $5.20, we will provide $5.20. We do the same thing on corn. We even the score on corn. They are at $4.85 today. We are at $2.25 a bushel on corn. If they want to stay at $4.85, we will match them; we will meet them in the competition. We will take them on head to head, dollar for dollar, so we don't surrender these markets and find ourselves in an inferior position. 
   Not only do we even the score with respect to support to producers, we even the score with respect to export subsidy, because in the FITE bill we provide $4 billion a year of support for export subsidy, because we believe that will send a message to the Europeans that the United States intends to fight. This would put us in a strong position for the talks this fall because right now we have no leverage. 
   The question is, How do we respond?

   Mr. CONRAD. We have support from the North Dakota Farmers Union, the North Dakota Association of Rural Electric Co-ops, the North Dakota NFO, the U.S. Duram Growers Association, the Milk Producers Association of North Dakota, the American Renewable Oil Association, the North Dakota Bankers Association, the Central Power Electric Cooperative Board of Directors, the Square Butte Electric Cooperative, the North Dakota Rural Development Council, and even a resolution of support from the Midwestern Legislative Conference of the Council of State Governments that, while not endorsing the specifics of this legislation, specifically endorsed the concept in which they say:  
   The Midwestern Legislative Conference favors legislation that would include support to American producers which would put prices received for crops on an even par with those of our European Union competitors.  
   Mr. President, the Midwest Council of State Governments has it right. We simply cannot permit our farmers to be left at a competitive disadvantage. We must fight back. That is what the FITE legislation will do. 
   We have had an unprecedented outpouring of support in North Dakota. In addition to those who have sent written comments, the North Dakota Wheat Commission has gone on record supporting this legislation. We have many more who are considering resolutions of support. I am hopeful that this will start a ground swell that will spread across the country and send a message that the United States does not intend to give up our agricultural dominance. That would be a mistake. It would be one we would live to regret. We are very close now to these negotiations this fall. If we don't alter dramatically the negotiating environment, we are going to lose. Make no mistake about it. We are going to lose. 
   It doesn't have to be that way. It should not be that way. But it is in our hands. We have a choice to make. Do we fight back, or do we give up? 
   At a time of unprecedented economic prosperity in this country, it would be a travesty for us to have lost the world  agricultural trade battle because we were unwilling at this critical moment to respond. I hope we don't let this opportunity pass us by. 
   Some people watching me say: Well, why should we help farmers? 
   I believe farm families are the backbone of strength for this country. They are absolutely fundamental to America's success. They have long been the dominant source of our trade surpluses. Overall, we run massive trade deficits. But in agriculture, we have run trade surpluses. It has been one of two sectors of this economy that has run trade surpluses, and we are right at the brink of losing that. That would be a tragedy for this country--not just because of the dollars or just because of the economics, but because of what it would mean to the fundamental strength of this country. 
   In Europe, they made a decision. They decided they wanted to have people out across the land. They didn't want everybody forced into the cities, so they made it possible for people to prosper in the rural parts of Europe. Perhaps their being hungry twice before informed those decisions. But whatever the reason, you can travel through the French countryside and the German countryside and it is prosperous; they are doing well. But go through the countryside of my State and what you see is an area that is in economic decline. It is not just in North Dakota; it is all across the heartland of America. 
   The question is, Are we going to let it go? You know, it would be one thing if it were a fair competition. It would be one thing if it were simply the fact that our farmers weren't as competitive or as efficient as our competitors. But that is not the case. It is not the case. The fact is, our farmers are as competitive and as efficient as any in the world. What is hurting them is that other nations are willing to fight for their producers, and we have been in retreat. 
   We have to decide what kind of country we want to have. Do we want everybody to move to town? Or do we want people out across the land? Europe has made a decision that they want people out across the countryside, and they have made it possible economically to be there. Now the choice comes to us. The hour is late because these negotiations will start this fall, and if we don't do something to change the rules of the game, our side is going to lose. It doesn't have to be that way. It should not be that way. But we have choices to make in this Chamber, and across in the other Chamber, about what is going to be the policy of America, what is going to be our position. 
   I hope very much that we will decide we are going to give our farmers a fighting chance. I hope very much that we are going to make a decision that the best policy is to have people out across the land, not to have everybody come to the cities. I hope very much we are going to conclude that it is in our national interest, just as the Europeans have concluded that it is in their interest, to give farmers a fighting chance. There is no way they are going to win this battle when the odds are stacked against them: 10-to-1, 50-to-1, that is the unevenness of the fight our farmers are in now. It is in our hands; it is our decision. 
   I hope very much that we can start across this country a move to say: Let's fight back. Let's put our farmers on a level playing field. Let's rearm our negotiators. Let's prepare for this battle. Let's not lose. Let's win a victory that would make a difference for hundreds of thousands of farm families across America and the cities and towns that are dependent upon them and, at the end of the day, for a country that needs them. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I would like now to take a moment to acknowledge the accomplishments of my former colleague and friend James Sasser, the United States Ambassador to the People's Republic of China. I need not remind the Senate of the quality of his leadership as fellow member, and former chairman, of the Budget Committee. It is not his 18 year tenure in the Senate that I want to discuss at this time, but his distinguished work as Ambassador to China. 
   Over the past three years, the People's Republic of China has been turbulent both socially and economically. From the reversion of Hong Kong in 1997, to the heightened concern about human rights violations, to the recent developments in Kosovo, it is an understatement to say that the task set before James Sasser was daunting. From the onset of his appointment in 1996, during the Chinese missile testing in the Taiwan straits, James Sasser has worked tirelessly towards a ``strong, stable, prosperous China,'' and towards the realization of an equally healthy relationship with United States. 
   The frontier of Chinese-US relations is a fast changing one, and Sasser's efforts have been considerable. Through the continued promotion of tariff reduction he has helped to launch American business towards the exploration of the Chinese market and helped to secure important trade commitments in the negotiations of the PCR's accession by the WTO. 
   There has also been considerable progress on the human rights front during the term of Sasser's Ambassadorship. Coupled with the release of prominent political and religious leaders, the PRC's ratification of the International Covenant of Economic and Social Rights is one of the most significant signs of progress with respect to civil rights in China. Sasser has also pioneered agreements with the PCR concerning the nonproliferation of nuclear technology, striving'' to cooperate on the peaceful uses of nuclear energy and halt the spread of nuclear weapons technology.'' 
   It is with regret that I acknowledge James Sasser's departure. His counsel will be greatly missed. His accomplishment as US Ambassador to China will be remembered as important in advancing the opportunity for a sound relationship between the two countries. I would like to extend my sincere thanks for a job well done.

   Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, for the fourth time the Senate is being asked to vote on a so-called lockbox without being given the opportunity to consider amendments. 
   What is the majority afraid of? Why aren't they willing to vote on amendments? That is the way we do business in the Senate. Somebody makes a legislative offering, and then Members have a chance to amend and a chance to vote to decide what is the best policy for this country. 
   I have believed for a very long time and I have fought repeatedly in the Budget Committee, in the Finance Committee, and on the floor of the Senate to stop the raid on Social Security surpluses. I see our friends on the other side all of a sudden become defenders of Social Security. 
   Some Members have not forgotten. Sometimes our friends on the other side of the aisle think we have amnesia, but we remember the repeated attempts on the other side to amend the Constitution of the United States with a so-called balanced budget amendment that would have looted and raided Social Security to achieve balance. We remember very well. 
   It was done in 1994; it was done in 1995; it was done in 1996; it was done in 1997; and here is the language. This language makes clear that the definition of a balanced budget was all the receipts of the Federal Government and all the expenditures of the Federal Government, including Social Security. Then they were going to call that a balanced budget. That is what they were doing in 1994, 1995, 1996, and 1997--an absolute raid on the Social Security trust funds and trying to put that in the Constitution of the United States. 
   All of a sudden, they are defenders of Social Security. I welcome the transformation. I welcome them coming over to our 
   side and agreeing now that we ought to protect Social Security. But why won't they allow amendments? What are they afraid of? Are they afraid to vote? I think they are. I think they are afraid to vote. I think they are afraid to vote because we have  an amendment that provides a lockbox for Social Security, one that is defended against what can happen out here on the floor--unlike the amendment being offered now. It is defended by sequestration. Their amendment has no such defense. 
   I think they are afraid to vote on an alternative because we not only protect Social Security but Medicare. 
   Looking at the Republican ``broken safe,'' we try to look inside and find out what is there. What we find is that there is not one single additional penny for Medicare in the Republican lockbox. No, Medicare is left out of the equation. 
   Senator LAUTENBERG and I believe Medicare ought to be protected with Social Security. We ought to have a lockbox to protect both. We ought to have procedures that defend them, not create enormous loopholes that can be used to again loot Social Security and not protect Medicare. 
   The fact is, the amendment we want to offer that they will not let this side consider is an amendment that provides $698 billion for Medicare over the next 15 years; the Republican plan provides nothing, zero, not one penny. That is why they don't want to vote. They don't want to vote because they don't want to protect Social Security and Medicare. 
   It is fascinating what a difference a year makes. Just 1 year ago we had a debate in the Budget Committee of the Senate. Here is what the Republicans were saying then. This is Senator PETE DOMENICI, the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee:  
   Mr. President, this is a very simple proposition ..... We suggested, as Republicans, that Social Security and Medicare are the two most important American programs to save, reform, and make available into the next century ..... I believe the issue is very simple--very simple: Do you want a budget that begins to help with Medicare, or do you want a budget that says not one nickel for Medicare; let's take care of that later with money from somewhere else.  
   Senator DOMENICI was right then. They don't want to consider the amendment that would do exactly what he is talking about--protect Social Security and Medicare. They want to forget the position they were taking just a year ago. 
   Here is another member, a senior Republican member of the Budget Committee. He said 1 year ago:  
   But the fundamental strength of it is, whether they are democrats or republicans who have got together in these dark corners of very bright rooms and said, what would we do if we had a half a trillion dollars to spend? 
   ..... the obvious answer that cries out is Medicare ..... I think it is logical. People understood the President on save Social Security first and I think they will understand save Medicare first ..... 
   Medicare is in crisis. We want to save Medicare first.  
   It is 1 year later now. All of a sudden those brave words are forgotten and our friends on the other side want to prevent us from even considering an amendment that would do what they were advocating a year ago, save Social Security first and save Medicare first. Now they want to forget Medicare. Now they do not want to provide an additional dime for Medicare, even though it is endangered in a more immediate way than is Social Security. 
   One more quote from the chairman of the Budget Committee:  
   Let me tell you for every argument made around this table today about saving Social Security, you can now put it in the bank that the problems associated with fixing Medicare are bigger than the problems fixing Social Security, bigger in dollars, more difficult in terms of the kind of reform necessary, and frankly, I am for saving Social Security. But it is most interesting that there are some who want to abandon Medicare ..... when it is the most precarious program we have got.  
   The reason I believe our colleagues on the other side do not want any amendments is because they do not want to vote on an amendment that Senator LAUTENBERG and I are prepared to offer that would save Social Security first, every penny, and save Medicare as well. They do not want to vote. 
   That is not the way the Senate ought to operate. That is not what we should do here. 
   Let me conclude by saying the amendment we have would save $3.3 billion in debt reduction; the Republican plan, $2.6 billion. Our plan is superior. We ought to have a chance to vote.

   Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I am very pleased to join my distinguished colleagues from Maine, New Hampshire, and Nebraska in introducing the Rural Education Initiative Act. Over the past five years, Congress and the Administration have significantly increased education funding for States and local school districts. They have also undertaken a number of new initiatives in response to educational concerns including Class Size Reduction and the 21st Century Community Learning Centers Program. 
   Unfortunately, rural schools are not benefiting from these new initiatives or from funding increases to the same degree as many urban and suburban schools. In fact, on the basis of discussions with educators in North Dakota, Federal education laws are discouraging many rural schools from making the best use of funds that are currently allocated by formula from the Department of Education. 
   The formulas developed to allocate education funding, formulas which take into consideration a number of factors including student enrollment, in many cases do not result in sufficient funding to permit the smaller school to most effectively use the funds for local educational priorities. 
   Many small, rural schools, for example, don't have the enrollment numbers or special categories of students that result in sufficient revenue under the education formulas to hire a new teacher under the Class Size Reduction initiative, or to participate in a more specialized education program like the 21st Century Community Learning Centers Program. 
   Additionally, these schools are not able to compete as effectively as larger districts for funding under some Department of Education competitive grant programs. Limited resources do not permit smaller districts to hire specialists to prepare and submit grant applications. In some cases, the only option for a smaller school district is to form a consortium with other rural districts to qualify for sufficient funding. 
   No more clearly are the concerns of rural school educators expressed than in a letter that I received from ElRoy Burkle, Superintendent for the Starkweather Public School District, in Starkweather, North Dakota, a school district with 131 students. In his letter, ElRoy expressed the difficulty that smaller, rural schools are having in accessing Federal education funds. 
   ElRoy remarked, ``..... school districts have lost their ability to access funds directly, and as a result of forming these consortiums in order to access these monies, it is my opinion, we have lost our individual ability to utilize these monies in an effective manner that would be conducive to promoting the educational needs of our individual schools.'' 
   Mr. President, the Rural Education Initiative Act responds to the unique needs of rural school districts by enabling these districts to more fully participate in Department of Education formula and competitive grant programs. 
   Under Section 4 of the proposed legislation, school districts with less than 600 students would be eligible to pool resources from four DOE formula programs, and use the funding for quality of instruction or student achievement priorities determined by the local school district. 
   These programs include the DOE's Class-Size Reduction, Eisenhower Professional Development, Title VI (Innovative Education Strategies), and Safe and Drug Free Schools, Title I GOALS 2000, Individuals With Disabilities Education, and Impact Aid are not included in this legislation. 
   Additionally, to qualify for funding under the Rural Education Initiative Act, a school district would elect not to apply for competitive grant funding from seven programs including Gifted and Talented Children Grants; State and Local Programs for Technology Resources; 21st Century Community Learning Centers; Grants under the Fund for the Improvement of Education; Bilingual Education Professional Development Grants; Bilingual Education Capacity and Demonstration Grants; and Bilingual Education Research, Evaluation, and Dissemination Grants. 
   In opting out of these competitive grant programs, the rural school district would be entitled to a formula grant, based on student enrollment, to use for education reform efforts to improve class instruction and student achievements. The grant amount would be reduced by the level of funding received by the School district under the formula grant programs outlined in Section 4. 
   To remain in the Rural Education Initiative, school districts, after five years, would be required to assess the academic achievement of students using a statewide test, or in the case where there is no statewide test, a test selected by the local education agency. 
   Additionally, the Rural Education Initiative Act will not abolish or reduce funding for any DOE education program including the eleven grant programs discussed in this initiative. 
   Mr. President, It's very important that we consider the Rural Education Initiative Act as part of the re-authorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act during the 106th Congress. No issue is more important for rural America than the future of our schools. In North Dakota 86 percent of school districts, 198 schools, have less than 600 students. 
   Additionally, many of these school districts are facing declining enrollments. According to the Report Card for North Dakota's Future (1998) prepared by the North Dakota Department of Public Instruction, over the past two decades school districts in the State have declined from 364 to 214, almost 40 percent. 
   This decline in student population is not unique to North Dakota. Many other states have a significant percentage of rural school districts, and many are also experiencing a decline in rural student population. While the quality of education, including smaller classes, in many of these smaller communities remains excellent, the more limited resources of smaller, rural schools, coupled with the declining student enrollments, pose extraordinarily challenges for rural schools across America. 
   These factors along with current Federal education formulas have limited the ability of smaller districts to take full advantage of federal education grants. In some instances, they have limited educational opportunities for students such as distance learning, or advanced academic and vocational courses. Rural schools are unique and have educational needs that are not being met. 
   Mr. President, I want to commend the American Association of School Administrators (AASA) for the key role they have played in the development of this rural schools initiative. AASA has a remarkable record of achievement on behalf of the education community, parents, and students. For several years, they have been examining the difficulties that rural schools were experiencing in applying and qualifying for Federal education funding. The proposal developed by AASA would have a significant impact on almost 200 school districts in North Dakota. 
   I also want to commend the Organizations Concerned About Rural Education for their efforts on behalf of this initiative, and the exemplary work on behalf of other educational issues for rural America. 
   Again, I congratulate Senator COLLINS for taking the lead on this important education initiative, and I strongly urge the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions to carefully consider this legislation and the educational needs of rural schools during the reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act.

    Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill that would amend the Trade Act of 1974 to make farmers eligible for Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) similar to that provided to workers in other industries who suffer when there is an increase in imported products. This bill would provide equitable treatment for farmers  when imports affect the prices of the commodities they grow. 
   When imports cause layoffs in manufacturing industries, workers are eligible for TAA. However, when imports cause agricultural commodity prices to drop, farmers lose income but they don't lose their jobs. That means they generally don't get benefits from TAA. Let me explain why. 
   Farmers typically do not earn a salary check. Farmers get paid for the crops or livestock that they grow. When commodity prices are low, the check the farmers get for all the hard work of growing crops or livestock for a whole year may be so low that they cannot cover family expenses. In some cases, the payment they get for selling their crops or livestock is so low that they cannot even cover the costs necessary to produce the commodity (such as feed, seed, fertilizer, etc.), so the farmers lose money for the year. Low prices resulting from imports directly reduce farmers' incomes, but because farmers do not actually lose their jobs, they do not qualify for the TAA benefit. 
   For example, farmers in my state are experiencing record low prices that result, in part, from a flood of imports of wheat, barley and livestock from Canada. These imports cost North Dakota farmers hundreds of millions of dollars in lost income. But North Dakota farmers have not been able to take advantage of the TAA program. The bill that I am introducing today would provide some equity by ensuring that farmers whose income was affected by imports would be eligible for TAA benefits just like other workers. 
   Most of us would agree that trade is extremely important to our overall economy. International trade allows Americans to sell U.S.-made products to world markets, rather than just to those who live in this country. Trade also allows American to buy products that the rest of the world produces. And trade is especially important to our agricultural economy. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, one-third of U.S. crop land produces for export. 
   U.S. agricultural exports are a bright spot for our nation's balance of trade. In 1999, the United States is expected to export $49 billion worth of goods, compared to agricultural imports this year of $37.5 billion. Thus, agricultural exports contribute $11.5 billion to our balance of trade with other nations. 
   Nonetheless, many farmers and other citizens feel that they can be hurt by free trade. When we import commodities that compete with what Americans are producing, then some American producers--whether they are workers, firms, or farmers--can be hurt by falling prices for the goods they produce. 
   As a result, the lack of trade adjustment assistance for farmers has undercut support for trade among many family farmers. 
   By giving farmers some protection against precipitous income losses from imports, the Trade Adjustment Assistance for Farmers Act can help strengthen support for trade agreements that expand agricultural export opportunities. 
   We need to be sure that we don't leave American farmers behind, and that we treat farmers fairly in comparison with other American workers and industries. That's why I am introducing this bill, the Trade Adjustment Assistance for Farmers Act. 
   This bill would amend the Trade Act of 1974 to provide trade adjustment assistance to farmers by partially compensating them for income lost due to the effect of imports. Here's how it will work. 
   Farmers would receive benefits that would be triggered when two conditions are met. First, the national average price for a specific commodity for the previous marketing year must have dropped more than 20 percent below the average price in the previous 5-year period. Second, increased imports--or a high level of imports--must have contributed importantly to the commodity price reduction. 
   A group of farmers who grow a particular commodity (or a commodity group representing them) would submit an application for trade adjustment assistance to the Labor Department. The Secretary of Labor (consulting with the Secretary of Agriculture) would determine whether the two triggers had been met. 
   If the commodity is determined to be eligible, then individual producers could apply for benefits. Farmers who are eligible for benefits under the program would receive a cash assistance payment equal to half the difference between the national average price for the year (as determined by USDA) and 80 percent of the average price in the previous 5 years (the price trigger level), multiplied by the number of units the farmers had produced. The maximum cash benefits available to farmers under this program would be $10,000 per year. 
   Training and employment benefits that are available to workers under TAA would also be available, on an optional basis, to farmers who are eligible for cash assistance benefits under the law. For example, a farm family that was suffering from low prices due to increased imports might consider retraining to learn skills in the high-tech computer industry, which they could use in an at-home business to supplement farm income. 
   In most years, this program would likely have a modest cost because very few commodities, if any, would be eligible for assistance. However, in a year like the last we have just been through--when hog and wheat prices dropped precipitously--this program would be one tool to provide a modest amount of support to compensate farmers for the harmful effect of imports on their commodity prices and thus their incomes. Thus the bill would treat family farmers fairly, including them in the protections available to others in our economy who are hurt by the increased trade that, in the aggregate, benefits us all. 
   Mr. President, I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting American family farmers as they compete in the global market place.

   Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise in support of the bill before us. 
   In this bill the Armed Service Committee has done a good job of reconciling important yet competing needs for defense funding under daunting fiscal constraints. This bill will be an important contribution to our efforts to strengthen our already first-class military, and enhance important benefits for American military personnel, their dependents, retirees, and veterans. 
   I am especially pleased that this legislation includes my amendments concerning Russia's tactical nuclear stockpile, National Missile Defense, and Air Force cruise missiles. I would offer to the distinguished Chairman and Ranking Member my most sincere thanks for working with me on these important amendments, as I would for the assurances they offered regarding the Navy's BQM-74 in a colloquy with Senator DORGAN, Senator BINGAMAN, and myself. 
   Before reviewing several of the bill's provisions, I would like to reflect for a moment on the context in which the Senate is considering this year's defense authorization bill. 
   Mr. President, I have had the honor and privilege of serving the people of North Dakota and the nation in the United States Senate for 13 years. However, this is the first time during my tenure that the Senate has taken up a defense authorization bill while our forces are engaged in hostilities. I know I am not alone in being especially mindful of the fact that the provisions we approve here today will have a significant impact on our brave men and women in uniform as they do their jobs in Balkans and over Iraq. I am pleased that several sections of this bill address concerns and needs that have been identified during Operation Desert Fox and the current air campaign against Yugoslavia. 
   Now, Mr. President, allow me to highlight several particularly good provisions of this bill, for which Chairman WARNER and Senator LEVIN should be congratulated. 
   First, this measure wisely provides full funding for vital missile defense programs. National Missile Defense that is affordable, makes sense in the context of our arms control agreements, and utilizes proven technology has always had my support, and it is encouraging to see that it has been fully funded for fiscal year 2000. After damaging cuts in recent years, the revolutionary Airborne Laser program has also been fully supported this year by the Committee. 
   Chairman WARNER and Senator LEVIN must also be praised for including many of the provisions passed earlier this year by the Senate as part of S. 4, the Soldier's Sailor's, Airmen's, and Marine's Bill of Rights. Several of the most beneficial include a base COLA of 4.8 percent for all personnel, coupled with reform of the pay tables. Servicemembers will also now be able to participate in a Thrift Savings Plan. 
   Third, the bill recommends significant funding boosts for vital strategic forces. The Minuteman III Guidance Replacement Program will be kept on schedule with a $40 million hike, and $41.4 million has been wisely added for B-52 upgrades identified as top unfunded priorities by the Air Force. 
   Additionally, the Committee has also supported important housing improvement projects at Minot and Grand Forks Air Force Bases in North Dakota, and acted to accelerate construction of a $9.5 million apron extension at Grand Forks. 
   Finally, I am pleased that the Strategic Forces Subcommittee has recommended a reduction in the minimum START I Trident submarine force level that must be maintained until START II is ratified by the Russian Duma. The Commander in Chief of the U.S. Strategic Command has assured me that we can meet our deterrence needs with 14 Trident boats, and that retirement of four submarines will not adversely affect our nation's security. 
   All of these provisions are steps in the right direction, but there are a number of matters in this bill of great concern. 
   First, the Committee yet again did not provide adequate funding for the B-52H bomber force. Today, part of the fleet is deployed to keep an eye on Saddam, and 15 B-52s are participating in Operation Allied Force. The B-52 is the backbone of the long range bomber force, and it is my hope that the Committee will review its decision not the fund the entire force during conference. As I have said many times before, no airborne platform can deliver a greater quantity or quality of nuclear and conventional munitions as far without refueling at as little cost to taxpayers than today's thoroughly modernized, battle-tested B-52. I applaud Senator STEVENS and Senator INOUYE--the distinguish leadership of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee--for acting to fund all 94 B-52s in the fiscal year 2000 defense appropriations bill. 
   Additionally, the bill unnecessarily increases spending on the Space Based Laser by $25 million. One day we will likely do the NMD mission from space. But that time is not now, when ground-based NMD will soon be available. Today, the SBL is unaffordable, a clear violation of the ABM Treaty, and simply not feasible. I hope the extra funding is reallocated in conference. 
   Despite these drawbacks, this is a good bill. But it is a better bill in light of the addition of the amendments I offered today. Briefly, I would like to summarize each in turn. 
   First, the 1999 Conrad Russian tactical nuclear weapons amendment responds to Russia's extremely disturbing announcement last month that it will not reduce its massive tactical  nuclear stockpile, but rather will retain and redeploy many of these ill-secured thermonuclear weapons. 
   My amendment includes a Sense of the Senate calling on the President to urge the Russians to match U.S. tactical nuclear cuts. Additionally, my amendment requires regular reports on Russia's tactical arsenal, which could be larger than ours by a factor of eight to one, and is not covered by any arms control treaty. My amendment builds on the bipartisan amendment I authored last year, and supports the related provisions in the bill before us. 
   I thank the able leadership of the Armed Services Committee for supporting this amendment, as I do for accepting my amendment concerning NMD. As a result of this measure, the Secretary of Defense will be required to study the advantages of a two-site NMD system, as opposed to a single site, as is now being considered by the Administration. 
   Although we may be able to defend all 50 states from a single site, there may be advantages from a two-site system related to defensive coverage, system security, and economies of scale. My amendment will make sure these are fully explored. Two sites are also not incompatible with arms control. In fact, the ABM Treaty as originally drafted included two sites, and it may be appropriate to go back to such an idea. 
   The third amendment I offered here today responds to growing concern on the part of our military commanders about the rapidly diminishing supply of conventional air launched cruise missiles, or CALCMs. 
   Simply put, the CALCM has performed brilliantly in Operation Allied Force. Its range of more than 1,500 miles, ability to carry a 3,000 pound warhead, and dead-on accuracy are unmatched by any other air-delivered cruise missile in the world. It represents a capability we will continue to need, long after the 60 or so left in the inventory, and the 320 now being converted from nuclear missions, have been expended. 
   My amendment will require the Secretary of the AF to report to Congress on how the Air Force plans to meet the long-range, large warhead, high accuracy cruise missile requirement once the CALCMs are expended. 
   In particular, three options will be reviewed: restarting the CALCM line, developing and acquiring a new variety of cruise missile with the same or better performance characteristics, and upgrading planned munitions. The time to start planning on this matter is now, and again I thank Chairman WARNER and Senator LEVIN for working with me on this amendment. 
   In closing, Mr. President, I would reiterate that the bill before us is a good one, and deserves the support of every Senator. 
   No bill is perfect in every respect, but I am confident that this defense authorization bill will strengthen our armed forces and require studies that will enhance our national security. At a time when we are at war in the Balkans, ready for another on the Korean Peninsula, and continue an open-ended air campaign against Iraq, we owe our brave men and women in uniform no less.

   Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about the continuing crisis in the farm economy. I have just been home the weekend before last. Everywhere I went in my State, people were saying to me: Senator, something has to be done. We are facing a crisis in rural America. The prices we are getting for things continues to be at very low levels--in fact, we have the lowest prices in 53 years--and at the same time everything we buy is going up. That is putting us in a cost/price squeeze that is truly strangling American farmers. 
   The result is going to be devastating unless there is a response. Last year, the Federal Government did respond with a $6 billion program of disaster assistance that made a significant difference in rural America. About half of that money went for a support, a supplement that gave farmers some assistance when prices were collapsing. There was also a second major element for a disaster program, natural disasters around the country that had dramatically reduced farm income. That program made a significant difference. 
   Those same conditions continue this year. Prices again are at very low levels, and we have seen natural disasters once again strike rural America. In fact, we now know to deliver on the promise we made last year on a disaster program is going to require more money than we appropriated. We appropriated about $3 billion for that purpose. We now know delivery on the program we passed is going to cost another $1.5 billion, because the signup of agricultural producers that is now completed indicates to us there are far more who are eligible than we thought when we wrote the program. That is, of course, because we were faced with a moving target. We were faced with additional natural disasters that deepened and worsened and made more farmers eligible. 
   I believe we need that $1.5 billion to keep the promise made last year and another $2.8 billion that will be necessary to give the same kind of income support we provided last year, about a 50-percent AMTA supplemental. 
   Why are these necessary? What is happening out there so those of us who represent farm country come to our colleagues and talk about a crisis in rural America? Perhaps the best way of showing what has happened is this chart that shows what has happened, over a 53-year period, to farm prices. As we can see, with spring wheat and barley prices from 1946 to 1999, we are now at the lowest level for barley and wheat prices in 53 years. That is the hard reality our farmers are coping with, the lowest prices in 53 years. We know that earlier this year hog prices fell to 8 cents a pound. It costs 40 cents a pound to produce a hog. 
   To put these prices into some perspective, these are per bushel. We are down to a price per bushel of $2.60 to $2.70 for wheat. I know a bushel does not mean a lot to many people in our very urban society today, but a bushel of wheat weighs 56 pounds. So farmers are getting 5 cents a pound--actually something less than 5 cents a pound--for the product they produce. There is no way you can make it when you are getting 5 cents a pound for a product that costs at least 10 cents a pound to produce. But that is what is happening to farmers. 
   Let me go to the next chart that shows what is happening to wheat prices received by farmers in relationship to cost. This green line shows the cost of production in 1997. You can see it 
   is just about $5 a bushel. That is the cost. That is the best estimate of what it costs across the country to produce a bushel of wheat, just above $5. You can see the last time farmers were getting above $5 was back in 1996. Since that time, in 1997, it was far below the cost of production, and it has done nothing but get worse through 1998 and on into 1999. We are far below the cost of production. As I indicated, we are running, down here at $2.60 a bushel. The cost of production is over $5. It is no wonder farmers are saying we desperately need a Federal response. 
   Why is it a Federal responsibility? For the entire history of the United States, we have recognized the special role of agriculture. We have recognized it is subject to dramatic swings in both production and prices, because, first of all, it is a product that depends on the weather, and the weather is very unpredictable, as we have seen across the country for year after year after year. On top of that, we are subjected to dramatic price swings. In the last several years, we have been influenced by the collapse in Asia; we lost one of our biggest customers. We have also seen a financial collapse in Russia. Of course, Russia was a key customer of the United States. Those two things have had a dramatic and adverse impact on price. You can see it here--prices down, down, down--and the cost of production staying up. That has put our farmers at an extreme disadvantage. 
   While farmers are paying more but receiving less, it is not surprising, then, they find themselves in a cost/price squeeze. This green line shows the prices farmers paid for various inputs. As you can see, the prices farmers had been paying had been going up rather steadily. They have actually leveled off in the last 3 years. But look at what the prices that farmers have been receiving look like. That is this red line. We can see it peaked right at the time we passed the 1996 farm bill. 
   The 1996 farm bill changed everything. It said, instead of adjusting what Government provides by way of assistance when prices fall, we will no longer do that. The new farm bill said we are going to have fixed payments that are sharply reduced year after year no matter what happens to prices. 
   Here is the pattern we see: the prices farmers pay for goods they use to produce products going up; the prices  they receive going down dramatically. The result is this enormous gap between what they are able to buy for, what they have to pay to receive goods, and what they are able to get when they sell their goods. This dramatic gap, this chasm now, between the prices farmers pay for what they have to buy and what they get for what they sell has opened up into such a large difference that literally tens of thousands of farm families are threatened. 
   It would be one thing if the United States was alone in this world, if we did not have competitors to worry about, but we do have competitors. The Europeans are our chief competitors, and it is very interesting to see what they are doing. 
   At the very time when we have dramatically cut support for farmers, cut support at the very time they are in the greatest need, because the gap between what they pay for and what they get has opened up in such a very serious way, we have cut dramatically the level of support we provide our farmers. In the last farm bill, we cut in half the support we provide our farmers. If we look at what our competitors, the Europeans, are doing, we see quite a different pattern. 
   Our European competitors are spending far more than we are to support their farmers. If we go back to 1996, we can see the red bar is what Europe is spending in direct support; the yellow bar is what we are spending. We can see the pattern all through 1997, 1998, 1999, the year 2000--and these are projections for 2001 and 2002--that our competitors are providing much more support to their producers than we are providing ours. 
   I conclude by saying we have a crisis in rural America. It requires a Federal response. I hope very much before this year has concluded that we have said farming is important in this country, that we understand it is in crisis, and that we are prepared to respond. 
   I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.

    Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, today I join again with my friend from Utah, Senator HATCH, to introduce the Biomass and Coal Facilities Extension Act. This legislation would extend by eight months the placed-in-service date under section 29 of the Internal Revenue Code. 
   We are offering the same bill we offered in the 105th Congress because the problem addressed by the bill remains uncorrected. The change we propose is  necessary in order to alleviate a hardship taxpayers are suffering as a result of their reliance on actions taken by Congress nearly three years ago. 
   A number of taxpayers made substantial commitments of resources to develop alternative fuel technology projects in good faith reliance on the incentives provided in the Small Business Protection Act of 1996. Under that law, Congress intended to ensure that alternative fuel technology projects involving coal and biomass would qualify for the credit provided under section 29 of the Internal Revenue Code as long as projects were subject to a binding contract by December 31, 1996 and placed in service by June 30, 1998. 
   That should have settled the matter. However, a proposal offered by the Administration in February 1997 contained a proposal to shorten the placed-in-service deadline by a full year for facilities producing gas from biomass and synthetic fuel from coal. The Administration was concerned about what it characterized as rapid growth in the section 29 credit. Congress considered that argument, but concluded that no change in the 1996 legislation was necessary. 
   In the tax legislative arena, even a mere proposal can have consequences. When the Joint Committee on Taxation published its analysis of the Administration's budget proposals in March 1997, it warned Congress about just such a consequence as it observed that ``[b]ecause the binding contract date has already passed *.*.* the proposal might place an unfair financial burden on those taxpayers who are bound to contracts entered into prior to the Administration's announcement.'' 
   Mr. President, that is exactly what happened--many taxpayers who found themselves in that situation lost their sources of funding because financial institutions were obligated to take into account the possibility that the Administration's proposal could have become law. Because the tax credit plays a significant role in the financial examination lenders must make, its potential loss made securing the necessary financing impossible for taxpayers who were proceeding in good faith under binding contracts made in reliance on the provisions of the Small Business Protection Act of 1996. 
   The bill would extend the placed-in-service date for a period eight months from the date of the bill's enactment. This would restore some of the time that taxpayers lost as a result of the confusion which resulted from the events of 1997. 
   Let me emphasize that the bill would not authorize any ``new starts.'' The binding contract date provided in the 1996 Act would not be altered. The sole purpose of this bill is to allow taxpayers who began projects under the 1996 Act to proceed in an orderly manner to create the kinds of facilities that will help increase the country's useful energy resources.

    Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, today I am pleased to be joined by Senators HARKIN, HATCH, and GRASSLEY in submitting a concurrent resolution that will ensure Medicare beneficiaries have access to the medical care they need. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 established the Medicare+Choice program and required that all services covered under traditional Medicare would also be covered in the Medicare+Choice program. Unfortunately, subsequent Medicare+Choice regulations do not ensure that beneficiaries participating in Medicare managed care will be eligible for the services provided by a chiropractor. 
   Medicare beneficiaries have access to chiropractic services under Part B of Medicare. Chiropractors are uniquely educated and trained to perform chiropractic services, such as a manual manipulation to the spine to correct a subluxation, a covered service under the traditional Medicare program. When the Medicare+Choice program was created, it was the unequivocal intent of Congress to ensure that every beneficiary that chooses to enroll in a Medicare+Choice program would have access to all services covered under Medicare Parts A and B--including chiropractic services. 
   Under the current Medicare+Choice regulations, managed care plans have incorrectly assumed that they can limit access to chiropractic care by referring patients to other types of providers. As the number of beneficiaries enrolling in Medicare HMOs continues to rise we must make sure that beneficiaries have access to the same services that they are promised under traditional Medicare--and chiropractic services are now exception. 
   This legislation will clarify the Congressional intent to ensure that all chiropractic services covered under traditional, fee-for-Medicare are also covered under the Medicare+Choice program. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this resolution.

   Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I am very pleased to join my distinguished colleague from North Dakota, in introducing legislation to authorize $1.7 billion in emergency funding for FY 2000 Veterans Health Administration programs. Since the release of the Administration's FY 2000 budget for the Department of Veterans Affairs, I have been deeply concerned by the level of funding--$17.3 billion--for the Veterans Health Administration. 
   This concerned was heightened by comments in an internal memo by Dr. Kenneth Kizer, VA Undersecretary for Health, in February, regarding the FY 2000 veterans health care budget. In that memo, Dr. Kizer warned VA Secretary Togo West that the Administration budget for FY 2000 ``poses very serious challenges which can only be met if decisive and timely actions are taken.'' 
   Dr. Kizer went on the say that unless the VA acts soon, ``*.*.* we face the very real prospect of far more problematic decisions, e.g. mandatory employee furloughs, severe curtailment of services or elimination of programs and possible unnecessary facility closures'' 
   Indeed, Mr. President, I can confirm, that concern over VA health care funding in FY 2000, and the possibility of severe curtailment of services, and the furlough VA employees is a very real concern for North Dakota veterans and DVA officials at the Fargo VA Medical Center in North Dakota. Veterans health care funding in FY 2000, and the hope that funding can be authorized this year to under take critical environmental improvements at the Fargo DVA Medical Center are high priorities for North Dakota veterans. These key priorities were discussed during a visit  to the Fargo DVA Medical Center earlier this year, at my request, by Deputy Secretary Hershel Gober. In fact, so concerned are members of the Disabled American Veterans nationwide, including North Dakota members, about funding for VA medical programs, that a rally has been scheduled on May 30th at the Fargo DVA Medical Center to heighten public awareness of the FY 2000 budget for veterans medical care and to press for additional funds. 
   Mr. President, over the past few months, Members of the Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs and many of my colleagues have been working hard to increase funding for veterans medical care in FY 2000. I have strongly supported these efforts. During consideration of the FY 2000 budget resolution in committee, and when the resolution was reported to the Senate for consideration, I voted to increase funding for VA medical care by $3 billion, the figure recommended in the FY 2000 Independent Budget supported by the AMVETS, Disabled American Veterans, the Veterans of Foreign Wars, and the Paralyzed Veterans of America. House and Senate conferees eventually agreed to increase veterans health care funding by $1.66 billion in FY 2000. Most recently, I cosigned a letter to Members of the Senate Appropriations Committee urging the committee to provide $1.7 billion above the administration's request for the Veterans Health Administration. Although Senate appropriators have not made a decision on how much to increase funding for veterans medical care, initial reports for a significant increase are not encouraging. 
   Because of concerns that the FY 2000 appropriations for veterans health are not expected to be adequate, and may result in unnecessary furloughs and disruptions of health care services for veterans, Senator DORGAN and I are introducing legislation to provide an emergency authorization of $1.7 billion in funding above the administration's request for $17.3 billion for the Veterans Health Administration. This figure also represents the level of additional health care funding recommended for the VA to Senate appropriators by Senate Veterans' Committee Chairman ARLEN SPECTER and Ranking Member JOHN D. ROCKEFELLER. We must make every effort to find these emergency FY 2000 funds for veterans medical care, and to include them in appropriate legislation to avoid disruptions in critical health care. We can do no less for our veterans.

   Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise today to again talk about the continuing agriculture crisis that is facing America's farmers. I spent this weekend in North Dakota. I spoke at the annual graduation of the North Dakota State School of Science and then at North Dakota State University's graduation on Saturday morning. On Friday, I went to an event we call Marketplace For Kids, which we hold every year, in which children from a large part of North Dakota come in and show the things they have been working on--inventions, creative ideas that they have had. 
   In these three sets of events I ran into literally hundreds of North Dakota farm families. Without exception they told me, Senator, unless there is a Federal response and unless it comes quickly, literally thousands of us are going to be forced off the land this spring. 
   This is a crisis as deep and as serious as any I have seen in my 13 years now representing North Dakota in the Senate. We have had quite a string of crises: in 1988-1989, the worst drought since the 1930s; in 1997, the worst flood in 500 years that devastated the town of Grand Forks, ND; and now this continuing agriculture crisis, as a result of, really, three factors. One is the collapse of farm prices. The second is incredibly bad weather over the last 5 years--overly wet conditions. In fact, as I flew over North Dakota, it looked like Lake Agassiz, which existed thousands of years ago, was reforming, because everywhere I looked, as I flew in a light plane over half of North Dakota, flying from east to west, all I saw was water everywhere. It was really stunning to see it. Then, of course, we have been hit by bad policy: A farm bill that has reductions in support from Government no matter what happens to farm 
   prices, very steep reductions that are included in that policy; and, of course, a trade policy that left us vulnerable to incredible increases in imports from Canada traded on an unfair basis. 
   This stew that is being cooked is increasingly hard to choke down for our farmers. This is a recent headline, April 4, in the Bismarck Tribune, my hometown newspaper. The headline is: ``Farm Families Forced To Cancel Health Insurance.'' In the story they talk about Clint Jacobs, a 30-year-old farmer, who raises 200 head of cattle near Amidon, ND. That is out in western North Dakota. He and his wife and their 1 1/2 -year-old daughter were paying $550 every 3 months for health insurance and they had $1,000 deductible. They had to drop their health insurance. 
   This is a story that is repeated every day across North Dakota, and I am sure in other farm belt States as well, as we cope with the lowest prices in 52 years--the lowest prices in 52 years. These farm families, with incredibly hard-working, decent, honest people, are having to dump their health insurance in a bid to survive financially. This really is not right. 
   As I traveled across my State this weekend, farm families came to me, bankers came to me with a very consistent message: You have to respond and you have to respond quickly, because this is a set of facts that is going to suck thousands of us down. 
   This article I was referring to says that 26 out of 82 farmers and ranchers who were surveyed had dropped health insurance to make ends meet. The survey was done by the Lutheran Disaster Response of Lutheran Social Services in North Dakota. As one person said, if you have four or five bad years and you tighten the belt every time, health insurance gets to be one of the things that is cut. 
   That is what is happening today in my State. Patients are skipping preventive care, such as checkups and mammograms. Some doctors and other health care providers are not getting paid. 
   In a sidebar story by the Associated Press, their farm writer says: Facing a dim agriculture forecast this year, farmers can now prepare for financial cutbacks. A Purdue University extension specialist who offers financial advice to struggling farmers in Indiana said families must determine what they can do without. 
   That is exactly what is happening in North Dakota. Maybe there are some who are listening and saying that we have had to do that in our life, we have had to cut back when times are tough, we have had to consider what you can do without; so what. 
   This is not a typical downturn. This goes far beyond what somebody can fairly plan for--the lowest prices in 52 years; 5 years of the worst weather on record; as a result, an outbreak of disease unprecedented in our State's history. 
   In over 100 years, we have never seen an outbreak of disease like we are coping with now. Scab, a fungus that breaks out when there are overly wet conditions, dramatically reduced production, with prices, as I indicated, the lowest they have been in 52 years. What a double whammy. On top of it, to have a farm bill passed--and it does not matter what farm prices are--that is slashing Government support for producers at the very time our chief competitors are spending more. 
   The Europeans, who are our chief competitors and who we were supposed to be convincing to cut their subsidies by cutting ours, did they decide to follow suit? Absolutely not. They have decided to spend more, and they are already spending $50 billion a year to support their farmers. We are spending $5 billion. That is not a fair fight. 
   Our farmers are ready to take on anybody anytime anywhere. They are ready to compete. They are ready to take on the farmers of France and Germany and England, and all the rest, but they are not prepared to take on, in addition to the farmers from those countries, the governments of those countries. They are not prepared to take on the French Government, the German Government, and the British Government, as well as the farmers from those countries. That is not a fair fight. 
   Yet, that is what we have said to our farmers: You go out there and you take on the French farmers and, while you are at it, take on the French Government as well. You go out there and compete against the German farmer, and while you are at it, take on the German Government as well. 
   That is not a fair fight. We have to put tools in the 
   hands of our farmers so they have a chance to fight back. If we do not, we will wake up sometime soon and find that tens of thousands of farm families have been forced off the land and have been destroyed financially. That is what is happening in my State each and every day. Good people, honest people are being destroyed. The question is, Are we going to stand and  help them or are we going to stand by and do nothing? That is the choice that is before us. I hope we respond, and I hope we respond quickly. 
   We need to immediately pass the emergency supplemental that is in the conference committee between the House and the Senate tomorrow. We need to pass that legislation because it provides an expansion of credit to get farmers into the fields, and we need to add to that package. We need to add $1.5 billion to keep the promise that we made last year in the disaster bill. We now know the farmers have signed up for the program that we have promised. We found we are $1.5 billion short of funding what we promised. We ought to keep the promise, and we ought to do it in this bill. 
   In addition, we ought to provide the same supplemental benefit we provided last year to offset this dramatic decline in prices. That would be an AMTA supplemental, transition payments that were provided for in the last farm bill that are going down each and every year. Last year, because of the crisis, we provided a 50-percent supplement. We need to do that again this year. It will cost $2.8 billion. 
   That is a total package approaching $5 billion. Last year, we passed a package of $6 billion. I would like to have that amount again this year, but the reality is that we are going to have to make do with the package like the one I have described, at least for now. But it needs to happen now. We should not wait because while we are waiting, literally thousands of people are being forced off the land and being financially destroyed, through no fault of their own, by being caught up in a circumstance of bad weather, bad prices, and bad policy. There is not much we can do about the prices, there is not much we can do about the weather, but we can do something about the policy. That is our responsibility. I hope we meet that responsibility and meet it this week. 
   I want to show, before I leave this subject, some charts that appeared in the newspapers back home while I was there. It showed the net return per acre of wheat in North Dakota going back to 1986. You can see the kinds of returns that farmers were seeing per acre for planting wheat. Our State is a major wheat State, really one of the key breadbasket States in the Nation. 
   As you can see, there were positive returns of over $30 an acre in 1986 and 1987. Then we saw pretty tough times in 1988, 1989, and 1990, the drought years. We saw a substantial improvement in 1991, 1992, and 1993. In 1994, we saw a steep slide; 1995, further erosion; 1996 was about the same as 1995, and then the bottom fell out in 1997, negative returns per acre approaching a $20 loss per acre. The more you planted, the worse off you were, and the same pattern was repeated in 1998. 
   If we do not act, 1999 is going to be a whole lot worse and, literally, as I have indicated, thousands of farm families are going to be facing auction. I showed a cartoon that was in the biggest paper in my State several weeks ago. It showed a pole, and it had auction signs, 9 or 10 different auction signs all pointing in different directions. Sitting on top of the 
   pole was a buzzard. That is kind of the feeling in my State right now. The buzzards are swooping overhead waiting for another farm failure, waiting for another auction, waiting to see another farm family sold out, because that is what is happening all too frequently in my State these days. 
   If it was not enough to have the dominant crop in negative return territory the last year, this is the pattern of raising cattle. You can see very much a similar pattern, only returns went negative earlier for cattle. In 1995 and 1996, they were negative, and they were barely in the black for 1997 and 1998. 
   Two-thirds of the income in my State is crop income. So when crops are giving negative returns, and then you face on top of that livestock giving negative returns, it is impossible to make money--impossible to make money--again, not through any fault of these farm families. These are the hardest working, most honest people I know, but they are being devastated by events beyond their control. 
   The financial collapse in Asia cost them their biggest customer. The financial collapse in Russia cost them a very big customer. Those events, working together, have created a nightmare for these farm families. Then on top of that, after you stack these natural disasters, you put the final coup de grace--the bad policy coming out of Washington--and it is pretty hard for a farm family to make it. 
   It is pretty hard for them to take on the Europeans when those countries have decided that they are going to spend $50 billion a year to support their producers and we are spending $5 billion. We are being outspent, outgunned, 10-to-1. And why? Because the Europeans decided some time ago that it made sense to their countries to have people out across the land. They did not want to see everybody forced into the city. They did not think that made sense for their society. 
   I hope very soon we will come to a similar conclusion in this country and will decide that it makes sense to have people out across the land, because if we do not respond, there will be precious few people out there; they will all be headed to the cities. The last thing we need in the Washington metroplex is more people: More crowding, more pollution, more hassle. That is exactly what is going to happen unless we respond. 
   This is a good country, a generous country, and one that responds when people are in crisis. We are going to respond to the disasters in Oklahoma, in Kansas, in Tennessee, and the other States that have been affected. I believe we are going to respond in this crisis, as well, in the farm States of America, because they are on the brink of a total financial collapse. That is the seriousness of what is happening. 
   Now is the time; this week is the time; on this supplemental is the time to respond, and to respond strongly, to give people the help they desperately need. 
   I thank the Chair and yield the floor.

   Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, today, I am pleased to join Senator BAUCUS, Senator DASCHLE, and other Senators to introduce the Promoting Health in Rural Areas Act of 1999 (PHIRA). This legislation will improve access, increase choice and improve the quality of health care in rural America. 
   As you know, Mr. President, the Balanced Budget Act (BBA) of 1997 produced real savings for the Medicare program and helped to extend solvency of the program. However, since passing the BBA, we have heard concerns from many rural health care providers that they are facing serious financial pressures due in large part to reductions that were enacted as part of the BBA. 
   During the BBA debate, I was very concerned that across-the-board cuts in Medicare would have a disproportionate impact on rural health care. Rural hospitals rely heavily on Medicare and in my state of North Dakota, Medicare accounts for 70 percent of hospital revenue. This means that Medicare reimbursement reductions have a bigger direct impact on rural hospitals than on other hospitals. It also means that rural hospitals have fewer other sources of revenues where they can increase margins to make up for losses in Medicare revenue. 
   To help protect access to health care in rural areas, I and a coalition of other Senators, worked hard to fight for provisions in the BBA to protect our rural areas. We made positive steps toward ensuring that health care in rural areas is affordable and accessible. 
   Our victories included, for the first time, requiring Medicare reimbursement for telehealth. Also included was the creation of the Critical Access Hospital program. The BBA also helped to reform managed care reimbursement to make it more equitable to rural areas and added Graduate Medical Education language to protect rural residency programs. 
   Despite our efforts, BBA reductions are having an unfair and disproportionate impact on rural health care systems--these cuts have caused real pain for providers and threaten to reduce access to health care for seniors, particularly in rural areas. 
   To help address these concerns, we have worked hard to develop legislation that will ensure our rural areas have access to quality care. The Promoting Health in Rural Areas Act of 1999 will improve Medicaid and Medicare reimbursement to rural providers, strengthen health professional recruitment programs, and encourage the development of telehealth. 
   One problem that rural areas face is reimbursement systems that favor urban areas, or that do not take the special needs of rural providers into account. Medicare payments to hospitals are currently based on formulas that are biased toward urban areas. The first element of PHIRA would correct these formulas and pay hospitals more fairly. In the BBA, Medicaid funding for Community Health Clinics (CHCs) and Rural Health Clinics (RHCs) was changed, leaving no guarantee that states will adequately fund these facilities. This bill would create a new payment system for CHCs and RHCs that will help ensure continued support for these essential facilities. 
   The bill would also guarantee that Medicare+Choice plans in rural counties get the increased reimbursement promised in the BBA. This provision is important to ensure that beneficiaries in rural areas have at least some of the health plan choices that are available to urban seniors. 
   The second element of our bill includes provisions to attract and bring more health care providers into our communities. Rural communities face difficulties in recruiting and retaining health care providers. In my state, over 85% of counties are designated as either a partial or full health shortage profession area (HPSA). Nationwide, 22 million rural Americans live in HPSAs. We must do more to attract qualified health care providers into our rural areas. Currently, communities must actually lose a physician before they qualify for recruitment assistance to replace that provider. This bill would let communities get assistance for up to 12 months in advance when they know someone is going to retire. In addition, this bill will take positive steps to ensure that our future health care providers choose to serve in HPSAs. Currently, students in our National Health Service Corps program, a program helps students pay for their medical education or re-pay their medical student loans in return for serving in HPSAs, are facing undue hardship due to the fact that they are being taxed on scholarships they receive to participate in the NHSC. This bill will reward students for their commitment to working in HPSAs by exempting them from being taxed on their NHSC scholarships. 
   The third element of PHIRA will go even further to ensure that the most important medical services are available in our communities by expanding access to telehealth services. The  promise of telehealth is becoming increasingly apparent. Throughout the country, providers are experimenting with a variety of telehealth approaches in an effort to improve access to quality medical and other health-related services. Those programs are demonstrating that telecommunications technology can alleviate the constraints of time and distance, as well as the cost and inconvenience of transporting patients to medical providers. Many approaches show promising results in reducing health care costs and bringing adequate care to all Americans. For the first time, technological advances and the development of a national information infrastructure give telehealth the potential to overcome barriers to health care services for rural Americans and afford them the access that most Americans take for granted. But it is clear that our nation must do more to integrate telehealth into our overall health care delivery infrastructure. 
   This bill would expand Medicare reimbursement for telemedicine to all rural areas, and to all Medicare services. Medicare reimbursement policy is an essential component of helping to integrate telehealth into the health care infrastructure and is particularly important in rural areas, where many hospitals do as much as 80% of their business with Medicare patients. Because the Secretary defined reimbursable services so narrowly in the BBA, this legislation clarifies that all services that are covered under Medicare Part B will be covered if they are instead delivered vial telehealth. In particular, it clarifies that the technology called ``store and forward'', which is a cost-effective method of transferring information, is included in this reimbursement policy. 
   This bill will also help communities build home-grown telehealth networks. It will help to build telehealth infrastructure and foster rural economic development, and it incorporates many of the most important lessons learned from other grant projects and studies on telehealth from across the Federal government. Because so many rural and underserved communities lack the ability to attract and support a wide variety of health care professionals and services, it is important to find a way to bring the most important medical services into those communities. Telehealth provides an important part of the answer. It helps bring services to remote areas in a quick, cost-effective manner, and can enable patients to avoid traveling long distances in order to receive health care treatment. 
   Mr. President, I am confident that the Promoting Health in Rural Areas Act will take important steps toward ensuring those in our rural and underserved communities have access to quality, affordable health care. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.

   Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I add my words to those who talked about the tragedy in Oklahoma this morning. I remember watching television last night and seeing the power and the destructive might of those storms that swept across Oklahoma and parts of Kansas as well. 
   I have a feeling for what the people are going through, as a result of the disasters that hit North Dakota in 1997. We had the worst flood in 500 years in Grand Forks, ND, and we had 95 percent of the town evacuated, the largest mass evacuation of a city in the United States since the Civil War. I know the trauma those people are facing, and I know the difficulty of recovery.  
   Our hearts go out to the people in Oklahoma and Kansas who have been so affected. I hope they know that we are prepared to respond and to help. We in North Dakota remember very well how people reached out a helping hand to our State, so many people from around the country who actually came to North Dakota to help us rebuild--the Red Cross, the other organizations, the Salvation Army. We had a woman from California who came to town and gave $2,000 to every family that had been affected, a gift of tens of millions of dollars. 
   We remember very well the Federal Government's rapid response, the agencies of the Federal Government that moved to assist the people who were affected. FEMA did an absolutely superb job under the leadership of James Lee Witt. We will never forget it. The Department of Housing and Urban Development, under the leadership of Secretary Cuomo, did a superb job, and we will never forget their help. The SBA was quick to move in to help businesses. We know all of those agencies will be ready to respond in Oklahoma and Kansas as well. 
   I hope that we see the Congress respond. I believe the people in Oklahoma and Kansas deserve the same kind of rapid and full response that we received in North Dakota. Frankly, I hope they don't face some of the delays we faced in trying to get a congressional response, because when people are devastated, they should not have to wait for help. This Government is big enough and strong enough and this country is generous enough to move to help immediately. 
   Mr. President, again, our hearts go out to the people in Oklahoma and Kansas who have lived through this trauma; and to those who have lost relatives and loved ones, we share their deep sorrow.

   Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I also want to comment on the National Teacher Appreciation Week, because I think all of us can look back in our own backgrounds and remember what a difference teachers made in our lives. 
   I can remember very well the teachers who made a contribution to my life, to my growing up: Mrs. Goplin, who taught American history and who really shared a great love for understanding the Constitution of the United States, always told us that this is one of the greatest documents in human history. I will never forget those words of Mrs. Goplin. 
   She was exactly right. Our Constitution is one of the greatest documents in human history, and how lucky we are to live in a country that has constitutional guarantees of freedom for the American people and says to each and every American, you have certain rights, rights that protect you from the overreach of government, because our forefathers had known in Europe that government can become oppressive and that government can make demands on its citizenry that are not fair, that are not reasonable. We are so lucky to have these protections. 
   I remember other teachers: My third grade teacher, Mrs. Offerdahl, who is still alive in a nursing home in North Dakota, what a great woman. She  came every morning to that class with a sparkle in her eye and a love for learning and a love for teaching. She made a difference not only in my life but in the lives of hundreds and hundreds of students whom she taught over a very long career in the Bismarck, ND, school system--Mrs. Offerdahl. 
   And Mrs. Senzek, who was my fifth grade teacher, a highly intelligent woman, somebody who was absolutely committed to improving the educational standards of the kids in Bismarck, ND. My sixth grade teacher, Miss Barbie, who was a very sophisticated woman, somebody who loved reading and imparted that love to students. 
   I think back to how fortunate we were to have people of that quality and that caring who provided education to us and at great sacrifice to themselves. I can say every one of these women whom I have mentioned could have made much more money doing something else, but they were dedicated to teaching young people, and they made enormous financial sacrifices to do it. 
   There are so many other teachers along the way whom I remember. Mrs. Hook was my second grade teacher. She was a woman of real majesty, really almost a regal person, very tall, very erect, very dignified, somebody who commanded respect. 
   These are people who made an impression that has lasted a lifetime, lasted a lifetime for me, but I know lasted a lifetime for other students in the Bismarck public school system as well. 
   Mr. President, I add our words of praise to all the teachers across this country who make a difference in the lives of kids. Other than family members, other than parents, perhaps there is no more important relationship than what teachers do in terms of training our kids. So, today, we say thank you, thank you for everything you have done. You have made a difference.

   Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I want to talk about another crisis that is occurring in this country. It is not receiving the attention as are the storms in Oklahoma, the tornadoes, and the tremendous damage that has been wreaked in those States by this set of storms, but it is a crisis nonetheless. It is almost a stealth crisis. It is a crisis in American agriculture, and I can tell you, it is causing trauma, too. 
   In my State, we have just seen a series of headlines in the major newspapers that tell the story. I thought I would bring them to the attention of my colleagues today so hopefully we can reflect not only on the tragedy in Oklahoma and Kansas, but we can reflect on the tragedy that is happening in central America, and I mean the central America of North Dakota and South Dakota, Montana, Nebraska, and Kansas--States that have been hard hit by a virtual depression in agriculture. 
   It is causing real trauma, Mr. President. These headlines tell the story. This headline sums it up: ``The rural depression.'' There is a real depression in the heartland of America. Prices, the lowest we have seen in 50 years, are causing literally thousands of farmers to exit agriculture. 
   Here is another headline which recently ran in papers back home: ``Farm prices, farm numbers both fall.'' 
   And this headline that says: ``Another farm dies; does Washington really care?'' That is the question we are going to be asking today and we are going to continue to ask as we see this crisis grow and develop affecting more and more farm families and starting to affect the small towns of our State as well. 
   In fact, this headline says it well: ``AG Crisis Is Bigger Than N.D.'' This is an editorial from the largest paper in our State pointing out that not only is North Dakota affected but other farm States as well. 
   This is a headline which ran recently: ``State Loses Farmers.'' And one headline which ran, again, in the biggest paper in our State: ``Crop Prices Are the Problem.'' And indeed they are. ``Crop Prices Are the Problem.'' This article says, ``Crop prices, that's the big thing wrong with the region's farm picture this year.'' And they are exactly right. 
   When I mentioned the crisis has moved from the farmstead to the streets of North Dakota, this headline tells that story: ``Farm Downturn Leaves Main Street Reeling. Three family-run businesses in Michigan, North Dakota closed, with little hope of reopening.'' 
   There is the crisis that is receiving enormous attention in Oklahoma and Kansas--and it should have enormous attention. Those people deserve for others to understand what is happening and the suffering they are experiencing. 
   There is another crisis as well, and that is the crisis in farm country. Those people are suffering. And they deserve attention as well. 
   Let me just show another chart which goes right to the heart of the problem we are facing. This shows what has happened to farm prices from 1946 to 1998 for wheat and barley. You can see from the prices--this is 1998--it has even gotten worse. We go out to 1999, and these prices continue to decline in real terms. We have the lowest prices now for these commodities in 52 years. This is a crisis by any definition. 
   I just want to conclude by going back to what one of the articles said in the papers back home. This says: ``Banks' Survey Shows Farm Income Dwindling.'' In this article they say, ``The vice is tightening on farm borrowers in the Upper Great Plains. The outlook for farm income is grim unless commodity prices increase.'' 
   Mr. President, that is exactly the case. We face a tightening noose around the necks of literally thousands of farm families, and it is time for a response from the Federal Government. We need to pass the disaster supplemental. We need to make the last disaster program we passed whole, because we now know it will cost $1.5 billion more to keep the promise which was made in that disaster program. We need to once again shore up the transition payments that are promised farmers under the new farm bill at this time of price collapse. 
   Those are steps we can take, we need to take, we must take. In addition, we should reform crop insurance, because we know that program does not work when you have multiple years of disaster. 
   I just close by saying once again, I hope America is listening and understands that there are tragedies occurring across the United States. We have a tragedy in Oklahoma, a tragedy in Kansas, and we ought to respond. 
   There are also tragedies that are occurring below the radar screen. They are not getting the attention of the national press. They are a crisis nonetheless, and we ought to respond to them as well. 
   I thank the Chair and yield the floor. 
   Mr. President, I know my colleague from Montana is waiting to speak.

   Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise today as an original cosponsor of the bipartisan Flag Protection Act of 1999. I salute its author, Senator MCCONNELL of Kentucky. 
   I believe every Member of this body abhors acts of desecration against the flag. Burning a flag, or otherwise dishonoring this symbol of freedom, is repugnant to me, to my colleagues, and to the vast majority of American citizens. I believe we should protect the flag from the acts of those few who would dishonor it. 
   But the question is, How do we do it? Mr. President, we have previously passed a statute to protect the flag but that was overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court as unconstitutional. 
   Some now say the only alternative is to pass a constitutional amendment. After considerable study and review, I have concluded that is not the case. There is an alternative, and the alternative is the legislation that we offer today, the Flag Protection Act of 1999. It is a statute. It is not a constitutional amendment. It will protect the flag, and I believe it will be upheld as constitutional. 
   We have a clear responsibility to exhaust all other options before we take the very serious step of amending the Constitution of the United States. Every one of us in the Senate pledges on our first day in this Chamber to uphold, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States. Amending that time-honored, time-tested document is among the most serious of our duties--a step we have taken only rarely in the long history of our country. 
   The Constitution is the foundation of our Government. I believe it is one of the greatest documents in human history. Its freedoms are the source of our strength as a nation--and a model of freedom to the world. 
   Mr. President, the Founding Fathers wisely made it very difficult to amend the Constitution. They knew that a process that would allow for easy amendment of the Constitution could destabilize our country, that it could undermine the stability we have enjoyed through our long history. The Constitution has been amended only 27 times in 200 years, although many more attempts have been made. 
   Those 27 amendments, beginning with the Bill of Rights, were the result  of fundamental debates about the nature of our society, and who we would be as a nation. Freedom of religion, freedom of the press, freedom to assemble peacefully, the right to a trial by jury, the right to vote--these amendments address rights so basic we almost take them for granted today. Yet, some of them at the time of adoption provoked serious debate and division, division so deep they threatened to split the country. 
   Mr. President, I hesitate to launch this Nation on an undertaking of such magnitude and divisiveness. When there is an alternative--and there is an alternative--I believe we can protect the flag without amending the Constitution. I believe we can propose and pass a statute that will protect the flag against burning and other acts of desecration, and I believe that statute will be upheld as constitutional. 
   That is why today I am joining this bipartisan effort with my colleagues, Senator MCCONNELL of Kentucky, Senator DORGAN of North Dakota, and Senator BENNETT of Utah, to introduce the Flag Protection Act of 1999. This statute provides for maximum protection for the flag while respecting the liberties it symbolizes. We have been assured by experts at the Congressional Research Service and by constitutional scholars that it will be upheld by the courts. 
   When it comes to amending the Constitution, I am conservative. I feel strongly that the flag can and should be protected. But before we take the step of amending the Constitution of the United States, we should exhaust every other remedy. Today we have introduced a statutory remedy. I ask my colleagues to join me in approving this law to protect the flag and the Constitution.

   Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I would also like to read briefly from a letter I received from a constituent in North Dakota. He wrote to me the following:  
   As a third generation military officer, I cannot support an amendment to the Constitution with respect to the flag. I have many compelling reasons to ask that you not support this amendment. My sworn duty as an officer in the United States Air Force to uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States lies at the heart of my opposition. This amendment will weaken the Constitution and open the door for more frivolous amendments in the future. I cannot stand by and let this happen without raising my voice.  
   He went on to say:  
   Of the gallant Americans who fought and died in the service of our country within the last 200 years, I tell you this: They did not die defending the flag. They died defending our freedom and the ideals upon which our country was founded. Don't cheapen their sacrifice by supporting this misguided amendment.  
   Mr. President, a third letter that I received was from a man also from North Dakota. He wrote me this:  
   On my mother's side, my great-grandfather came to the United States from Bohemia and fought in the Union Army. On my father's side, my great-grandmother lost her two oldest sons, Iowa soldiers, at the Siege of Vicksburg. And members of my family have represented the United States in every war since. I am a Korean War combat veteran.  
   He went on to say:  
   The flag is strong enough to take care of itself. But if these flag protectors are sincere about its protection, then strong legislation is the safest way to go.  
   Mr. President, that is what we are offering today on a bipartisan basis--four Senators; two Democrats, two Republicans--offering the Flag Protection Act of 1999. We believe this is the appropriate way to protect the flag. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor. 
   Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.

   Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, today I am pleased to be joined by Senators NICKLES, ROCKEFELLER, INOUYE, and HARKIN to introduce legislation that directs the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) to develop a classification standard appropriate to the occupation of physician assistant. 
   Physician assistants are a part of a growing field of health care professionals that make quality health care available and affordable in underserved areas throughout our country. Because the physician assistant profession was very young when OPM first developed employment criteria in 1970, the agency adapted the nursing classification system for physician assistants. Today, this is no longer appropriate. Physician assistants have different education and training requirements than nurses and they are licensed and evaluated according to different criteria. 
   The inaccurate classification of physician assistants had led to recruitment and retention problems of physician assistants in federal agencies, usually caused by low starting salaries and low salary caps. Because it is recognized that physician assistants provide cost-effective health care, this is an important problem to resolve. 
   This legislation mandates that OPM review this classification in consultation with physician assistants and the organizations that represent physician assistants. The bill specifically states that OPM should consider the educational and practice qualifications of the position as well as the treatment of physician assistants in the private sector in this review. 
   Mr. President, I believe that this legislation will make an important correction that will help federal agencies make better use of these providers of cost-effective, high quality health care.

   Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise to speak today about the continuing crisis in agriculture. Last night I was watching CNN. They had the first of a series of programs on the crisis in agriculture. They interviewed a cotton farmer from the Deep South who has a 2,500-acre farm, which is not a small farm but certainly not one of the largest. He was telling the interviewer that he lost $500,000 last year. 
   I tell that story because that was a farmer from the Deep South. I represent North Dakota, the opposite end of the country. We are having exactly the same experience in our part of the country, a farm depression. 
   This is a cartoon that ran in the major newspaper back home. It is a picture of vultures sitting on signs of farm auctions, pointing the way to farm auctions. There are one, two, three, four, five, six, seven different signs pointing towards farm auctions with the buzzard sitting on top of the sign. The cartoon says, ``Tis spring! Tis spring! Tis spring!'' 
   That is how an awful lot of us are feeling because in most of the country we are celebrating spring. Certainly here in the Nation's Capital we see beautiful flowers in bloom and we are enjoying absolutely gorgeous weather. We are celebrating a rebirth, a renewal. 
   But we are not celebrating in farm country because spring has brought us up against hard reality. The hard reality is that our operations are not going to make it. They are not cash-flowing. Many farmers are not getting the credit they need to get into the field this spring. 
   That is why the now stalled emergency supplemental is important. It provides emergency disaster funding for farm credit to assure that those who are credit worthy can get into the field to plant this year's crop. 
   Too many feel that agriculture has turned against them, that policy here has turned against them, that trade policy has turned against them, and, yes, that market forces have turned against them. 
   Look at the very tough facts that our producers face. This chart shows wheat prices. The red line on the chart shows the cost of production across the country. Producing a bushel of wheat costs about $5. This jagged line shows what has happened to wheat prices. Wheat prices are now $2.40 a bushel, and it costs over $5 to produce it. 
   This is the pattern going back to 1996. The last time we were at the cost of production was back in 1996. Since that time, wheat prices have plunged. Why? It is a complicated series of factors, starting with the Asian financial collapse that cost us some of our best markets, followed by the financial collapse in Russia that did further damage to our farmers because, of course, Russia was a big customer of ours. Yet now they cannot pay because they are out of hard currency. We have had that double whammy. On top of that, we have had good production weather around most of the world, so production has been up, yet because of the financial problems in Asia and Russia, demand is down. That has led to a dramatic price weakening. 
   In the midst of that, we passed a new farm bill. The new farm bill, unfortunately, doesn't work well when prices collapse because there is no adjustment for price collapses. Under 
   the old farm policy, when prices went down, support  went up. Under this new policy, support goes down year by year no matter what happens to prices. The combination is leaving our farmers in the ditch, literally and figuratively. Our prices are so bad, so ruinously low, that literally tens of thousands of farm families face foreclosure. 
   This is not just true in our part of the country. The distinguished Chair is from a nearby State. They are experiencing the effect of these very low prices, not only in terms of row crops, not only in terms of wheat, barley, and other commodities, but in terms of beef, in terms of hogs. We see hog prices as low as 8.5 cents a pound. It costs 40 cents a pound to produce a hog. If farmers only get 8.5 cents a pound when they go to sell, they are in deep trouble. 
   We are down to only 800 hog producers in my State. We anticipate losing as many as three-quarters of them this year; 600 of the 800 are going to go out of business. The story is not much different in terms of beef because we see cattle prices at very, very low levels. 
   The combination--whether it is in our part of the country, the northern plains, or as I started these remarks talking about this cotton farmer in the Deep South losing $500,000 last year on only 2,500 acres--is a calamity. What is especially ironic is it is in the midst of a great economic boom across the country. We have probably never had better economic times in the larger economy, yet when we look at agriculture, we see the worst of times. 
   It is really a result of a triple whammy: bad prices, bad policy, and bad weather. To top it all off, in addition to the bad prices, these are the lowest prices in 52 years; on top of that, the bad policy--trade policy and farm policy--that has left farmers without much help in a time of this financial collapse; on top of that, we have had bad weather. In my State, 5 years of overly wet conditions have led to the biggest outbreak of a disease called scab that has also dramatically reduced production. Talk about a bad set of facts, that is it: bad prices, bad weather, and bad policy. 
   We have a chance to do something on the policy front. It won't solve the problem, but it will help. It is urgently needed. That is the disaster supplemental that is before the Senate. 
   I ask my colleagues, can't we move on that disaster supplemental? Can't we move on that legislation now? Can't we pass it? If we wait, it will be too late. If we wait, it is simply going to be too late. Farmers need to be in the field now. This is the end of April. Time waits for no man. Time does not wait when you are planting a crop. 
   I hope my colleagues will respond to this plea that we pass the urgent supplemental directly. I hope we do it this week and get that money out there where it can do some good and help these farmers through what is the worst crisis they have faced since the 1930s. 
   The time to act is now. I urge my colleagues to participate in that effort. We passed it here the end of March, and now here we are at the end of April. There is something dysfunctional when we have disaster emergency legislation before us and we passed it in this Chamber a month ago and it still is not out there; it is still not implemented. 
   Mr. President, I ask our colleagues to act on that disaster supplemental and to do it now. I thank the Chair. 
   I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise today, joined by my colleagues Mr. NICKLES, Mr. MACK, Mr. ROBB, and Mr. BAUCUS, to introduce important legislation to provide for a 10-year depreciation life for leasehold improvements. Leasehold improvements are the alterations to leased space made by a building owner as part of the lease agreement with a tenant. 
   These improvements can include interior walls, partitions, flooring, lighting, wiring and plumbing--essentially any fixture that an owner provides in space leased to a tenant. They keep a building modern, upgraded, and energy efficient. In actual commercial use, leasehold improvements typically last as long as the lease--an average of 5 to 10 years. However, the Internal Revenue Code requires leasehold improvements to be depreciated over 39 years--the life of the building. 
   Economically, this makes no sense. The owner receives taxable income over the life of the lease (i.e., 10 years), yet can only recover the costs of the improvements associated with the lease over 39 years--a rate nearly four times slower. This wild mismatch of income and expenses causes the owner to incur an artificially high tax cost on these improvements. 
   The bill we introduce today will correct this irrational and uneconomic tax treatment by shortening the cost recovery period for certain leasehold improvements from 39 years to a more realistic 10 years. If enacted, this legislation would more closely align the expenses incurred to construct these improvements with the income they generate during the lease term. 
   For example, a building owner who makes a $100,000 leasehold improvement for a 10-year, $1 million lease would be able to recover this entire investment by the end of that lease at a rate of $10,000 per year. Under current law, this $100,000 improvement is recovered at a rate of $2,564 per year over 39 years. 
   By reducing this cost recovery period, the expense of making these improvements would fall more into line with the economics of a commercial lease transaction, and more property owners would be able to adapt their buildings to fit the demanding needs of today's modern business tenant. Small business should find this bill particularly helpful, because small businesses turn over their rental space more frequently than larger businesses. And we cannot forget that over 80 percent of building owners who provide space to small businesses are themselves small businesses. 
   We have an interest in keeping existing buildings commercially viable. When older buildings can serve tenants who need modern, efficient commercial space, there is less pressure for developing greenfields in outlying areas. Americans are concerned about preserving open space, natural resources and a sense of neighborhood. The current law 39-year cost recovery for leasehold improvements is an impediment to reinvesting in existing properties and communities. 
   This legislation has the strong backing of six major real estate organizations, including the National Realty Committee, the national Association of Realtors, the International Council of Shopping Centers, the national Association of Industrial and Office Properties, the national Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, and the Building and Office Managers Association, International. 
   I urge all Senators to join us in supporting this legislation to provide rational depreciation treatment for leasehold improvements.

   Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, today the Senate is debating the so-called Social Security lockbox. This is legislation that was intended to protect the Social Security surpluses. Unfortunately, it failed. 
   Throughout my tenure in the Senate, as a member of the Senate Budget Committee and the Senate Finance Committee, I have done my level best to support balancing the budget without counting Social Security surpluses and to protect those surpluses. 
   That is why I was looking forward to this debate. I was hoping we were going to have a chance to really engage in a discussion about how to protect Social Security--to go through the normal legislative process, to offer amendments, to have votes and to let Senators decide the outcome. 
   Unfortunately, the advocates of this particular approach apparently are so insecure about their approach that they won't permit any amendments. They don't want a debate. They do not want votes to decide the outcome. That is unfortunate. 
   But I think it speaks volumes about the weakness of their position. It seems incredibly ironic to this Senator that a bill whose sponsors say is designed to protect Social Security actually puts Social Security benefit payments at risk. 
   Let me repeat that. 
   This bill which is advertised to protect Social Security actually puts Social Security benefit payments at risk. 
   That is not just the view of this Senator. That is the view of the Secretary of the Treasury, who has the responsibility for making Social Security payments. The Secretary of the Treasury, Mr. Rubin, in a letter dated yesterday, wrote in part:  
   Our analysis indicates that this provision could preclude the United States from meeting its financial obligations to repay maturing debt and to make benefit payments--including Social Security checks--and could also worsen a future economic downturn.  
   The Secretary of the Treasury says this bill is the wrong way to protect Social Security. 
   Interestingly enough, it is not just the Secretary of the Treasury who says that and has reached that conclusion. We also have a letter from the Chairman of the Ways and Means Committee in the House of Representatives, Chairman ARCHER. Chairman ARCHER in a letter to the Chairman of the Budget Committee in the House of Representatives, dated April 9, says:  
   One has only to read the arguments presented in the March 17, 1999, letter from Secretary Rubin to appreciate the dire consequences always presented during a debt limit crisis--disruption of Treasury bond management and worldwide financial markets, doubts about making government payments including Social Security benefits, and raising borrowing costs to the taxpayers--and why Congress always votes to raise the limit.  
   Chairman ARCHER, the Republican Chairman of the Ways and Means Committee in the House of Representatives that has jurisdiction over this issue, says in conclusion in his letter:  
   I see no need to enact limits, even if merely advisory, that do not directly protect the Social Security surplus and re-ignite the debt limit controversy that proved so bitter and futile for everyone four years ago.  
   That is the Chairman of the Ways and Means Committee in the House of Representatives warning that this legislation is not the way to protect Social Security. 
   Instead, he says:  
   In my view, strict budget enforcement measures are the most effective way to control spending. To reduce debt, the President and the Congress, like every American household, must commit themselves to spending constraint.  
   The Chairman of the Ways and Means Committee is exactly right. The Secretary of the Treasury is exactly right. We are pursuing an illusion here. It is an attractive illusion. It is an illusion that suggests if we just will adopt it, that it is going to save Social Security. Unfortunately, it will not. 
   I would really like to know what the sponsors of this legislation are so afraid of. Why have they, through a contorted plan, blocked anybody from offering an amendment? Why do they want to prevent Senators from voting on alternatives? Why? Because they are afraid of the results. They are  afraid they would lose in the cold, hard light of day. They fear that if we have a real debate out here about options and alternatives that their alternative wouldn't hold up. 
   What is there to fear by having votes right here on the floor of the Senate, and deciding this issue the way we decide all others? Why have they gone through their contorted legislative process, this legislative scheme, to prevent people from voting their conscience? I think it is because they know they have a plan that does not hold up. 
   I think you really have to wonder. Are they really interested in protecting Social Security, including its trust funds and benefit payments? Or do they just want a quick vote on a bill whose provisions can't withstand scrutiny? 
   Mr. President, I think we should subject this legislation to scrutiny just as we do other legislation. If we do, we will see that instead of protecting Social Security, this legislation endangers Social Security, while risking more Government shutdowns and default on our obligations. 
   Mr. President, the lockbox that has been offered here today creates limits on publicly-held debt that are supposedly enforceable with 60-vote points of order. 
   I strongly support the goal of paying down publicly-held debt. But creating supermajority points of order against raising the debt limit won't accomplish that goal. The ability of the Federal Government to pay down publicly-held debt is created through tough fiscal decisions, 
   decisions to control spending, decisions not to squander the surpluses that are projected to occur over the next 10 years. 
   If Congress fails to make those tough decisions and spends the surpluses, debt will rise. Creating a debt crisis at that point in time is too late. At that point, the Federal Government has obligations it simply must meet. 
   Interestingly enough, Chairman ARCHER agrees with me on this point as well. He says:  
   ..... debt limits have a long history of failure in preventing spending and deficits. Hitting a debt limit, like a credit card limit, merely represents the consequences of government spending already approved by the President and Congress.  
   So these new limits on debt could preclude the United States from meeting its future financial obligations to repay debt and to honor its commitments. They would produce permanent damage to our credit standing. The debt obligations of the United States are currently recognized as the most creditworthy of any investment in the world. It is in our interest to maintain that standard. Even the appearance of risk would impose significant additional costs on American taxpayers. 
   I think we all remember November of 1995. A debt crisis was precipitated when Government borrowing reached the debt limit; two months later, in January, Moody's, the credit-rating firm, placed Treasury securities on review for possible downgrade. It is absurd to put us back in that position--endangering the credit rating of the United States to supposedly protect us against rising debt, when this legislation doesn't do that. 
   In addition to the damage that can be done to the U.S. credit rating, this lockbox also puts Social Security benefit payments at risk, as I have indicated before. Again, that is not just my opinion, it is the opinion of the Secretary of the Treasury who has the responsibility to make those payments. It is the opinion of the Chairman of the Ways and Means Committee in the House of Representatives who has jurisdiction over these issues. 
   The point is simple: during a debt crisis, the Treasury Department has no ability to prioritize the payment of Government benefits that are coming due. If Congress cannot raise the debt limit, Social Security benefits cannot be made. 
   The sponsors of this lockbox claim they have addressed this problem in their legislation. They say they have directed Treasury to give priority to Social Security payments. Unfortunately, the Treasury Department has no ability to do that now. If the Treasury Department runs out of borrowing authority and has no cash coming in, prioritization of payments won't help anyway. The Treasury would have no ability to pay Social Security benefits that are due. Using the debt limit as a fiscal policy tool is bad policy. It directly places at risk the benefit payments to Social Security recipients. 
   These are not the only shortcomings of this legislation. Another of the serious problems with the legislation before the Senate is that it risks creating longer and deeper recessions than our economy might otherwise experience. 
   I am concerned about the economic and fiscal impact these debt limit targets could have on the economy during a time of recession. I believe these limits would require the Federal Government to take the wrong actions during recessionary periods, making recessions more severe and negating the stabilizing counter-cyclical tools the Federal Government can use during times of recession. 
   Sometimes I wonder if we learn from the past. Sometimes I wonder if we are not condemned to repeat the unfortunate experiences of the past because we don't learn those lessons. We suffered depression after depression in this country before we finally figured out how to counter the cycle of recession and depression. What this legislation could do is take away those tools at the very time they are most needed. 
   This lockbox legislation requires the Federal Government to 
   hit a debt limit target on May 1 of each year. Throughout the year, the debt target could not be exceeded. During years when we are heading towards the trough of the business cycle, revenues grow more slowly because more people are unemployed and expenditures for programs like unemployment insurance and food stamps rise. When those two things happen, the deficit gets larger and the Treasury has to issue more debt. Under this proposal, the Treasury couldn't issue more debt. At that point, the lockbox would become a noose on this economy, making the recession worse, requiring the Congress to either raise taxes or cut spending at precisely the wrong time. 
   That is economic folly. It is at that very time that the counter-cyclical tools ought to be used to lessen the recession, to prevent depression. That is what our economic history teaches. We should not forget the lessons so bitterly learned. 
   Our friends advocating this legislation say they have included an exception for recession in their lockbox. The problem is, it won't work. The exception allows the debt limit targets in the lockbox to turn off if the U.S. economy experiences two quarters of real GDP growth that is less than 1 percent. 
   This chart shows a few examples of recessions over the last 20 years to see what would have happened had this legislation been in place. For example, the recession of 1981-1982 lasted from July of 1981 to November of 1982. The chart shows what was happening with economic growth during that period. The recession began back in July of 1981. But the trigger under this lockbox legislation would come nine months after the recession had already begun. It chokes off the counter-cyclical tools needed for the first nine months, guaranteeing a deeper recession and perhaps even plunging this economy into depression. 
   This is truly dangerous legislation. It should not be passed. We have the Secretary of the Treasury warning, ``Do not pass this legislation;'' we have the Republican chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee warning, ``Do not pass this legislation.'' What is wrong with those who continue to advocate, in the face of those warnings, legislation that will not protect Social Security, that will endanger it, that further endangers plunging this economy into a worse recession or perhaps even a depression in a time of economic downturn--especially when we have alternatives that we know will work. 
   Those alternatives can't be considered because the advocates of this legislation have engaged in a legislative scheme to prevent amendments, to prevent the consideration of alternatives. What a way to legislate. 
   If we look at another example, the recession of 1973-1975, we see the quarterly economic growth fluctuated greatly. That recession lasted from November of 1973 to March of 1975. The lockbox provided for in this legislation would not have kicked in until January of 1975, when the recession had been going on for more than a year. We can see on the chart why that is the case. The recession started back in  1973. We can see economic growth fluctuated back and forth--growing, falling; growing, falling. It would have only been late in the recession that this lockbox legislation would have allowed the counter-cyclical policies of the Government to come into play. 
   This legislation simply does not work. This data shows that a recession in the U.S. economy will very likely precipitate a debt crisis, despite the exemption provided in the lockbox. 
   These are not the only defects of this legislation. There is another major problem with the lockbox that is before us, because there is something not included in the lockbox. Medicare is not included in this lockbox. Not one penny of non-Social Security surpluses is included in this lockbox, not one penny. Medicare is under more severe fiscal pressure than Social Security, but Medicare has been left out. Why? Because our friends who are the advocates of this proposal prefer to use the surplus for a tax break scheme. They prefer a tax break scheme, so they do not guarantee one penny of the non-Social Security surplus for Medicare. 
   We have an important decision to make. Do we use the non-Social Security surplus in a tax cut scheme that will provide the greatest relief for the wealthiest among us? Or do we save the Social Security surpluses for Social Security, extend the solvency of Medicare, and still provide room for targeted tax relief and high-priority domestic needs like education, agriculture, health care, and defense? To me, the choice is absolutely clear; we must honor our commitments to the seniors of America. 
   That does not mean we do not need to reform Medicare; obviously we do. I think everybody understands we need to take action to put Medicare on a more sound financial footing, and I have voted consistently in the Finance Committee to do that. But we must also ensure that whatever we do to put Medicare on a more sound financial footing also preserves affordable access to high-quality health care for our senior citizens. 
   Responsible Medicare reform will be much more difficult if we do not provide additional resources to Medicare during this time of severe pressure, because of the demographic changes in this country. The very real pain the balanced budget act of 1997 is already causing suggests to me that making additional cuts of hundreds of billions of dollars over the next 10 years in Medicare, without providing additional resources, would be irresponsible. That is why the lockbox I have supported protects Social Security and Medicare. 
   Senator LAUTENBERG and I have an alternative lockbox that really does protect Social Security, that does protect Medicare, that does pay down the Federal debt even more aggressively than what our friends on the other side of the aisle are proposing, that does provide room for targeted tax relief and for high-priority domestic needs like education, agriculture, health care, and defense. 
   Our Social Security and Medicare lockbox creates supermajority points of order against any legislation that does not save the entire Social Security surplus in each year and does not save at least 40 percent of the non-Social Security surplus for Medicare. Our lockbox is enforced with points of order and sequestration. It is not enforced through the debt limit. It follows the advice of the Secretary of the Treasury, Mr. Rubin. It follows the advice of the Chairman of the Ways and Means Committee in the House of Representatives. 
   Our amendment provides a remedy if Social Security surpluses are spent--across-the-board cuts in other programs. That is a real defense of Social Security. That is something we know works. Our amendment also adds a new supermajority point of order against a budget resolution that violates the off-budget treatment of Social Security. Our amendment reserves $65 billion for Medicare over the next 5 years, and $376 billion over the next 10 years. After passage of comprehensive Social Security and Medicare reform, our alternative provides $385 billion over the next 10 years for targeted tax relief and for high-priority needs like education, agriculture, health care, and defense. And our amendment reduces publicly-held debt by $300 billion more than the Republican lockbox. It protects Social Security, the surpluses and the benefit payments, and it provides additional resources for Medicare. 
   That is the type of lockbox the Senate should approve. I hope we have an opportunity to consider this alternative. But under the current legislative structure we will not, because the advocates of the legislation before us do not want an alternative considered. They do not want any amendments. They do not want any alternatives. They do not want to give Senators a chance to choose. They want it their way or no way.

   Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation which would help clarify an issue that relates to Medicare coverage for anesthesia services and its impact on rural health care. 
   As a senator representing a predominantly rural state, I know only too well the difficulties facing rural health care needs. Access to care in rural areas is slowly worsening as more and more rural hospitals close their doors in the face of overwhelming cost pressures. Clearly, one aspect of access to care is access to surgical procedures. And without anesthesia services, general surgery becomes impossible. 
   Certified registered nurse anesthetists (CRNAs) tend to be the predominant anesthesia provider in rural and undeserved urban areas. In fact, CRNAs are the sole anesthesia provider in 65% of rural hospitals and in addition, provide at least 65% of the nation's anesthesia needs. The simple fact is that anesthesiologists have not been moving into rural areas in any significant numbers, and are not expected to do so in the foreseeable future. Given this trend, if rural hospitals are going to stay open, they desperately need CRNAs for their anesthesia and ultimately their surgical needs. That means we have to maintain a healthy supply of CRNAs to maintain access to care for rural Medicare beneficiaries. 
   Unfortunately, current Medicare rules with respect to supervision provide a disincentive for hospitals to use nurse anesthetists. Medicare's regulations require physician supervision of CRNAs as a condition for hospitals or ambulatory surgical centers to receive Medicare reimbursement, despite many state laws that allow nurse anesthetists to practice without such supervision. Although HCFA has issued a proposed rule that would drop this requirement and defer to states on the issue of supervision, this rule has never been finalized. 
   The federal supervision requirement creates several problems for CRNAs. First, some surgeons and hospitals have been dissuaded from working with  CRNAs, in the face of arguments that the physicians may be subjecting themselves to liability for engaging in supervision. But the truth is, the attending physician--or the hospital--is no more legally liable for the CRNAs actions than he or she is for the acts of an anesthesiologist. Second, the federal restriction is anti-competitive, acting as a disincentive for CRNAs to be used. Finally, the restriction creates an inaccurate perception among some surgeons that they have an obligation to direct or control the substantive course of the anesthetic process, even though there is no such obligation. 
   The legislation I am introducing today would eliminate the Federal supervision requirement and instead direct Medicare to defer to state law requirements on supervision. By eliminating this prescriptive federal regulation, we can better maximize the use of nurse anesthetists and eliminate the confusion surrounding CRNA supervision. At a time when the Congress is seeking ways to reduce costs for the Medicare program without sacrificing quality or access to care, increasing the use of nurse anesthetists seems particularly appropriate. 
   In terms of quality of care, there are no significant differences between anesthesia provided by CRNAs or that provided by anesthesiologists. Notwithstanding the claims of anesthesiologists, it is clear from a careful reading of the studies that there are no quantifiable differences in outcomes when CRNAs work with anesthesiologists, or when anesthesiologists provide anesthesia alone. CRNAs have been providing anesthesia services for more than a century. They have been the principal anesthesia providers in combat areas in every war the United States has been engaged in since World War I. CRNAs have received medals and accolades for their dedication, commitment and competence. And CRNAs perform the same anesthesia delivery function as anesthesiologists and work in every setting in which anesthesia is delivered: traditional hospital suites, obstetrical delivery rooms, dentist's offices, HMO's ambulatory surgical centers, Veterans Administration facilities and others. 
   Mr. President, the Federal Government is deferring to state judgment on a whole host of issues, so it seems completely consistent to let states decide how best to use nurse anesthetists, particularly in light of CRNA's long track record of success. States, which have the primary responsibility for regulating nurse practice, have generally not seen any need for a physician supervision requirement in non-Medicare settings. Twenty-nine states do not require supervision of CRNAs in nurse practice acts or board of nursing rules. This clearly indicates that many states, as a matter of public policy, do not believe it is necessary to require physician supervision of CRNAs. It is easy to understand why. Anesthesia is provided only when necessary to permit some medical procedure or intervention. Thus, as a practical matter even when supervision is not required as a matter of law, a surgeon, podiatrist, or dentist will be in the room when anesthesia is provided, and would be capable of handling any emergency that might arise. 
   Finally, I would note that when CRNAs were given direct Medicare reimbursement in 1986, there was no statutory requirement that CRNAs be supervised by physicians in order to receive reimbursement. This was not a requirement imposed by Congress then, nor has there been one since. Had Congress believed that such a requirement was appropriate, it would have been imposed as a condition of reimbursement at that time. Moreover, HCFA routinely defers to the states on scope of practice issues as its relates to other health care professionals. 
   This proposed change is supported by the American Hospital Association and the National Rural Health Association. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation and let the states make their own decisions about how to regulate a health care professional's scope of practice. Rural and undeserved urban areas need CRNAs and it's time the federal government removed impediments in regulations so that consumers' access to anesthesia care, particularly in rural areas, will not be jeopardized.

This country could have avoided an awful lot of the pain of the 1980s and 1990s if this country had listened to the Senator from South Carolina on budget matters. There has been no Member of this body who has had a better handle on the budget problems of this country than the Senator from South Carolina. Years ago, if we would have followed the Hollings plan and put in place a budget freeze, we could have avoided the massive deficits that came in the 1980s and the early 1990s, and this country would have been in a far better fiscal position. 
   He has been an activist and a leader on the Budget Committee of every effort to provide fiscal discipline to this country. I venture to say, in this Chamber there is no single Member who has made a greater contribution moving this country from massive deficits to now surpluses than the Senator from South Carolina. Senator HOLLINGS has been, I think, a model of what a United States Senator should be, in terms of budget discipline for this country. This country owes him a debt of thanks for the leadership he has provided.

   Mr. CONRAD. They had one, but they did not have a budget there. It is most amazing. As my colleague knows, a conference is the representatives of the Senate and the representatives of the House coming together to work out the differences between the two. We were there, the Members were there. 
   I think you would have been quite amazed, I say to the Senator from South Carolina, because there was no budget there, there was no document there. There was no discussion about the differences between the House and Senate. What we had was an immaculate conception. What we had was a document that appeared out of nowhere after we had met.

   Mr. CONRAD. To privatize it or raid it in some other way. We really do not know. I was very interested to listen to the Senator from Texas say--say--that they had reserved every penny of Social Security surplus for Social Security. That is what we said.

   Mr. CONRAD. Unfortunately, that is not what the budget document provides. It is very interesting; the Senator from South Carolina probably knows better than anybody how one can play games with these documents. It is fascinating what they have done here, because on one line, they suggest that they have provided a lockbox for Social Security. That is on one line on page 16 and it runs on to page 17. But then on the bottom of page 17, in the next section, they gut what they did earlier on the page. This is the oldest budget game in the book: ``Now you see it, now you don't.''

   Mr. CONRAD. I wish it were not the case but, unfortunately, it is. We had, I think, hoped--certainly the Senator from South Carolina and I--that we would be at a point where we really would reserve every penny of Social Security surplus for Social Security. We thought that is where we were headed. Unfortunately, what our friends across the aisle have done is indicate that that is what they are doing, but that is not what the budget document says. No, no, no, they have changed it all, and they have made it possible to continue the raid on the Social Security trust fund on a simple majority vote which, of course, their lockbox was intended to protect against. 
   Unfortunately, what they say they have done and what they have done are two very, very different things.

   Mr. CONRAD. Social Security is clearly in danger. Clearly, the priority on the other side is a tax cut, a massive tax cut at all costs. That is their priority. 
   Looking at this budget, the budget that is before us, the major problem with it is that it does not represent the priorities of the American people. I think the best way to understand this is we now have projected a surplus over the next 10 years of $2.6 trillion. Our friends on the other side say all of the non-Social Security surplus--virtually all of it--ought to go for a tax cut. Nothing, not a dime out of that surplus is for Medicare--not a dime--even though it is in greater danger than Social Security. They do not have the resources available for the high-priority domestic concerns of education, health care, defense, because if you look over time, they are going to have massive cuts in those categories. They are disguised, they are hidden, but they are there. 
   Mr. President, I think perhaps it would be useful to recount a little bit of the budget history, how we got to where we are today and where we are headed. 
   This chart shows over the last 30 years the budget history of the United States at the Federal Government level. We can see the 
   last time we had a surplus was back in 1969, a little bitty surplus of $3 billion. We bumped along. Then we got into the seventies and the deficits started rising. Then we got into the Reagan years and the deficits exploded. 
   We then had the Bush years and the deficits got even worse, so that on a unified basis--unified basis simply means all spending, all revenue put in one pot; that is a so-called unified budget--and on a unified basis in 1992, the last year of the Bush administration, we had a $290 billion deficit. 
   In 1993, President Clinton put before the Congress a 5-year plan to reduce the deficit. We passed that plan. It was done with all votes on this side of the aisle. Not a single Republican voted for that plan. Not one. That plan has reduced the deficit each and every year of the 5 years of the plan. In fact, now we are seeing a slight surplus. 
   What did that plan contain? It cut spending. It cut spending and it raised income taxes on the wealthiest 1 percent in this country. The Senator from Texas who was talking earlier opposed that plan. He said, as did many on that side of the aisle, that it would not work. In fact, they said it would increase the deficit. They said it would increase unemployment. They said it would increase inflation. They said it would be an economic disaster. They were wrong. They were not just a little bit wrong, they were completely wrong. 
   The fact is that plan worked and worked extremely well, and the proof is in the pudding. We can see what happened to the deficit after that plan passed in 1993. Each and every year the deficit came down. In this last year, we ran on a unified basis a $70 billion surplus, and we are headed for much larger surpluses if the projections come true. 
   On a unified basis, we ran a surplus last year. But remember, that counts all revenues and all expenditures. If we take out Social Security, because that is a separate trust fund, we will see we still ran a deficit last year of $29 billion--if we take out Social Security--because it was in surplus by about $100 billion. 
   The good news is, we are very close to balancing without counting Social Security this year, and in 2001, we anticipate we will balance without counting Social Security. That is an enormous, enormous development and enormous progress. 
   You can see back in 1992, if we were not counting Social Security, we had a $340 billion deficit. That is the kind of progress that has been made, and it has been made because, as I indicated, we had a 1993 5-year plan that cut spending, raised taxes on the wealthiest 1 percent, raised income taxes on the wealthiest 1 percent, and in 1997, we had a bipartisan deal. In that case, we came together and agreed on a budget plan to finish the job of balancing the budget. 
   This chart shows what the 1993 plan did and what the 1997 plan did. You can see most of the savings are the result of the 1993 package. Again, our friends on the other side of the aisle--all of them, to a person--voted against it. The bipartisan agreement was 1997, but most of the work has been done by the 1993 5-year plan and that, in combination with the 1997 plan, has put us in this very favorable circumstance we face now. 
   I thought just for the record we should look back on what the deficits were under each of the last three Presidents. 
   With President Reagan, from 1981 through 1988, we saw the deficits explode. 
   They went from $80 billion a year--that is the deficit he inherited--and very quickly he shot it up to $200 billion. Then we, at the end of his term, saw some improvement--back down to about $150 billion. 
   When President Bush came in, the deficits exploded again, and went from $150 billion, as I indicated, up to $290 billion a year by 1992. 
   Under President Clinton, as I indicated, in 1993 we passed a 5-year plan; and we can just look at the results. In 1993, the deficit was $255 billion. And you can see each and every year thereafter the deficit went down under that 5-year plan. We almost achieved unified balance under that 5-year plan. 
   So the proof is in the pudding. Our friends on the other side of the aisle talk about ``sham'' and ``hoaxes,'' and all the rest of it. The proof is in the pudding. My friends, Democrats passed a plan in 1993, without a single Republican vote. Democrats did the heavy lifting to get this country back on a fiscally responsible course. Facts are stubborn things. And the facts show, without question, that the Democrats passed a plan that, in fact, restored fiscal health to this country. 
   It is true in 1997 we did get together on a bipartisan basis to finish the job. I wish it could have been bipartisan in 1993. But our friends on the other side of the aisle said then that if you pass this plan, you are going to make the deficit worse. They said if you raise taxes, even if it is on just the wealthiest 1 percent, that is going to collapse the economy. 
   They were wrong. Their economic prescription for this country was wrong. And the facts clearly show that they were wrong. Thank goodness there were people who were willing to stand up and cast very tough votes to cut spending and, yes, to raise taxes on the wealthiest 1 percent so we could get this country back on course. It worked; and it worked splendidly. The results are dramatic. Not only have we reduced the red ink and eliminated it--no more running of deficits--but we also got remarkable economic results. 
   We now have an unemployment rate that is the lowest in 41 years. The other side said, when we passed the 5-year plan in 1993, if you pass it, unemployment is going to go up. Unemployment went down. Unemployment went way down, the lowest it has been in 41 years. 
   The other side said, the inflation rate, if you pass this plan, will go up. They were wrong. The inflation rate has gone down. We have the lowest rate of inflation in 33 years. 
   But the good news does not end there. 
   In addition, we passed welfare reform. In fairness and in truth, that was done on a bipartisan basis. We came together on welfare reform. And the result, coupled with the good economy that came from the 1993 budget plan, that coupled with welfare reform, has led us to the lowest percentage of our people on welfare in 29 years. Look at this dramatic improvement in terms of the percentage on welfare in this country. 
   As well, Federal spending has come down because, as I indicated, in 1993, part of that package was to cut the growth of spending in this country. And we did even more in the 1997 bipartisan plan. So the two together, the 1993 plan and the 1997 plan, have brought down Federal spending as a percentage of our national income to its lowest level since 1974. So now we are spending, as a percentage of our national income, the lowest level in 25 years of the Federal Government. 
   Because we have reduced deficits and gotten our fiscal house back in order, debt held by the public has also declined. We reached a debt, in relationship to our gross domestic product, of  50 percent in 1993. We saw, through the Reagan and Bush years, that the debt was climbing in relationship to the size of our gross domestic product. In 1993, when we passed that plan, we stopped the growth of the debt in relationship to the size of our income and reversed it. So now we have seen the debt come down to a level of 44 percent of our gross domestic product. And we anticipate, if we stay the course that we are currently on, we will get the debt down to only 9 percent of our gross domestic product in 2009. 
   The budget before us threatens that course. Because the colleagues on the other side of the aisle are so fixated on a massive tax-cut scheme, they would rather do that than to make this progress in reducing our national debt. I think that is precisely wrong. I think what we did in 1993 demonstrates that taking debt burden down gives a greater lift to this economy than any tax-cut scheme that anybody can come up with. That is not to say we should not have tax reduction, because we should. 
   The question is one of priorities and proportion. Our friends on the other side of the aisle say--we have $2.6 trillion of surpluses projected over the next 10 years--there are only two priorities. Their two priorities are to safeguard $1.8 trillion of that for so-called ``retirement security''--I don't know exactly what that means. That entire $1.8 trillion is generated by Social Security. It should be set aside for Social Security. That is the plan we Democrats offered in the Budget Committee. We offered to safeguard every penny of Social Security surplus for Social Security. That is $1.8 trillion. 
   In addition, we said we also ought to put about $400 billion aside for Medicare. The budget that is before us does not provide one penny of these projected surpluses for Medicare --not one penny. These are not the priorities of the American people. 
   Instead, our Republican colleagues say all the non-Social Security surplus, or virtually all of it--because you have about $800 billion of non-Social Security surplus over the next 10 years--they say, use virtually all of it for a tax-cut scheme. And the best description we have of what they do with it is a 10-percent, across-the-board tax cut. That is what the chairman of the Finance Committee has said he thinks should be done. That is what their leadership in the House have said they think should be done. 
   We have a different view of what the priorities for the American people are. For that $2.6 trillion, we say every penny that comes from the Social Security surplus ought to be reserved for Social Security. Interestingly enough, that is what was passed here in the Senate. But it went to the conference committee, and somewhere in the dead of night they backed away from that commitment; they backed away from that commitment and they came up with this very clever, very complicated little scheme. And this very complicated and very clever scheme says, on one page, yes, we are going to devote the Social Security surpluses to Social Security, but in the very next line they undermine it all--they undermine it all--they create a big loophole so that on a simple majority vote here the Social Security fund can be raided, can be looted, just like it has been done for the last 15 years. That is wrong. That is not the priority of the American people. 
   The American people want to preserve every penny of Social Security surplus for Social Security. That is what the Democrats offered in the Senate Budget Committee. In addition to that, we said the next $400 billion of surplus ought to be reserved to strengthen and protect Medicare. Our friends on the other side have not provided one penny of the projected surpluses to strengthen Medicare. 
   Instead, they say, let's have this massive tax cut scheme to benefit primarily the richest and wealthiest among us. 
   Now, the Senator from Texas says, you cannot love investment and not love the investor. That is true. I think we all respect those who invest. We respect those who save. We respect those who are successful. The question is, how do we use Government policy? Who do we benefit when we make decisions? Do we use governmental power to benefit the wealthiest among us? Is that what we do? 
   That is not what I favor. As I said, I believe the first priority ought to be every penny of Social Security surplus for Social Security; that is, $1.8 trillion of the $2.6 trillion we now estimate will be in surplus over the next 10 years. But the next $400 billion we say ought to be used to strengthen and protect Medicare. That leaves another $400 billion that would be available for high-priority domestic needs under our plan, like education, like health care, and, yes, defense and tax relief for the American people. 
   Our friends on the other side of the aisle have a different view. They say, yes, reserve the $1.8 trillion, but not just for Social Security, no, not just for Social Security. They call it ``retirement security.'' If they want to reserve every penny for Social Security, why don't they say Social Security? Why have they come up with this new term ``retirement security''? I think most of us know why they have done that--because the Senator from Texas has a scheme to privatize part of Social Security, and he wants the money reserved for his plan. He doesn't want to say reserve every penny of Social Security surplus for Social Security. Instead, he wants to make people believe he is going to do that, but then he provides a big loophole so that later on this year he can come along and raid the Social Security trust fund for his plan to create private accounts. That is what is really going on here. 
   None of us is fooled. They do not provide anything, not a penny of these projected surpluses, to strengthen and protect Medicare, when we know Medicare is in the most imminent danger of being insolvent. We say the priority ought to be Social Security and ought to be Medicare and, after that, we also ought to have some money for high-priority domestic needs like education and health care, and, yes, tax relief. But it is a matter of priority, and our friends on the other side of the aisle say the priority ought to be a massive tax cut. 
   This is the comparison for what happens. Let me focus on the 10 years. The blue column represents what the Republicans would do to pay down debt, and the red column shows what we offered as Democrats in the Budget Committee to pay down debt. A lot of people might be as surprised by this, because the Democratic plan paid down more debt than the Republican plan. We paid down more debt over the next 10 years, by nearly $400 billion over and above what is in the Republican plan, because we believe that is a key priority for the country. 
   Again, our Republican friends think there is a different priority. They want to have this massive tax cut scheme. That is really what is most on their mind. Unfortunately, because of this, they do not have, as I have indicated before, one penny of the surpluses set aside to strengthen Medicare, not a dime. They have what I call ``the Republican broken safe.'' Here it is. You look in it and what do you find? There is nothing there. 
   Now, with what they have done in the conference committee, we ought to have this up for Social Security, too, because, 
   goodness knows, we could find, after the clever game they have played here in this budget document, that we may go into the Social Security trust fund in the future and open the vault door and find there is nothing there, either. Because they have this set up so that they can raid every penny of the Social Security trust fund surplus and put it over into private accounts. They could do that. They could use it for a tax cut and call it retirement security. Who knows what that means, ``retirement security''? If they wanted to reserve the money for Social Security, why didn't they say it? 
   Well, I guess if we wanted to be fair to them, they do say it, don't they? On one line they say they are going to reserve the money for Social Security, but they say, by a simple majority vote, you can overturn that. Before it was a supermajority vote. Now in the dead of night they changed it, simple majority vote, and now you can loot Social Security. You can raid it, because in the very next line, section 202, they created another reserve fund. It is clever. 
   I don't think it is going to work for them, because the American people are too smart. They know the kind of games that get played here in Washington. 
   This is one of the most cynical games I have seen yet. In the Budget Committee, when we vote and the people  are there watching and the reporters are there watching, we vote to protect every penny of Social Security surplus for Social Security. That is the vote when everybody raised their hands in the Budget Committee. Maybe that is the reason, when we held the conference committee meeting between the House and the Senate, the Members were there, but there was no budget there. How can you have a meeting about a budget and not have the budget there? It was very interesting. There were no TV cameras there. We were there, the Members representing the House and the Senate, but there was no budget document there. 
   I think I now know why there was no budget document there--because they did not want this little trick revealed. They did not want this little loophole found out. They were hoping they had buried this so deep in the document that nobody would find it in time for this discussion and this debate and this vote. But we are going to vote, and we are going to see who is ready to protect Social Security and who has a mind to raid it later this year. We are going to see, by Members' votes, who is committed to protecting Social Security and who is committed to protecting Medicare and who isn't. We are going to see whose priority is a massive tax cut scheme for the wealthiest among us, because that is really what is afoot here. That is really what is afoot. 
   What happens if you give a 10-percent across-the-board tax cut? For those in this country who earn less than $38,000 a year, they are going to get $99. That is going to be their tax cut. But for folks who are earning over $300,000, they are going to get $20,000 of a tax cut. The Senator from Texas thinks this is a fair deal. I don't think this is a fair deal. I don't think this represents the priorities of the American people. 
   The other side is saying the priorities of the American people are to have a massive tax cut that would give a $20,000 check to those earning over $300,000 a year in this country, send $99 to those who have an income of less than $38,000, and not have one penny of the surplus available to strengthen Medicare, and to leave vulnerable the Social Security trust fund that everybody says ought to be inviolable, ought not be touched, that every penny ought to be set aside to redeem the promise made by Social Security. 
   That is what I thought we were going to do. That is what the Democrats offered in the Senate Budget Committee. We offered a plan that said of the $2.6 trillion of surpluses, take the $1.8 trillion that comes from Social Security and dedicate every penny to Social Security. 
   Take the next $400 billion and use it to strengthen Medicare. Take the final $400 billion and use it, yes, for tax relief, but also for high-priority domestic needs such as education and health care and, yes, defense. Those are America's priorities. 
   But that is not what is in this budget resolution. These are not America's priorities. These are the priorities of, frankly, those who are getting ready to get a $20,000 tax break, and they are salivating. Of course, for the very wealthy, it is much more than this. For those who have had good fortune in this country--and we are grateful for that; it is one of the great things about America, that people have had enormous advantages. The priority of this country isn't to make those who have had great success even more comfortable; the priority of the American people is to strengthen Social Security, strengthen and protect Medicare, provide for high-priority domestic needs such as education and health care and, yes, defense, and also to provide tax relief. My Republican friends have just focused on a tax cut scheme. That is what is wrong with this budget at the most fundamental level. 
   I see that my colleague from the State of Washington is here. How much time would she like?

   Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I thank my colleague, Senator DORGAN, for offering this motion, and for bringing to the attention of our colleagues in the Senate the disastrous circumstances we face in American agriculture. 
   I represent North Dakota. I can tell you that in agriculture in our State we are on the brink of a depression. We are the victims of a triple whammy of bad prices, bad weather, and bad policy. Bad prices are the lowest prices for farm commodities in 52 years. The bad policy is the last farm bill that was passed, and some of our trade policy that has left America vulnerable to a very intense effort by our competitors. Mr. President, our chief competitors--the Europeans--are spending 10 times as much to support their farmers as we are spending to support ours. We are, in essence, saying to our farmers, you go out and compete against the French farmer and the German farmer, and, while you are at it, take on the French Government and the German Government as well. That is not a fair fight. 
   In addition to the bad prices and the bad policy, we are also stuck with bad weather. We have had 5 years of overly wet conditions in North Dakota. The result has been the development of a disease called scab. That is a fungus. It has dramatically reduced production. There are parts of North Dakota that saw their production reduced 40 percent. 
   So you put all of this together, what do you have? You have an economic calamity, a disaster of its own, with the lowest prices in 52 years and production reduced because of bad weather, and because of an outbreak of disease that is unprecedented in this century, and couple that with the bad policy of a bad farm bill that has been put in place that makes no note of what happens to farm prices but that cuts each and every year the support that is given to American agricultural producers at the exact time our competitors are dramatically increasing what they are doing for their producers. 
   Mr. President, Members of the Senate, this is an emergency. It is a disaster. It is stunning in its proportion. I just completed a series of meetings across the State of North Dakota. Everywhere I went, producers took me aside and said unless something is done and done quickly, we are faced with a calamity of losing tens of thousands of family farmers across the heartland of America. 
   I hope very much that our colleagues will support this motion that instructs the conferees to provide additional funding for agricultural policy reform. It is critically needed. It must be done. The consequences could not be more serious. A failure to act will lead to the unraveling of the farm safety net in this country and will mean we will lose literally tens of thousands of farm families this year. We are not talking about sometime in the distant future. We are talking about right now. We are talking about an economic calamity. 
   Again, I hope my colleagues will support this motion. I yield the floor.

   Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Dickinson Dam Bascule Gates Settlement Act of 1999 and I am pleased that my colleague from North Dakota, Senator DORGAN, is an original cosponsor of the bill. This legislation would permit the Secretary of the Interior to accept a one-time, lump-sum payment for the city of Dickinson, ND, in lieu of the annual payments required under the city's existing repayment contract for construction of the ``bascule gates'' on the Dickinson Dam on the Heart River. This bill would resolve a long-standing issue for the city of Dickinson and the Bureau of Reclamation. The Dickinson Dam Bascule Gates Settlement Act is nearly identical to a bill I introduced last June, and it is my hope that the Senate will quickly consider and pass this important piece of legislation. 
   Mr. President, the history of the bascule gates is long and complex. The Bureau of Reclamation constructed the Dickinson Dam on the Heart River in 1949 and 1950 to supply water to the city of Dickinson, and for flood control, recreation, and other purposes. The reservoir created by this dam was named Patterson Lake in about 1960. 
   The need for additional water supply for the city was identified in the early 1970's, and the bascule gates were constructed in the early 1980's, to provide additional water storage capacity in Lake Patterson. At the time, the city expressed reservations over the cost of the bascule gates and the viability of the gates, since the city was not aware of any other location in a northern climate in which the gates had been tested or proven. In 1982, shortly after the gates were operational, a large ice block caused excessive pressure on the hydraulic system, causing it to fail. Construction modifications were made to the gate hydraulic system and a de-icing system were added in 1982, adding further costs to the project. 
   In 1991, the city began to receive its municipal water supply from the Southwest Pipeline Project, a project constructed in part with funds provided for North Dakota's statewide water project, the Garrison Diversion project, which is another Bureau of Reclamation project. The Southwest Pipeline brings high-quality water from Lake Sakakawea on the Missouri River to the city of Dickinson and other communities in southwest North Dakota. The water is of much higher quality that the water from the city's previous supply from Lake Patterson, and has helped spur economic development in the region. While the citizens of the area now benefit from a higher quality water supply, the city no longer benefits from the additional water supply provided by the bascule gates. The result is the city is paying for two Bureau of Reclamation projects, while it is using water from only one of those projects for its municipal water supply. The city has repaid more than $1.2 million to the United States for the bascule gates, despite the fact that the gates now provide almost no direct benefit to the city. 
   The city has previously investigated alternatives to the current situation. The city has discussed the option of assuming title to the dam and bascule gates, as well as attempting to negotiate a new agreement with the Bureau of Reclamation administratively. However, because 
   the terms of the existing contract are outlined statutorily, new legislation is required to make any changes to the current repayment contract. 
   The legislation I am introducing today would do three primary things. First, it would permit the Interior Secretary to accept a lump-sum payment of $300,000 from the city and terminate the remaining annual payments required under the existing repayment contract. This is an increase from last year's legislation, which called for a $150,000 final settlement. Enacting this legislation would end the issue of paying for the construction of these gates for both the city and the Federal government. 
   Second, my bill would require the Secretary to reallocate the costs of operation and maintenance for the bascule gates and the Dickinson Dam. The bill does not prescribe any particular reallocation formula, but does require the Secretary to consider the fact that the current benefits of the dam and bascule gates are primarily for flood control, recreation, and fish and wildlife purposes. In my view, operation and maintenance costs should be borne by those who benefit from a particular project. 
   Finally, my bill would permit the Secretary to enter any appropriate water service contracts in the future if the city or any other entity uses water from Patterson Lake for municipal water supply or for other purposes. It is only fair that if the city benefits in the future from the water stored behind the bascule gates that we preserve an option for recovering additional costs from those beneficiaries. 
   Mr. President, this legislation represents a win-win situation for the residents of the Dickinson area and for the Federal Government. I hope this Congress will carefully study this issue and quickly pass this important legislation.

   Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, today, I am pleased to be joined by Senator DASCHLE, Senator WELLSTONE, Senator INOUYE, Senator HARKIN, and Senator MURKOWSKI to introduce legislation to help improve health care delivery in rural and underserved communities throughout America through the use of telecommunications and telehealth technology. 
   Telehealth encompasses a wide variety of technologies, ranging from the telephone to high-tech equipment that enables a surgeon to perform surgery from thousands of miles away. It includes interactive video equipment, fax machines and computers along with satellites and fiber optics. These technologies can be used to diagnose patients, deliver care, transfer health data, read X-rays, provide consultation and educate health professionals. Telehealth also includes the electronic storage and transmission of personally identifiable health information, such as medical records, test results, and insurance claims. 
   The promise of telehealth is becoming increasingly apparent. Throughout the country, providers are experimenting with a variety of telehealth approaches in an effort to improve access to quality medical and other health-related services. Those programs are demonstrating that telecommunications technology can alleviate the constraints of time and distance, as well as the cost and inconvenience of transporting patients to medical providers. Many approaches show promising results in reducing health care costs and bringing adequate care to all Americans. For the first time, technological advances and the development of a national information infrastructure give telehealth the potential to overcome barriers to health care services for rural Americans and afford them the access that most Americans take for granted. But it is clear that our nation must do more to integrate telehealth into our overall health care delivery infrastructure. 
   Because so many rural and underserved communities lack the ability to attract and support a wide variety of health care professionals and services, it is important to find a way to bring the most important medical services into those communities. Telehealth provides an important part of the answer. It helps bring services to remote areas in a quick, cost-effective manner, and can enable patients to avoid traveling long distances in order to receive health care treatment. 
   We have made progress. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 includes a provision that provides for some Medicare reimbursement of telehealth services. Unfortunately, however, the Health Care Financing Administration interpreted the legislative language too narrowly and severely limited the services that are covered. This bill clarifies the intent of Congress regarding Medicare reimbursement and thereby increases access to these services in underserved areas. 
   The first element of my proposal clarifies and expands Medicare reimbursement for telehealth. Medicare reimbursement policy is an essential component of helping to integrate telehealth into the health care infrastructure and is particularly important in rural areas, where many hospitals do as much as 80% of their business with Medicare patients. Because the Secretary defined reimbursable services so narrowly in the BBA, this legislation clarifies that all services that are covered under Medicare Part B if you drive to a doctor's office, are covered via telehealth. In particular, it clarifies that the technology called ``store and forward'', which is a cost-effective method of transferring information, is included in this reimbursement policy. Finally, this bill expands coverage from health professional shortage areas, as enacted in 1997, to cover all rural areas. 
   The second element of this proposal asks the Secretary of Health and Human Services to submit a report to the Congress on the status of efforts to  ease licensing burdens on practitioners who cross state lines in the course of supplying telehealth services. Currently, consultation by almost any licensed health professional in this situation requires that the practitioner be licensed in both states. 
   In talking with telehealth providers in my state, and with experts on the Ad Hoc Committee, I have been told repeatedly that this is one of the most significant barriers to developing broad, 
   integrated telehealth systems. More importantly, they tell me states have actively been using licensure to close their borders to innovative telehealth practice. Many states have taken legislative action to ensure that out-of-state practitioners must be fully licensed in their state in order to provide telehealth services, even if they are fully licensed in their own state. During a discussion with a telehealth practitioner from my home state of North Dakota, I was told about a group of telehealth specialists who, among their small group practice, were licensed in more than thirty different states. That means they pay thirty different fees, are responsible for thirty different continuing education requirements, and are overseen by thirty different regulatory bodies. This is a costly and burdensome procedure for many practitioners, but the burden falls particularly heavily on rural practitioners, who face long travel times to acquire continuing education, and who frequently run on lower profit margins than urban practitioners. 
   While I am not prepared at this time to propose that the federal government get involved with professional licensure, I have asked the Secretary to study the issue and report to Congress yearly on the status of efforts by states and other interested organizations to address this issue. This will allow us to reach out to the states and work together to find solutions to cross-state licensure concerns. As part of this report, I have asked to the Secretary to make recommendations to Congress, if appropriate, about possible federal action to lower the licensure barrier. 
   A third element of my proposal involves coordination of the Federal telehealth effort. The Department of Health and Human Services has created an informal interagency task force that is examining our federal agency telehealth efforts. This group reported on Federal activities related to telehealth and provided a thorough examination of many of the important issues in telehealth. 
   My bill attempts to use that task force to inventory Federal activity on telehealth and related technology, determine what applications have been found successful, and recommend an overall Federal policy approach to telehealth. Many departments and agencies of the Federal government are engaged in telehealth activity, including the Veterans Administration, Department of Defense, Department of Agriculture, Office for the Advancement of Telehealth, and many others. The more these agencies work together to coordinate the Federal effort and consolidate Federal resources, the more effective the Federal government will be in contributing to telehealth in a positive way. I believe this is especially important in light of the GAO report calling for an expanded role for this group and more coordination of telehealth issues across the Federal agencies. The efforts of this group, along with the ongoing activities of the Congressional Ad Hoc Steering Committee, will provide a renewed focus for telehealth across the Federal government. Such coordination will also help protect the American taxpayer from unnecessary duplication of effort. 
   The fourth part of my proposal helps communities build home-grown telehealth networks. It attempts both to build a telehealth infrastructure and foster rural economic development and incorporates many of the most important lessons learned from other grant projects and studies on telehealth from across the Federal government. 
   Clearly, the scarcity of resources in many rural communities requires that the coordination and use of those resources be maximized. My bill encourages cooperation by various local entities in an effort to help build sustainable telehealth programs in rural communities. It plants seed money to encourage health care providers to join with other segments of the community to jointly use telecommunications resources. Using a unique loan forgiveness program, it rewards telehealth systems that supply appropriate, high-quality care while reducing overall health care costs. 
   Most importantly, it does not create a system where various technological approaches are imposed upon communities. Rather it enables potential grantees to determine user-friendly approaches that work best for them. This home-grown approach to developing user-friendly telehealth systems, as well as the preference for coordinating resources within communities, will help ensure the long-term viability of such programs after the grant expires. 
   Mr. President, my proposal continues our national efforts to integrate telecommunications technology into the rapidly evolving health care delivery system. I am very encouraged by the positive feedback I have received from telehealth networks across the country. I have continued to work with telehealth networks and representatives to strengthen this proposal. As a result, I have made several changes in the bill that I believe will make this a stronger proposal. But, as with any complex issue, I understand that some may prefer different approaches. I would like to continue to encourage all interested parties to come forward with creative solutions to these important issues. It is my hope that telehealth legislation can be included in the comprehensive rural health care legislation in this Congress so we can continue to improve access to needed health care services for rural and underserved populations.

   Mr. CONRAD. As a member of the Budget Committee and a member of the Finance Committee and somebody who was worked and voted for Medicare reform in the Finance Committee as part of a group cochaired by Senator BREAUX along with Senator CHAFEE, I believe we must have reform of the Medicare program. There is no question about that. I applaud the efforts of Senator BREAUX. Nobody has worked harder over a longer period of time to try to get the job done. 
   As a part of the centrist coalition, I voted in the Finance Committee for a series of difficult steps to begin the process of reforming the Medicare program. 
   I think my record on the question of being willing to cast tough votes to reform Medicare is beyond question. But I must say, as I look at this amendment that has been offered by the distinguished chairman of the Finance Committee, I have real doubts about this. It looks to me to be a political statement as much as it is an interest in reforming Medicare. When I see in the resolution the suggestion that the President's budget framework does not devote 15 percent of the budget surplus to the Medicare program, I do not think that is a true statement. I have read the President's framework, and it says very clearly that of the surpluses over the next 15 years, 15 percent is dedicated to Medicare. He does it by making a transfer to the trust fund. 
   People get up and quote the Comptroller General all of the time around here, only they leave out something very important that he said. The Comptroller said in his statement before the Finance Committee that the President's proposal ``provides a grant of a new set of Treasury securities for the Medicare Hospital Insurance Program which would extend the life of the trust fund from 2008 to 2020.'' 
   That is the testimony of the Comptroller General before the Senate Finance Committee. Others have stood in the Chamber and said that he denigrated the proposal. Well, he certainly did raise questions about it in certain ways, but he also made the very clear statement that the President's proposal does extend the solvency of the Medicare trust fund from 2008 to 2020. 
   Those who stand in this Chamber and tell our colleagues and the American people that the President's proposal does not do anything are not telling the truth. To just be selective in 
   their quotations of the Comptroller General does a disservice to this body and a disservice to anybody else who is listening. 
   Let's be direct and honest. The President's proposal is to reserve 15 percent of the surpluses over the next 15 years for Medicare. That is a break in policy, without question. It is a change. We should debate the wisdom of that change. But to stand up here and say it makes no difference, that is not factual and it is not honest as far as I am concerned.

   Mr. CONRAD. I would like to complete the thought and then I will be happy to yield. 
   As I read this resolution, it is suggesting that it makes no sense to make any transfer from the general fund to the HI trust fund. I do not agree with that. I think that is flat wrong. You can question the policy. You can say, gee, we should not be doing that, but to suggest that in this resolution, to  adopt in this resolution that we are just going to be opposed to a transfer I think is a mistake. That has the cart before the horse. 
   As I go through this resolution, there are other things that trouble me. I, for one, value the work of the Medicare Commission. I value the work of Senator BREAUX, Mr. THOMAS, and the others who served there, but as I read this resolution it is suggesting that what they came up with in terms of a proposal is what we ought to adopt. I am not prepared to say that because they also proposed a dramatic change in policy. They proposed, instead of what we know now as the Medicare program, a system of vouchers. People would be able to go out in the marketplace and buy insurance, and they would get from the Federal Government, instead of the coverage provided by Medicare, a voucher for a certain amount of money to go out and purchase insurance. 
   That may be an excellent idea. I do not know. I think we are a long way from making a determination that that is the right course. We have not completed a hearing process in the Finance Committee on that question. As I read this resolution, it is fundamentally endorsing that approach. 
   Also included in the recommendation of the Commission is an increase in the age of eligibility. That may be necessary, but I do not think we ought to conclude that in the Chamber here today. 
   So, Madam President, I respect those who bring the amendment before us but I, for one, would not vote for it. I do not think saying, in effect, that we should not make a transfer from the general fund to strengthen Medicare is something we ought to be saying. In fact, I offered an amendment last night that said just the opposite, that we ought to, as part of a reform proposal, put more resources into the Medicare plan. I think it needs more resources. 
   I also believe it has to be reformed. I think we need both. I am certainly not going to vote for an amendment that suggests that what the President has proposed is wrong. I also think, as I indicated, that some of the statements here are just factually incorrect. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. CONRAD. The Senator from Massachusetts makes an interesting point. We have to be very careful in our use of language around here. When people talk about Government instruments as being IOUs, I suppose in a way that is true. But it probably leaves people with a misimpression. These are Government bonds, U.S. Government bonds. There is no more valued instrument in the world than a U.S. Government bond. I would love to have somebody give me Government bonds worth $700 billion. The suggestion that that has no value is an absurdity. It is an absurdity. They are backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. Government. There has never, ever been a default on an obligation of the U.S. Government. So this kind of careless use of language I think misleads people. 
   Of course they have value. They have exactly the value that is on their face. These are bonds that have $700 billion worth of value, plus they earn interest. The fact is, this suggestion that it doesn't make any difference if you transfer these instruments, these bonds, to the trust fund is just wrong. They extend the solvency of the Medicare trust fund by 12 years. 
   Is that the only thing we should do? Certainly not. Senator BREAUX is exactly right. That is not the only thing we should do. Maybe it is not even the first thing we should do. But we have to decide on a budget resolution right now. We do not have the luxury of waiting until the reform plan is passed. We have to make a decision how resources are going to be used around here. What we are suggesting is the resources ought to be used in a certain priority order. 
   The first priority is using every penny of the Social Security surplus for Social Security. Then we are saying, in the non-Social Security surplus, the next priority ought to be to strengthen Medicare. We think that is a priority of the American people. Yes, there ought to be reform as well, and then we ought to also have some resources that are available for high-priority domestic needs like education and defense--and, yes, tax relief. But the first priority of the non-Social Security surplus is not tax relief, especially tax cuts that are designed to go to the wealthiest among us. 
   We had, yesterday, a discussion of what some on the other side want in terms of an across-the-board cut. To those who are earning $800,000 a year, they would give $20,000. To those earning less than $38,000 a year on average, they would give $99. I think it is a higher priority for the American people to strengthen Social Security and extend its solvency than to go out and give back $20,000 to somebody who is making almost $1 million a year. That is a question of priorities. It is the difference between us. The Senator from Massachusetts is right on this question.

   Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I hope people think very carefully about this amendment as drafted. Because it seems to me, if they vote for it, they are saying they do not want to do anything to extend the solvency of the Medicare trust fund. They are adopting, it seems to me, a view that, at least with respect to the surpluses that are projected over the next 15 years, they do not want to dedicate any of that money to extend the Medicare trust fund solvency, and the fact is the Medicare trust fund is in more immediate danger than is the Social Security trust fund. 
   We expect insolvency in the Medicare trust fund by 2008. That is why some of us feel strongly that we ought to keep alive the possibility of transferring some of these surpluses that we now project to strengthen and preserve the Medicare system. 
   Beyond that, I think we have to ask the question, are we ready to say that the solution we want to adopt is what the National Commission on the Future of Medicare adopted? They couldn't reach agreement in terms of the supermajority that was required of them to make a recommendation. It seems to me we ought to keep our powder dry until we consider all of the options that we might want to adopt to reform Medicare. 
   Again, I say this with the greatest of respect for Senator BREAUX and Senator KERREY and other Members who served on that Commission, along with Mr. THOMAS and others. I have real concerns about what is included in this amendment. Part of it, I think, is just factually wrong. The suggestion that the President is not reserving 15 percent in his framework for Medicare defies the facts. It defies what is clearly in his plan. I do not think it is wise to adopt something that makes false statements.

   But I must tell you, I do not read this as a bipartisan amendment. There may be some Democrats who are on it--and I can understand why they are on it--but I tell you, this does not look, to me, like a real bipartisan message that is being sent with this amendment. It looks, to me, like a lot of bash-the-President's proposal and suggestions that what is at the heart of the President's proposal, to transfer some resources from the general fund to strengthen Medicare, has no merit and that the answer is what the bipartisan reform Commission came up with--which did not achieve the necessary agreement of that Commission to make a recommendation. 
   Frankly, I do not think this body should be in a position now to decide that is the answer. I do not think a plan to----

The first speech by any member is one of the most important, and I think the Senator from New York chose well when he chose this subject. Obviously, it is a matter of urgent concern in New York, and the Senator has spoken movingly and persuasively about what must be done to respond to the crisis there. I want to thank the Senator from New York for bringing this to the attention of his colleagues and for doing a masterful job of informing us of what is facing the people of New York. 
   I again thank and commend the Senator on his initial speech here in the Chamber. In my 12 years in the Senate, I believe the Senator from New York is one of the most impressive new members and we are very happy to have him here.

   Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Massachusetts for this amendment, because I think it puts into stark relief what the choices are. Fundamentally, this debate is about what we do with the projected surpluses over the next 15 years. On our side, we believe that the best use of the surpluses is, first and foremost, to protect every dollar of Social Security surplus for Social Security. 
   Then we turn our attention to Medicare, because we believe Medicare is also critically important to this country's future, and we recognize that it is endangered. We recognize that in 2008 it will be insolvent unless we take action. So we say take, of the surplus over the next 15 years, 15 percent of that surplus --15 percent of that total unified surplus--over the next 15 years. Dedicate that to Medicare. That is some $700 billion. 
   That still leaves resources for high-priority domestic needs like education  and health care, defense, and, yes, tax relief. It is much less in the way of resources available for a tax cut plan than in the Republican priority list, because they really only have two priorities. Their priorities are safeguarding Social Security, which we commend them for; but their other priority is a massive tax cut. They don't provide an additional dollar out of the 
   surpluses that we now project over the next 15 years to strengthen Medicare. We think that is a mistake. 
   We have heard the other side repeatedly saying that putting this transfer of resources to Medicare will require raising taxes, benefit cuts, or increasing gross debt to pay for Medicare in the future. We have heard that said repeatedly on that side of the aisle. I would like to give an alternative view, because I don't think that is right. It sounds right. If one were expecting budget deficits in the future, it would be right. But that is not what we are anticipating. 
   The fact is, we now project that there will be a surplus for more than a decade even after we dedicate part of the surplus to Medicare and Social Security. That is because by paying down the publicly held debt, the President's plan reduces net interest costs to the Federal Government and increases economic growth. Therefore, even after we start using the surplus to pay for Medicare and for Social Security, there will still be a budget surplus, hence no need for benefit cuts or for premium increases. 
   Mr. President, that is central to what we are proposing and what we are advocating. We believe it is critically important to put Social Security first, but also to put Medicare first, because it has made a profound difference in the life of this Nation. We now know that without Medicare and Social Security, a significant chunk of our senior population would be below the poverty level. Two programs in the life of this country have lifted senior citizens out of poverty: Social Security and Medicare. 
   So we believe that is where the priority ought to be: Social Security, and Medicare. After they are taken care of--after they are taken care of; after they are taken care of--then we can deal with other domestic priorities, certainly education and health care. And, yes, defense. And, yes, there would still be resources available for tax relief--not as much as the tax cut plan in the Republican budget resolution, because they don't provide one thin dime out of these projected surpluses to strengthen Medicare. They provide resources for Social Security surpluses to support Social Security. That is in our plan as well. Where we diverge is on the question of whether or not we are going to use some of these surpluses we now project to strengthen Medicare. That is really at the heart of this debate and this discussion.

   Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, very briefly, let me just say I hope our colleagues will support the amendment which my colleague from Wyoming has offered, along with a number of others of us who are very concerned about what has happened in the livestock industry. 
   In American agriculture now, we face the lowest prices in 52 years. We have been through an absolute price collapse in many sectors of the livestock industry. In the hog industry alone, prices have dropped to 8.5 cents a pound. 
   Mr. President, it takes 40 cents a pound to break even in the livestock industry. And 8.5 cents a pound is absolutely ridiculous. We anticipate losing as many as three-quarters of the hog producers in our State if something is not done. 
   This amendment, offered by Senator ENZI, cosponsored by others of us, we think is one way to help livestock producers manage risk through a program of risk management. I hope very much our colleagues will support it.

   Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I thank Senator DORGAN and I thank our colleagues. This is a matter of sheer survival. I want to say to my colleagues, we are on the brink of a depression in farm country in this Nation. If you come to North Dakota today and go with me to community farms, what you find people want to talk about is the collapse of farm income because it is threatening the survival of literally tens of thousands of family farmers just in our State of North Dakota. In fact, this year, unless something happens and happens quickly, we anticipate we will lose one-third of all the farmers in the State. 
   The reason that is occurring is really very simple. This chart shows what happened from 1996 to 1997, as farm income was washed away: In 1 year, a 98 percent reduction in farm income in our State. The reason we have seen this collapsing income is really three factors: Bad prices, bad weather, and bad policy. 
   The bad prices are stunning. This shows what has happened to farm prices over a 52-year period. We now have the lowest prices for our major commodities in 52 years. We have wheat selling for $2.60 a bushel. Mr. President, $2.60 a bushel. That is 5 cents a pound. There is no way anybody can make it at those prices. The cost of production is about double that. So what we have is a hemorrhaging, a loss of income, and farmers' livelihoods being threatened. That is what we are faced with. 
   When I talk about bad policy, when we passed the last farm bill--which is, frankly, a disaster itself--the support for farmers was cut in half. Under the previous legislation we averaged $10 billion a year. Under the new legislation, $5 billion a year. This makes it virtually impossible to write any kind of decent farm legislation. The current farm legislation cuts support for farmers each and every year and cuts it sharply, without regard to what happens to prices. In previous legislation we used to make an adjustment. When prices fell there was more assistance. 
   But look what our major competitors are doing. It is very interesting, because if we look at what they are doing we see that they are spending almost 10 times as much as we are to support their producers. In Europe, they are spending nearly $50 billion a year to support their farmers. We are spending $5 billion. This is not a fair fight. This is unilateral disarmament in a trade confrontation. We would never do it in a military confrontation. Why ever are we doing it in a trade confrontation? This says to our farmers: You go out there and compete against the French farmer and the German farmer. And, oh, while you are at it, you take on the French Government and the German Government as well. That is not a fair fight. You have to say to our farmers it is pretty amazing you are able to survive in a circumstance like this one, when our major competitors are spending 10 times as much to support them. 
   When we look at what they are doing for support of exports, it is even more dramatic. Instead of a factor of 10 to 1, they are outspending us by a factor of more than 100 to 1. In fact, it is about 130-to-1 to support their farm exports versus what we are doing. Then some say just leave it to the market. That is not what our competitors are doing. If that is what we do, we are going to  consign our farmers to a life of economic hardship and economic collapse. That is what is happening in farm country today. That is why it is absolutely critical that an amendment like this one pass to help farmers through this period of collapsed commodity values. If we do not do it, we 
   will see literally thousands of farm families forced off the land. The stakes are high. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.

   Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, the amendment that I am offering says simply, let us lock up in a safe-deposit box every penny of Social Security surplus and, in addition to that, 40 percent of the non-Social Security surplus for Medicare. 
   Mr. President, that is what this depicts: Social Security's and Medicare's first lockbox. Let's save the Social Security surplus over the next 10 years. That is $1.8 trillion. And we save every penny of the Social Security surplus each and every year. 
   In addition, we say let's also save 40 percent of the non-Social Security surplus for Medicare. These are the two top priorities of the American people. We say let's reserve funds for both of them. Let's make certain that there are sufficient resources to do the reforms that are necessary to strengthen and preserve both Social Security and Medicare. 
   As I have looked at the lockbox offered by our friends across the aisle, it seems to me that there is a deficiency. I call this ``the broken safe,'' because, while I commend our friends on the other side of the aisle for locking up the Social Security surplus, they forgot something. They forgot Medicare. 
   I am simply saying we ought to not only reserve the Social Security surplus for Social Security, but we ought to also provide for Medicare. Medicare is on the brink of insolvency. In fact, it is closer to going under than Social Security. So let's take the top priorities of the American people and put them at the top of the list for the Congress as well. 
   Let me make clear that under this plan we would have $1.8 trillion over the next 10 years for Social Security. We would have over $370 billion for Medicare. But those aren't the only priorities. And we understand there would also be money left over--some $385 billion over the 10 years--for top domestic priorities, including education, defense, and health care and, yes, tax relief for hard-pressed American families, but the difference is one of priorities.  
   If I could go to this next chart and show the comparison, under the plan that we are offering we are saving Social Security and Medicare first because we think those are the priorities of the American people. We save 100 percent of the Social Security surplus in every year. We save 40 percent of the non-Social Security surplus for Medicare. Overall, we are saving 77 percent of the unified surplus in comparison to 62 percent in the Republican plan. That means we are paying down more of the publicly held debt than the plan offered by our friends across the aisle. In fact, we will pay down $300 billion more of the publicly held debt under the plan that I am offering in this amendment than the plan of our colleagues on the other side of the aisle. 
   So, over 15 years, we reserve $700 billion for Medicare, over $370 billion for 10 years, but over 15 years over $700 billion for Medicare. Our friends on the other side, on the other hand, have tax cuts of over $700 billion over that same period. But they have not one dime of the surplus saved for Medicare. 
   Mr. President, we think that is a mistake. 
   If we look at the combination and compare the two plans, here is what we see. The Republican plan is in blue. The plan I am offering is in red. In the years 2000 to 2004, the Republican plan would save $768 billion. We would save $833 
   billion for Social Security and Medicare. And over a 10-year period, the Republican plan would save about $1.8 trillion. We would save $2.155 trillion, because not only again are we protecting every dollar of the Social Security surplus for Social Security, but in addition we are reserving funds out of the surplus for Medicare. Why? Because no part of the Federal budget is in greater danger than Medicare. And, yes, we need to reform the program. 
   In addition to that, we need to put additional resources into Medicare to extend its solvency. Right now we know that Medicare is threatened by the year 2008. What is going to happen? What is going to happen to the millions of Americans who rely for their health care on the Medicare system? Not only is it important to our grandparents, it is important to their children, because what happens if the health care of their parents are not provided for? What happens if the promise is not kept? I think we all understand what happens. The responsibility and the debts shift, and the children will be put in an impossible position as well. 
   I believe this amendment reflects the priorities of the American people. The Republican plan basically says save money for Social Security. I commend them for that part of the plan. But almost all of the rest of the money they say is reserved for a tax cut will go disproportionately to the wealthiest among us. 
   We say those are not the priorities of the American people. Instead, we ought to save every dollar of the Social Security surplus. But we also ought to reserve 40 percent of the non-Social Security surplus for Medicare. That will still leave nearly $400 billion available for high-priority domestic concerns like education, defense, health care, and, yes, for tax relief as well. 
   That we believe reflects the priorities of the American people better than those offered by the other side. They have in their plan over $800 billion reserved for tax cuts. They don't have one penny reserved out of the surplus for Medicare--not one penny. Mr. President, we don't think that is the right set of priorities. 
   I remind my colleagues of what they said last year in the Budget Committee debate. This is the chairman of the Budget Committee, the very able Senator DOMENICI. Last year he said this.  
   ......Let me tell you, for every argument made around this table today about saving Social Security, you can now put it in the bank that the problems associated with fixing Medicare are bigger than the problems fixing Social Security, bigger in dollars, more difficulty in terms of the kind of reform necessary, and, frankly, I am for saving Social Security. But it is most interesting that there are some who want to abandon Medicare.......when it is the most precarious program we have got.  
   Senator DOMENICI was right then. What a difference a year makes. I wish this budget reflected those priorities. 
   He went on to say:  
   ......[W]e are very concerned about the long-term effect our population demographics will have on Medicare, and we are of the strong opinion that the second objective of this budget should be to preserve Medicare. 
   ......We think the best way to do something commensurate with the depletion in the budget is to pledge any extra resources we have, not generating programs, but, rather, putting them in Medicare where they ought to be.  
   Again, the distinguished Senator from New Mexico was absolutely right. We ought to put additional resources that come to us to secure Medicare for the future as well as Social Security. 
   And Senator GRAMM of Texas said just a year ago in the Budget Committee, and I quote:  
   ......[W]hat would we do if we had a half a trillion dollars to spend? ......The obvious answer that cries out is Medicare. 
   ......I think it is logical. People understood the President on save Social Security first, and I think they will understand save Medicare first. 
   ......Medicare is in crisis. We want to save Medicare first.  
   That is Senator GRAMM of Texas, just a year ago. What has happened? Why is there not a dime of the surplus reserved for Medicare in the plan of our Republican friends? There is not one dime locked away for Medicare. They will say: But we do have a surplus of $100 billion that we have not spent, that is really for Medicare. But, you know what, they did not do anything to protect it for Medicare, not one thing. Nothing has been done to protect one penny of that $100 billion for Medicare. 
   Do you know what else, that money is also required for emergencies over the next 10 years. If we go back and look at the last 10 years, we know that $100 billion will be spent just for emergencies because we are spending about $9 billion a year for emergencies. Over the next 10 years, including debt service, we will use up that $100 billion of their reserve just for disasters. 
   That leads me to the conclusion that without question they have not locked up one penny of surpluses for Medicare. The $100 billion that they talk about has not been protected for Medicare, not a dime of it. And every penny of it will likely be used for disasters and other emergencies because that has been the historical record.

   Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, unfortunately, when you pierce the veil on this one, what you find is there is not anything left. There is not any part of that money that is protected for Medicare, not a dime. There is $100 billion that is not spent in their budget plan, but based on our history we know it will probably all go for disasters and emergencies. There will not be any money available to strengthen Medicare. There will not be any money available to extend the solvency of Medicare. 
   That is why I think this amendment is fundamentally important. Because we are saying: Yes, absolutely, save every penny of the Social Security surplus for Social Security. But, of the rest of the surplus, the non-Social Security surplus, we save 40 percent of it, lock it up, protect it by special budget points of order so it cannot be raided, it cannot be looted. It is there to strengthen Medicare. 
   These are the top priorities of the American people: Medicare and Social Security. We believe we ought to provide protection for both. That is the essence of my amendment and I hope my colleagues will support it.

   Mr. CONRAD. The Senator is exactly correct. He is reading the table exactly in the correct way. I might just say to my friend, the Senator from Massachusetts, really I think our friends across the aisle have about spent this $100 billion three or four times. Because, to anybody who comes to them and says there are any deficiencies in their budgets, they say we have $100 billion we have not spent. 
   Of course all that money, based on history, will go for emergencies and disasters, every penny of it. That is why they have not put one penny of the surplus into a Medicare lockbox, because they really want to spend that money two, three, or four times. They say to the Medicare people who are interested in Medicare, ``We have that $100 billion. It will go for Medicare.'' They say to those who are concerned about disasters, ``We have funded that. We have this hundred billion we have not spent. It's available for disasters and emergencies.'' They say to anybody else, ``Your money is in that pot of $100 billion.'' 
   Surprise, surprise, there are going to be an awful lot of people lining up for that $100 billion who will find there is nothing there for them because the money has all gone for disasters and emergencies. That is really what it is reserved for. There is really not a penny of surplus that is lockboxed for Medicare--not a dime. 
   Mr. President, this amendment is an attempt to protect Social Security, to protect Medicare, to allow us to get ready for the challenge we face. We all understand Medicare is under enormous pressure. Social Security is under enormous pressure. Both of them need to be addressed. This is our opportunity. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. CONRAD. If I might just state, there was not consent granted to go off the Conrad amendment, and the reason consent was not granted is we have two Senators who have been here for a considerable amount of time waiting to talk about the Conrad amendment. 
   We allowed the other side to speak to their pending amendments. I twice gave consent for the other side to argue the amendment of Senator ASHCROFT, and then it returned to a discussion on the Conrad amendment. 
   I think it is only fair that those Members who are here be given a chance to address the Conrad amendment. They were here for that purpose, and then we go to the Bond amendment, which is on a different matter and is a different amendment. So I ask, in fairness, that those Senators who are here, specifically Senator REED of Rhode Island, and the Senator from New York, be given an opportunity to discuss the Conrad amendment which is the pending business. I did not give consent to going off my amendment to go to the next amendment.

   Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Chair. 
   I have been delighted at hearing the description of my amendment by the Senator from Texas. He has probably the greatest imagination in the Chamber. Unfortunately, his imagination has been working overtime, because his description of my amendment has virtually nothing to do with my amendment. The Senator from Texas suggests that my amendment is to prevent a tax cut. That is not the purpose of my amendment. My amendment is very clear. My amendment provides a lockbox that reserves every penny of the Social Security surplus for Social Security. It then goes to the next step and reserves 40 percent of the non-Social Security surplus for Medicare because Medicare is in imminent danger. 
   I point out that the Senator from Texas knew that last year. I don't know what happened in the last year that has caused him to forget it. But here is what he said last year. What a difference a year makes. He said:  
   ......[w]hat would we do if we had a half a trillion dollars to spend?  
   He said then:  
   The obvious answer that cries out is Medicare. 
   ......I think it is logical. People understood the President on save Social Security first and I think they will understand save Medicare first. 
   ......Medicare is in crisis. We want to save Medicare first.  
   The Senator from Texas said that last year. This year, the budget that he is advocating doesn't save one penny of the surplus for Medicare. That is where the difference lies. He wants all of the non-Social Security surplus to go for an across-the-board tax cut. 
   Where does that go? Guess where that goes. That goes to the richest among us. Here is what the top 1 percent gets in his proposal. They get $20,000 of tax cut. What happens to the bottom 60 percent? They get on average $99. 
   Maybe that is why now the Senator from Texas doesn't want to lock up and protect one penny of surplus for Medicare, because he wants to send it back not to Dicky Flatts. He wants to send it back to Dicky Flatts' wealthy friends, 20,000 bucks apiece to them; $99 to the rest of the people. The vast majority of the people, the top 1 percent, get $20,000. The bottom 60 percent get $99 on average. 
   Mr. President, the Senator from Texas suggests there is no 
   money available for a tax cut under the Conrad amendment. That is not my amendment. 
   That is a great speech. It is a great political argument. The only problem with it is that it is not true. It doesn't have anything to do with my amendment. 
   Let's be honest. Let's be honest. What does the Conrad amendment do with the surplus over the next 10 years? Over the next 10 years the surplus is $2.6 trillion. Under my amendment, the $1.8 trillion that comes from Social Security would be reserved for Social Security. 
   Second, another $376 billion would be reserved to strengthen Medicare. 
   Interestingly enough, last year the Senator from Texas said what happens if you have a windfall? The first priority ought to be Medicare. This year, he doesn't want to provide one thin dime out of the surplus for Medicare. He wants it all to go to a tax cut, an across-the-board tax cut that has this result. I don't think that is the priority of the American people to give a $20,000 tax cut to folks who are in the top 1 percent, people who have an average income of $833,000. I don't think that is a priority of the American people. Not one dime of surplus for Medicare, but provide it all to a tax cut for people who earn $833,000, give them $20,000, when Medicare is the program that is in the deepest trouble. What sense does that make? Let's go back to what the Conrad amendment provides, because the Senator from Texas talks about an amendment that is not the amendment that is before the body. It doesn't prevent tax relief. It doesn't prevent correcting the marriage penalty. The Senator from Texas knows better. 
   The amendment that I have offered offers of the $2.6 trillion of surplus over the next 10 years $1.8 trillion that comes from the Social Security surplus which goes to Social Security; $376 billion goes to Medicare. That leaves nearly $400 billion that is available for tax relief and for domestic priorities like education and defense and health care and, yes, tax relief. In fact, you could easily accommodate taking care of the marriage penalty under my amendment. You could provide other forms of targeted tax relief under my amendment, because those are the priorities of the American people. Save Social Security, dedicate every penny of the Social Security surplus for Social Security, and then 40 percent of the non-Social Security surplus for Medicare, because it needs money, a need that the Senator from Texas himself recognized just a year ago. In addition to that, $400 billion available over  the next 10 years for high priority domestic needs like education and defense, and yes, money available for tax relief as well. 
   Mr. President, that is what this amendment provides, not the description given by the Senator from Texas that bore absolutely no relation to the amendment that is before us. 
   I thank the Chair.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CONRAD. The Senator from Massachusetts asks a good question. The simple answer to the Senator is: By locking up additional funds for Medicare, we would be in a position at a later point, because we cannot do that in the context of the budget resolution, to extend the solvency of the Medicare system for at least another 12 years. That is the goal of this effort; to first lock it up and protect it so it cannot be diverted for some other purpose and then, when we get at a later point where we can make transfers which we are precluded from doing in a budget resolution, to then extend the solvency of the Medicare system. That is what this is all about: Protecting, strengthening Medicare, as well as strengthening Social Security. 
</TEXT>
</DOC>

<DOC>
<DOCNO>106-conrad-nd-24-19990324</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CONRAD. That is exactly correct. As the Senator may know, as a member of the Finance Committee I have voted repeatedly to reform Medicare in order to further extend its solvency. But it is my conviction, and I think the failure of the Medicare Commission so indicates, the need is for additional resources into Medicare. We also need to reform that system. But without additional resources I do not believe we will succeed in extending the solvency of the Medicare system. 
   So, there is really a two-part test here, to reform the system and to provide additional resources. If we do not protect them, if we do not lock them up, I assure you, Senators like our colleague from Texas will take the money and he will send it back to those who are earning over $833,000 a year. He will send them a $20,000 check and we will find our grandparents and our parents, who are dependent on Medicare for their health care, are not going to have it. That is the choice before the body. That is the choice before the body.

   Mr. CONRAD. That is correct, because this would extend it at least another 12 years beyond 2008 to 2020. With the new projections that are coming in, I believe it will be extended even beyond that. 
   That is fundamentally the question and the choice before this body. What are we going to do with these surpluses? Our friends on the other side of the aisle say: Social Security and tax cuts. We are saying in this amendment: Yes, Social Security, every dime of Social Security surplus for Social Security. But then let's provide additional resources to strengthen and preserve Medicare. And then, yes, let's also have funds that are available for high-priority domestic needs like education and health care and, yes, defense. And also have resources to provide some tax relief. I put marriage penalty right at the top of the list. That is provided for in this amendment.

   if you have a 10 percent across-the-board cut, the results are what I have shown here. For the top 1 percent, those whose income is over $800,000 a year, they get $20,000. The bottom 60 percent get, on average, relief of $99.

   Mr. CONRAD. It is all really a question of priorities. How should these surpluses be used? Our view is, the priorities of the American people are to safeguard Social Security, to safeguard Medicare, to provide for education and defense and health care, and also tax relief. The other side says there are only two priorities. They say the priorities with these surpluses are Social Security--and I commend them for that. But then they say virtually all the rest of the money ought to go for tax cuts. When you look at what they are proposing, the Senator from Texas was very clear. He likes across-the-board. The chairman of the Finance Committee has indicated he likes the 10 percent across-the-board. 
   That is not fair. That is not fair. It is not the priorities of the American people. That is why this amendment is important.

They have told us: Social Security, Medicare, education, health care, defense, and, yes, tax relief. Those are their priorities, and that is what this amendment represents.

   Mr. CONRAD. I appreciate that, and absolute affection for the Senator from New Mexico as well. We have a disagreement. I think both of us are being honest and direct about that disagreement. 
   Let me be clear. The Senator from New Mexico says that my amendment does not fix Medicare. That is true. That is absolutely true. My amendment does not fix Medicare; it does not solve the problem. But my Medicare amendment, or the part of my amendment that deals with Medicare, does make a difference, because it reserves funds to strengthen Medicare--nearly $400 billion over the next 10 years. 
   The lockbox offered by our friends across the aisle does not provide one penny of the surplus for Medicare. They say, in answer, ``But we fund Medicare.'' Yes, of course they fund Medicare. That is a budget requirement. Of course they fund it. But in the surpluses that are projected over the next 10 years, they are not setting aside one penny of that surplus to strengthen Medicare. That is a deficiency of their proposal. 
   Let's go back to what the Conrad amendment really does. The Conrad amendment reserves, in a lockbox, every penny of the Social Security surplus over the next 10 years for Social Security. 
   No. 2, the Conrad amendment takes $370 billion over the next 10 years of non-Social Security surplus and reserves that for Medicare. That is a critical first step to solving and resolving the Medicare crisis. 
   No. 3, we still then have about $400 billion left over the next 10 years to deal with high-priority domestic needs--education and health care and, yes, defense and, yes, tax relief--$400 billion that is available for those categories. 
   Our friends on the other side say that is not what we want to do. They say, we just want the money for Social Security and tax cuts, nothing out of the surplus--nothing out of the surplus--for defense, for education, for Medicare. Well, we do not believe those are the priorities of the American people. That is the difference. And that is what this amendment is about. 
   I ask my colleagues, just for a moment, to suspend partisanship on both sides and really look at what this amendment says--not to the characterization of the Senator 
   from Texas. His characterization was his imagination working overtime. It is what he hoped my amendment said, not what my amendment does say. The argument that he made was an argument not against the amendment that is before us but an argument against an amendment that he wished I was offering. 
   My amendment does pay down the publicly held debt more than the budget resolution--by about $300 billion. My proposal pays down publicly held debt more than what is being offered on the other side. 
   I think that is a good priority as well. So not only do we strengthen Social Security, strengthen Medicare, or at least make it possible to strengthen Medicare and also provide for high-priority domestic needs such as education, health care, defense, and tax relief, but we also are in a position to further pay down the public debt. Because every economist who has come before us in the Budget Committee, in the Finance Committee, has told us that that is the highest priority of all--pay down this publicly held debt, to put us in a position to keep interest rates down, to have a stronger economy for the future. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor and reserve my time.

   Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Chair. 
   Madam President, this amendment is very direct. It creates a lockbox to protect every dollar of Social Security surplus for Social Security. In addition, it creates a lockbox to add 40 percent of the non-Social Security surplus for Medicare. 
   Medicare is in danger. It is on the brink of insolvency. It is time not only for reform of Medicare, but to add additional resources so the promise of Medicare can be kept. 
   In addition, this amendment will pay down the debt by $300 billion more than the budget resolution alternative. I ask my colleagues to support this amendment to create a safe lockbox, not only for Social Security but for Medicare. That leaves sufficient resources----

   This leaves sufficient resources for $400 billion over the next 10 years for high-priority domestic issues, like education and defense, as well as room for tax reduction. But, fundamentally, it puts Social Security and Medicare first.

   Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise in support of S. 257. Although this bill is not as comprehensive or detailed as I would prefer, I have come to the conclusion that S. 257, as amended, sends an important signal of our country's commitment to defending itself from ballistic missile attack from a rogue state. 
   As my colleagues are aware, I am an advocate for national missile defense, and have authored legislation that has advanced the NMD program. I urge the Administration to include funding in the budget that would allow for NMD deployment, and am pleased that $6.6 billion was added to the future years defense plan for this purpose. 
   Increasingly, I am convinced that we need NMD sooner rather than later. Last July, the Rumsfeld Commission reported that several rogue states could develop an ICBM capable of threatening our country before we expect it. Recent missile tests by North Korea and Iran have confirmed the essence of the Rumsfeld panel's findings. I was disturbed by these developments, but have long said that we should be prepared before we are surprised. 
   Our country needs to move forward aggressively with NMD. But because our NMD program does not exist in a vacuum, it needs to be guided by what I call three common sense criteria: compatibility with arms control, affordability, and use of proven, tested technology. 
   As introduced last year S. 257 did not address these concerns, and its authors were refusing to entertain amendments. For these reasons, in 1998 I opposed this measure. 
   I am pleased that the bill's authors decided to support improving S. 257 through the amendment process. With the addition of the amendments offered by Senators COCHRAN and LANDRIEU, today I am prepared to support S. 257. Allow me to briefly discuss the impact of these amendments. 
   Yesterday the Senate, on a 99-0 vote, approved an amendment offered by Senator COCHRAN that will ensure that considerations of affordability and use of proven technology will not be neglected. By stating that funding the NMD will be subject to Congressional authorization and appropriations, the Cochran amendment indicates that no final decisions about deployment, funding levels, or the system's technological maturity have been made. I thank my esteemed colleague from Mississippi for his comments on this point during his colloquy with Senator BINGAMAN earlier today. Let me repeat: as amended, S. 257 is not the final word on NMD cost and use of proven technology. 
   Even more significant was the amendment offered by the distinguished ranking member of the Armed Services Committee's Strategic Forces Subcommittee, Senator LANDRIEU. In affirming that it is our nation's policy to pursue continued negotiated reductions to Russian nuclear forces, the Landrieu amendment makes unmistakably clear that as our NMD program moves forward we will take into account our arms control agreements and objectives. Because there can be little hope of Russian agreement to further nuclear reductions in the absence of continued United States support for the ABM Treaty, following through on the Landrieu amendment will require continued adherence to the ABM Treaty. 
   I would also like to note that I have been assured by the President's advisors that in no way will S. 257 by interpreted by our nation's arms control negotiators as a repudiation of the ABM Treaty. Administration officials continue to make it clear that the ABM Treaty remains the ``cornerstone of strategic stability,'' and that the Administration has a ``strong commitment to the ABM Treaty.'' 
   I cannot understate the importance of these amendments. Without them, I would again vote against S. 257. 
   It is true that I would have preferred that the Senate would today be passing a more comprehensive NMD bill, one that is more explicit about the importance of our arms control agreements and offers specific guidance on affordability, system component selection, and technology development and deployment. It is my intention to introduce legislation which will describe in more detail how the NMD program should proceed. 
   For the time being, however, I regard S. 257 as a constructive contribution to our NMD program. It will do no harm to our nation's security, and will put our nation's potential enemies on notice that we are working aggressively to establish a defense against ICBMs. As amended, S. 257 will also help ensure that concerns of arms control, cost, and use of proven technology will be carefully considered. This is a good bill, and will have my support.

   Mr. CONRAD. I rise today to introduce the Dakota Water Resources Act of 1999, as cosponsored by my colleague, Senator DORGAN. Our colleague, Congressman POMEROY, is introducing identical legislation in the House of Representatives today. 
   Mr. President, the Dakota Water Resources Act represents a fiscally responsible, environmentally sound, treaty-compliant approach to completing the Garrison project. The U.S. Senate is well aware of the history of failed promises on water development projects on the Missouri River. The 1944 Flood Control Act authorized six main-stem dams along the Missouri River. These structures flooded about 550,000 acres of land in North Dakota. These were prime agricultural lands that were flooded. We were promised that we would get certain things in return for the loss of these lands. We were promised that we would get a major water project for the State of North Dakota. Unfortunately, only part of that promise has been kept. 
   You can see here the kinds of things that have happened. This is the town of Elbowoods, July 7, 1954. This town is now under water. It is not the only town that is under water. Town after town along the Missouri was flooded in order to give protection to downstream States, to remove from them the flood threat that so long had devastated them economically. 
   We accepted the permanent flood, a flood that came and has never gone. That flood has cost our State tremendously. All we are asking is that the promise that was made to us in exchange for flooding these 550,000 acres now be kept. 
   Mr. President, the Dakota Water Resources Act would assure North Dakota an adequate supply of quality water for municipal, rural, and industrial purposes. In fact, without these amendments, many communities in North Dakota will be forced to be without clean and reliable water supplies. 
   I think you can see these two jars. This is water that is delivered to rural North Dakotans via a pipeline. It is clean. It is healthy. It is wholesome. 
   This is the typical water supply for rural North Dakotans. It looks like coffee or dark tea. This is actually what comes out when you turn on your spigot in the homes of many of the people in rural North Dakota. This is like living in the Third World. I tell my colleagues, there is nothing quite like getting ready to step into a bathtub of water when it looks like this; even worse, to have your child getting ready to step into a bathtub of water that looks like this. This is absolutely at the heart of what we are trying to accomplish with the Dakota Water Resources Act, to provide clean, healthy supplies of water to our population. 
   Mr. President, water development is essential for economic development, agriculture, recreation and improving the environment. The legislation that we are offering today will provide an adequate and dependable water supply throughout North Dakota, including communities in the Red River Valley. 
   This picture shows what we have faced in the past. This is 
   1910. This is the Red River, the famous Red River of the North. You could have walked  across this river. You can see, at that point it was nothing more than a few puddles. It had virtually dried up. Now, since that time we have had major cities spring up, and we can't face a circumstance in which those towns would be high and dry. Fargo, ND--I think many people have heard of Fargo, ND--Grand Forks, ND; they are on the Red River. They depend, for their water supplies, on the Red River. Yet periodically in history the Red River all but dries up. We need to make certain that there is ample supplies of water so that we aren't facing that circumstance. 
   The bill that we are offering today is addressing the current water needs of our State. Those needs are significantly different than what we faced in 1944. 
   Let me briefly summarize the bill. It provides $300 million for statewide MR&I projects. It provides $200 million for tribal MR&I projects--in many cases, the water conditions on our reservations are even worse than the ones that I have shown that pertain in much of rural North Dakota--$200 million to deliver water to the Red River Valley to make certain that those towns and cities have reliable and adequate supplies of water; $40 million to replace the dangerous Four Bears Bridge that was required because of flooding that occurred, a bridge was built--that bridge is now badly out of date and dangerous--$25 million for a natural resources trust fund; $6.5 million for recreation projects; and an understanding that the State pays for the project facilities that it uses. We think that is a fundamental principle that ought to be recognized. 
   Those are the key elements of the bill that we are offering. Let me say, this bill is friendly to taxpayers as well, because our bill, while proposing $770 million of new authority to complete the project, deauthorizes many parts of the project that were previously authorized. The total project cost of the Dakota Water Resources Act would be roughly $1.5 billion, nearly $500 million less than the current cost of constructing the remainder of the 1986 project that is already authorized. In other words, we are trading in parts of the project that no longer make the most sense in exchange for new elements which do make sense, and we are doing it in a way that is cost-effective for the taxpayers, reducing the overall bill by $500 million. 
   Now, there are some, representing certain national environmental organizations that will remain unnamed here, who have said that this is nearly a billion dollars of new spending. They aren't telling the truth. That is not the truth. We are reducing the spending by deauthorizing certain features previously authorized in exchange for new ones, less costly ones that make sense in light of contemporary needs. 
   Mr. President, North Dakota has been waiting a long time, a long time for the promise to be kept to our State. It is desperately needed. 
   Mr. President, this legislation represents a fiscally responsible, environmentally sound, treaty-compliant approach to completing the Garrison Project that was promised in North Dakota. I look forward to continuing to work with Members of this body and the other body and the administration to advance this legislation. 
   I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.

   Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, throughout the 105th Congress, the Administration and the Congress focused considerable attention on information technology (IT) issues, particularly the difficulties that many American companies are experiencing in recruiting skilled workers to fill key positions in information technology. 
   The Department of Commerce, early in the 105th Congress, released a study, ``America's New Deficit: The Shortage of Information Technology Workers,'' alerting us to the severe shortage of information technology workers. This report was supported by a study from the Information Technology Association of America, ``Help Wanted 1998: A Call for Collaborative Action For the New Millennium,'' which estimated that there are more than 340,000 highly skilled positions in information technology that are not filled. Moreover, the Department of Labor projected that our economy will require more than 130,000 information technology jobs in three fields--systems analysts, computer scientists and engineers, and computer programmers--every year for the next 10 years. 
   Mr. President, the shortage of skilled high-tech workers is not unique to any one region of the country--Silicon Valley, Dallas, Atlanta, or Northern Virginia. It is a matter of urgent concern across the country. The shortage affects every State, every sector of the economy, and its impact was documented during a conference of more than 350 educators, State officials, and business community leaders that I hosted last fall in Bismarck, North Dakota. The conference was scheduled to examine the challenges and opportunities of information technology in the 21st century. 
   Without question, the shortage of skilled IT workers is a major concern for State officials and the North Dakota business community. During the conference, many North Dakota business leaders from firms, including Great Plains Software, Gateway, U.S. West, and North Central Data Co-op, confirmed the difficulties they are having in recruiting employees with qualified information technology skills. The business community and educators, representing all levels of education, emphasized the importance of expanding opportunities in information technology training and education. 
   Last year, during the closing days of the 105th Congress, we took the first step to respond to the concern over the shortage of skilled high-tech workers by increasing the annual cap on H1-B visas for foreign workers recruited to work in U.S. high-tech industries. As important as this first step is, the increase in H1-B visas by itself will not adequately respond to the shortage of  skilled workers in the U.S. Nor is it acceptable to authorize an increase in the number of foreign workers coming to the U.S. to fill IT vacancies without taking steps to ensure that American workers and students have opportunities to train and qualify for these excellent opportunities. 
   Mr. President, that is why, during consideration of the American Competitiveness Act last year, I introduced legislation, S. 2089, to allow employers an income tax credit for information technology training expenses paid on behalf of employees or other individuals who are entering information technology careers. I believe it is essential that we provide every opportunity to American workers and individuals to become aware of opportunities in information technology, and to ensure that training and education is available at all levels. I regret that we did not adopt this important initiative during the 105th Congress. 
   Today, I am introducing this legislation to provide employers a tax credit for information technology training. I am very pleased that Senators FEINSTEIN, JOHNSON, DASCHLE, SARBANES, BOXER, SNOWE, MURRAY, REID, and ROBB are cosponsoring this important initiative. This legislation is also endorsed by the Information Technology Association of America, the Software and Information Industry Association, the Computing Technology Industry Association, the Information Technology Training Association, and the American Society For Training and Development. 
   Under this legislation, the tax credit would be an amount equal to 20 percent of information technology training program expenses, not to exceed $6,000 in a taxable year. The value of the credit would increase by 5 percent if the IT training program is operated in an Empowerment Zone, Enterprise Community, Rural Economic Area Partnership (REAP) zone, in a school district in which at least 50 percent of the students in the school district participate in the school lunch program, in an area designated as a disaster zone by the President or Secretary of Agriculture, or associated with a small business with no more than 200 employees. 
   Mr. President, last year we responded to the IT worker shortage by increasing the opportunities for skilled high-tech workers from other countries to come to the U.S. to work in the information technology field. Now we have an obligation to make certain that the same exciting opportunities in information technology are available to American workers and other individuals interested in information technology careers. I welcome additional cosponsors of this legislation, and I strongly urge my colleagues to incorporate this important bill in the tax legislation that we are expected to consider in the 106th Congress.

   Mr. CONRAD. Mr. Chief Justice, I have served twelve years in the United States Senate. 
   I respect this institution and all of you as colleagues. I especially respect the job our leaders have done in this trial. They have performed in the highest tradition of the United States Senate. Most of all, I respect our oath of office: to ``preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States.'' I know all of us take that oath seriously. 
   At the end of this proceeding, however, we may reach different conclusions about what the Constitution compels us to do. The simple truth is that this case is not black and white. As Mr. Manager GRAHAM said, reasonable people may come to different conclusions. 
   There is one thing on which we all agree: The President's conduct was wrong. In fact, it was very wrong. But the question before us is not whether the President's conduct was wrong. The question is whether that conduct meets the Constitutional standard for removing a President from office. 
   That requires us to make a profound judgment on whether we should overturn the results of a national election. 67 members in this chamber can nullify the votes of the 47 million Americans who voted for President Clinton. That is an awesome power. It must be used with great restraint. 
   There are three questions we must answer in the affirmative to remove a President: First, did the President commit the crimes he is charged with? Second, are these crimes properly addressed by impeachment, or would they be better left to the criminal justice system? Third, do the charges rise to the level of high crimes and misdemeanors and justify the removal of the President of the United States?

   Mr. CONRAD. I agree with my colleagues. Through the section 29 tax credit for nonconventional fuels, Congress has supported the development of environmentally friendly fuels from domestic biomass and coal resources. There are lignite resources in my state that could compete in the energy marketplace if we can find a reasonable incentive for the investment in the necessary technology. As soon as possible in the 106th Congress, I hope we will give this crucial subject the attention it deserves.
