   Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, when I think of my dear friend SLADE GORTON, I am reminded of how many of our colleagues are frequently saying: I wish I were Governor; or, I really ought to be out making some money; or, I am really not satisfied being 1 of 100; or, there must be something better I could be doing with my life. 
   I have heard that from many of our colleagues on both sides of the aisle. I once asked SLADE GORTON: SLADE, did you ever think about running for Governor? And he said: Absolutely not. I wouldn't have that job. He said: I love the legislative process. 
   And no one is better at the legislative process than our good friend SLADE GORTON. 
   I forget which brokerage house it was, but there used to be commercials that said, when so and so spoke, everyone listened. Whether it was the Republican conference meetings or on those rare occasions when all Members met together, SLADE GORTON was rarely the first one to talk, but when he spoke, everyone listened.

   Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. Speaker, the bill before the Senate is a half billion dollars below last year's appropriation--the fiscal year 2000 bill was $15.4 billion--this year we are presenting a $14.9 billion bill. This includes $14.5 billion in fiscal year 2000 funds plus an additional $466 million in supplemental funding for debt relief, Southern Africa, and the Balkans. 
   Although we are below last year's level, we have managed to substantially increase key priorities, including providing $865 million for Ex-Im, a nearly $100 million increase over last year, $1.3 billion for development assistance, again a $100 million increase, within child survival we surpassed the request for AIDS funding and provided $315 million. Overall child survival funding was also increased to $963 million. In addition to over $1 billion in supplemental funds for Colombia, the Narcotics and Law enforcement account was increased by $20 million over the request to $325 million. For the first time in years, we managed to increase security assistance. This account is of real concern to our friends and allies in Central and Eastern Europe. We exceeded the request and provided $3.545 billion. To respond to crises from Chechnya to Sierra Leone, we substantially increased funding both over last year's level and this year's request for refugees to $700 million. In this account we were able to work out a compromise that will improve management and oversight of UNHCR while affording the administration flexibility to respond rapidly to any real emergency. 
   Finally, we provided funds for the fiscal year 2001 and the supplemental request for debt relief. In addition to language on IMF reforms recommended by Senator GRAMM, we have included a number of HIPC conditions worked out between Senator HELMS and Congressman LEACH, representing the authorizing committees. There are a number of policy provisions which are also important to mention. Within the $675 million account for Eastern Europe, we have provided up to $100 million for Serbia. Senator LEAHY and I agree that we will never be able to withdraw troops and help stabilize the Balkans as long as Milosevic and other criminals responsible for outrageous atrocities across the Balkans are allowed to go free. No government in the region will have confidence in Belgrade if the rule of law is not upheld. 
   The administration lobbied heavily against our arguments that U.S. support for the new government should come with specific conditions attached. We thought aid should flow only if the Serb government met three specific conditions: First, they need to cooperate with the War Crimes Tribunal. Second, they must take steps to end support for organizations in the Republic of Srpska which prevent effective integration of Bosnia Hercegovina. Finally, given Belgrade's vicious track record, we thought it was important to seek assurances that the new government will implement policies which respect the rights and aspirations of minorities and the rule of law. Each of these conditions was designed to serve our interests in stabilizing the region so that an exit strategy for U.S. troops can be safely and effectively executed. The bill modifies this approach and includes an agreement which will give this administration and the new government in Belgrade a 5-month window in which assistance can move forward. After that period, only humanitarian aid and support to local mayors will be allowed if Belgrade refuses to meet the conditions which I have outlined. 
   I must confess my reservations about this approach. I listened to the arguments for flexibility, but I have little confidence in the administration's past record of support for the Tribunal and  standing up to Belgrade. I believe that there is no problem in Serbia that will be made easier by Milosevic's predatory presence. No regional government will have confidence in Belgrade as long as he is allowed to go free. It is in their interest and ours to see him turned over for trial. In the end I agreed to this compromise because funds for Serbia are made available subject to the committee's notification. If 
   there is no sign of cooperation or progress on our conditions during the next five months, the administration should understand that I will put a hold on funding. This compromise is not a free pass to spend for five months--Senator LEAHY and I will be expecting concrete progress. The second area of tremendous concern addressed in the bill is Russia's action in Chechnya. Since launching this war, Moscow has blocked all humanitarian relief operations or international human rights investigations from proceeding in Chechnya. While we cannot always change the views in Moscow, I was extremely disappointed by the administration refusal to support the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights call for an international investigation. Instead Secretary Albright testified the administration preferred to allow Moscow to conduct its own internal investigation. The State Department has also rejected support for non-government groups providing relief and preferred instead to work through the Russian government. 
   To address these problems, we have earmarked $10 million for the more than 400,000 displaced families in Chechnya and Ingushetia which can only be provided through NGOs. Aid to the Russian government is also made contingent upon cooperation with international investigations in Chechnya. We have also made aid to the Russian Government contingent upon a certification that Moscow has terminated support for the nuclear program in Iran. In the past we have withheld 50 percent of the Russian government funds until this certification is made--this year we have increased the withholding to 60 percent. Putin has said Russia must build a dictatorship of law--what remains unclear is whether his personal emphasis will be on dictatorship or law. I think our aid should be leverage to secure a result which serves American interests and nuclear armed Iran certainly is not in U.S. interests. 
   Finally, let me mention debt relief. Senator HELMS and Congressman LEACH reported out bills which conditioned U.S. support to the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative managed by the IMF and the World Bank. The Foreign Relations Committee bill requires the Secretary of Treasury to certify that it is World Bank policy to--(1) suspend funding if loans are diverted or misused, (2) not displace private sector funding, and (3) disburse funds based on the implementation of reforms by the recipient country including the promotion of open markets and liberalization of trade practices, the promotion of projects which enhance economic growth and the establishment of benchmarks to measure progress toward graduation from assistance. Similar conditions are required of the IMF. In addition to including language supported by Senator HELMS and Congressman LEACH, we have included House language limiting resources to countries engaged in a pattern of human rights abuses. I supported stronger language which would have required that the Secretary of Treasury certify that the IMF and Bank actually were implementing new policy conditions before Treasury was allowed to disburse funds--this approach was recommended by Senator GRAMM, the chairman of the Banking Committee. That was my view of how it should have been handled. Instead, my colleagues on the conference supported Helms-Leach language which releases the funds and then requires reporting on performance over the course of the next year. 
   While I completely agreed with Senator GRAMM, I also shared the problem he has with his committee--there simply were not the votes to sustain this position. I think we have made progress on conditioning debt relief, but the Treasury Department should understand that I will continue to consult with Senator GRAMM when we receive notifications on intended debt relief recipients. Performance benchmarks are essential if we are to avoid seeing the same groups of countries and banks back in 5 years seeking the same relief all over again. Separate from the HIPC relief, we did include binding requirements that the Treasury Department withhold 10 percent of our contribution to any multilateral bank until specific conditions are met on procurement and management reforms. Not only will the banks have to improve internal management practices through audits, they will have to improve recipient country procurement management and financial practices. This is an important step in our battle against fraud and corruption. Once again, I think we have produced a balanced bill which funds U.S. priorities within sound budget principles and I urge its favorable consideration. 
   Finally, I repeat, this bill is below the amount spent for foreign operations last year. That makes it somewhat unique among the appropriations bills we have been in the process of passing, and I am proud to say we were able to bring this bill in under last year's total. 
   Mr. President, are we under some time agreement?

   Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I want to express my support for the FY 2001 Agriculture Appropriations bill and offer my support for the prescription drug reimportation provisions included in this conference report. While I do not believe the provisions are perfect and I continue to have grave concerns about the so-called ``non-discrimination'' language, I believe this final product represents a good faith compromise which will meet the needs of the American people. 
   However, I would like to emphasize that my support for reimportation was and remains contingent upon the legislation specifically ensuring that any prescription drug reimported from another country meets all of the United States' safety standards. In other words, our citizens must remain confident that their prescriptions will be filled with products that are safe and effective. In particular, I am pleased that under these provisions, FDA must issue regulations requiring that reimported products be FDA-approved drugs that meet all of the conditions of the New Drug Application, or NDA. It is especially important to maintain our gold standard of drug quality, that all such products comply fully with what FDA calls the ``chemistry, manufacturing, and controls'' portions of the NDA. Compliance with these requirements assures that the drugs not only have the necessary ingredients but also have been manufactured according to the same specifications as the domestic drug product, and the same high-quality process.

    Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the thousands of workers, both past and present, at the Gaseous Diffusion Plants in Paducah, Portsmouth, and Oak Ridge for their patience and persistence through what has been, and continues to be, a challenging time. 
   When the reports of contamination broke in the August 8, 1999 edition of the Washington Post, my first thoughts were of the individuals and families who had suffered because of DOE's mistakes. I thought of the pain those workers must have endured from the illnesses and continue to endure in many cases, and the sense of loss families must have felt for those whose loved ones did not survive the harsh effects of contamination. 
   The story of the Harding Family, of Paducah, still haunts me. To think that a man suffered and died a painful death because of the carelessness of officials at the Department of Energy is incomprehensible. My heart goes out to the Harding Family for the loss of Mr. Joe Harding, and I hope that this dear family can take some solace in the knowledge that it was because of Joe's persistence that this story came to light. Because of Joe's willingness to speak in the face of high-powered opposition, at least 120 other workers who suffer effects of contamination will now be treated and compensated by the United States government. Joe paid the ultimate price in his death, and for that he deserves our sympathy, our respect, and our gratitude. 
   From that very first moment the story broke, I have been determined to make sure all current and former employees are tested for contamination and that sick employees receive the treatment they need and deserve. Of course, nothing can take the place of good health or life, but every effort should be made to provide compensation for DOE's wrongs. 
   I want the workers in Paducah, Portsmouth, and Oak Ridge to know that I am working here in the Senate to ensure that they are adequately tested and treated for any problems they experience as a result of contamination at the plant. I have continually sought funding, as a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, and am pleased to have played a role in providing the funding to make health testing equipment, such as the vital lung screening van for Paducah, available to all of the dedicated workers who have served at the each of the Gaseous Diffusion Plants. 
   The mobile lung screening unit should serve as a symbol to each of the workers and their families that we will keep fighting for your health and safety, for your economic livelihood, and for the cleanup of the plant sites and surrounding neighborhoods. 
   On behalf of my colleagues in the Senate, I want to say thank you to the employees at the plants for their service to the United States. Your sacrifice to help us win the Cold War will never be forgotten.

    Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to honor my good friend, the twentieth President of Centre College in Danville, Kentucky, John Roush. 
   I want to offer my heartfelt congratulations to John Roush, the students and faculty at Centre College, and the City of Danville, Kentucky for their successful bid to host the only vice presidential debate of the 2000 election. Under the leadership of John Roush, the college and the community worked together to make the debate at Centre College a reality. 
   By all accounts, the debate in Danville was a success. Even though Centre College is the smallest higher-education institution to have ever hosted a presidential or vice presidential debate, they exceeded expectations and pulled-off a top-rate event. The town and college coordinated events throughout the day of the debate to build anticipation and provide opportunities for those who did not have tickets to participate in the occasion. An outdoor concert, open to the public, was held on Centre's campus and featured Maysville native and celebrity Nick Clooney, gospel singer Larnelle Harris, and the Owensboro Symphony Orchestra. Then, attendees were treated to a live, big-screen viewing of the vice presidential debate. 
   President John Roush's fingerprints were all over the events of the day; his creativity and ingenuity a benefit to everyone who participated. Whether you watched the debate from the screen on Centre's lawn, the seats of Centre's Norton Center for Fine Arts or on television in your home, the professionalism with which John led the extensive preparations for the debate were apparent. 
   Just talk to anyone at Centre College, in Danville, or in all of Kentucky for that matter--they will tell you that in the two years John has served as president at Centre, he has rallied students, faculty, and city residents with his passion for excellence. He has been described by his peers and co-workers as having an ``infectious enthusiasm'' and being ``full of integrity.'' He has been characterized as ``energetic'' and ``impressive.'' I know from my own personal experience with and observation of John that all of these descriptions are true. I am proud to call him a fellow Kentuckian and friend. 
   At this point, Mr. President, I would like to read into the RECORD an excerpt from an October 7, 2000, editorial by Washington Post writer David Von Drehle that ran in the Louisville Courier-Journal, which perfectly sums up the atmosphere in Danville, KY, on the day of the debate.  
   Centre College hosted the debate. This unlikely setting--far from the nearest airport, in a place without many four-lane roads, in fact--turned out to be one of the best ever. The whole day was a happy pageant of Norman Rockwell meets Alexis de Tocqueville. 
   Tired and jaded political junkies stepped from their cars and buses into an afternoon that was either the very end of summer or the very beginning of fall. Clear sky, warm sun, fresh breeze. Though the trees all appeared to be green, a few golden leaves began to drift toward the grass of the college common as evening approached. 
   On the common, bands played marches and choirs sang gospel hymns. Hours before the debate began, the gently sloping ground filled with grandparents on lawn chairs and moms and dads on blankets and children who twirled and ran and tumbled and plucked  leaves from their hair. There were young men in shorts and their sweethearts in sun dresses enjoying the day and preparing to watch the clash on giant screens. 
   Speakers read passages from great documents of American history--the Declaration of Independence, the Gettysburn Address--and an orchestra played the national anthem and ``My Old Kentucky Home.'' Kids waved flags.  
   There are no words I can add to more accurately describe the picture-perfect day John Roush orchestrated at Centre College on October 5, 2000. 
   On behalf of myself and my colleagues in the United States Senate, I applaud you, John Roush, for what you have accomplished at Centre College and thank you for your commitment to higher education.

    Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to my friend Dr. Sam Robinson on the occasion of his retirement as president of the Lincoln Foundation in Louisville, Kentucky. 
   Sam has been a tireless advocate for the Lincoln Foundation in his 26 years as president, making a difference in the lives of countless young Kentuckians. Sam has worked toward a worthy mission at the Foundation: to help underprivileged children get an education so that they can have a better chance at succeeding in professional life. I applaud your commitment to this cause, Sam, and offer sincere thanks for the good work you have done. 
   One of the projects Sam has been most passionate about during his time at the Lincoln Foundation is the Whitney M. Young Scholars Program. Sam's ingenuity got the ball rolling for this project, which is a four-year college scholarship program. Since the program's inception, Whitney M. Young scholarships have enabled hundreds of bright young people to attend college who could not have otherwise afforded the expense of an education. 
   Sam's legacy of service extends far beyond the Lincoln Foundation. His philanthropic and civic actions have resulted in his being honored with the Humanitarian Award from the Louisville Chapter of the National Conference of Christians and Jews, and being named ``Man of the Year'' by Sigma Pi Phi fraternity. Sam also has served on the boards of Bellarmine University, PNC Bank and the Kentucky State Board of Elementary and Secondary Education. 
   Dr. Sam Robinson's service to the Lincoln Foundation and the thousands of young people he has helped over the years will long be remembered and admired. His genuine compassion for underprivileged students will encourage and inspire Kentuckians for generations to come. Today, I say to Sam: best wishes for many more years of service, and know that your efforts to better the lives of others in Louisville and throughout Kentucky are recognized and appreciated. On behalf of myself and my colleagues in the United States Senate, thank you for giving so much of yourself for so many others.

    Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Lawrence and Kim Butterfield for their commitment to higher education, and their generosity to the many students who will be able to attend Spalding University because of their gift. 
   Spalding University has 2.5 million reasons to be grateful to Lawrence and Kim Butterfield of Louisville, Kentucky. Their recent $2.5 million contribution to Spalding University will allow the school to expand their current overseas travel and study programs, and provide additional student scholarships. The Butterfield's kindness and generosity will ensure that countless students from all backgrounds will receive a quality education and the opportunity to succeed in whatever field of study they choose. Their contribution also will enable students to have the incredible experience of traveling and studying abroad. Students who could not otherwise have afforded this opportunity will now be able to participate because of Lawrence and Kim. 
   Spalding University will benefit from the many students who will be able to attend classes because of the Butterfield's gift of scholarship funds. The gift of an education is truly the gift that keeps on giving. When Lawrence and Kim provide a scholarship for a student at Spalding, they give the student a quality education and lifelong career opportunities. But the gift goes further than the individual recipient--it also is a gift to the University and to the Louisville community. 
   On behalf of myself and my colleagues in the United States Senate, I offer sincere thanks to the Butterfield's for their gift to the students and faculty at Spalding University, to the Louisville community, and to the education of today's youth.

   Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, earlier this year the Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies held an organizational meeting to officially begin preparations for the next Presidential Inauguration hosted by Congress to be held on Saturday, January 20, 2001. 
   Next year marks more historic milestones as it will be the 200th anniversary of the first Presidential Inauguration in our Nation's Capital, the first Presidential Inauguration of the 21st Century, and, not least of all, the first inauguration of the new millennium. 2001 also marks the 100th birthday of the Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies, an entity which I am greatly honored to serve as Chairman.  
   As we approach adjournment for this Congress, let us look forward with great anticipation and excitement to our Nation's 54th Presidential Inauguration and celebrate this remarkable American tradition in which the peaceful transference of power takes place with all our citizens as witnesses. 
   In 1789, our Nation's Father and first President, George Washington, recited the oath of office on the Balcony of Federal Hall in New York City. By 1801, the seat of the U.S. Government had moved from New York City, to Philadelphia, and finally to Washington, D.C. 
   On March 4, 1801, Thomas Jefferson became the first President to be inaugurated at the U.S. Capitol in Washington, D.C., in a room now known as the ``Old Supreme Court Chamber.'' In 1829, Andrew Jackson became the first President to be inaugurated on the East Front of the Capitol, where the majority of swearing-in ceremonies continued to take place until the late twentieth century. It was not until President Ronald Reagan's inauguration on January 20, 1981, that the swearing-in ceremony moved to the West Front of the Capitol where larger crowds could be accommodated. Though below-freezing temperatures in 1985 forced the second Reagan inaugural ceremony inside to the Capitol Rotunda, the West Front set the standard for the next three Congressionally hosted ceremonies. The 2001 Presidential inaugural ceremonies will continue that tradition. 
   It is interesting to note that until 1901 the Presidential inaugural ceremonies were planned and conducted solely by the Senate. A century later, the Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies brings together the Senate and the House of Representatives in welcoming America's President-elect to the Capitol for the public swearing-in ceremony. 
   Upon undertaking this endeavor, it became apparent that steps needed to be taken to direct that the important historic materials generated by the JCCIC were preserved. For a committee reconstituted every four years, these documents are critical tools for conducting this massive quadrennial event. To ensure these materials are preserved in an appropriate manner, I am introducing a resolution to establish the procedures for archiving the records of the Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies.

    Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Kentuckian Terry Wilcutt on the occasion of his recent journey to the International Space Station as commander of the space shuttle Atlantis. 
   Congratulations to Colonel Wilcutt, on achieving the kind of academic and professional success it takes to receive the honor of commanding a flight into space. Colonel Wilcutt has flown to space not once, but four times, and on two such flights he has held the title of mission commander. I, along with my fellow Kentuckians, am certainly proud to call him one of Kentucky's own. His accomplishments speak well for his home state as well as his alma mater, Western Kentucky University. 
   Colonel Wilcutt is a Kentuckian, born and bred. He was born in Russellville, KY, graduated from Louisville's Southern High School in 1967, and is a 1974 graduate of Western Kentucky University with a bachelor of arts degree in math. Colonel Wilcutt taught high school math for 2 years and then entered the Marine Corps. While in the Marine Corps, he attended the notorious ``Topgun'' Naval Fighter Weapons School, achieved honors at every level of pilot training and has logged over 4,400 flight hours in more than 30 different aircraft. 
   Colonel Wilcutt's career in aeronautics began in 1990 when he was selected by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, NASA, to become an astronaut. Prior to his September 2000 trip to space, Colonel Wilcutt flew on three missions to space and logged more than 724 hours in space. 
   On behalf of myself and my colleagues in the Senate, I congratulate you on your accomplishments. Only a handful of Americans reach the level of excellence required and receive the honor of being selected to lead missions into space. Colonel Wilcutt, I am proud of you, your fellow Kentuckians are proud of you, and your alma mater of Western Kentucky University is proud of you. Thank you for your brave service to our country, and best wishes for further success in the future.

    Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize my good friend Ellen Williams for her tremendous work as chairwoman of the Kentucky Republican Party. 
   To say that Ellen Williams is a busy woman is quite the understatement. Besides being a wife, Mom, soccer coach, and part-time career woman, Ellen is chairwoman of the Republican Party of Kentucky. She has a history of service spanning more than 15 years, which includes work in President Reagan's 1984 reelection campaign, Larry Forgy's 1995 gubernatorial campaign, and as state executive director of the Kentucky Republican Party in 1992-93. Ellen has shared her time, knowledge, and spirit with Kentucky Republicans over the last several years, and she continues to share her able leadership skills with us now as chairwoman of our party. 
   Ellen is a confident, capable leader. In her position as chairwoman, one of her many responsibilities is to be the voice of the Kentucky Republican Party. Ellen makes it her business to have her finger on the pulse of the State's Republicans. Considering the liberal leaning nature of the Kentucky press, I am fully aware of the challenge that being a spokesperson presents. Ellen is a true professional when it comes to dealing with the media, and handles each statement she gives and each press conference she holds with style and grace. 
   Another part of Ellen's job is to rally Kentucky Republicans for local, State and national races. This responsibility requires her to do a great deal of traveling--a recent Anderson News article says that Ellen has driven nearly 30,000 miles in the last year going to meetings and party events across the State. The fresh enthusiasm Ellen has brought to her post as chairwoman is invaluable, and I thank you, Ellen, for all that you do. 
   I also thank your husband, Greg, whom you have referred to as your ``co-chairman,'' and to your two young sons, Sam and Joey. I thank them for sharing you with Kentucky's Republicans, and for the love and support they provide which makes it possible for you to do the excellent job you do. 
   Ellen leads the party during an exciting time in Kentucky politics and in national politics. Our great state boasts two Republican U.S. Senators, five Republican Members of the U.S. Congress, a Republican majority in the State senate, and a promising November election for our Presidential nominee, Gov. George W. Bush. As chairman of Bush/Cheney 2000 in Kentucky, I want to say a special thank you, Ellen, for all of your hard work thus far. Thank you in advance for all of the hours of work yet to come before November 7.

    Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to my good friend Lowell Guthrie for his commitment to higher education, and his generosity to the students at Western Kentucky University in Bowling Green, Kentucky. 
   I have had the privilege of knowing Lowell for many years and have witnessed his compassion for others on numerous occasions. Lowell has a kind heart and a giving spirit, and he constantly thinks of ways to improve the quality of life for others. Lowell has  built a successful business in Bowling Green and is an active member of the Bowling Green community. He is a leader in education, providing opportunities for his employees and for others whom he does not know by funding scholarships to Western Kentucky University. He has consistently been a contributor to WKU and has now stepped up as a leader in Western's Investing in the Spirit capital campaign with a $1.8 million gift to provide student scholarships and to construct a clock and bell tower on the WKU campus. 
   The clock and bell tower will stand in ``The Guthrie Plaza'' in memory of Lowell's brother, Sgt. 1st Class Robert Guthrie, an American soldier who died in the Korean War, and it will honor all those associated with WKU who have lost their lives in service to their country. The courtyard area of The Guthrie Plaza will be constructed in honor of Lowell's wife, Judith Carolyn Guthrie. 
   The tower and courtyard will enhance the appearance of WKU's campus but more importantly it will serve as a reminder to thousands of students and alumni of those who sacrificed their lives so that we may have freedom. Lowell's generosity and his commitment to education will ensure that hundreds of students from all backgrounds will receive a quality education and the opportunity to succeed in whatever field of study they choose. 
   On behalf of myself and my colleagues in the United States Senate, I offer heartfelt thanks to Lowell and to the entire Guthrie family for their continuing commitment to Western Kentucky University, their community and to the education of America's youth.

   Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, in accordance with section 318 of Public Law 101-520 as amended by Public Law 103-283, I am submitting the frank mail allocations made to each Senator from the appropriation for official mail expenses and a summary tabulation of Senate mass mail costs for the third quarter of FY2000 to be printed in the RECORD. The official mail allocations are for franked mail expenses only, and therefore are unrelated to the mass mail expenditure totals. The third quarter of FY2000 covers the period of April 1, 2000 through June 30, 2000. The official mail allocations are available for franked mail costs, as stipulated in Public Law 106-57, the Legislative Branch Appropriations Act of 2000. 
   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to print the frank mail allocations in the RECORD.

   Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Kentucky National Forest Land Transfer Act of 2000. The purpose of this legislation is to provide an equitable solution to a problem that exists in Kentucky--specifically, to allow the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) to donate mineral rights, which it owns, to the Forest Service in exchange for compensation through the sale of other mineral rights in the Federal land inventory. 
   Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to give my colleagues some background on this issue and why this is necessary. During the 1960's, TVA purchased coal mineral rights on land that was later designated as the Daniel Boone National Forest. Today, TVA owns 40,000 acres of mineral rights under the forest. 
   This past July, TVA announced that it no longer had a need for these extensive mineral rights, and announced that after a 15-day comment period, it intended to auction the rights to a coal operator to mine the land. In TVA's view, this was a way to get much needed funds to pay down the $26 billion debt which they have amassed over the years. Since TVA originally had purchased the land with ratepayer funds, they were unwilling simply to donate the land, and consequently defended their proposal to auction off their rights to a coal operator by arguing that they currently have the ability to mine the land since they owned the mineral rights before the forest was created.

   Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, it is an honor to rise today in support of H.R. 4444, a bill granting permanent normal trade relations to China. While there is considerable and legitimate debate on this measure, for this Senator it is a simple choice. 
   At its base, this is a common sense issue--does the United States want its businesses, its farmers, its manufacturers to have the same advantages that every other member of the Word Trade Organization will enjoy? Or, because of our desire to score political points, do we wish to shut out American interests and bar them from beneficial interaction with this enormous market? 
   As has been pointed out several times during the course of this debate, China already has full access to American markets. However, U.S. businesses do not have reciprocal access to Chinese markets. It's a one way street. A vote against H.R. 4444 would serve not to punish China for behavior we find distasteful but, rather, would forbid American industry and farmers from taking advantage of the agreements our Government worked for 13 years to secure. Let me repeat that. 
   Defeating PNTR would in no way force China to alter its behavior, it would however single out U.S. interests as ineligible from benefitting from hard-won concessions. That is an unacceptable alternative. 
   We all agree that our relationship with China is complex and evolving. The United States must remain strong and active in its pursuit of increased security and improved human rights in China. But, we will not be able to accomplish any of our goals if we decide to erect our own Great Wall, and refuse to interact with the Chinese people. Rather, by taking advantage of hard-won access we will be able to export not only American products, but, perhaps more importantly, American ideas and ideals. 
   The approach of merely wielding the stick has not proven effective and, therefore, it is time to engage with China on a different level. A level that will allow us new opportunities to improve not merely the bottom-line of American farmers and entrepreneurs, but the rights and freedoms of the Chinese citizens as well. In the end, I believe strongly that this will be the enduring legacy of this new relationship. 
   In all honesty, I do not enter this debate armed solely with high-minded objectives for improved relations and greater freedoms for the Chinese. No, I am blessed to be a U.S. Senator solely because the citizens of Kentucky have allowed me to hold this office, and, thus, I confess that it is also for parochial reasons that I am enthusiastic about our improving trade relationship with China. 
   Kentucky is home to more than 125,000 jobs that are supported by exports. That number has increased by 15,000 since the implementation of the North American Free Trade Agreement. I might add as an aside, Mr. President, that during debate of that historic agreement we heard many of the same sky-is-falling arguments which are being used during this debate. Well, they were wrong then, and they are wrong today. 
   Those 125,000 Kentucky workers were responsible for more than $9.6 billion in exported goods in 1999, a figure that has grown by $6 billion since 1993. 
   Yet, despite those impressive statistics, there is incredible room for growth in Kentucky's export economy. The latest available statistics show that Kentucky exported a mere $69 million worth of goods and services to China in 1999. By way of contrast, Kentucky export totals were more than $336 million to the Netherlands, $295 million to Belgium and $137 million to Honduras. It is astonishing that three countries whose total population is just over 30 million purchase more than 11 times the amount of goods from Kentucky than do China's 1.3 billion citizens. In short, a country with 124 times the population of Belgium should not be purchasing $200 million less in Kentucky products. Clearly, the United States must aggressively alter our relationship with China in order to reverse this perverse trend, and that is exactly what we propose to accomplish. 
   Kentuckians are calling for these changes and they have been outspoken in their support and clear in their understanding of what is at stake. I want to share with the Senate some of the persuasive arguments they have offered in support of action I hope we will shortly take. 
   I have heard from countless Kentuckians describing how normalizing our trade relations with China will improve their businesses. I heard from folks like Alan Dumbris. Alan is the plant manager of PPG Industries which manufactures coatings, glass chemicals and  fiber glass products. Here is how he framed the debate:  
   Here at the Berea, Kentucky facility, 140 associates work together to satisfy our customers while contributing over $6 million to the local economy. We believe that PNTR is good for PPG and good for our facility....... Without PNTR, PPG Industry's competitors will have preferential access to Chinese markets.  
   It is clear to me that Alan Dumbris understands this issue, and he's right on the mark. He sums it up clearly and concisely; if we refuse to grant PNTR to China, Americans will be forced to operate at a severe disadvantage from their international competitors. That is common sense, and that is why Alan agrees that we should send this bill to the President. 
   I also heard from Ronald D. Smith, President of Gamco Products Company in Henderson, KY. Gamco employs nearly 400 people in Henderson which is a small town on the banks of the Ohio River in western Kentucky. The employees at Gamco produce zinc die casting, which is used on faucets and other products. Here is how Ronald Smith of Henderson stated his support:  
   U.S. manufacturers, like us, deserve a fair chance at securing a portion of this business. The current business structures impede our success. China's accession to the WTO would have very positive benefits to our organization in the years ahead.  
   Again, I say that Kentuckians understand the issue clearly. What is at stake here is fundamental fairness and opportunity for Kentucky and American businesses. 
   But it is not merely manufacturers that contacted me with their unequivocal support for PNTR. The agriculture sector has been consistently enthusiastic in calling for improved access to Chinese markets for their products. And, as anyone who has followed the difficulties our farmers have faced over the last several years knows, the 
   clearest opportunity for improving agriculture's bottom-line lies in expanding our exports. 
   Here, I would like to quote another Kentuckian. Steve Bolinger is the President of the Christian County Farm Bureau Federation, and he hits the nail on the head when he states:  
   This could be an excellent opportunity for Christian County considering we raise over 17,000 head of beef cattle. These farmers will surely benefit from the trade agreement as China has agreed to cut tariff rates from 45 to 25 percent on chilled beef....... Granting PNTR for China will not just benefit farmers in Christian County, it will benefit all of America and China.  
   I cannot improve on Steve's assessment. 
   There is a final, but vitally important issue relating to U.S.-China trade that I would like to take a few minutes to discuss. Kentucky's tobacco farmers are in desperate need of new markets for their product. I think its clear that China provides such a market--in fact, one might say there are 1.3 billion reasons for this Kentucky Senator to support PNTR. This potential market is music to the ears of my farming families who have been caught in the crosshairs of an unprecedented legal and political assault for the past seven years. 
   The importance of tobacco to Kentucky's economy cannot be overstated. I have been on this floor defending my tobacco farmers every year since I first came to the Senate 16 years ago. And, let me tell you, I long for those times when tobacco was not the pariah it has been shaped into over the past few years by an Administration bound and determined to put these farmers out of business. 
   And, as we all know, there is a lot of debate about the legacy of President Clinton and Vice President Gore. But, I think it is clear that their national war on tobacco has achieved devastating results. Just ask my tobacco farmers in Kentucky. In fact, for the very first time tobacco will not be Kentucky's largest agricultural money maker. 
   The past 7 years have been devastating to Kentucky's tobacco economy and farm families. The cold political calculations which went into demonizing tobacco during the previous Presidential campaign made clear that this Administration was not interested in what might happen to the impacted farmers. As a result of their efforts, quota has been cut so much that Kentucky's farm families are only growing one-third of what they produced just three years ago. This translates into real loss of income--not just low prices that will bounce back--quota cuts mean many Kentucky farmers won't be able to pay their bills. 
   That's why you saw me down here in 1999 and again this year, fighting to make sure tobacco farmers were, for the first time in history, included in our most recent agriculture economic assistance packages. Tobacco farmers are just farmers--it's not their fault that this Administration decided that they were politically dispensable and that their crop was now politically incorrect. Thanks to the Clinton-Gore Administration and their trial lawyer friends, 15,000 Kentucky tobacco farmers are now out of business. Again, that has had a real impact on Kentucky's rural communities. No money to buy tractors. No money to buy fertilizer. No money to buy seed. And even more devastating, in many cases, no money to pay the rent or buy the food or put shoes on a child's feet for school. Yet, despite this harsh reality, during the past seven years there has not been one request in any of the Clinton/Gore budgets for one dime to aid tobacco farmers. Regardless of one's opinion on tobacco, that fact is disgraceful. 
   But Kentuckians are optimistic by nature, and we haven't lost hope. We are looking for ways to move forward. We're looking east--we're looking Far East. China is one market that has the potential to buy our crop--and lots of it. And I'm doing all I can to get that market open and keep it open. 
   On June 6th of this year I met with Chinese Ambassador Li, and we discussed PNTR and the possibility of selling American tobacco, particularly Kentucky burley tobacco, to China. We are working through tough issues and the Chinese have now agreed to buy American tobacco. Through my relationship with Ambassador Li, I was able to arrange a meeting on June 16 between the Chinese Trade Minister/Counselor here in Washington, D.C. and representatives of the Burley Tobacco Grower's Cooperative Association, the Council for Burley Tobacco, the Kentucky Farm Bureau Federation and my staff. 
   I have encouraged the Burley Tobacco Growers Cooperative and the other Kentucky representative tobacco organizations to strongly pursue the Chinese market by meeting with representatives of China's tobacco interests. In fact, earlier this month, I joined the Burley Tobacco Grower's Cooperative and Kentucky's Farm Bureau in a meeting with members of China's Inspection and Quarantine Office who were in Kentucky to look over our tobacco crop. 
   Finally, I intend to help our Burley Tobacco Growers Cooperative arrange a trip to China for later this year. I plan to arrange meetings with government officials and tobacco buyers in China to establish the business relationships necessary for us to sell our product to China down the road. 
   Mr. President, if I might, I would like to quote one more Kentuckian. Donald Mitchell is a 38-year old, lifelong tobacco farmer from Midway, Kentucky whose family has been in the tobacco business for generations. He accurately sums up the potential of the Chinese market when he says:  
   I think voting for PNTR for China is an excellent chance to market our burley tobacco to the world's largest tobacco consumer. And, today we need every opportunity--and this is a major one.  
   Is Donald Mitchell suggesting that exporting tobacco to China is a guaranteed solution for Kentucky's farmers? No. But, he is correct in recognizing that this is an incredibly important first step. And I predict that once the Chinese get a shot at American tobacco, they are going to want more. This is the best new market in the world, and we're going to be in this for the long haul. We must work each year, first to begin, and then to increase, our sales there. 
   So, Mr. President, I close where I began. I recognize that there is room for legitimate debate on the subject of granting China Permanent Normal Trading Relations--but to this Senator--the issue is clear. I am going to support passage of this measure, because I am convinced it will provide Americans a level playing field that they have not yet enjoyed. Further, I am going to do everything in my power to take advantage of this improved relationship to assist Kentucky's tobacco farmers as they work to gain access to China's market.

    Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Mike and Joanne Duncan of Inez, Kentucky, for the successful internship program they continue to run for students in eastern Kentucky. 
   Mike and his wife Joanne founded an innovative summer-internship program in 1977 with the hope of encouraging young people to continue to work and live in their home state after college. To date, more than 100 people have participated in Mike and Joanne's program and have had the opportunity to intern at local businesses or participate in other leadership-building projects around the community. This program has given students a place to exchange ideas with each other and community professionals to help them prepare for their career. It is through experiences such as these that Mike and Joanne have helped to show interns that they can make a difference in their corner of the world. The program the Duncan's have created gives students an opportunity to see first-hand what the real, working world is like in their hometown and often results in the students' desire to return home after college to share their talents and skills with the community of their youth. 
   Mike and Joanne's work is known and appreciated throughout eastern Kentucky, and throughout the nation. In 1996, Mike was called the ``Mentor to Eastern Kentucky,'' by the Journal of the Appalachian Regional Commission. Also, the Los Angeles Times once described the internship program as being ``more akin to adoption.'' The impact of the Duncan's work reaches across county and state lines, and is surely an example for similar programs across the United States. 
   Mike and Joanne display an unswerving commitment to the people of Kentucky and possess the gratitude and respect of many. Their dedication to helping young Kentuckians succeed through countless hours of counseling and tutoring over the last 23 years is indeed admirable. 
   Congratulations, Mike and Joanne, on your tremendous success, and thank you for your many generous years of service to eastern Kentucky's youth. On behalf of myself and my colleagues in the United States Senate, thank you for giving so much of yourself for so many others.

   Mr. McCONNELL. As chairman of the Senate Rules Committee, which has jurisdiction over the campaign finance issue, and one who has been rather closely identified with the spirited debate in this arena over the past decade, I wholeheartedly support putting S. 1816, the Hagel-Kerrey bill, on the Senate Calendar. 
   That is not to say I would vote ``aye'' were there a rollcall vote on the bill as it is currently drafted. 
   Senator HAGEL's legislation was the backdrop for a comprehensive series of hearings held by the Senate Rules Committee between March and May of this year. The final hearing featured the testimony of Senator HAGEL, Senator KERREY, Senator ABRAHAM, Senator HUTCHISON, and Senator LANDRIEU. An impressive, to say the least, bipartisan lineup of Senators bravely stepping into the breach separating those who persist in trotting out the old, blatantly unconstitutional campaign finance schemes of the past, from others like myself who firmly believe that the first amendment is America's greatest political reform and must not be sacrificed to appease a self-interested editorial board at the New York Times. 
   The Senator from Nebraska has taken what for the past couple of years has been the biggest bone of contention in the campaign finance fight in the Senate--party soft money--and essentially split the difference between the opposing camps. Rather than an unconstitutional and destructive provision to entirely prohibit non-federal activity by the national political parties, Senator HAGEL has crafted a middle ground in which the party so-called ``soft'' money contributions would be capped. Yet, even a cap raises serious constitutional questions and would surely be challenged were one to be enacted into law. Nevertheless, the Hagel-Kerrey approach is more defensible and practicable than outright prohibition. 
   Coupled with the party soft money cap in the Hagel-Kerrey bill is an ameliorative and common sense provision to update the hard-money side of the equation by simply adjusting the myriad hard money limits to reflect a quarter-century of inflation. An inflation adjustment of the hard money limits is twenty-five years overdue. Candidates, especially political outsiders who are challenging entrenched incumbents, are put at a huge disadvantage by hard money limits frozen in the 1970s. 
   The lower the hard money limits are, the more that insiders with large contributor lists are advantaged. Incumbents and celebrities who benefit from the outset of a race with high name recognition among the electorate also start way ahead of the unknown challenger. The greatest beneficiary of low hard money limits are the millionaire and billionaire candidates who do not have to raise a dime for their campaigns because they can mortgage the family mansion, cash out part of their stock portfolio and write a personal check for the entire cost of a campaign. 
   As hard money limits are eroded through inflation and non-wealthy candidates are further hampered, election outcomes are ever more likely to be determined by outside groups whose independent expenditures and issue advocacy are completely unlimited. That is ``non-party soft money.'' 
   Mr. President, absent from the attacks on party soft money is any acknowledgement by reformers that the proliferation is linked to antiquated hard money limits which control how much the parties can take from individuals and PACs to pay for federal election activities. It stands to reason that hard money limits frozen in 1974 and thereby doomed to antiquity are going to spawn an explosion of activity on the soft money side of the party ledger. 
   It also is not coincidence that increased soft money activity in the past decade corresponded to vastly increased competition in the political arena. We are amidst the third fierce battle for control of the White House in the past decade And every two years America has witnessed extremely spirited contests over control of the Congress. Democrats who had been exiled from the White House since Jimmy Carter's administration at long last got to spend some quality time at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue and are not keen to give that up. Republicans, after four decades in the minority, got to savor the view from the Speaker's office in the House of Representatives and would like very much to keep it. And we have seen more than a little action on the Senate-side of the Capitol. 
   Reformers look upon all this activity over the past decade in abject horror, seeing only dollar signs and venal ``special interests.'' I survey the same era and see an extraordinary period in which every election cycle featured a tremendous and beneficial national war of ideas over the best course for our nation to pursue in the coming years and which party could best lead America on that path. 
   All signs, Mr. President, of a competitive, healthy, and vibrant democracy. 
   While I strongly support the hard money adjustments in the Hagel-Kerrey bill, I remain concerned by the bill's silence in an area sorely in need of reform: Big Labor soft money. The siphoning off of compulsory dues from union members for political activity with which many of them do not agree is a form of tyranny which must not be permitted to continue. Senate Republicans have fought hard, and unsuccessfully, to protect union workers from this abuse. Democrats are understandably and predictably loathe to risk any diminution of Big Labor's contributions which may result from freeing the rank-and-file union members from forced support of Democratic candidates and causes, but the absence of reform in this area is unacceptable. Big Labor soft money and involuntary political contributions must be part of any comprehensive reform package which ultimately passes Congress. 
   With those provisos and a few others, I will close by again commending the Senator from Nebraska from his willingness to wade in a big way into one of the most contentious issues before Congress--an issue in which all Members of Congress have a vested personal interest but that affects not just us but every American citizen and group that aspires to participate in the political process. That is why the U.S. Supreme Court will be the final arbiter of any campaign finance bill of consequence. And those are the reasons we should continue to be cautions and deliberative as the effort continues for a nonpartisan, constitutional campaign reform package.

    Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to honor my good friend and fellow Kentuckian, Bill Young, in recognition of his service and dedication to the state of Kentucky. As Bill steps down from a few of his many leadership positions, I pay tribute to him for his lifelong commitment to this region. 
   Born in Lexington, he has always focused on the state's higher education. Bill's many leadership positions, including Transylvania University Board of Trustees member and chairman of the board of Shakertown, have guided the growth and success of Kentucky. As he is known for his single-minded determination to help the future success of Kentuckians, he has left a legacy behind that would prove he is one of the state's greatest assets. 
   No opportunity has been missed by Bill to continue Kentucky's prosperity. Beginning with investments in peanut butter that is now better known as Jif, his business endeavors started successfully. With an interest in horses, he continued his success in the business world by becoming a prominent leader of thoroughbred racing. Over the years, he became a leading philanthropist by helping construct the YMCA located on Lexington's High Street, Shakertown, and the University of Kentucky's new William T. Young Library. He still continues other projects for the community that are significant and meaningful to him. 
   Kentucky would not be what it is today without Bill's leadership and guidance over the past years. Though Bill has stepped down for others to guide the future, Kentucky will feel the effects of his accomplishments for years to come. Thank you, Bill, for putting so much of yourself into this state to make it a better place for others. Your hard work and successes are admired, and they will continue to impact Kentucky for years to come. My colleagues join me in congratulating you on a job well done, and I wish you all the best for your future.

    Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to my friend and Phi Kappa Tau fraternity brother Ron Gist, as founder of Gist Piano Services, on the occasion of his success with his Louisville piano dealership. 
   After attending the University of Louisville, Ron started his piano dealership with only $1000 and two used pianos in 1971. Many years later, after persevering through a tornado in 1974, a devastating fire that nearly destroyed his business, and the hardship of an unfortunate economic downturn, Gist Piano Services has grown to become one of Louisville's most highly regarded piano dealerships, restorers, and consultants in the region. 
   As a natural salesman, Ron's success has led to profitable relationships with the Louisville Orchestra, Kentucky Center for the Arts, and Kentucky Fair & Exposition Center. Also, Ron is one of few in the country selected for the honor to represent Steinway pianos. Ron has also provided piano services to other prestigious performance venues and for popular entertainers like James Taylor and Carol King. 
   Ron should not only be congratulated for his success with Gist Piano Services, but he should be recognized for his service to the community. He has dedicated himself to making a difference in people's lives through music. By creating more avenues for young people to express themselves, like through playing the piano, children can learn how to imagine, create, and organize the power of music. These skills can later be used as key tools to succeed in the future as they enter adulthood. Thank you, Ron, for ensuring a better future for this state as the younger generations are better equipped to lead Kentucky. 
   Your hard work continues to display an unswerving commitment to the people of Kentucky and possesses the respect and gratitude of many in the community. The significant work which you and your wife Amanda have accomplished is appreciated by myself and the many others whose lives you have touched throughout your career. 
   Ron, thank you and best wishes for many more years of success. Know that your efforts to better the lives of those in the region will be felt for years to come. On behalf of myself and my colleagues in the United States Senate, thank you for giving so much of yourself for so many others in Louisville, the state of Kentucky, and the entire music industry.

    Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the directors and staff of Cardinal Hill Rehabilitation Hospital in recognition of providing physical rehabilitation services for the past fifty years to the people of Kentucky. 
   Cardinal Hill Hospital treats more than 6,000 patients every year from virtually every county in the state. The  Hospital, beginning as a convalescent home for children with polio, has now developed into a leading physical rehabilitation center for Lexington and its region. This anniversary not only reaches a significant milestone, but marks a time for recognition and celebration. 
   Dedicated to treating children and adults, some of Cardinal Hill's patients have been treated for catastrophic accidents or disabling diseases like multiple sclerosis, spina bifida, or cerebral palsy. Two of the more publicized patients would include Missy Jenkins, survivor of the Paducah Heath High School Shooting and Palmer Harston, of Lexington, 2000 National Easter Seals Child Representative, that have been given care and treatment by Cardinal Hill Hospital. Cardinal Hill has provided for patients who have dealt with all kinds of tragedies, whether small or large. 
   Cardinal Hill Rehabilitation Hospital continues to display an unswerving commitment to the people of Kentucky and possesses the respect and gratitude of many in the community. The significant work accomplished at this hospital promises a successful future for the citizens of this state as they can be ensured that disabilities will be continued to be treated at Cardinal Hill. 
   I am certain that the legacy of dedication that Cardinal Hill Rehabilitation Hospital has left will carry on. Congratulations to the directors and staff of Cardinal Hill on 50 years of service to Kentucky. Best wishes for many more years of commitment, and know that your efforts to better the lives of those in the region will be felt for years to come. On behalf of myself and my colleagues in the United States Senate, thank you for giving so much of yourself for so many others.

   Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, we celebrate today the life of our friend and colleague, PAUL COVERDELL. On behalf of my wife Elaine, who succeeded Paul in the job as director of the Peace Corps, and myself, I extend to Nancy and all of PAUL's friends our sincerest condolences. 
   I first met PAUL in 1988. I was traveling around the South during the Republican Presidential primaries. I was a supporter of then-Vice-President George Bush. I happened to find myself in Georgia, and ran into a State senator in Georgia named PAUL COVERDELL, who was also active in that campaign. PAUL, as he often did, made an immediate good impression. I recall the people in the Georgia meeting were all quite deferential to him. It was clear he had achieved a level of respect at that point in his career. Having served in the State senate in Georgia for 18 years, having been the leader of a rather small group of Republicans in that body, he had nevertheless achieved a level of respect at that point. 
   As we all know, Vice President Bush became President Bush, and the next time I met PAUL COVERDELL, he had been nominated to be director of the Peace Corps. As many Senators have said, he did an extraordinary job running that well-known agency. 
   Sometime in 1991, PAUL came into my office and said: I am thinking of running for the Senate. I am going to be running against an incumbent Democrat in the South. I know that is rather difficult to do. 
   We talked about the experience I had running against an incumbent Democrat in the South. We struck up the beginnings of a real friendship during which we talked off and on during his extraordinary quest for the Senate. 
   It was indeed an extraordinary quest. Because of the peculiarities of Georgia law, PAUL COVERDELL is surely in the Guinness Book of Records because he won four elections in 1 year. I am not certain what the law of Georgia is today. I think it is still the same with regard to primaries. In order to be the nominee of a party in Georgia, you have to get 50.1 percent of the vote. 
   PAUL had a very contested primary for the nomination. He did not get 50.1 percent of the votes, so he was in a runoff in order to achieve the nomination. So it took our good friend two elections to get the nomination. 
   Then Georgia had--I believe they have since changed this law--a requirement that in the general election, in order to become a U.S. Senator, you had to get 50.1 percent of the vote. 
   Election day came and went, and neither PAUL nor his opponent, the incumbent, had achieved 50.1 percent of the vote. So there was a runoff for the general election--a hotly contested, spirited contest--in which PAUL came out on top, I believe, in early December of 1992. 
   So he had won four elections in 1 year in order to find his way to this body. PAUL was indeed tested right from the beginning in his quest to become a Senator. 
   I remember in the early stages of that campaign, people did not take PAUL very seriously. As I watched his growth and development, almost from the beginning it seemed he was consistently underestimated. But in his extraordinarily effective and friendly manner, he managed to make himself a force in the Senate very quickly, to the point, as many have said already, that he was elected as one of our leaders in his first term. 
   One of his staffers lives in my neighborhood. I noticed on the back of the car the Coverdell bumper sticker, which says: ``Coverdell Works.'' There may have been another bumper sticker somewhere in America that said: ``Someone Works,'' but I can't think of a bumper sticker or, for that matter, a better way to sum up our friend and colleague PAUL COVERDELL than ``Coverdell Works.'' 
   He was ubiquitous. He was everywhere. As all of us who work in the Senate know, in order to make anything happen, you have to develop little groups to work in an area to try to advance the ball in the middle of these 100 substantial egos, each of which has its own goals and aspirations. PAUL was literally ubiquitous, all over the place, in a group here, in a group there, always advancing the cause. He did it in a friendly, effective, and intelligent manner. 
   No one is irreplaceable. The Senate continues to function. We are functioning today, although probably not very effectively. But if I have ever met somebody about whom I could say he was almost irreplaceable in the Senate, it was PAUL COVERDELL. 
   So it is with extraordinary sadness, not only personally but in terms of the loss in this institution, that we say goodbye to our good friend, PAUL COVERDELL. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, this debate has come a long way from the days of trying to regulate the speech of politicians and other major players on the American political scene. Just a few years ago, folks on the other side of the aisle were trying to get taxpayer funding for elections, spending limits for campaigns, and regulation of any group that mentioned a candidate in an ad two months before an election day. As recently as last year, there were measures being debated in the Senate that would have devastated the Republican Party in trying to compete with the Democrats and with well-funded outside groups who are almost wholly and completely affiliated with the Democrats--groups such as the labor unions, the plaintiffs' lawyers, the Sierra Club, and the League of Conservation Voters. 
   This particular bill before us will not put Republicans at a disadvantage in this fall election. And, of course, it will not put Democrats at any disadvantage because it doesn't affect their political affiliates, the unions and the trial lawyers. In fact, it's hard to tell exactly who will be put at a disadvantage by this bill because there are so few groups that will actually be impacted. So, in many respects, it is a relatively benign and harmless bill. 
   But, let me be clear, there is an important constitutional principle at stake here--even though it may only affect a handful of groups in this country. This bill takes us down the constitutionally dubious path of disclosure related to issue advocacy, which the Supreme Court has said, falls outside of the boundaries of government regulation. In fact, the federal courts following Buckley v. Valeo have routinely struck down attempts to regulate speech that does not expressly advocate the election or defeat of a federal candidate. Just two weeks ago, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals struck down the latest attempt to regulate issue advocacy as a clear violation of the First Amendment. Nevertheless, I say to my Republican colleagues, particularly those who are up for election this year, that is a pretty hard argument to explain in a political campaign. The constitutional distinction between issue advocacy and express advocacy is complex and does not get reduced to a campaign commercial very easily. 
   So in light of the limited impact of this relatively benign bill, I recommend to my Republican colleagues that they vote for this bill. I will not be voting for it because I do think the constitutional law in this area is rather clear. But, ultimately, this is not a spear worth falling on 4 months in advance of an election. This vote will insulate them against absurd charges that they are in favor of secret campaign contributions or Chinese money or mafia money. 
   With regard to the few groups who may be in the 527 area, they will have a choice to make, either to no longer be organized under section 527 or to go to court. And, these groups will have to weigh the costs and make that choice. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

    Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to my good friend and philanthropist, R. Gene Smith. 
   I have had the privilege of knowing Gene for many years, and have always been able to witness his compassion for others on numerous occasions. Gene has a kind heart and a giving spirit, and constantly thinks of ways to help those less fortunate than himself. Eight years ago, he offered another of his generous gifts to a fourth grade class in Louisville. In a spectacular show of kindness, Gene promised an all-expense paid college education to 58 students at Jefferson County's poorest school, Engelhard Elementary. The students' part of the deal entailed completing high school and gaining acceptance to a post-secondary college or university. As fourth graders, these children probably couldn't grasp the incredible opportunity they were offered then, but they certainly understand it now. 
   As Gene often does, he went the extra mile on his promise and committed to helping each of the 58 students graduate from high school. He created the R. Gene Smith Foundation to meet the academic, social, and emotional needs of each child. Over the students' eight-year journey to graduation, the Foundation served as a haven for the children and facilitated learning and personal growth opportunities. In spite of numerous obstacles, Gene and his students exceeded expectations and recently celebrated the graduation of 31 of the original 58 students. 
   Gene gave an amazing gift. Not only did Gene provided a free college education, but he provided each of the students and their parents with compassion, motivation, and peace of mind over the last eight years. He prevented 31 sets of parents from having to worry about whether they would have the money to pay for their child's education. He provided 31 students with hope for a bright and successful future. 
   Although this latest act of compassion is extraordinary, it is only one example of Gene's generosity. Gene chaired fund-raising efforts for Neighborhood House, a community center in a poverty-stricken area of Portland, Kentucky. He supports a preschool program for underprivileged children in Kentucky, called Jump Start. Additionally, he donated $1 million towards redevelopment of the Louisville waterfront. Gene also lends his support to such civic groups as the Speed Art Museum, the Cathedral Heritage Foundation, the University of Louisville Hospital Foundation, and Greater Louisville, Inc. 
   On behalf of myself and my colleagues in the United States Senate, I offer heartfelt thanks to Gene for his continuing commitment to helping others and a hearty congratulations to the 31 hardworking high school graduates.

    Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to introduce the Low-Income Widows Assistance Act of 2000. Since 1988, Congress has established several programs to help pay the out of pocket medical costs for low-income Medicare beneficiaries. These programs, commonly referred to as Medicare Buy-in or QMB, SLMB, and QI-1, operate as federal-state partnerships and are funded through state Medicaid programs. Depending on an eligible senior's income level, the programs could cover the cost of Medicare Part B premiums, doctor visits, deductibles, and co-payments. 
   Despite the availability of these programs, many seniors are not aware that they may be eligible to receive these additional benefits. According to a 1998 Families USA study, there are somewhere between 3.3 and 3.8 million seniors in America who are eligible to receive these benefits, but not currently receiving them. In my home state, the same study estimates that there are somewhere between 49,000 and 58,000 Kentucky seniors who may be eligible for one of these assistance programs but are not enrolled. While the actual task of enrolling eligible seniors  is left to the states, there are several important steps the federal government, through the Social Security Administration (SSA), can and should take. 
   A key component in improving participation in cost-sharing programs is the capacity of federal and state agencies to identify those individuals who experience a reduction in income after they have already enrolled in Social Security and Medicare. One group at particular risk of reduced income in their later years is widowed spouses. 
   For anyone who has lost a loved one, the experience is often overwhelming both mentally and emotionally. The loss of a spouse leaves many elderly with the difficult task of restructuring their lives in order to regain personal and financial stability. When SSA is informed that a married individual has died, the agency recalculates the benefit to determine the new benefit level. Frequently, the widowed spouse's benefit is lower than the amount the married couple received from Social Security. This sets up a circumstance in which a widow who was not previously eligible to receive QMB/SLMB benefits when she was married, would now be eligible to receive these benefits because her income has fallen. 
   In an effort to address this serious problem, I am today introducing the Low-Income Widows Assistance Act. This legislation directs Social Security to undertake outreach efforts designed to identify and notify individuals who may be eligible for these expanded benefits. It also addresses the unique challenges facing widowed spouses by requiring that when SSA recalculates the benefits for a recently widowed spouse and finds that he or she might be eligible for these assistance programs, the agency must: 
   One, notify the beneficiary that he or she may now be eligible for this additional assistance. 
   Two, notify the beneficiary's state that she may be eligible so that they can begin their own outreach efforts. 
   In order to help better understand how the Low-Income Widows Assistance Act would work in practical terms, I would like my colleagues to imagine the following scenario. Sally and Bob enjoyed 60 years of marriage, but just last fall, Bob suddenly passed away. Since Bob's death, Sally has been having a hard time making ends meet. She now has a lot of expenses to take care of on her own: making the house payment, buying food and clothes, and paying for doctors' visits and prescriptions--and not to mention the ``extras'' like birthday and Christmas presents for her many grandchildren. While her expenses remain essentially the same, Sally's Social Security survivors benefit is lower than what she and Bob were receiving. 
   Under the Low-Income Widows Assistance Act, when SSA recalculates Sally's benefit and finds that her monthly Social Security check has fallen below the $855 threshold for SLMB eligibility, the agency would be required to notify Sally that she may be eligible for SLMB benefits. SSA also would be required to notify Sally's state government that she may be eligible for these additional benefits. It is my hope that the states would then use this information to conduct their own outreach efforts to enroll Sally and others like her. 
   I look forward to working with my colleagues in the Senate, as well as Congressmen LEWIS and FLETCHER who are introducing similar legislation in the House, to help low-income widows by enacting the Low-Income Widows Assistance Act of 2000.

   Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, over the past two years, the Subcommittee has held hearings which have focused on corruption, fraud and financial management problems at the international financial institutions. The interest was stimulated in part by flagrant abuses which compromised the World Bank's program in Indonesia. The Bank's Country Director ignored internal reports detailing program kickbacks, skimming and fraud because he was unwilling to upset the Suharto family and their cronies whom he believed were responsible for Indonesia's economic boom. A change of government and country directors presented an opportunity to set a new course for management and lending policies. 
   Because of these problems, I asked GAO to conduct a review of the Bank's management with an emphasis on anti-corruption policies and programs in several of the largest borrowing countries, including Indonesia, Russia, and Brazil. While the Bank limited GAO's access to documents, and set up a special committee to supervise their work, they still did an excellent job. 
   In brief, the GAO concluded the Bank has launched an ambitious effort to identify problems, but significant challenges lie ahead. We are a long way from real solutions. 
   Let me tick off some of the conclusions which concerned me the most-- 
   First, although the World Bank has established an Investigations Unit which answers to a new Fraud and Oversight Committee, many local problems in borrowing countries never reach the investigators. In one country where the Bank itself identified corruption as a serious problem, 30 allegations of abuse reported to their local officials had not been referred on to the Investigations Unit or Committee. 
   Second, both the Investigations Unit and the Committee answer to one of the Bank's Managing Directors. GAO concluded that the independence of investigations could be compromised by the fact that a Managing Director controls the unit's budgets and makes final decisions on whether an investigation is pursued, including those that may involve employees who answer to the Director. 
   Third, new initiatives introduced in 1998 to improve financial and procurement procedures only apply to 14% of the Banks 1,500 projects. In recent audits, 17 of 25 borrowers showed a lack of understanding or noncompliance with procurement rules. GAO's review of 12 randomly selected projects identified 5 projects where the borrowing countries implementing agencies had little or no experience managing projects. 
   Fourth, when making project recommendations for Board approval, the staff's risk analysis fails to adequately address corruption or undue political influence as key factors. Eight of Twelve projects reviewed did not identify corruption or political manipulation as a critical risk even though other Bank reports indicated both were serious issues in the countries included in the project sampling. 
   Finally, GAO determined that solving problems is made more difficult because audits are often late and of poor quality, and the Bank does not evaluate the quality of audits. 
   To remedy these problems, GAO recommends the Bank integrate the investigative function and establish its organizational independence, include more complete corruption data in risk assessments and country strategies, develop a system for allocating anti-corruption assistance, improve borrowing countries' capabilities to monitor, implement and supervise fraud free projects, and improve auditing and project supervision. 
   These problems are not unique to the World Bank. We have all read the stories about the IMF being caught by surprise in both Russia and Ukraine regarding manipulation of loans and loan data. I am sure there are similar problems in the regional institutions as well. 
   To accelerate a solution to these pressing issues, Senator LEAHY and I felt it was prudent for the Secretary of the Treasury to encourage these institutions to implement GAO's recommendations. The amendment before the Senate requires the Secretary to withhold 10% of our contribution to each institution until audits are in place, independent investigation units are established, and the problem of corruption is being addressed in risk assessments. We also expect the institutions to strengthen local government capacity so that lending and projects are better supervised to prevent corruption. 
   This amendment addresses one of the most fundamental issues which has compromised support for the multilateral banks. Bringing more transparency to lending and improving procurement and management procedures will help restore confidence and support to the banks.

   Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, this is a two front war--we need to advance on both fronts. Clearly, we can't continue the administration's pattern of ignoring this crisis. 
   I agree that we should increase education, prevention, and treatment efforts, as well as local law enforcement efforts. But, will that effort pay off, if we do so at the expense of attacking the source country problem? 
   It is pretty clear that after seven years of doing nothing, the administration is trying to play catch up in this crisis. 
   If we look at trends and commitments, during the Reagan Just-Say-No years, drug production and use plummeted. 
   This trend sharply reversed in 1992 which was exactly when Clinton was asked, ``If you had to do it over again, would you have inhaled?'' He answered, ``Sure, if I could have.'' 
   Since 1992, and this unfortunate remark, drug use has soared and production has tripled. 
   We need to attack both fronts in this war--here, at home, and abroad. 
   I think we have recommended a good balance for the battle abroad. 
   Let me remind everyone it is a very different package than the request made by the administration--I have much more confidence in the bill before the Senate than I did in the request. 
   The most important difference is our emphasis on a regional strategy. Just as we saw production spike in Colombia when pressure was applied to traffickers in Peru and Bolivia, I believe we would see the problem shift back to Peru, Bolivia, and to Ecuador if we don't increase our regional support. 
   Without compromising vital support for Colombia, we provided $205 million in support to Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, and other nations in the region. This more than doubles the administration's request of $76 million. 
   A second key difference between the bill and the request is the support we offer for human rights programs. As the tempo of operations against the traffickers pick up, I am concerned that abuses will also increase. 
   Colombia's judicial system is weak and court officials are regularly threatened making investigations and prosecutions extremely difficult. Moreover, the military has undermined attempts by civilian courts to prosecute officers accused of human rights abuses even though Colombian law requires the transfer of these cases to civilian courts. 
   To address these concerns we have required certification that the military is complying with their own laws and are cooperating in the pursuit of these cases in civilian court. We also substantially increase aid to government and non-government organizations involved in the protection of human rights. 
   We paid for these increases by changing the helicopter package. 
   Again, let me say, striking the right balance is the key to our success. 
   This bill strikes the right balance between domestic and international law enforcement--the right balance between Colombia and the other countries in the region--and the right balance between our support for Colombian law enforcement and Colombian human rights advocate.

   Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, we received a request April 21 to allow fiscal year 2001 outlays--not budget authority--to be disbursed early into a Federal Reserve account. We have never structured accounts around outlays before, so we are looking at the scoring implications as well as what this will provide to Egypt in security assistance. 
   I am not prepared to write a blank check to any government. It is possible that this request could generate an additional $35 to $40 million for the Egyptians to spend on military equipment. 
   I would like to know what they plan to spend these resources on and no one can tell me. I think we need to be better informed before signing off on this approach. 
   Another problem with the proposal concerns actual control of the resources. The reason there are no scoring consideration is the entire amount is deemed obligated to Egypt once the funds are transferred into this account. That means the Egyptians could default or cancel a contract with an American company and we would have very little recourse because the money is already in their account. We must be sure that we will continue to have transparency and ongoing U.S. management of these resources, both the funds put into the account and the interest generated by the account. 
   Let me add, separate and apart form concerns about the actual account structure, I am not sure we should be increasing U.S. security assistance to Egypt. A short while ago, President Mubarak paid a visit to Lebanon and issued a statement of support for  Hezbollah's terrorist war against Israel. At this delicate juncture with rising concern about cross border violence against Israel, Mr. Mubarek's comments were and are extremely damaging to peace and stability, to say nothing of safety of Israeli civilians. I am not sure what signal it sends to increase military aid after such unfortunate remarks. After all, the aid is provided in recognition of Egypt's service to the peace process established at Camp David--the President's comments undermined those very principles and prospects. 
   In the State Department briefing justifying the request, U.S. 
   officials urged our support because of Mubarek's need to address the requirements of ``his key constituents, the military.'' Frankly, I think Mr. Mubarek needs to worry less about satisfying the military and spend more time and effort shoring up democratic institutions and civic society. 
   Once again this year he demonstrated a heavy handed political style be extending for three more years the State of Emergency which grants him far reaching powers. He has granted and maintained this sweeping authority for nineteen years. Press censorship and restrictions on political parties and activities are among many authoritarian measures which are routinely enforced in Egypt--not characteristics of the most open democracy. 
   In spite of my concerns about the trends in Egypt, I am prepared to consider this request fully and carefully in consultation with the chairman and others who I know are interested and expect we will have a recommendation by the time we get to conference.

We had a vote a few moments ago to reduce the Colombian drug war money by $225 million. That was defeated 89-11. Now my colleague from Washington would take it all the way down to a mere $100 million for this effort. He would be the first one to agree that, in effect, eliminates this effort. I think that is a mistake. 
   I will make the motion to table the Gorton amendment which I would like to schedule for 4 p.m., if that is agreeable with Senator GORTON.

   Mr. McCONNELL. At the outset, neither of these helicopters were made in the Commonwealth of Kentucky. My good friend from Connecticut has done, as usual, a very effective job of representing his position. Were I the Senator from Connecticut, I am confident I would be making a very similar speech. Even though the amendment of the Senator from Connecticut doesn't specify the 
   particular kind of helicopter, as a practical matter, if you leave that decision entirely to the Pentagon, I think the Senator would agree that they are likely to prefer the Blackhawk. 
   Let me just point out to my colleagues why the committee made the decision that it did. First, this is primarily a cost decision. While we didn't want to compromise on safety or capability, we had to consider the fact that over the next several years of use, this subcommittee will have to provide financial support to maintain and operate whatever aircraft is selected to move Colombian troops. Mr. President, this is not a one-time procurement decision. We will be dealing with this in future years. According to the Defense Security Cooperation Agency, the Blackhawks will cost about $12 million each and then at least $1,200 an hour to operate. Counternarcotics aircraft are expected to average 25 hours of flying time a month year-round. To cover these costs, the administration has requested $388 million to procure, maintain, and operate the 30 Blackhawks. 
   In comparison, the Huey II will cost $1.8 million to refurbish, and then roughly $500 an hour for fuel, spare parts, and other operational costs. 
   Frankly, the strongest argument the administration made for Blackhawks over Hueys was that the former had twice the troop-carrying capability, as Senator DODD pointed out. While the Huey manufacturer challenged this argument, I decided it was better safe than sorry. So to address the issue, we doubled the number of aircraft we are funding to 60. Even doubling the number of helicopters, the cost of the Huey program stays under $120 million. 
   Supporters of the Huey have also argued that they can be made available sooner than the delivery schedule of the end of the year for the Blackhawk. Given the pilot shortages and the time it will take to ``train up'' either Blackhawk or Huey pilots, I don't see this aspect as particularly decisive. 
   I think we have assured the Colombians that they can successfully achieve their mission by taking the approach we recommended in the bill. 
   I think we have assured the Colombians that they can successfully achieve their mission at a lower cost, not only now but, very importantly, to the budget here in the United States, and lower it in the future for the United States. 
   With the savings we achieved by taking the approach we recommended in the bill, we have been able to increase the regional support for the Colombian police, increase support for human rights programs, and sustain requested levels for equipment, training, and related support for counternarcotics battalions. 
   Senator DODD's chart points out the precise reason we chose to fund 60 Huey IIs rather than 30 Blackhawks. His chart points out that the cost to operate the Huey is $617 per hour compared with the Blackhawk cost of $1,675 per hour. 
   The foreign operations account has to pay for these operational costs this year, next year, and every year after that. Those are years in which we will probably not have $1 billion in emergency funds for Colombia. That means we will have to cut into other accounts to keep these helicopters flying in future years. Which accounts do we cut? Refugees, UNICEF, funds for Armenia, and Russia, demining, or health? What accounts will pay the price to fly Blackhawks in the future years when Hueys would do? 
   These are U.S. units, which do not have Blackhawks, which will have to wait while the production line produces Colombia's inventory. Given the short- and long-term costs, and given the impact on the availability for U.S. troops, the committee decided to provide twice the number of refurbished Hueys which will meet all the troop transport requirements in Colombia. 
   Those are the arguments for the approach the committee has chosen. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, there are United States units that don't have Blackhawks yet, that will have to wait while Blackhawks are produced to send to Colombia, which could 
   get by on Hueys. My good friend from Connecticut has made a good case for a home State product, the Blackhawk helicopter. The Blackhawk is not made in Kentucky. The Huey is not made in Kentucky. What I am concerned about, as chairman of this subcommittee, is two things: No. 1, the fact that even U.S. units don't have Blackhawks yet and will have to wait, as I just said, while these are sent to Colombia. And, No. 2 is the cost of operation. 
   We are not going to have $1 billion to spend on Colombia every year. This is a unique year in which we are debating whether to spend $1 billion on the drug war in Colombia--an unusual year. But the cost of operating these Blackhawks, if we go in that direction, is going to come back every year and that is $1,000 an hour more than operating the Huey--$1,000 an hour more than operating the Huey. 
   As the distinguished chairman of the Appropriations Committee just pointed out, and also the chairman of the Defense Subcommittee of the Appropriations Committee, the Huey will get the job done for a lower cost to the United States. The foreign operations account is going to have to pay for these operational costs, as I just pointed out, not just this year but the year after that and the year after that and the year after that. That means we will have to cut into other accounts to keep these helicopters flying. 
   That is the reason the subcommittee decided to go with the Huey because we think the Huey will get the job done at less cost this year, next year, and in years down the road, which is not to say I am sure the Colombians would not like to have Blackhawks; I am sure they would. All of our U.S. units that need them would like to have them, too, and they don't have them yet. So that is the reason for the recommendation of the subcommittee. 
   I hope when we subsequently vote on the Dodd amendment it will be defeated. Mr. President, with that, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, the issue is this. We do not have enough Blackhawks for our own troops, much less the Colombian troops. The Blackhawks are much more expensive, about $1,000 an hour more expensive to operate. The Huey II will get the job done. We ought to do that in the most efficient way, looking not only at this year's appropriation but down the road. We will have to pick up the operation and maintenance cost on the Blackhawk in subsequent years. The Huey II will do the job. 
   The Senator from Connecticut has done his usual articulate job of arguing for a home State interest. The Blackhawk is made in Connecticut. I would probably be making the same speech if I were from Connecticut. But the least expensive alternative is the Huey II. That is why the committee recommended what it did.

   Mr. McCONNELL. Thank you, Senator ABRAHAM. 
   I, like you, am dismayed to learn that the Administration has not offered any budgetary amounts for an aid package to Lebanon. You are absolutely right that the current events in Lebanon demand that we reexamine our foreign aid package to that country. 
   As such, I pledge to work with you every step of the way to see that a more comprehensive aid package to Lebanon is considered here in the Senate. I appreciate your suggested amount, and would like to work with you once all the elements for a successive aid package are assembled. This requires input by the Administration, and a plan as to what programs would be funded and which ones would receive priority funding. It is my hope that the Administration will consult with us as soon as possible regarding figures for an assistance package. However, until the Administration produces a comprehensive package, I will have to lay your amendment aside.

   Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, the pending bill provides $13.4 billion for foreign assistance programs. By comparison, last year the Senate voted 97-2 for a $12.6 billion bill and the President signed a $13.7 billion bill. Given the budget constraints, the fact that we are just below last year's final level is a tribute to Senator STEVENS' and Senator BYRD's adept management of allocations. 
   I think the bill strikes a good balance between meeting emerging requirements yet requiring accountability for the funds we make available. 
   In terms of meeting emerging global needs, we have invested $651 million in a new, global health initiative which will help ramp up immunizations and combat malaria, tuberculosis, polio, and AIDS. Senator LEAHY deserves special recognition for his efforts to establish this initiative with adequate funding. The committee's interest in health began several years ago when we earmarked $25 million for polio programs. The administration's initial howls of protest have been silenced since we are on the verge of wiping out the disease thanks largely to the public-private collaboration between the Rotary Club and international donors. 
   We have a unique opportunity, if not responsibility, to replicate the success of this public-private partnership in other health areas, given recent generous support for vaccination research and programs by pharmaceutical companies and the Gates Foundation. 
   The bill also increases funding for key countries in the Balkans struggling to accelerate economic and political reforms. The administration requested $195 million in a supplemental and $610 million for 2001. Instead of adding to emergency spending, the committee has increased the overall amount made available for fiscal year 2001 to $635 million rather than add to emergency spending. I do not think the region needs more money so much as it requires better management of American resources. With $635 million, I think we have more than adequately responded to the needs of the region. 
   Within this increase we were able to provide $89 million for Montenegro and $60 million for Croatia, which in each case combined the Supplemental and 2001 request. Our assistance to the government in Montenegro is a lifeline as they struggle to address mounting political and economic pressure applied by the regime in Belgrade. Within the last few weeks we have seen an escalation of political violence which can be traced to Belgrade including the assassination of a presidential bodyguard and an attack on a member of the political opposition. We need to be clear about U.S. support for the embattled Montenegrin Government. 
   Croatia's recent elections renew prospects for real reforms and real growth, which I expect our funding help encourage. I commend the new government for making serious commitments to allow for the return of refugees, suspend support for extremists in Bosnia, and press forward with political and  economic reforms. To give the new government some leverage, the bill includes those commitments as benchmarks for releasing our assistance. 
   As the Croatian provisions illustrate, this bill is not just about spending. It is fundamentally about accountability--we must have more confidence that the resources we commit will, in fact, achieve results. 
   U.S. resources cannot singlehandedly rebuild, rehabilitate, reform, or develop a nation, but we can assure that aid is effectively administered and we must guarantee our partners--including other donors, recipients, and nongovernment organizations--all share the burden and share our commitment to free market economics and democracy. 
   I think it is pretty clear in Kosovo we are off track. Last year, we earmarked $150 million for Kosovo with the requirement that our pledge would not exceed 15 percent of the total committed by 
   European and other donors. We also made clear we would not assume any responsibility for major infrastructure reconstruction. The initial affect of this conditionality was positive, and the Secretary of State was able to determine that other donors pledged enough to meet at least 85 percent of the resource requirements. Unfortunately, those pledges have been slow to materialize. Donor support for roads, clinics, schools, utilities, courts, and industry is imperceptible. 
   Instead of supporting an effort to build up Kosova, we are building up a U.N. bureaucracy--and a pretty incompetent one at that. UNMIK is like a huge Macy's Thanksgiving Day float--bloated and detached--drifting far above the crowd--fluttering in a confetti cloud of rulings, edicts, ordinances, and injunctions. 
   Few Kosovars I talk with can point to a single meaningful accomplishment. Instead, they suggest Serb rule has been supplanted by the United Nations--a more benign influence, perhaps, but every bit as indifferent and irrelevant to real Kosovar needs. 
   And, we are expected to pay the lion's share for this waste. For months, the committee has been besieged by requests to release funds because of urgent shortfalls and gaps other donors have failed to fill. 
   We are making the same mistake we made in Bosnia. And it isn't just the U.N.'s failure. Within weeks of setting up a mission, AID set off on a course to fund large-scale contracts with groups that had no local experience or no inclination to build up and to leave behind a strengthened local civic society. 
   To address these problems, the bill structures new conditions on our support for Kosovo. This year, we have modified language so that U.S. actual expenditures do not exceed 15 percent of the total actual expenditures by all donors. And, we require that 50 percent of all resources flow through local nongovernment organizations which know what they are doing and have the only, real prospect of making a difference at the community level. 
   Turning to Russia, the new Putin government is untested in many respects, but not in its ability to wage a ruthless war against civilians in Chechnya. After creating 440,000 refugees, Moscow not only is limiting access by international relief workers, they have stonewalled international attempts to allow investigations of alleged war crimes and atrocities. 
   The Clinton administration has made a bad situation worse. Not only did they refuse to vote in support the U.N. Human Rights Commissioner's call for an international investigation and tribunal, the Bureau of Refugees and the U.S. Embassy in Moscow have rejected requests to support the courageous relief workers operating in the region. The Department argues they don't want to encourage groups to enter unsafe areas. This is both disingenuous and unjust--these groups are already in Chechnya and Ingushetia desperate for contributions. What the administration refuses to admit is they simply don't want to challenge or upset the Russians. This is a dangerous, longstanding pattern which compromises our values and our interests. 
   Russia's war against the Chechen people makes me wonder what kind of democracy the administration has helped fund with more than $5 billion in assistance. 
   Over the years, and including administration veto threats, we have tried--and often failed--to establish benchmarks and conditions on U.S. aid to Russia. This year, we have conditioned further support to the Russian Government upon certification that the Putin government is allowing relief workers unimpeded access in Chechnya and Ingushetia. We also require certification that the Russian Government is fully cooperating with international investigations of war crimes and atrocities committed in Chechnya and relief efforts. Finally, of money made available 
   to Russia, we have earmarked $10 million for nongovernment organization relief operations in Chechnya and Ingushetia. 
   Turning to our hemisphere, after spending more than $2 billion in Haiti, most of us are frustrated by the fact that it remains the poorest country in the hemisphere with political assassinations and violence a staple of daily life. Only real political change holds out hope of producing stability and economic progress, so we have conditioned further assistance upon certification that the Preval government has allowed free and fair elections to proceed and that a parliament is seated on schedule this month. 
   That may prove difficult given yesterday's news. Apparently, according to the New York Times, Haiti's top election official fled the country, ``fearing for his life after he refused to approve results for last month's contested legislative and local elections.'' 
   Now, let me take a moment to describe the committee's treatment of the Colombia supplemental request. Our disposition of Plan Colombia differs from the request in four ways. 
   First, within the Foreign Operations area, the overall funding is lower. The administration requested $1,073,500,000. The Committee has appropriated $934,100,000. 
   Second, that lower funding level is primarily a result of providing a different helicopter package. The request was for 30 Blackhawks at a cost of $388 million. We have provided 60 Huey IIs at a cost of $118.5 million. These numbers include the first year's operating costs. 
   Third, with the savings in the helicopter package we were able to invest in a regional strategy and substantially increase aid to Bolivia, Ecuador, and Peru. I felt the administration's singular focus on Colombia guaranteed that the production and trafficking problem would simply be pushed across the border. The bill's regional emphasis on interdiction and development keeps Colombian traffickers from becoming a moving target. We more than doubled the regional request of $76 million and provided $205 million. 
   This level allowed us to fully fund Bolivia's request of $120 million for both alternative development and interdiction programs. With an impressive track record in eradication of coca and alternative development, Bolivia deserves our continued support as the government completes the task. The results in Bolivia are truly noteworthy, almost to the point of being astonishing. 
   Similarly, we nearly tripled the support for Ecuador while increasing aid to the Peruvian Government as well. 
   Fourth and finally, we added $50 million to the $93 million request for human rights monitoring. As the military pressure picks up, so will the likelihood of abuses, so we have expanded witness, prosecutor, and judicial protection programs as well as support to monitoring groups. We have also conditioned aid on the Secretary of State certifying that the Colombian military is in full compliance with their own laws requiring the prosecution of military officers in civilian courts for alleged human rights abuses. This should help end the pattern of allowing these cases to be dropped in military courts. 
   In addition to supplemental funds for Colombia, the administration also submitted a $193 million supplemental request for Mozambique, only $10 million dedicated to meeting immediate disaster needs. While there is no question the flooding in Mozambique was a disaster, the question the committee had to consider was whether the requested funds were for immediate urgent needs or long-term rehabilitation and reconstruction which should be addressed in the fiscal year 2001 regular spending bill. What we chose to provide in emergency spending will offer immediate relief on a one-time basis, rather than support the longer-term reconstruction and rehabilitation needs which can be  covered by the increase we provided in the 2001 development assistance. 
   Finally, the committee was asked to support a $210 million supplemental package for a contribution to the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative Trust Fund. The committee has provided an initial commitment of $75 million pending authorization legislation currently being considered by the Banking Committee. 
   With that, let me pass the baton to my friend and colleague, Senator LEAHY, with whom I have enjoyed working on this legislation each year during our time together, as either chairman or the ranking member. I express my gratitude to him for his friendship and the cooperative way in which we have proceeded every year.

   Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I say to my friend from Virginia, he is entirely correct. This is the wrong place for this amendment. But for those Senators who are not persuaded that the fact that this is the wrong place for this amendment is enough to vote against it, I think it is important to understand that this is a rather limited disclosure amendment. Among the groups that are not covered in the 527 amendment the Senator from Virginia and others have been discussing are groups such as the Sierra Club and the AFL-CIO.

   Mr. McCONNELL. I am, indeed. I am talking about the McCain amendment. The Senator from Virginia was making the point that even if it were otherwise a desirable thing to do, this is the wrong place to do it and runs the risk of having this bill blue-slipped in the House. 
   On the substance of the McCain issue, virtually everybody in the Senate is in favor of enhanced disclosure, greater disclosure. That is hardly a controversial subject. But to single out 527s only, I would say to my colleagues--to single out 527s only leaves out such groups as the Sierra Club and the AFL-CIO, which do not operate under section 527. 
   I have long believed we ought to have broad, comprehensive disclosure. I would be in favor of addressing this issue this year. But we ought to do it in a comprehensive way, I say to my friend from Virginia, not leave out some of the major players on the American political scene, many of whom are on the airwaves right now, beating up Republican candidates for the Senate. 
   From the more comprehensive approach, it is my understanding the Senator from Virginia may well have an alternative to offer that would give all of us an opportunity to go on record in favor of a more evenhanded, comprehensive, across-the-board disclosure provision that would not eliminate some of the principal players on the American political scene--ironically, most of whom are hostile to Republicans.

   Mr. McCONNELL. I say to my friend from Pennsylvania, if this bill passed, 527s that do only issue advocacy would have to publicly disclose their donors. But other tax-exempt groups that do exactly the same kinds of issue ads, such as 501(c)(4)s, such as the Sierra Club, and 501(c)(5)s, such as the AFL-CIO, would not have to publicly disclose their donors. 
   So the problem is, if the idea is to have comprehensive disclosure, we have left out a huge percentage of those who are involved in political activity. The two that I mentioned happen to almost always be in support of candidates on the other side of the aisle. It would also not include the American Trial Lawyers Association.  It would not include groups such as Public Citizen, and environmental groups. As I mentioned, organized labor, all of whom would be exempt. 
   As I understand, the point of the sense-of-the-Senate amendment of the distinguished chairman of the Armed Services Committee which would be offered, as I understand it, after a motion to table the McCain amendment is approved, would call for a comprehensive approach. The majority leader is going to address the issue of when to do that. It is my opinion--I know he will announce it is his opinion--we ought to do that this year in this session because disclosure is, as the Senator from Arizona has pointed out, an area where we have been largely in agreement. It is a question of making sure that this is the right kind of disclosure and not a kind of selected partial disclosure which happens to have the practical effect of leaving out, in my view, most of the major players who engage in issue advocacy in this country.

    Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the faculty, staff, and students at Lindsey Wilson College in Columbia, Kentucky. 
   First, I extend sincere thanks for the graciousness and hospitality shown during my visit to Lindsey Wilson College for the May 13, 2000 Commencement. It was an honor to address the faculty and graduating students at such a fine Kentucky institution, and I sincerely appreciate the opportunity. 
   Located on a southcentral Kentucky hilltop, Lindsey Wilson College is a four-year liberal arts college affiliated with the Kentucky Conference of the United Methodist Church. It began in 1903, as a training school for Vanderbilt University, then became a two-year college in 1923, and started offering a four-year degree program in 1986. Lindsey Wilson's diverse student body is comprised of individuals from 89 Kentucky counties, 23 states, and 26 foreign countries. 
   Since its four-year degree program began, enrollment has grown a whopping 160 percent and they have expanded to offer 16 undergraduate degree programs and two master's programs. Over the last 13 years, several new buildings have been constructed, the budget has more than doubled, assets now total $49 million, and Lindsey Wilson College's endowment is valued at more than $28 million. Congratulations on these tremendous accomplishments. 
   I would like to recognize President William T. Luckey and Chancellor John B. Begley. Students, faculty, and staff at Lindsey Wilson are all fortunate to have such committed individuals serving the mission of the school and facilitating its growth. 
   Another name that is important to Lindsey Wilson is Ruby McKinney Roach. Ms. Roach grew up in Adair County, Kentucky, and is a proud Lindsey Wilson College Alumnus of 1954. From Lindsey Wilson, she went to Berea College and earned a Bachelor of Arts in home economics and a Master of Education at Western Kentucky University. After a brief time teaching in Barren County, Ms. Roach went home to Adair County and served as a teacher and guidance counselor for 30 years. 
   According to the many people touched by her kindness and generosity, Ruby Roach became deeply involved in the lives of her students. As a home economics teacher, she had the opportunity to share her skills and knowledge with thousands of students over the years. As a guidance counselor, she had the unique experience of talking with students both about their educational and personal goals, and helped them develop a plan to accomplish those goals. 
   Ms. Roach has been an active member of the educational community outside her school as well, having held positions in the Kentucky Association of School Administrators, the Kentucky Counselors Association, the National Education Association, and Iota chapter of The Delta Kappa Gamma Society International, the honorary society of professional women educators. 
   Ruby Roach also served on numerous civic boards and organizations in the Adair community. She is a former member of the Columbia Women's Club and is an active member of Beulah Chapel. Ruby Roach has made her alma mater proud, and I commend her for what she has contributed to the College, the surrounding community, and to Kentucky. 
   In the same way, Lindsey Wilson College is an institution of which the Commonwealth of Kentucky can be proud. On behalf of myself and my colleagues in the Senate, congratulations Lindsey Wilson College, on your many achievements, and best wishes for continued success.

   Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the late Fred Capps and to offer condolences to his wife, Cathy, and their two young children, John and Lydia. 
   Commonwealth's Attorney Fred Capps lost his life fighting for the people he represented each day in the courtroom. Kentucky Senate President David Williams, a longtime friend of Mr. Capps, said it best: ``He died a hero, protecting his family. He was defending his home and his children, and he didn't go down easy.'' As a prosecutor for Adair, Casey, Cumberland and Monroe counties, Mr. Capps was devoted to bringing criminals to justice. He gave his time and energy to protect the victims who needed his help and, in the end, he gave his life for their sake as well. I have a tremendous amount of respect for the sacrifices Mr. Capps made, and I am deeply saddened that such a fine Kentuckian has been lost. 
   Since this tragedy occurred, people across the State of Kentucky have spoken out in fond remembrance of Mr. Capps. Many have spoken about his reputation as a skilled prosecutor, and about his genuine concern for finding justice for innocent victims. But Mr. Capps also is remembered for the many hours he served as a volunteer and coach for the Burkesville Little League, and for his example as a committed family man. He was a devoted husband and father, loyal friend, community leader, and gifted attorney. 
   At times such as this, I am reminded of the fragility of life and the importance of family. From all accounts, Mr. Capps understood and valued these things while he was alive and has left a legacy of excellence for his children to remember. Hopefully it will be a comfort to the family and friends Mr. Capps leaves behind to know that he was loved and admired by so many in his community and throughout the entire State. On behalf of myself and my colleagues, we offer our deepest condolences to his loved ones, and express our gratitude for all Mr. Capps contributed to the counties he served, the State of Kentucky, and to our great Nation.

    Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to express congratulations to all of the team members at the Toyota assembly plant in Georgetown, Kentucky, on being recognized by J.D. Power and Associates for the high quality of vehicles which they have produced. 
   It is my understanding that the Georgetown assembly plant is the only plant in North America to win this award this year. Moreover, I understand that all of the cars produced at the Georgetown plant have been ranked best in their category in this year's J.D. Power and Associates survey of the best cars and trucks. Not only is it an outstanding achievement to be chosen by J.D. Power--whose rankings are widely considered to be the industry standard for new car quality--to receive a Gold Plant Quality Award in recognition of outstanding vehicle quality, but to receive this honor for the fourth time in ten years is a truly remarkable accomplishment. I commend you and all of your hard work in earning this award. 
   News of the announcement by J.D. Power of the Georgetown plant's award follows closely on the announcement by Toyota that the company hit a milestone with a record-breaking production of 1 million vehicles in North America. A significant amount of the credit for this accomplishment, too, belongs to the hard-working folks at the Georgetown facility, and I want to congratulate you on this achievement, as well. 
   I am proud of the relationship between Toyota Motor Manufacturing and the Commonwealth of Kentucky. Since Kentucky made its original investment in Toyota in 1986, the state has realized a 36.8 percent annual rate of return, and has benefited greatly from the more than $5 billion which Toyota has invested statewide. Most of all, though, I am proud of the work being done by the Kentuckians who work at the Toyota plant. On behalf of myself and my colleagues in the United States Senate, congratulations again on your significant achievement.

    Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate students at my alma mater, duPont Manual High School, for their victory in the U.S. Department of Energy's National Science Bowl. 
   I am proud to share with my colleagues that a team of five students from duPont Manual High School in Louisville, Kentucky, are the champions of the 2000 National Science Bowl. These young scholars worked diligently to reach the competition and through their academic excellence and teamwork, prevailed at the end of a tough, four-day challenge held in Chevy Chase, Maryland. 
   First, and most importantly, I recognize the students on this year's Manual High School team and commend them for their hard work and determination: Mariah Cummins, Marty Mudd, Matthew Reece, Gabe Wood, and Yan Xuan. 
   I also applaud and thank their teacher, Skip Zwanzig, who taught these students and provided the leadership which brought them to this year's competition. 
   The National Science Bowl is a rigorous academic competition among teams of high school students. This year is the 10th anniversary of the program, which has brought more than 60,000 high school mathematics and science students from across the country together in competition since its inception in 1991. The program is designed to encourage students and their teachers to achieve educational excellence in science and math. Competing teams are quizzed on topics in biology, chemistry, physics, astronomy, earth science, computer science, and mathematics. 
   Congratulations, Manual High, on your win and thank you for continuing Louisville's and the State of Kentucky's tradition of excellence in education.

   Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the nomination of Professor Bradley A. Smith to fill the open Republican seat on the bipartisan Federal Election Commission. In considering the two FEC nominees, Professor Brad Smith and Commissioner Danny McDonald, the Senate must answer two fundamental questions: 
   Is each nominee experienced, principled and ethical? And, 
   Will the FEC continue to be a balanced, bipartisan commission? 
   I want to take a minute to rebut some of the myths that have been perpetuated by the reform groups over the past several months. 
   Myth No. 1: Professor Smith's First Amendment views are radical and disqualify him for government service at a bipartisan agency. 
   Over 30 renowned First Amendment and Election Law experts, including past members of the governing Board of Common Cause, urge Brad Smith's confirmation and attest to the validity of Brad Smith's actual views--that is distinguished from the views that have been attributed to him by his critics. 
   Moreover, these renowned scholars are indignant about the misrepresentation of Smith's scholarship. Let me share just a few examples: 
   First Amendment Scholar Michael McConnell of the University of Utah Law School writes:  
   [S]ome opponents of the nomination of Bradley A. Smith to the Federal Elections Commission are claiming his scholarly writings regarding the First Amendment and campaign finance laws are irresponsible or otherwise beyond the pale. This is simply partisan nonsense. *.*.* The merits of his nomination should not be clouded by charges of this sort, which have no scholarly validity.  
   Professor Daniel Kobil, a former governing Board Member of Common Cause in Ohio writes:  
   I believe that *.*.* [the] opposition is based not on what Brad has written or said about campaign finance regulations, but on crude caricatures of his ideas that have been circulated.  
   Even one of the scholars who support McCain-Feingold has written in support of Professor Smith's nomination. Professor Jamin Raskin, a signatory to the McCain-Feingold letter, writes:  
   The political reform community would actually be better off with Smith on the FEC. *.*.* Smith is no party hack, but a serious scholar who cares about political liberty. *.*.* He is a dream candidate *.*.* [who] should not be opposed by political reformers.  
   In fact, Smith's views on election law are shared by many fine scholars, like Kathleen Sullivan, the Dean of Stanford Law School, who praised Smith stating:  
   I do think Mr. Smith's views are in the mainstream of constitutional opinion. I like to think that I am enough in the mainstream of constitutional opinion that our agreement on many points would place us both there.  
   Let me paraphrase Dean Sullivan to rebut those who argue that appointing Brad Smith is like appointing a conscientious objector to be Secretary of Defense: appointing a First Amendment election law scholar to the FEC is, in fact, like appointing a seasoned U.S. Attorney who values the constitutional liberties of every American citizen.

   Mr. MCCONNELL. Would my colleagues on the other side vote to reject all of these individuals, including the Dean of Stanford Law School, who have questioned the wisdom and workability of our campaign finance laws and the proposed reforms? 
   Myth No. 2: Professor Smith fails to acknowledge the Supreme Court's recent decision in Shrink-Pac. 
   As for this assertion, I would direct my colleagues to pages 20, 31, 36 and 40 of the published Rules Committee hearing report from March 8 of this year. Professor Smith 
   clearly acknowledged the holding of the Shrink PAC decision, and, in particular explained:  
   Had I been on the Commission and the case had come forward under Federal law . . . I would have had no problem voting for [the] enforcement action . . . .  
   Of course, the reform groups won't tell you that the Supreme Court agreed with Smith's views and declared campaign finance laws unconstitutional in cases such as Colorado Republican, and McIntyre v. Ohio, and just last year in Buckley v. American Constitutional Law Foundation, or that, as Professor Nagle of Notre Dame Law School has written: Smith's ``understanding of the First Amendment has been adopted by courts in sustaining state campaign finance laws.'' 
   Myth No. 3: Professor Smith will not enforce the law. 
   The letter of Dan Lowenstein of UCLA Law School, a 6 year member of the national governing Board of Common Cause rebuts this myth. He writes:  
   [Smith] will understand that his job is to enforce the law, even when he does not agree with it. I doubt if anyone can credibly deny that [Smith] is an individual of high intelligence and energy and unquestioned integrity. When such an individual is nominated for the FEC, he or she should be enthusiastically and quickly confirmed by the Senate.  
   Let me address the Democrats' nominee, Commissioner Danny McDonald. 
   Commissioner McDonald and I are clearly in different campaign reform camps. If I follow the new litmus test that is being put forth by some in this confirmation debate, then I have no choice but to vigorously oppose his nomination. 
   I want to be clear that Danny McDonald is not my choice for the Federal Election Commission. I have serious questions about his 18-year track record at the FEC. McDonald's views and actions have been soundly rejected by the federal courts in dozens of cases. 
   Two of these cases even resulted in the U.S. Treasury paying fines because the action taken by McDonald and the FEC was ``not substantially justified in law or fact.'' And, just this month, the 10th Circuit struck down yet another FEC enforcement action as unconstitutional--finding, I might add, that reformer concerns of corruption were unsubstantiated. 
   I think Commissioner McDonald's voting record has displayed a disregard for the law, the courts and the Constitution. And, it has hurt the reputation of the Commission, chilled constitutionally protected political speech, and cost the taxpayers money. 
   Equally troubling, is the fact that Commissioner McDonald apparently chose to pursue the chairmanship of the Democratic National Committee while serving as a commissioner to the Federal Election Commission. 
   I must say that I have serious questions about whether an FEC Commissioner exhibits ``impartiality and good judgment'' when he seeks the highest position in his political party and simultaneously regulates that party and its candidates--and regulates the competitor party and its candidates. 
   All of that being said, I am prepared to reject this new litmus test whereby we ``Bork'' nominations to this bipartisan panel. I am prepared to follow the tradition of respecting the other party's choice and to support Commissioner McDonald's nomination--assuming that McDonald's party grants similar latitude to the Republicans' choice, Professor Smith, which will be voted on first. 
   As an aside, let me say to my distinguished colleague from Arizona and my distinguished colleague from Wisconsin: even though we are in different  campaign reform camps and even though we famously disagree on the First Amendment and federal election law, I would wholeheartedly support either of you to serve as the Democrat's nominee to the Federal Election Commission. 
   I urge my colleagues to also reject this new litmus test of barring government service for those who question Congress and its laws. Harvard Law professor and former solicitor general of the United States, Charles Fried, has summed up this point. This is what Solicitor Fried had to say:  
   I address ..... the proposition that because [Professor Smith] has been critical of the Commission to which he has been nominated and some of the laws which it administers he is somehow disqualified for confirmation to the post of Commissioner. This argument is not only dangerous, but so far-fetched, so out of line with historic practice, that it is hard to believe it is not being deployed strategically only, and that those who urge it in this case would not repeat it were they more in sympathy with the nominee or his philosophical orientation...... 
   [I]f these arguments against Mr. Smith should prevail it would have two dangerous consequences. It would limit more and more the administration of laws to zealots. And it would inhibit robust debate about the wisdom of laws, by using views expressed in such debates as weapons used deny the opportunity for public service on the basis of those views. The first danger would give us an administration of zealots; the second an administration of malleable non-entities.  
   In conclusion, I believe that Professor Smith's intelligence, his work ethic, his fairness, his knowledge of election law and--to quote from the statute: his ``experience, integrity, impartiality and good judgment'' will be a tremendous asset to the FEC and to the American taxpayers who have been forced to pay for unconstitutional FEC actions. 
   Professor Smith is a widely-respected and prolific author on federal election law, and, in my opinion, the most qualified nominee in the twenty-five year history of the Federal Election Commission. I wholeheartedly support his nomination to the bipartisan Federal Election Commission. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, based on the caricatures of Professor Bradley Smith, one would think he must have horns and a tail. I unveil a picture of Brad Smith and his family in the hopes of putting to rest some of these rumors. 
   Let me quote Professor Smith himself on this point, talking about the experience he has had over the last 10 months. He said: In the last 10 months since my name first surfaced as a candidate, certain outside groups and editorial writers opposed to this nomination have relied on invective and ridicule to try to discredit me. Among other things, some have likened nominating me to nominating Larry Flynt, a pornographer, to high office. Nominating me has been likened to nominating David Duke, one-time leader in the Ku Klux Klan, to high office. Nominating me has been likened to nominating Theodore Kaczynski, the Unabomber, a murderer, to high office. 
   Professor Smith went on and said: Just this week I saw a new one. I was compared to nominating Jerry Springer, which is probably not a good comparison since Springer is a Democrat. Other critics have attempted ridicule, labeling me a ``flat Earth Society poobah,'' and more. 
   He says: I say all this not by way of complaint because I'm sure that Members--he is referring to Members of the Senate--have probably been called similar or worse things in the course of their public lives. 
   I thought it might be appropriate to begin with a photograph of Professor Smith and his family, which bears little resemblance to Larry Flynt, David Duke, or Theodore Kaczynski. 
   It is my distinct honor today to rise in support of the nomination of Professor Bradley A. Smith to fill the open Republican seat on the bipartisan Federal Election Commission. 
   In considering the two FEC nominees, Professor Brad Smith and Commissioner Danny McDonald, the Senate must answer two fundamental questions: Is each nominee experienced, principled, and ethical? And: Will the FEC continue to be a balanced, bipartisan commission? 
   I might state this is a different kind of commission. It is a commission set up on purpose to have three members of one party and three members of another party so that neither party can take advantage of the other in these electoral matters that come before the Commission. The Federal Election Commission is charged with regulating the political speech of individuals, groups, and parties without violating the first amendment guarantee of freedom of speech and association--obviously, a delicate task. 
   Over the past quarter century, the FEC has had difficulty maintaining this all-important balance and has been chastised, even sanctioned, by the Federal courts for overzealous prosecution and enforcement that treated the Constitution with contempt and trampled the rights of ordinary citizens. 
   In light of the FEC's congressionally mandated balancing act and the fundamental constitutional freedoms at stake, Congress established the balanced, bipartisan, six-member Federal Election Commission. The law and practice behind the FEC nominations process has been to allow each party to select its FEC nominees. The Republicans pick the Republicans; the Democrats pick the Democrats. As President Clinton said recently, this is, ``the plain intent of the law, which requires that it be bipartisan and by all tradition, that the majority make the nomination'' to fill the Republican seat on the Commission. 
   Professor Bradley Smith was a Republican choice agreed to by the Republicans in the House and the Republicans in the Senate and put forward by the Republicans to the President of the United States, who has nominated him. 
   Typically, Republicans complain that the Democratic nominees prefer too much regulation and too little freedom, while Democrats complain that the Republican nominees prefer too little regulation and too much freedom. 
   Ultimately both sides bluster and delay a bit, create a little free media attention, and then move the nominees forward. In fact, the Senate has never  voted down another party's FEC nominee in a floor vote or even staged a filibuster on the Senate floor. 
   At the end of the day, however, the bipartisan nature of the FEC serves the country well. The FEC gets a few commissioners that naturally lean toward regulation and a few commissioners that naturally lean toward constitutionally-protected freedoms. And the country gets a six-member bipartisan Federal Election Commission to walk the critical fine line between regulation and freedom. 
   The Dean of Stanford Law School, Kathleen Sullivan, has summed up the balance as well as anyone. Specifically, she praised Professor Smith for the instrumental role he would play in upholding constitutional values and establishing a bipartisan equilibrium:  
   I do think Mr. Smith's views are in the mainstream of constitutional opinion. . . . I think it is a good thing, not a bad thing, to have people who are very attuned to constitutional values in Government positions, just as we would think it is a good thing to have a prosecutor who thinks very highly of the Fourth Amendment and wants to make sure searches are always reasonable, maybe more so than some of his colleagues. It is certainly good to have one of those prosecutors in the shop, and it certainly would be a good thing to have one Commissioner at least who has those views.  
   Let me say that I sincerely hope that we can uphold this bipartisan law and tradition that President Clinton invoked when he sent these two nominees to the Senate. 
   After all, Professor Smith's views are similar to the Republicans who have gone before him. And, Commissioner McDonald's views are similar to those he himself has held for the past 18 years as one of the Democrats' commissioners at the FEC. In fact, Commissioner McDonald's views are so consistent with and helpful to the Democratic Party that former Congressman and current Gore campaign chairman Tony Coelho has hailed Commissioner McDonald as ``the best strategic appointment'' the Democrats ever made. So, notwithstanding the bluster and delay, these two nominees largely represent their parties' long line of past FEC Commissioners. One could argue that the only thing new in this debate is the opportunity for new headlines. 
   Again, let me restate the questions before the Senate on these two FEC nominees? 
   Is each nominee experienced, principled and ethical? 
   Will the FEC continue to be a balanced, bipartisan commission? 
   I dedicate the remainder of my opening comments this morning to reading a few excerpts from the flood of letters I have received in support of Professor Smith since he was nominated. These letters from those who agree and those who disagree with Professor Smith clearly establish that: (1) Professor Smith is experienced, principled and ethical, and (2) his service would help the FEC to be balanced and bipartisan. 
   Even staunch advocates of reform, including two past board members of Common Cause, have written in support of Professor Smith's nomination. These many letters attest to the central role that Professor Smith's scholarship has played in mainstream thought about campaign finance regulation. 
   Equally important, these letters make clear that no one who knows Brad Smith personally or professionally, including self-avowed reformers, believes that he will fail to enforce the election laws as enacted by Congress or to fulfill his duties in a fair and even-handed manner. 
   All of the scholars that have written urging the confirmation of Professor Smith believe that his scholarly work is not radical but rather well-grounded in mainstream First Amendment doctrines and case law. Let me share with you a few examples of what these experts say.

   Mr. McCONNELL. First, Professor Daniel Kobil, Capital Law School, Reform Advocate and Past Director of Common Cause, Ohio:  
   Groups seeking to expand campaign regulations dramatically might have misgivings about Brad's nomination. However, I believe that much of that opposition is based not on what Brad has said or written about campaign finance regulations, but on crude caricatures of his ideas that have been circulated. . . . I think that the FEC and the country in general will benefit from Brad's diligence, expertise, and solid principles if he is confirmed to serve on the Commission.  
   Second, Professor Larry Sabato, Director of the University of Virginia Center for Governmental Studies, appointed by Senator George Mitchell to the Senate's 1990 Campaign Finance Reform Panel:  
   Contrary to some of the misinformed commentary about Professor Smith's work and views, his research and opinions in the field of campaign finance are mainstream and completely acceptable. For example, Professor Smith has argued in several of his academic papers for a kind of deregulation of the election rules in exchange for stronger disclosure of political giving and spending. This is precisely what I have written about and supported in a number of publications as well. Bradley certainly supports much of the work of the Federal Election Commission and understands its importance to public confidence in our system of elections. I have been greatly disturbed to see that some are not satisfied to disagree with Professor Smith and make those objections known, but believe it necessary to vilify the professor in an almost McCarthyite way. I do not use that historically hyper-charged word lightly, but it applies in this case. Any academic with a wide ranging portfolio of views on a controversial subject could be similarly tarred by groups on the right or left.  
   Third, Professor John Copeland Nagle of Notre Dame Law School:  
   Professor Smith's view is shared by numerous leading academics from across the political and ideological spectrum, including Dean Kathleen Sullivan of the Stanford Law School and Professor Lillian BeVier of the University of Virginia School of Law. His understanding of the First Amendment has been adopted by the courts in sustaining state campaign finance laws.  
   Fourth, Professor Burt Neuborne of the Brennan Center at New York University. There is no group in America that disagrees more passionately with Professor Smith on campaign finance than the Brennan Center. Yet, listen to what Burt Neuborne, the Legal Director of the Brennan Center had to say about Smith's scholarship. 
   Neuborne considers Professor Smith's writings to be ``thoughtful discussions of topics of extreme importance'' and concludes that Smith has done ``excellent work in debunking the status quo.'' He goes on to say of Professor Smith's scholarship:  
   I learned from it and altered aspects of my own approach as a result of his argument. It is, in my opinion, thoughtful scholarship that helps us move toward a better understanding of an immensely important national issue. Higher praise than that I cannot give.  
   It also speaks well of Professor Smith that constitutional scholars and election law experts that know him personally and are familiar with his work, including some who have served on the board of Common Cause, are confident that he will faithfully enforce the law as enacted by Congress and upheld by the courts. Here are just a few examples of the confidence these experts have in Brad Smith's integrity and commitment to the rule of law. 
   Fifth, Professor Daniel Lowenstein of UCLA Law School, served six years on Common Cause National Governing Board:  
   Anyone who compares his writings on campaign finance regulation with mine will find that our views diverge sharply. Despite these differences, I believe Smith is highly qualified to serve on the FEC. . . . Smith possesses integrity and vigorous intelligence that should make him an excellent commissioner. He will understand that his job is to enforce the law, even when he does not agree with it. . . . In my opinion, although my views on the subject are not the same as theirs, [the Senate Republican Leadership] deserves considerable credit for having picked a distinguished individual rather than a hack. . . . Although many people, including myself, can find much to disagree with in Bradley Smith's views, I doubt if anyone can credibly deny that he is an individual of high intelligence and energy and unquestioned integrity. When such an individual is nominated for the FEC, he or she should be enthusiastically and quickly confirmed by the Senate.  
   Sixth, Professor Daniel Kobil of Capital Law School, former governing board member of Common Cause, Ohio:  
   Knowing Brad personally, I have no doubt that his critics are wrong in suggesting that as a FEC Commissioner, Brad would refuse to enforce federal campaign regulations because he disagrees with them. I have observed Brad's election law class on several occasions and he always took the task of educating his students about the meaning and scope of election laws very seriously. I have never heard him denigrating or advocating skirting state and federal laws, even though he may have personally disagreed with some of those laws. Indeed, several times in class he admonished students who  seemed to be suggesting ignoring what they considered overly harsh election laws. Brad is an ethical attorney who cares deeply about the rule of law. I am confidant that he will fairly administer the laws he is charged with enforcing as a Commissioner.  
   Seventh, Professor Randy Barnett of Boston University Law School:  
   I . . . can tell you and your colleagues that [Professor Smith] is a person of the highest character and integrity. If confirmed, Brad will faithfully execute the election laws which the Commission is charged to enforce--including those with which he disagrees . . . . Brad's critics need not fear that he will ignore current law, but those who violate it may have reason to be apprehensive.  
   Let me close my opening comments by sharing with you Brad Smith's own closing remarks in his statement before the Senate Rules Committee:  
   [S]hould you confirm my nomination to this seat, which I hope that you will, here is my pledge to you. First, I will defer to Congress to make law, and not seek to usurp that function to the unelected bureaucracy. Second, when the Commission must choose under the law, whether to act or not to act, or how to shape rules necessary for the law's enforcement, faithfulness to congressional intent and the Constitution, as interpreted by the courts, will always be central to my decision making. Third, I will act to enforce the law as it is, even when I disagree with the law. . . . Finally, I pledge that I will strive at all times to maintain the humility that I believe is necessary for any person entrusted with the public welfare to successfully carry out his or her duties.  
   I think, with all due respect to current and past members of the FEC, this is clearly the most outstanding individual ever nominated for that commission. We all regret that this nomination has taken on some level of controversy because of Professor Smith's views, which are similar to those of 95 percent of the Republicans in the Senate. But that happens occasionally. 
   I am confident that well-meaning Senators on both sides of the aisle will remember that this is a bipartisan agency. It is supposed to have three Democrats, picked by the Democrats, and three Republicans, picked by the Republicans. It is important for us to honor each others' choices if the FEC is to work. So I am hopeful and confident that Professor Smith's nomination will be confirmed tomorrow when the roll is called. 
   With that, I yield the floor.

   Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, let me say briefly to the ranking member of the Rules Committee, I listened carefully to his statement. I thank him very much for respecting the process by which we have selected our nominees for the Federal Election Commission. He made it clear that, had the choice been his, he would not have picked Professor Smith. I will make it clear a little later that had the choice been mine, I would not have picked Commissioner McDonald. This is the way the FEC is supposed to work. I thank my colleague for honoring that tradition.

   Mr. McCONNELL. I yield myself whatever time I consume. 
   Mr. President, I begin my comments by rebutting some of the points made by colleagues on the other side of the Brad Smith nomination. One of the quotes used against Professor Smith out of context was that he said:  
   The most sensible reform is the repeal of the Federal Election Campaign Act.  
   Using this quotation to imply that Professor Smith would repeal the FECA exemplifies the meritless arguments being used to block the nomination of the most qualified FEC nominee in the history of the Federal Election Commission. 
   When this statement is read in context and the ellipsis are removed, it is clear that Professor Smith is only talking about the contribution limits in the Federal Election Campaign Act. On that point he is in pretty good company: Chief Justice Warren Burger and Justice Hugo Black also held that view. Justices Scalia and Thomas hold that view. Professor George Priest of the Yale Law School, Professor John Lott of Yale Law School, Dean Kathleen Sullivan at Stanford Law School, Dean Nelson Polsby at George Mason Law School, and former Solicitor General and Justice of the Massachusetts Supreme Court and now Harvard law professor, Charles Fried, have all espoused this view on campaign contribution limits. 
   I assume all of them would by that argument be barred from serving on the Federal Election Commission. Of course, they would not be barred from serving on the Federal Election Commission, and neither should Professor Smith. 
   In holding this view, Mr. Smith is no more in disagreement with the law than the Brennan Center and Common Cause, Professor Neuborne, and others who think the law should allow expenditure limits. These people at the Brennan Center and Common Cause advocate a position contrary to the law as declared by the Supreme Court in Buckley and affirmed in Shrink PAC. Under the standard being applied to Mr. Smith, all of them are barred also from serving on the FEC. Clearly, that would be an absurd result. 
   The Democratic nominee before the Senate, Mr. McDonald, disagrees even more sharply with the Supreme Court than Professor Smith. In open and recorded meetings of the FEC on August 11, 1994, in response to a recitation of election laws interpreted by the Supreme Court, Mr. McDonald declared: The Court just didn't get it. 
   He doesn't care what the courts say. Clearly, we can't confirm him if disagreement with the law disqualifies an FEC nominee. If there is anyone who has displayed contempt for the law, it is Danny McDonald, not Brad Smith. 
   Mr. Smith has acknowledged that his view that there should be no contribution limits is no more the law than is the view of the Brennan Center and Common Cause and some of my colleagues that there should be expenditure limits. Moreover, he has made clear he would have no problem enforcing contribution limits. 
   When asked if he would pledge to uphold his oath, he said he would proudly and without reservation take that oath, and everyone who knows him, including Dan Lowenstein, former national board member of Common Cause, has no doubt that Brad Smith will faithfully enforce the laws written by Congress and interpreted by the courts. 
   Professor Smith's detractors fail to note that he has made clear in his testimony before the Rules Committee that if the Shrink Missouri case had been a Federal case and come before the FEC for an enforcement action, he would have had no problem voting for enforcement action in that kind of case. 
   So the notion that Smith ignored Shrink PAC in his testimony is completely unfounded. I refer my colleagues to page 40 of the 
   Rules Committee Hearing Report dated March 8 of this year. Opponents argue Professor Smith says problems with election law have been ``exacerbated or created by the Federal Election Campaign Act'' as interpreted by the courts. 
   So what? Supreme Court Justices have expressed concern that the Federal Election Campaign Act as interpreted by the courts has had unintended consequences which have exacerbated or created problems with our campaign finance system. The Supreme Court Justices have said that. In Shrink PAC, Justice Kennedy opined: It is the Court's duty to face up to adverse, unintended consequences flowing from our prior decisions. 
   He goes on to assert, FECA and cases interpreting it have ``forced a substantial amount of political speech underground.'' Noting the problems created by the Federal Election Campaign Act, Justice Kennedy explained that under existing law ``issue advocacy, like soft money, is unrestricted--see Buckley at 42 to 44--while straightforward speech in the form of financial contributions paid to a candidate, speech subject to full disclosure and prompt evaluation by the public, is not *.*.* This mocks the First Amendment. Our First Amendment principles surely says that an interest thought to be the compelling reason for enacting a law is cast into grave doubt when a worse evil surfaces than the law's actual operation. 
   In my view, that system creates dangers greater than the one it has replaced. 
   So, I guess this passage would disqualify Justice Kennedy of the Supreme Court from serving on the Federal Election Commission. So, are we to punish Professor Smith for telling the truth? Professor Burt Neuborne of the Brennan Center has written that at least three extremely unfortunate consequences flow from Buckley. 
   Neuborne also writes that:  
   Reformers overstate the level of downright dishonesty existing in our political culture; furtherer deepening public cynicism.  
   Then is Professor Neuborne prohibited from serving on FEC? We all know that many of the problems with the current system are caused by excessively low contribution limits. President Clinton, other Democrats, and many people from my own party have publicly acknowledged this reality and the need for raising hard money limits. So I guess all of those folks would also be disqualified from serving on the FEC. 
   Professor Smith is opposed also because he has written that the Federal election law is profoundly undemocratic and profoundly at odds with the first amendment. 
   It has been said that Professor Smith is unfit for the FEC because he believes that the Federal election law is profoundly at odds with the first amendment. Quoting his 1995 policy study from Cato Institute: 
   Here is the Supreme Court in Buckley. Justice Brennan, in fact, who is known to have written the opinion:  
   The Supreme Court's decisions in Mills v. Alabama and Miami Herald Publishing v. Tornillo held that legislative restrictions on advocacy of the election and defeat of political candidates are wholly at odds with the first amendment.  
   So, now we are keeping Professor Smith off the FEC, it is argued, for quoting from the majority opinion in the Buckley case? From quoting from the majority opinion in the Buckley case? Before reformers began attacking Justice Brennan for authoring this quotation that Mr. Smith has cited, let me note that Justice Brennan's observation has been borne out by the fact that provisions of FECA are still being declared unconstitutional as recently as the first week of May, when the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals declared unconstitutional the party-coordinated expenditure limits. 
   It is worth noting this was in a 1996 case on remand from the Supreme Court, a case known as Colorado Republican, in which the Supreme Court declared unconstitutional the party  independent expenditure limits in the Federal Election Campaign Act, despite reformer assertions that they were undoubtedly constitutional. 
   So, it is simply absurd to attack Professor Smith for quoting from a majority opinion in a Supreme Court case. But that is what Professor Smith's detractors are doing. They are saying he is unfit to serve on the Supreme Court--in this case the Federal Election Commission--because he quotes majority opinions that are binding laws and factually correct statements of how FECA has been treated by the courts. 
   I might also note that efforts to paint this quotation as an absolute statement of his views on the entire Federal Election Campaign Act also lack any merit. If one reads the article in which Bradley Smith recites this quotation by the Court, he makes clear that he supports many aspects of the Federal Election Campaign Act, including the statute's disclosure provisions. Arguments being asserted against Professor Smith are, at best, half truths constructred by reform groups, but many simply misstate Smith's position and reformers and their allies at the New York Times and the Washington Post persist in advancing these specious arguments, even after they have been shown to lack any merit whatsoever. 
   It seems that Professor Smith's detractors will say anything to get what they want without any regard for either facts or logic. 
   I also note even the intellectual leader of the reform movement, Burt Neuborne, has written that:  
   The arguments against regulation are powerful and must be respected.  
   Professor Smith's opponents conclude he should not be confirmed because he has said:  
   People should be allowed to spend whatever they want on politics.  
   Well, so what? Under current law, people can spend whatever they want in the form of independent expenditures. Parties can spend whatever they want in the form of independent expenditures and coordinated expenditures. Wealthy candidates such as Jon Corzine in New Jersey can spend whatever they want from their personal fortunes. Moreover, this statement clearly refers to expenditure limits. Since Buckley, the Supreme Court has consistently held expenditure limits unconstitutional. Although so-called reformers wish this were not the law, it is the law. So, again, we are punishing Professor Smith for stating what the law is, not what the reformers would like it to be. 
   I would also like to note that Burt Neuborne of the Brennan Center agrees with Brad Smith that contribution and spending limits have undemocratic effects. Neuborne has written:  
   Contribution and spending limits and unfair allocation of public subsidies freeze the political status quo, providing unfair advantage to incumbents.  
   Even the Brennan Center acknowledges that disagreement over Buckley does not disqualify a person from interpreting Buckley. The Brennan Center has come under fire for its book ``Buckley Stops Here,'' and its views that the current Federal Election Campaign Act is flawed. I wonder if my colleagues on the other side of the aisle would vote against the executive director of the Brennan Center or the legal director of the Brennan Center who have criticized the current campaign finance law and the Supreme Court's decision in Buckley? The Brennan Center has committed blasphemy, equal to that of Professor Smith, by actually criticizing the reformers. 
   For example, Burt Neuborne, the Brennan Center's legal director, has stated:  
   Reformers overstate the level of downright dishonesty existing in our political culture, further deepening public cynicism.  
   Moreover, Neuborne has written that:  
   Contribution and spending limits freeze the political status quo by providing unfair advantages to incumbents.  
   Neuborne has gone after the Holy Grail here. He has actually criticized Congress and the Federal Election Campaign Act. Would those who oppose Brad Smith also oppose the Brennan Center? 
   I would hope not. In fact, the Brennan Center's own web page acknowledges that this type of reasoning is invalid. Let me quote the Brennan Center regarding disagreements over Buckley and the Federal Election Campaign Act:  
   The fact that a person believes that the Court should revise its constitutional rulings does not mean that either side disrespects the law or is disqualified from interpreting Buckley. Moreover, there is no direct correlation between attitudes towards Buckley and constitutional analysis of proposed campaign finance reforms.  
   One of the most troubling solutions asserted during this confirmation debate is that if a nominee has personally questioned the law of Congress, then somehow that nominee is disqualified from government service. Implementing these new type of litmus tests for government service seems shortsighted and ill advised, to put it mildly. Certainly most Members of Congress would be disqualified from future service in the executive or judicial branch under this new test, since nearly everyday we question the wisdom of our laws and regularly vote in opposition to various laws. 
   This new litmus test barring government service for those who question the law would clearly exclude many fine and capable men and women. For example, it is not uncommon for Federal judges to personally disagree with Congress' efforts to establish mandatory minimum sentences or uniform sentences through the use of the Federal sentencing guidelines. Judge Jose Cabranes, of the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, is a widely respected legal scholar who has been mentioned by both Democrats and Republicans as a possible Supreme Court nominee. 
   Judge Cabranes, however, has been a frequent and outspoken critic of the law he follows every day. He has written a book and law review articles arguing that current Federal sentencing laws and guidelines are ill conceived and ``born of a naive commitment to the ideal of rationality.'' Judge Cabranes has stated:  
   The utopian experiment known as the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines is a failure......  
   Moreover, the respected Judge Cabranes disagrees with what has been popularly referred to as reform. Specifically, the judge explains that the sentencing reformers' ``fixation on reducing sentencing disparity.....has been a mistake of tragic proportions......[T]he ideal [of equal treatment] cannot be, and should not be, pursued through complex, mandatory guidelines. We reject the premise of [the] reformers......'' 
   Does this mean Judge Cabranes is unfit to be a Federal judge because he does not personally agree with the sentencing law he must follow every day from the bench? Is Judge Cabranes, who is an otherwise widely respected judge, unfit to serve because he disagrees with the reformers, the wisdom of Congress, and the sentencing laws? Of course not. 
   Let's look to the Supreme Court for a moment on the specific issue of campaign finance law where reasonable people have and do disagree. 
   In the landmark case of Buckley v. Valeo, the Court had the difficult task of harmonizing the Federal Election Campaign Act with the First Amendment to the Constitution. Ultimately, the Court's decision in Buckley established what has been the law of the land now for the past quarter-century. I think it is worth noting, however, that every Supreme Court Justice sitting in that case disagreed with the law Congress had passed. 
   Several of these renowned Justices even questioned the law that was ultimately established by the Court's interpretation in Buckley. For example, Justice Thurgood Marshall dissented in part. Justice Blackmun dissented in part. Justice White, Chief Justice Burger, and the current Chief Justice Rehnquist--all of these jurists disagreed with both the law Congress passed and the law the Court created through its interpretation in Buckley. 
   Several years after Buckley, Justice Marshall continued to question the law established in Buckley. Does that mean the Senate would have denied Justice Thurgood Marshall a seat on the FEC if he had desired such a seat? Would Justice Marshall be unfit to serve a fixed term on a bipartisan commission? 
   What about Chief Justice Burger who argued Congress did not have the power to limit contributions, require disclosure of small contributions, or publicly finance Presidential campaigns? If the  Chief Justice had wanted a seat on the FEC, would the Senate have rejected Chief Justice Burger as unfit to serve? After all, Chief Justice Burger's opinion is in contrast with that of the New York Times. Would Chief Justice Burger have been unfit to serve a fixed term on a bipartisan commission? 
   What about my fellow colleagues who question the Court's decision in Buckley? The junior Senator from California, for example, said on the floor of the Senate only a few months ago:  
   I am one of these people who believe the Supreme Court ought to take another look at Buckley v. Valeo because I think it is off the wall.  
   Would my colleagues on the other side of the aisle oppose the junior Senator from California if she retired from the Senate and wanted to become an FEC Commissioner? After all, she disagrees with the law and with the Court's decision in Buckley. Would she be unfit to serve? 
   What about noted scholars such as Joel Gora, the associate dean of the Brooklyn Law School, who has criticized the Federal Election Campaign Act? Or Ira Glasser of the American Civil Liberties Union? Both Gora and Glasser were lawyers in the original Buckley case. Or Kathleen Sullivan, the dean of the 
   Stanford Law School? Or Lillian BeVier of the University of Virginia Law School? Or Professor Larry Sabato of the University of Virginia and a former member of the 1990 Senate Campaign Finance Reform Panel named by Majority Leader George Mitchell? Would these respected scholars, who question the law and share many of Professor Smith's election law views, be disqualified from Government service at the FEC? 
   Professor Smith's sin, in the eyes of the reform industry, is twofold: One, he understands the constitutional limitations on the Government's ability to regulate political speech, and, two, he has personally advocated reform that is different from the approach favored by the New York Times. 
   Let me say loudly and clearly, I believe that neither an appreciation for the first amendment nor disagreement with the New York Times and Common Cause should disqualify an election law expert for service on the Federal Election Commission. 
   As the numerous letters that have been flooding to me at the committee establish, Professor Smith's views are well within the mainstream of constitutional jurisprudence and commend, not disqualify, him for Government service at the FEC. Personally, I think Professor Smith's views would be a breath of fresh air at a Commission whose actions have all too frequently been struck down as unconstitutional by the courts. 
   Let me point out that the world of campaign finance is generally divided into two camps of reasonable people who disagree with the Supreme Court's interpretation of the First Amendment in Buckley. One camp prefers more regulation; another camp prefers less regulation. Neither camp is perfectly happy with the current state of the law. 
   One camp is made up of the New York Times, Common Cause, the Brennan Center, and scholars such as Professors Ronald Dworkin, Daniel Lowenstein, and Burt Neuborne. I might add that reformers Neuborne and Lowenstein have both written strong letters in support of Brad Smith's scholarship and writings on campaign finance. 
   The other camp is occupied by citizen groups ranging from the ACLU to the National Right to Life Committee, and scholars such as Dean Kathleen Sullivan, and Professors Joel Gora, Lillian BeVier, and Larry Sabato. It is probably fair to say Danny McDonald is in one camp and Brad Smith is in the other. I definitely agree with one camp more than I do the other, but I do not think agreement with either camp makes a person a lawless radical or a wild-eyed fanatic. And, I certainly do not think membership in either camp should disqualify a bright, intelligent, ethical election law expert from service on a bipartisan Federal Election Commission. 
   Finally, and most importantly, the overwhelming letters of support for Brad Smith and his unequivocal testimony before the Rules Committee convince me without a doubt that Brad Smith understands that the role of an FEC Commissioner is to enforce the law as written and not to remake the law in his own image. 
   As I mentioned earlier, critics who have philosophical differences with Professor Smith should heed the words of Professor Daniel Kobil, a former board member of Common Cause. This is what he had to say:  
   I believe that much of the opposition--  
   Referring to Professor Smith--  
   is based not on what Brad has written or said about campaign finance regulations, but on crude caricatures of his ideas. ..... Although I do not agree with all of Brad's views on campaign finance regulations, I believe that his scholarly critique of these laws is cogent and largely within the mainstream of current constitutional thought. ..... I am confident that he will fairly administer the laws he is charged with enforcing. .....  
   Let me add the sentiments of Professor Daniel Lowenstein of UCLA Law School, also a former board member of Common Cause. This is what he had to say:  
   Smith possesses integrity and vigorous intelligence that should make him an excellent commissioner. He will understand that his job is to enforce the law, even when he does not agree with it.  
   Let me say a few words about the Democrats' nominee to the FEC, Commissioner Danny McDonald. First, the obvious: McDonald and I are in different campaign finance reform camps. If I followed the new litmus test that is being put forth by some in this confirmation debate, then I would have no choice but to vigorously oppose his nomination. 
   I have serious questions about McDonald's 18-year track record at the FEC. Commissioner McDonald's views and actions have been soundly rejected by the Federal courts in dozens of cases. 
   One of these cases, decided earlier this year, Virginia Society for Human Life v. FEC, resulted in a nationwide injunction against an FEC regulation that Commissioner McDonald has endorsed for years. 
   Let me point out that this McDonald-endorsed regulation had already been struck down by several other Federal courts. Yet McDonald has continued to defy the Federal court rulings and stubbornly refuses to support changing the regulation. Two other cases, FEC v. Christian Action Network and FEC v. Political Contributions Data, Inc. resulted in the U.S. Treasury paying fines because the action taken by McDonald and the FEC was ``not substantially justified in law or fact.'' 
   Just last Friday, the Tenth Circuit struck down yet another FEC enforcement action as unconstitutional. 
   I ask unanimous consent to print in the RECORD a list of a dozen cases where the Federal courts have rejected the actions of McDonald and the FEC as unconstitutional.

   Mr. McCONNELL. The list certainly does not contain all the cases where McDonald's views have been rejected by the Federal courts, but it should give Members on both sides of the aisle a sense for which nominee is truly out of step with the law, the courts, and the Constitution. 
   I ask unanimous consent to print in the RECORD a copy of a letter from a first amendment lawyer, Manuel Klausner, who has been honored with the Lawyer of the Year award for the Los Angeles Bar Association. Mr. Klausner details serious concerns about Commissioner McDonald's voting record at the FEC. 
</TEXT>

<DOCNO>106-mcconnell-ky-4-20000523</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McCONNELL. I think Commissioner McDonald's voting record has displayed a disregard for the law, the courts, and the Constitution. It has hurt the reputation of the Commission, chilled constitutionally protected political speech, and cost the taxpayers money. 
   Equally troubling is the fact that Commissioner McDonald apparently chose to pursue the chairmanship of the Democratic National Committee while serving as a Commissioner to the Federal Election Commission. 
   On August 22, 1997, the General Counsel to the Democratic National Committee, Joseph Sandler, testified under oath that it was his understanding that Commissioner McDonald had pursued the ``chairmanship'' of the DNC in late 1996 or 1997. I must say I am very troubled by the fact that an FEC Commissioner, who is charged with displaying impartiality and good judgment, would seek the highest position in the Democratic National Committee while regulating the Democratic Party and its candidates and, I might add, while regulating the archrival of his party; that is, the Republican Party, and its candidates. 
   As the distinguished Minority Leader stated in a floor speech on February 28 of this year:  
   [The] law states that [FEC] Commissioners should be ``chosen on the basis of their experience, integrity, impartiality and good judgment.''  
   I have serious questions about whether an FEC Commissioner exhibits ``impartiality and good judgment'' when he seeks the highest position in his political party and simultaneously regulates that party and its candidates and regulates the competitor party and its candidates. 
   All that being said, I am prepared to reject this new litmus test whereby we ``Bork'' nominations to a bipartisan panel based on their membership in a particular campaign finance camp. I am prepared to follow the tradition of respecting the other party's choice and to support Commissioner McDonald's nomination, assuming that McDonald's party grants similar latitude to the Republican choice. 
   In fact, I believe it is the very presence of Commissioners such as Mr. McDonald who make Professor Smith all the more necessary at the FEC. The FEC needs Brad Smith's constitutional expertise to help prevent the string of unconstitutional FEC actions which McDonald supported. As Dean Kathleen Sullivan stated in support of Brad Smith:  
   I think it is a good thing ..... to have people who are very attuned to constitutional values in government positions[.]  
   So I say to my colleagues, I personally believe that Professor Smith's intelligence, his work ethic, his fairness, his knowledge of election law, and, to quote from the statute, his ``experience, integrity, impartiality and good judgment'' will be a tremendous asset to the FEC and to the American taxpayers who have been forced to pay for unconstitutional FEC actions. 
   Professor Smith is a widely respected, prolific author on Federal election law and, in my opinion, the most qualified nominee in the 25-year history of the Federal Election Commission. I am firmly convinced he would faithfully and impartially uphold the law and the Constitution as a Commissioner at the FEC, and I wholeheartedly support his nomination. 
   In the words of the Wall Street Journal:  
   This Mr. Smith should go to Washington.  
   Mr. President, how much of my time do I have remaining?

    Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to honor my good friend and fellow Kentuckian Oran Little on the occasion of his retirement as dean of the University of Kentucky's College of Agriculture. 
   Oran taught at UK for 25 years, and served as a highly-respected and well-liked leader for UK's students and faculty for 12 years as Dean of the College of Agriculture. Under his tenure, new facilities were built, old facilities were renovated, and innovative educational programs were launched. An Agricultural Engineering Building, Regulatory Services Building, Animal Research Center, and Plant Science Building all took root during Oran's 12 years as dean. He also facilitated the creation of international exchange programs, faculty and student councils, and numerous agricultural development programs. Oran may be leaving UK in body, but the school will benefit from his enterprising spirit and the tangible improvements he made as the College of Agriculture's dean for years to come. 
   Oran's long list of awards is as impressive as his lengthy list of accomplishments. His knowledge and experience have not gone unnoticed by other Kentucky agricultural institutions. Oran has received awards from the Kentucky Seed Improvement Association, Bowling Green/Warren County Chamber of Commerce, Greater Lexington Convention & Visitors Bureau, Soil and Water Conservation Society, UK Alumni Association, Kentucky 4-H, Kentucky Pork Producers Association, and the Kentucky Cattlemen's Association. 
   Oran has a long history with UK, serving as assistant professor, associate professor, professor, coordinator of animal nutrition research and teaching, associate dean for research, director of the Kentucky agricultural experiment station, coordinator of graduate programs in agriculture, and finally as dean of the College of Agriculture. Oran earned respect the old-fashioned way, through years of hard-work and a sincere concern for students, teachers and faculty at the University of Kentucky. 
   Over the years, Oran and I have worked together on many projects at UK. With Oran's wealth of knowledge about the University, he has been an essential resource in targeting the needs of UK and communicating how Congress can help meet those needs. It has always been a pleasure to work with Oran and I will miss him a great deal. I have no doubt, however, that he will stay involved with UK's College of Agriculture and that we will continue to hear from him in the future. 
   Oran, on behalf of myself and my colleagues, I wish you all the best as you enter retirement and I thank you for your many successful efforts to make UK a better place to work and learn.

    Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to honor Father Edward Randall on the occasion of his Golden Jubilee and in recognition of 20 years of priesthood in Letcher County. 
   During Father Randall's 20 years in Letcher County, he has served at both St. George Catholic Church in Jenkins and Holy Angels Catholic Church in McRoberts. People throughout the community have come to know Father Randall for his dedication to parishioners and generosity to everyone, both inside and outside the Church walls. 
   The Letcher County community also boasts of Father Randall's artistic talent, which he graciously uses to enhance church buildings and to teach free art classes open for all to attend. Father Randall also helped establish, along with the late Mother Teresa, an order of the Sisters of Charity in Jenkins, which will endure as an honor to his philanthropic contributions. 
   Father Randall continues to display an unswerving commitment to his parishioners and possesses the love and respect of many in the community. Those who know him in Letcher County describe him as a man with great strength of character who demonstrates honesty and integrity, and who serves as a role-model to young and old alike. 
   I am certain that the legacy of commitment to faith that Father Randall has left will continue on, and will encourage and inspire those who follow. Congratulations, Father Randall, on 50 years of priesthood and 20 years of service to Letcher County. Best wishes for many more years of service, and know that your efforts to better the lives of your parishioners and those in Letcher County will be felt for years to come. On behalf of myself and my colleagues in the United States Senate, thank you for giving so much of yourself for so many others.

   Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to make some brief remarks about an amendment I offered along with Senator STEVENS and Senator WARNER to the Military Construction Appropriations Bill. This amendment temporarily suspends enforcement of a Department of Defense regulation prohibiting State and local election officials from operating polling places at Department of Defense facilities. 
   A few weeks ago, my staff at the Rules Committee began receiving calls from elections officials in several states complaining that the Department of Defense had directed them to stop using polling places on military facilities that had, in some instances, been used for decades. Senator GRAMS, Senator WARNER and Senator STEVENS also received letters and calls from their State election officials expressing concern about the impact of the Department of Defense regulation on upcoming elections. 
   Mr. President, let me spell out some of the real hardships that would occur in the absence of our amendment. The Clerk of Franklin County, Kentucky, Guy R. Zeigler, wrote saying that the DOD directive prohibited voting at an Army Reserve facility that the county had used as a polling place for ``15 years.'' He went on to explain: ``[c]hanging the polling sites for these precincts creates confusion for voters trying to locate the new polling place.'' The Franklin County Clerk concluded that the ``timing of this directive could not be worse . . . a Presidential Election Year.'' 
   I would also like to share a letter from Minnesota Secretary of State Mary Kiffmeyer. Ms. Kiffmeyer wrote that the DOD directive prevented voting at military and reserve bases that Minnesota precincts have used as polling places ``for several decades.'' She concluded that if these traditional polling places were changed this late in an election year, then ``many voters, including military personnel, will be inconvenienced at best, and deterred from voting at worst, due to the loss of these accessible traditional polling places.'' 
   The impact of the DOD regulation on the State of Alaska was so great that the State legislature passed a resolution declaring ``Alaska has a tradition since statehood of public voting on military installations and proposed changes will cause confusion and extra financial costs.''

   Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, on Monday, the Financial Times carried a story headlined ``Burma Regime Has the Most Child Soldiers.'' As Burma drives toward a goal of a half million man army, more than 50,000 children have been forced into military service, with orphans and street children the most vulnerable. 
   These are the facts of life in Burma that no longer surprise any of us who follow the region closely. Forced labor, forced relocations, arrests, detention, torture, even executions are more facts--repeated so often that it is easy to develop a tin ear to the unreal horrors these words convey about daily life in Burma. Add words like hunger, disease, and illiteracy--add unemployment, injustice and drug trafficking, and you get the full picture of the misery the Rangoon regime has created. 
   As acute as Burma's pain is, this is not a day of mourning. Today is a celebration of wisdom and courage--a tribute to Burma's citizens who 10 years ago defied all risks and elected Daw Aung San Suu Kyi and the National League for Democracy [NLD] to lift the nation from a deep swamp of poverty, brutality and repression to the solid ground of democracy and prosperity. 
   The army may have stolen Burma's elections and her rightful past, but they will not be allowed to diminish our faith nor discourage our service to her future--to Burma's freedom. 
   For 10 years, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi has honored the wisdom and courage of her constituents through countless acts of self-discipline, heroic judgment and profound humility. Treated with cruelty, especially during her husband's final days, her compassion has not withered. Imprisoned, isolated by house arrest, she finds strength to reach out for a peaceful, political dialog with her captors. Wounded with each report of a follower's detention or death, she does not scar with bitterness, she does not retreat from her destined course--democracy. 
   Today, Senator MOYNIHAN and I have introduced a resolution of support for that destiny--for the restoration of democracy. Joined by Senators LOTT, HELMS, LEAHY, ASHCROFT, FEINSTEIN, LUGAR, DURBIN, KENNEDY, SARBANES and WELLSTONE, we are honored to have the opportunity to pay tribute to those who persevere in the noble quest for Burma's liberty. 
   In particular, let me offer my appreciation to the Members and friends of the NLD who work tirelessly for Burma's free future and, especially the guardian angel of our common cause, Michelle Bohanna.

    Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate Mary Middleton of Covington, Kentucky, for receiving the Friends of Covington Award for Outstanding Community Service. 
   Mary is a devoted civic leader and volunteer in Covington and throughout Kenton County. She gives her time and energy to numerous activities at church, and has provided leadership for several Northern Kentucky organizations. Mary helped found the Northern Kentucky Interfaith Commission and was the first president of the area's Salvation Army Auxiliary. In her many years of service to the community, she also was president of the Covington Art Club, Booth Hospital Auxiliary, Church Women United, and the Mary Circle of the Gloria Dei Lutheran Church. 
   Mary's kindness and generosity does not end there--she also has been involved with the Heritage League, Northern Kentucky Symphony, Women's Health Initiative, American Cancer Society, Florence Women's Club, and the Friends of Covington. 
   Aside from being involved in civic and philanthropic activities, Mary has long been an active member of the Northern Kentucky Republican Party and a driving force for Kentucky's Republican women. Back in the 1960s, Mary helped found the Kenton County Republican Women's Club and continues her work there today. 
   Mary also deserves credit for the many successes in her personal life. She and Clyde have been happily married for many, many years and have showed enormous strength of character and have a marriage that is an example to us all. 
   My colleagues and I join in congratulating you, Mary, on yet another fine achievement and we thank you for the time and effort you have put into others lives. I know the people of Northern Kentucky will continue to benefit from your generosity for many years to come.

    Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate students at Ohio County High School for their First Place finish in the Kentucky competition of the ``We the People ..... The Citizen and the Constitution'' program and for their advancement to the national competition. 
   I am proud to share with my colleagues that the class from Ohio County High School in Hartford, Kentucky will represent our State in the national competition of ``We the People ..... The Citizen and the Constitution'' program. These young scholars have worked diligently to reach the national finals and through their hands-on experience have gained knowledge and understanding of the fundamental principles and values of our constitutional democracy. 
   I wish to acknowledge each of the winning students: Amber Albin, Kyle Allen, Rebecca Ashby, Susanna Ashby, Jamie Barnard, Nicole Bellamy, Brian Canty, Susan Fields, Sam Ford, Amanda Gilstrap, Crystal Goff, Chris Hunt, Leslie Johnson, Andrea Leach, Jason Martin, Jason Mayes, Lacey Patterson, Sarah Phillips, Dexter Reneer, Ann Shrewsbury, Luke Sims, Keegan Smith, Erika Underwood, Tara Ward, Michelle Westerfield. 
   I also would like to recognize and thank their teacher, John Stofer, who taught these students and provided the leadership which brought them to the final competition of this year's program. 
   The ``We the People .....'' program is designed to educate young people about the Constitution and the Bill of Rights. During the final competition, the students will be challenged in a three-day program modeled after Congressional hearings. The students will make oral presentations and testify as constitutional experts to a panel of adult judges, and then will be questioned and judged on their knowledge and grasp of the Constitution. As a strong advocate for the Constitutional rights of all Americans, I applaud the efforts of these young people to understand and apply Constitutional law to real-life situations. 
   My colleagues and I congratulate these Ohio County High School students in their Kentucky victory, and wish them all the best in their upcoming competition May 6-8, 2000, in Washington, D.C.

   Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I want to speak on behalf of the pending measure, the Worker Economic Opportunity Act, which the Senate will pass shortly. 
   This bipartisan bill will ensure that American workers can receive lucrative stock options from their employers--once considered the exclusive perk of corporate executives. 
   Senator DODD and I have worked closely with Senators JEFFORDS and ENZI, ABRAHAM, BENNETT, and LIEBERMAN, the Department of Labor, and others to develop this critical bill. 
   We have the support of groups representing business and workers, as well as Secretary Alexis Herman. In short, everybody wins with this proposal. 
   All over the country today, forward-thinking employers are offering new financial opportunities--such as stock options--to hourly employees. 
   Unfortunately, it appears that our 1930's vintage labor laws might not allow the normal workers of the 21st century to reap these benefits. 
   When we realized this, we decided to fix this problem. It would be a travesty for us to let old laws steal this chance for the average employee to share in his or her company's economic growth. 
   The Workers Economic Opportunity Act is really very simple. It says that it makes no difference if you work in the corporate boardroom or on the factory floor--everyone should be able to share in the success of the company. 
   In sum, the bill would amend the Fair Labor Standards Act to ensure that employer-provided stock option programs are allowed, just like employee bonuses already are.  
   Also, this legislation includes a broad ``safe harbor'' that specifies that employers have no liability because of any stock options or similar programs that they have given to employees in the past. 
   I hope that this bill will be the first of many commonsense efforts to drag old labor and employment laws into the new millennium. 
   Mr. President, we need to pass this law. The Federal Reserve Board of Governors recently estimated that 17 percent of firms have introduced stock option programs. 
   They went on to say that over the last two years, 37 percent of these employers have broadened eligibility for their stock option programs--allowing even more American workers to share in their employers' prosperity. 
   The Employment Policy Foundation estimates between 9.4 million and 25.8 million workers receive benefits through some type of equity participation program. 
   This trend is growing, and given the current state of the economy, it is likely to continue to grow. 
   However, we have one last thing we have to do to make sure that American workers can have this incredible opportunity--we have to pass this bill. 
   Without it, our ``New Deal'' labor laws will strangle the benefits our ``New Economy'' offers to American workers.

    Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate Bob Taylor on his accomplishments at the University of Louisville Business School and in the Louisville business community. 
   From the moment Bob took over the reigns at UofL's business school in 1984, good things started to happen. Bob is a man of vision and incredible instincts about what works in the business world. He brought those talents to UofL to improve the quality of the program and strengthen the students' capabilities in a real-life business environment. Bob succeeded at both of those goals and brought UofL's rankings among U.S. business schools up to an honorable level and continues to rise in national recognition. 
   Numerous academic achievements mark Bob's tenure at UofL, including Success magazine's recent naming of UofL as one of the best in the nation for training entrepreneurs. Also, the business school has begun offering master's level programs overseas and now offers varied advanced degrees. 
   Several personal achievements are evidence of Bob's knowledge of and influence in the business world. He became the president of the American Assembly of Collegiate Schools of Business last year, which serves as the accrediting body for business schools nationwide. Bob also serves the community on the board of directors for the Rawlings Company, Logan Aluminum Inc., the Louisville Police Administration Advisory Commission, and the Metro United Way. 
   Many of Bob's colleagues and members of the Louisville business community have noted his extraordinary leadership skills. Bob took on a huge responsibility when he came to UofL, and he continues to press on to reach higher goals for the school. For this, I commend Bob and thank him for his dedication to UofL. His hard work has paid off and students from across the state and even the nation are reaping the benefits of Bob's success. His experience in business and success at Louisville is a sign of more good things to come for the school and the great State of Kentucky. 
   Bob, on behalf of my colleagues and myself, thank you for your commitment to the students and faculty at UofL's College of Business and Public Administration. I have every confidence in your ability to lead the school to even greater heights with more accomplishments and successes in the years to come.

This important bipartisan bill will ensure that American workers can receive lucrative stock options from their employers--once considered the exclusive perk of corporate executives. 
   In recent years our country's innovative new workplaces and creative employers have offered new financial opportunities--such as stock options--for hourly employees.

   This law simply says: it makes no difference if you work in the corporate boardroom or on the factory floor--everyone should be able to share in the success of the company.  
   Our bill changes the outdated laws so they don't stand in the way of economic opportunity for American workers. In sum, the bill would amend the Fair Labor Standards Act to ensure that employer-provided stock option programs are allowed just like employee bonuses already are. Also, this legislation includes a broad ``safe harbor'' that specifies that employers have no liability because of any stock options or similar programs that they have given to employees in the past. The bill I am introducing today is what I hope will be the first of many common-sense efforts to drag old labor and employment laws into the new millennium. 
   I am very pleased that Secretary Herman and the Department of Labor have worked with us on this legislation. The Worker Economic Opportunity Act is also supported by a broad range of high tech and business groups who have joined together to form the Coalition to Promote Employee Stock Ownership. This group has been of great assistance throughout the development of this bill. 
   An identical companion bill to the Worker Economic Opportunity Act is being introduced in the House today. As a result, I am optimistic that we can work to ensure that this much-needed fix to the FLSA becomes law in the near future.

<DOC>
<DOCNO>106-mcconnell-ky-2-20000328</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, we had extensive debate yesterday on the Hollings amendment. Let me repeat some of that for the record today. 
   The Hollings amendment is at least very straightforward. As I understand what the Senator from South Carolina is saying, in order to enact the various campaign finance schemes that have been promoted around the Senate over the last decade or so, you have to, in fact, amend the first amendment to the U.S. Constitution. I think he is correct in that. I happen to think, however, that is a terrible idea. 
   His amendment would essentially eviscerate the first amendment to the U.S. Constitution, change it dramatically for the first time in 200 years, to allow the Government--that is us here in the Congress--to determine who may speak, when they may speak and, conceivably, even what they may speak. Of course, under this amendment, the press would not be exempt. So everyone who had anything to say about American political matters in support of or in opposition to a candidate would fall under the regulatory rubric of the Congress. The American Civil Liberties Union called this a ``recipe for repression.'' It is the kind of power the Founding Fathers clearly did not want to reside in elected officials. 
   So this is a step we should not take. The good news is the last time we voted on the Hollings amendment in 1997, it only got 38 votes. I am confident this will not come anywhere near the 67 votes it would need to clear the Senate. 
   I am rarely aligned with either Common Cause or the Washington Post on the campaign finance issue. They oppose the Hollings amendment. Senator FEINGOLD, of McCain-Feingold fame, also opposes the Hollings amendment. 
   This would be a big step in the wrong direction. I am confident the Senate will not take that step when the vote occurs sometime early this afternoon. 
   Now, some random observations on the subject of campaign finance reform. There has been a suggestion that this has become a leading issue nationally and will determine the outcome of the Presidential election. I think, first, it is important to kind of look back over the last few months at how this issue has fared with the American people, since it has been discussed so much by the press. There was an ABC-Washington Post poll right after the New Hampshire primary among both Republicans and Democrats, weighting the importance of issues. Among Republicans, only 1 percent--this was a national poll--thought campaign finance reform was an important issue and, among Democrats, only 2 percent. 
   Earlier this year, in January, another poll--a national poll--asked: What is the single most important issue to you in deciding whom you will support for President? Campaign finance was down around only 1 percent of the people nationally who thought that was an important issue in deciding how to vote for President. Further, a more recent CNN-Gallup-USA Today poll, in March--essentially after the two nominations for President for both parties had been wrapped up, after Super Tuesday--asked: What do you think is the most important problem facing this country today? It was open-ended. American citizens could pick any issue they wanted to as the most important problem facing this country today. 
   In this poll of the American public, over 1,000 adults all across America, 32 different issues were mentioned. It was an open-ended poll among American citizens as to what they thought was the most important issue. Not a single person mentioned campaign finance reform in this open-ended survey after Super Tuesday, after this issue had been much discussed in the course of the nomination fights for both the Democrats and the Republicans. Of course, in 
   California, on the very same day as the Super Tuesday vote, there was, in fact, a referendum on the ballot in California providing for taxpayer funding of elections and all of the various schemes promoted by the reformers here in the Senate in recent years. It was defeated 2-1. 
   So we have substantial evidence among the American people as to what they feel about this issue in terms of its importance in casting votes for the President of the United States or, for that matter, for Members of Congress as well. 
   It has been suggested by the reformers on this issue over the years that if we will just pass various forms of campaign finance reform, the public will feel better about us, their skepticism about us will be reduced, and their cynicism about politics will subside. A number of other countries have passed the kind of legislation that has been proposed here over the last 15 or 20 years. Most of those--or all of those countries don't have a first amendment, so they don't have that impeding legislative activity. I think it is interesting to look at these other countries and what the results have been in terms of public attitudes about government that have come after they have passed the kinds of legislation that has been advocated around here in one form or another over the years. 
   Let's look at some industrialized democracies. Our neighbor to the north, Canada, has passed many of the types of regulations supported by the reformers in the Senate over the years. They have passed spending limits for all national candidates. All national candidates must abide by these to be eligible to receive taxpayer matching funds. The Vice President just yesterday came out with a taxpayer-funded scheme for congressional elections. I have seen survey data on that. It would be more popular to vote for a congressional pay raise than to vote to spend tax money on buttons and balloons and commercials. That is what the Vice President came out for yesterday. We look forward to debating, in the course  of the fall election, how the American people feel about having their tax dollars go to pay for political campaigns. 
   Nevertheless, other countries have done that. I was talking about Canada. Candidates can spend $2 per voter for the first 15,000 votes they get, a dollar per voter for all votes up to 25,000, and 50 cents per voter beyond 25,000. They have spending limits on parties that restrict parties to spending the product of a multiple used to account for the cost of living. This is an incredibly complex scheme they have in Canada-- 
   a product of a multiple used to account for cost of living times the number of registered voters in each electoral district in which that party has a candidate running for office. 
   It almost makes you laugh just talking about this. 
   Right now, in Canada, it comes out to about $1 per voter. They have indirect funding via media subsidies. The Canadian Government requires that radio and TV networks provide all parties with a specified amount of free air time during the month prior to an election. The Government also provides subsidies to defray the cost of political publishing and gives tax credits to individuals and corporations which donate to candidates and/or parties. It sounds similar to the Gore proposal of yesterday. 
   They have this draconian scheme up in Canada in which nobody gets to speak beyond the Government's specified amount. The Government's subsidies are put into both campaigns and parties and media subsidies. 
   What has been the reaction of the Canadian people in terms of their confidence expressed toward their Government? 
   The most recent political science studies of Canada demonstrate that despite all of this regulation of political speech by candidates and parties, the number of Canadians who believe that ``the Government doesn't care what people like me think'' has grown from roughly 45 percent to approximately 67 percent. 
   The Canadians put in this system presumably to improve the attitude of Canadians about their Government, and it has declined dramatically since the imposition of this kind of control over political speech. Confidence in the national legislature in Canada declined from 49 percent to 21 percent, and the number of Canadians satisfied with the system of government has declined from 51 percent to 34 percent. 
   Here we have in our neighbor to the north, Canada, an example of a country responding to concerns about cynicism about politics in government put in all of these speech controls, and the people in Canada have dramatically less confidence in the Government now than they did before all of this was enacted. 
   Let's take a look at Japan. 
   According to the Congressional Research Service, ``Japanese election campaigns, including campaign financing, are governed by a set of comprehensive laws that are the most restrictive among democratic nations.'' 
   After forming a seven-party coalition government in August, 1993 Prime Minister Hosokawa--this sounds like the Vice President--placed campaign finance reform at the top of his agenda, just as Vice President GORE did yesterday. He asserted that his reforms would restore democracy in Japan. In November 1994, his legislation passed. After this legislation, the Japanese Government imposed the following restrictions on political speech. Listen to this. This is the law in Japan: 
   Candidates are forbidden from donating to their own campaigns. 
   Any corporation that is a party to a Government contract, grant, loan, or subsidy is prohibited from making or receiving any political contributions for 1 year after they receive such a contract, grant, loan, or subsidy. 
   In addition, there are strict limits on what corporations and unions and individuals may give to candidates and parties. 
   There are limits on how much candidates may spend on their campaigns. 
   Candidates are prohibited from buying any advertisements. 
   Listen to this: Candidates are prohibited from buying any advertisements in magazines and newspapers beyond the five print media ads of a specified length that the Government purchases for each candidate. 
   Parties are allotted a specific number of Government-purchased ads of a specified length. 
   The number of ads a party gets is based on the number of candidates they have running. 
   It is illegal for these party ads to discuss individual candidates in Japan. It is illegal. 
   In Japan, candidates and parties spend nothing on media advertising because not only are they prohibited from purchasing print media ads, they are also prohibited from buying time on television and radio. 
   Talk about speech controls--in Japan, candidates can't buy any time on television and radio. 
   The Government requires TV stations to permit parties and each candidate a set number of television and radio ads during the 12 days prior to the election. Each candidate gets to make one Government-subsidized television broadcast. 
   The Government's Election Management Committee--that is a nice title--provides each candidate with a set number of sideboards and posters that subscribe to a standard Government-mandated format. 
   The Election Management Committee also designates the places and times that candidates may give speeches. 
   In Japan, the Government designates the times and places candidates may give speeches. 
   This is the most extraordinary control over political discussion imaginable. All of this campaign finance reform in Japan was enacted earlier in the 1990s. 
   What makes it even more laughable is, after all of this happened, all of these regulations on political speech that amount to a reformers wish list were imposed, you have to ask the question: Did cynicism decline? Did trust in government increase? ``Not so should be noted,'' as we say down in Kentucky. Following the disposition of these regulations, the number of Japanese who said they had ``no confidence in legislators''--the Japanese passed campaign finance reform that Common Cause could only drool over. They did it in Japan. And after they did it, following the imposition of these regulations, the number of Japanese who said they had ``no confidence in legislators'' rose to 70 percent. 
   Following the enactment of this draconian control of political discourse that I just outlined, in Japan only 12 percent of Japanese believe the Government is responsive to the people's opinions and wishes. 
   After the enactment of all of this control over political discussion in Japan, the percentage of Japanese ``satisfied'' with the nation's political system fell to a mere 5 percent and voter turnout continued to decline. 
   Let's take a look at France. 
   In France, there is significant regulation of political activity: 
   Government funding of candidates; 
   Government funding of parties; 
   Free radio and television time, reimbursement for printing posters and for campaign-related transportation; 
   They banned contributions to candidates by any entity except parties and PACs; 
   Individual contributors to parties are limited; 
   Strict expenditure limits are set for each electoral district; 
   And every single candidate's finances are audited by a national commission to ensure compliance with the rules. 
   Despite these regulations, the latest political science studies in France demonstrate that the French people's confidence in their Government and political institutions has continued to decline, and voter turnout has continued to decline. 
   Let's take a look at Sweden. 
   Sweden has imposed the following regulations on political speech: 
   In Sweden, there is no fundraising--none at all--or spending for individual candidates. Citizens merely vote for parties and assign seats on proportion of votes they receive. 
   The Government subsidizes print ads by parties. 
   Despite the fact that Sweden has no fundraising or spending for individual candidates since these requirements have been in force, the number of Swedes disagreeing with the statement that ``parties are only interested in people's votes, not in their opinions'' has declined from 51 percent to 28 percent. 
   The number of people expressing confidence in the Swedish Parliament has declined from 51 percent to 19 percent.  
   So we could follow the rest of the world and trash the first amendment and enact all of these draconian controls over political discussion, and there is no evidence anywhere in the world that produces greater faith in government or greater confidence in the process. In fact, there is every bit of evidence that it declines dramatically after the enactment of these kinds of reforms. 
   I am confident we will not start repealing the first amendment today through the passage of the Hollings amendment. Only 38 Senators voted for this in 1997 when it was last before us, and I am certain there won't be many more than that today. 
   Mr. President, how much time remains in opposition to the Hollings amendment?

   Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, we all despise those who desecrate the flag. The issue before the Senate today is how we should deal with that problem. 
   In the late 1980s, the Congress passed a statute designed to prohibit this vile practice. It was struck down by the Supreme Court on First Amendment grounds. For the last several years we have had proposals in the Senate to amend the Bill of Rights in order to prohibit flag desecration despite the First Amendment. However, I think we should be very reluctant about amending the Bill of Rights. 
   Therefore, I have offered the amendment which we will be voting on shortly. It takes a new a statutory approach that I am confident would be upheld by the Supreme Court. Simply put, my alternative approach protects the flag by prohibiting three kinds of desecration. First, desecration of the flag that incites violence or breach the peace. Second, desecration of a flag belonging to the United States government. Third, desecration of a flag stolen from someone else and destroyed on government land. Anyone who engages in any of this kind of reprehensible behavior would be subject to fines of up to $250,000 and/or imprisoned for up to 2 years. I think this is a better approach than tinkering with the Bill of Rights for the first time in 200 years.

   Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, we had this constitutional amendment before us in 1997. It only got 38 votes, and it takes 67 votes to change the constitution. Frankly, I am surprised it even got 38 votes. This amendment would essentially repeal a major part of the First Amendment. The Bill of Rights has protected our free speech for over 200 years. We do not need to begin eviscerating it now. 
   The Washington Post opposes this amendment. Common Cause opposes this amendment. The distinguished Senator from Wisconsin, Mr. FEINGOLD, and others oppose this amendment. This amendment is simply a very bad idea. 
   I yield the remainder of my time to the Senator from Utah, Mr. BENNETT.

Mr. President, I want to take a moment to thank members of my staff for their hard work on the last two amendments: Tam Somerville, staff director of the Rules Committee; Hunter Bates, general counsel, who works with him; Andrew Siff, Denise Grant, and Nathan Oman who have been deeply involved in the last two amendments. I appreciate the great assistance from Senator BENNETT of Utah. 
   This is a red letter day for the first amendment. The Hollings amendment had only 33 votes in favor of the amendment. As we all know, it takes 67 votes to approve an amendment to the Constitution. There were 67 votes against this amendment to the Constitution. It is clear that the first amendment is secure for another day, and I thank my colleagues who made that possible.

   Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, the amendment that I sent to the desk is on behalf of myself, Senator BENNETT, Senator CONRAD, Senator DORGAN, Senator DODD, Senator TORRICELLI, Senator BINGAMAN, Senator BYRD, and Senator LIEBERMAN. 
   I am glad we are having this debate today. The American flag is our most precious national symbol, and we should be concerned about the desecration of that symbol. 
   This debate is also about the Constitution which is our most revered national document. Both the flag and the Constitution represent the ideas, values, and traditions that define our Nation. Brave Americans have fought and given their lives defending the truths these both represent. We should be concerned with defending both of them. 
   Today I am proud to offer, along with the colleagues I previously listed--Senator BENNETT, Senator CONRAD, Senator DORGAN, Senator DODD, Senator TORRICELLI, Senator BINGAMAN, Senator BYRD, and Senator LIEBERMAN--the Flag Protection Act as an amendment in the form of a substitute to the bill before us. 
   This amendment would ensure that acts of deliberately confrontational flag-burning are punished with stiff fines and even jail time. My amendment will help prevent desecration of the flag, and at the same time, protect the Constitution. 
   As all of us do, I revere the flag. Among my most prized possessions is the American flag which honored, as he was laid to rest, my father's service in World War II. That flag rests proudly on the marble mantle in my Senate office. Further, one of my first acts as chairman of the Rules Committee last year was to offer, along with the senior Senator from New Hampshire, Mr. SMITH, an amendment to the Standing Rules of the Senate to provide that we begin each day's business in the Senate Chamber with the Pledge of Allegiance to the flag. 
   I want to be perfectly clear, I have no sympathy for those who desecrate the flag. These malcontents are simply grabbing attention for themselves by inflaming the passions of patriotic Americans. There is no reason we should respect them or what they are saying. 
   Speech that incites lawlessness or is intended to do so merits no first amendment protection, as the Supreme Court has made abundantly clear. From Chaplinsky's ``fighting words'' doctrine in 1942 to Brandenburg's ``incitement'' test in 1969 to Wisconsin v. Mitchell's ``physical assault'' standard in 1993, the Supreme Court has never protected speech which causes or intends to cause physical harm to others. 
   That is the basis for this legislation. My amendment outlaws three types of illegal flag desecration. First, anyone who destroys or damages a U.S. flag with a clear intent to incite imminent violence or a breach of the peace may be punished by a fine of up to $100,000, or up to 1 year in jail, or both. 
   Second, anyone who steals a flag that belongs to the United States and destroys or damages that flag may be fined up to $250,000 or imprisoned up to 2 years, or both. 
   And third, anyone who steals a flag from another and destroys or damages that flag on U.S. property may also be fined up to $250,000 or imprisoned up to 2 years, or both. 
   Some of my colleagues will argue that we have been down the statutory road before and the Supreme Court has rejected that road. However, those arguments are not valid with respect to this amendment I am now discussing. The Senate's previous statutory effort to address this issue wasn't tied to the explicit teachings and principles of the U.S. Supreme Court. 
   Put simply, my statutory approach for addressing flag desecration is completely compatible with the first amendment and in no way conflicts with the Supreme Court's relevant rulings in the two leading cases: Texas v. Johnson, (1989) and U.S. v. Eichman, (1990). 
   In the Eichman case, the court clearly left the door open for outlawing flag burning that incites lawlessness. 
   As is made clear by these distinctions in cases and the direction pondered by the Supreme Court in Eichman, my amendment will pass constitutional muster. But you don't have to take my word on it. The Congressional Research Service has offered legal opinions concluding that this initiative will withstand constitutional scrutiny. CRS said:  
   The judicial precedents establish that the [Flag Protection Act], if enacted, while not reversing Johnson and Eichman, should survive constitutional attack on First Amendment grounds.  
   In addition, Bruce Fein, a former official in the Reagan administration and respected constitutional scholar, concurs. He said:  
   [The Flag Protection Act] falls well within the protective constitutional umbrella of Brandenburg and Chaplinsky ..... [and it] also avoids content-based discrimination which is generally frowned on by the First Amendment.  
   Several other constitutional specialists also agree that this initiative respects the first amendment and will withstand constitutional challenge. A memo by Robert Peck, formerly of the ACLU, and Professors Robert O'Neil and Erwin Chemerinsky concludes that this legislation ``conforms to constitutional requirements in both its purpose and its provisions.'' 
   And, these same three respected men have looked at the few State court cases which have been decided since we had this debate a few years ago and have reiterated their original finding of constitutionality. 
   As I am sure you will hear later today, opponents of my amendment have asked a number of constitutional scholars to find constitutional concerns with my bill. One of the most revealing responses was from Professor William Van Alstyne, a professor at Duke Law School and a dean of constitutional law. Professor Van Alstyne wrote that although he is not in favor of any law or constitutional amendment punishing those who abuse the flag, he did not find any constitutional infirmity with my legislation. 
   In closing, I would like to share some thoughts recently conveyed by General Colin Powell, a great American. In a recent letter he so eloquently expressed his sentiments which explain my own. He wrote:  
   I understand how strongly so many ..... veterans and citizens feel about the flag and I understand the powerful sentiment in state legislatures for such an [constitutional] amendment. I feel the same sense of outrage. But I step back from amending the Constitution to relieve that outrage. The First Amendment exists to insure that freedom of speech and expression applies not just to that with which we agree or disagree, but also that which we find outrageous. 
   I would not amend that great shield of democracy to hammer a few miscreants. The flag will still be flying proudly long after they have slunk away.  
   There is nothing wrong with the Bill of Rights or the first amendment. It  has stood the test of time for 200 years. It would be unfortunate if we began tampering with the important and fundamental protections of the first amendment because of a tiny handful of malcontents. This is especially true when we have this viable, constitutional statutory alternative, which I have just offered, for dealing with those malcontents who would desecrate one of our Nation's most cherished symbols.

   Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I listened with great interest to the comments of the junior Senator from Utah, with whom I agree on this issue entirely. 
   One of the items I would like to engage him on--I certainly didn't cover it in my comments, and in listening to his, neither did he--was the definitional difficulty, in addition to all the other reasons why the Constitution or the first amendment should not be amended for the first time in 200 years, for either one of these proposals. 
   Focusing on the flag desecration amendment, it leads the Senator from Kentucky to ask the Senator from Utah if he understands what flag desecration is, because I have always had a little difficulty trying to figure out what that was. I remember I took my kids to the beach one time and saw lots of flags on T-shirts. I even saw one on the behind of some blue jeans. There are a variety of ways in which flags are displayed in this country that, it seems to me, might be arguably inappropriate. 
   I wonder if the Senator from Utah thinks if this amendment were to become part of the Constitution, we would have a definitional problem here as well.

   Mr. McCONNELL. I had a marvelous friend who was a veteran of World War I. He lived up until a couple years ago. He lived in my hometown of Louisville, KY. His mission, toward the end of his life, was to make sure that flag etiquette was always followed. He had become an expert on the subject of flag etiquette, which is apparently quite complicated because it includes ways in which the flag can be displayed, in addition to what we are all familiar with as Boy Scouts, about folding the flag properly. He was constantly irritated and offended by ways in which well-meaning citizens groups used the flag that he felt were a violation of respect with which the flag should be treated in a category of behavior generally referred to as flag etiquette. Frankly, we were all somewhat confused in trying to do that properly. 
   I wonder if we would not, here in the Congress, be right back in the same soup, so to speak, as the Senator from Utah points out, in trying to determine what is and what isn't proper respect for the flag.

   Mr. MCCONNELL. Finally, I am not an expert on these matters, but I am told that the appropriate way to dispose of a flag that is tattered and really torn--in fact, I saw one recently at a school where I brought them a flag that had been flown over the Capitol as a replacement for a flag that had flown at this elementary school for a long time; it was battered and torn and was going to be destroyed. I am told the appropriate way to do that is to burn it. I wonder if the Senator from Utah shares my view with regard to if that is, in fact, the appropriate way to dispose of a flag that actually has reached the end of its useful life, how would we determine which flag burning was a desecration and which was actually an honor?

   Mr. McCONNELL. I thank the Senator from Alabama, who has faithfully participated in the campaign finance debates in the years he has been here, always very skillfully. I am sure some of the things I will say will be repetitious because he was right on the mark in his observations about the Hollings amendment. 
   It is important to note at the beginning of the debate, the last time we had a vote on the Hollings amendment was March 18, 1997. Only 38 Senators voted for the Hollings amendment, an effort to amend the first amendment for the first time in the 200-year history of our country, restricting avenues of political speech. Only 38 of the 100 Senators believe it necessary, no matter what our views on the various campaign finance proposals before the Senate, to carve a chunk out of the first amendment to give the Government this kind of truly draconian power to control everybody's speech. 
   I know Senator FEINGOLD of McCain-Feingold fame is also going to oppose this amendment. I note that the Washington Post, with which I have essentially never been aligned with on a campaign finance issue, also opposes this amendment. 
   With due respect to the Senator from South Carolina, he has framed the issue correctly by pointing out that in order to do what many of the so-called reformers have tried to do, you do need to amend the first amendment. Of course, that is a terrible idea, I respectfully suggest. 
   The campaign finance debate is all about constitutional freedom. Soft money, hard money, issue advocacy, express advocacy, PACs, independent expenditures, bundling, and the other terms of art in the campaign finance debate are euphemisms for freedoms of speech and association protections under the first amendment to our Constitution, freedoms belonging to citizens groups, candidates, and parties. It is no more complicated than that. 
   The measure before the Senate, the Hollings constitutional amendment to empower the Federal and 50 State governments to restrict all contributions and expenditures ``by, in support of, or in opposition to Federal and State candidates,'' illustrates this simple fact beautifully and succinctly. The Hollings amendment is a blunt instrument. Where a statutory approach such as a Shays-Meehan or McCain-Feingold and their ilk slices and dices at this freedom--a cut here, an evisceration there--the Hollings amendment reaches out and rips the heart right out of the first amendment. 
   Before this week is out, we could be on our way to getting rid of the first amendment protection for everyone except pornographers. But I rather enjoy this debate. No pretense, no artifice, no question about it: If you believe that the Government, Federal and State, ought to have the unchecked power to restrict all contributions and spending ``by, in support of, or in opposition to Federal and State candidates,'' then, by all means, vote for the Hollings amendment. If you believe that the U.S. Supreme Court should be taken out of the campaign finance equation, then the Hollings constitutional amendment is for you. 
   If the Hollings amendment had been in place 25 years ago, there would have been no Buckley decision; Congress would have gotten its way. Independent expenditures would be capped at $1,000. Any issue advocacy that the FEC deemed capable of influencing elections would be capped at $1,000. Everyone would be under mandatory spending limits. There would be no taxpayer funding. It would not be necessary because spending limits would not have to be voluntary. 
   That is why the American Civil Liberties Union counsel, Joel Gora, who was part of the legal team in the Buckley case, has called the Hollings constitutional amendment a ``recipe for repression.'' 
   The media, news and entertainment industries, ought to take note. There is no exemption for them in the Hollings constitutional amendment, no media loophole. Under the Hollings constitutional amendment, the Federal and State governments could regulate, restrict, even prohibit the media's own issue advocacy, independent expenditures, and contributions just as long as the restrictions were deemed reasonable. 
   What we have traditionally done in order to assert what the Congress might consider reasonable is look to the American people and their views. Let's look at their views with regard to the press. 
   Eighty percent of Americans want newspapers' political coverage regulated. You cannot do that under the first amendment; you could under the Hollings amendment. 
   Eighty-six percent want mandatory equal coverage of candidates by newspapers. You cannot do that under the first amendment; you could do it under the Hollings amendment. 
   Eighty percent want newspapers required to give equal space to candidates against whom they editorialize. You can't do that under the first amendment; you could under the Hollings amendment. 
   Seventy percent believe reporters' personal biases affect campaign and issue coverage. 
   They are right about that. Sixty-eight percent believe newspaper editorials are more important than a $10,000 contribution. 
   Sixty-one percent believe that a newspaper-preferred candidate trumps the better-funded candidate. 
   Forty-two percent of Americans believe editorial boards ought to be forced to have an equal number of Republicans and Democrats. 
   Finally, 45 percent of Americans think newspapers should be required to give candidates free ad space. 
   I mention this survey to make the point that if Congress is going to have the power to regulate all of this speech, presumably, it will refer to the opinions of the American people in trying to make these regulatory decisions, and all of those items I mentioned could be fair game in determining what is reasonable to be spent ``by and on behalf of or in opposition to a candidate.'' 
   Again, I commend the Senator from South Carolina for offering this amendment insofar as he lays on the table just what the stakes are in the campaign finance debate. To do what the reformers say they want to do, limit ``special interest influence,'' requires limiting the U.S. Constitution which gives special interests--all Americans--the freedom to speak, the freedom to associate, and the freedom to petition the Government for redress of grievances. That is called lobbying. 
   We have to gut the first amendment and throw on the trash heap that freedom which the U.S. Supreme Court said six decades ago is the ``matrix, the indispensable condition of nearly every other form of freedom.'' 
   Some would call that horror reform. A few dozen Senators may even vote for it. As I said, last time 38 voted for it. We can all agree to disagree on campaign finance. We can even agree to disagree on what is reform. But surely we can also agree that this business of amending the Constitution whenever the Supreme Court hands down a result we do not like is wrong and is dangerous. We trivialize that sacred document which so embodies the spirit of America, which guarantees the success of America, and we treat it as if it were a rough draft. To be seriously contemplating chopping off a huge chunk of the Bill of Rights must seem incomprehensible to the casual viewer of this discussion. 
   This debate, like the debate over Shays-Meehan and McCain-Feingold, is not only about politicians' first amendment freedoms. The ``in support of or in opposition to'' components of the Hollings constitutional amendment refer to the freedom of everyone else in America--private citizens and groups and, yes, as I pointed out, even the media, the entire universe of political speech.  
   What makes the Hollings amendment on many orders of magnitude so much more egregious than the statutory proposals is that the Supreme Court cannot intervene and save America from whatever folly we would engage in on the floor in defining what ``reasonable'' is. 
   As I said, I recoil in horror from the substance of the Hollings amendment while I embrace the clarity of the choice it presents us. It exposes the fallacy of McCain-Feingold and other such speech suppression schemes. If one believes that McCain-Feingold is constitutional, as its advocates claim it is, then we do not need the Hollings constitutional amendment. If my colleagues vote for the Hollings constitutional amendment, then they have affirmed what so many of us inside and outside the Senate have been saying: That to do what McCain-Feingold proponents want to do--restrict spending by, in support of, and in opposition to candidates--then we need to get rid of the first amendment. That is what the Hollings constitutional amendment does: No more first amendment protection of political speech for anyone, politician or not. 
   Fifteen years ago, when I first took the oath of this office to support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies foreign and domestic, I had no idea how much time and 
   energy I would expend doing just that--defending the Constitution, not from foreign enemies, mind you, but from the Congress itself. I certainly could not have imagined that the Senate would spend so much time seriously discussing whether we should wipe out core political freedoms. We need to stop this, and I am confident and hopeful that the Hollings amendment will be defeated overwhelmingly tomorrow, as it has been defeated overwhelmingly in the past. 
   I will mention a couple of recent letters in relation to this amendment. One is from Roger Pilon at the Cato Institute who says in pertinent part:  
   ..... I am heartened to learn that those who want to ``reform'' our campaign finance law are admitting that a constitutional amendment is necessary. But that very admission speaks volumes about the present unconstitutionality of most of the proposals now in the air. It is not for nothing that the Founders of this nation provided explicitly for unrestrained freedom of political expression and association--which includes, the Court has said, the right to make political contributions and expenditures. They realized that governments and government officials tend to serve their own interests, for which the natural antidote is unfettered political opposition--in speech and in the electoral process. 
   In the name of countering that tendency this amendment would restrict its antidote. It is a ruse--an unvarnished, transparent effort to restrict our political freedom and, by implication, the further freedoms that freedom ensures. That it is dressed in the gossamer clothing of ``reform'' only compounds the evil--even as it exposes its true character.  
   I also have a letter from the ACLU, dated March 24, 2000, indicating its opposition to the Hollings constitutional amendment. In pertinent part, the ACLU says the constitutional amendment:  
   ..... would also give Congress and every state legislature the power, heretofore denied by the first amendment, to regulate the most protected function of the press--editorializing. Print outlets such as newspapers and magazines, broadcasters, Internet publishers and cable operators would be vulnerable to severe regulation of editorial content by the government. A candidate-centered editorial, as well as op-ed articles or commentary printed at the publisher's expense are most certainly expenditures in support of or in opposition to particular political candidates. The amendment, as its words make apparent, would authorize Congress to set reasonable limits on the expenditures by the media during campaigns, when not strictly reporting the news. Such a result would be intolerable in a society that cherishes the free press. 
   Even if Congress exempted the press from the amendment, what rational basis would it use to distinguish between certain kinds of speech? For example, why would it be justified for Congress to allow a newspaper publisher to run unlimited editorials on behalf of a candidate, but to make it unlawful for a wealthy individual to purchase an unlimited number of billboards for the same candidate? Likewise, why would it be permissible for a major weekly news magazine to run an unlimited number of editorials opposing a candidate, but impermissible for the candidate or his supporters to raise or spend enough money to purchase advertisements in the same publication? At what point is a journal or magazine that is published by an advocacy group different from a daily newspaper, when it comes to the endorsement of candidates for federal office? Should one type of media outlet be given broader free expression privileges than the other? Should national media outlets have to abide by fifty different state and local standards for expenditures? These are questions that Congress has not adequately addressed or answered.  
   All of which would be before the Congress if the Hollings amendment were to become law.

   Mr. MCCONNELL. I say to my friend from Washington, it is discouraging that there were even 38, but I say also to my friend from Washington, in earlier Congresses the Hollings amendment got greater support, including up to 52 votes in favor of the proposition back in 1988. 
   So I prefer to look at the bright side of this, I say to the Senators. It makes progress. We are moving in the right direction and, hopefully, tomorrow there will be even fewer than 38 votes. I think we are heading in the right direction. We have some time remaining. I don't know whether the Senator from Utah would like to speak further.

   Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, as we are all aware, the Internet has revolutionized communication and business. However, it also provides a new tool for some very traditional villains: child molesters. Unfortunately, loopholes in the current law allow some of these predators to escape without any real consequences. For this reason I have introduced the Cybermolesters Enforcement Act to ensure that these new on-line molesters are brought to justice. 
   It is already a federal crime to cross state lines to sexually molest a minor. In recent years the number of people using the Internet to violate this law has skyrocketed. In the last two years alone the FBI's cybermolester caseload his increased by 550 percent. 
   Most cybermolesters are well-educated, middle-class, and have no previous criminal record. As a result, many judges are giving them laughably light sentences. Ironically, the purveyors of child-pornography receive a ten-year mandatory sentence, but those who use the Internet to meet children and act out pornographic fantasies often receive no jail time at all. We need to end the double standard that gives lighter sentences to a special set of privileged criminals. The Cybermolesters Enforcement Act takes a measured approach to this problem by imposing a five-year mandatory minimum sentence without changing the maximum sentence already contained in the law. 
   I would like to thank the high-tech industry for their help in drafting this bill. In particular, I would like to thank the Law Enforcement Security Council of the Internet Alliance. This broad-based internet industry coalition is doing important work in the fight against online crime, and helped to ensure that this bill will not burden Internet service providers. 
   The Cybermolesters Enforcement Act addresses a real and chilling threat to our children. It is supported by the FBI's ``Innocent Images'' program, which is on the front lines of the battle against on-line pedophiles. It doesn't create any new federal crimes or regulations. It simply takes a common sense step to ensure that we bring today's high-tech child molesters to justice. I hope my colleagues will join me in co-sponsoring this important legislation.

   Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, today I rise with Senator BIDEN to introduce the State and Local Law Enforcement Discipline, Accountability and Due Process Act of 2000. American families can turn on the news every night and see the reality of the war against crime and drugs. No one understands the dangers of this battle better than the men and women on the front lines. I'm talking about our nation's police officers. 
   We have entrusted the difficult work of protecting society to police officers. They know the stress and the strain of walking the daily beat, of being caught in the crossfire in a world of gangs and drugs. They do a very difficult job, and with few exceptions, they do it with honor and skill. 
   We should always remember that the vast majority of police officers work responsibly and risk their lives for all of us. In the words of one officer, `the ultimate sacrifice could occur at any time. * * * [The] gangs and criminals have rewritten the rule book.' 
   To make matters worse, the pressure of crime and drugs--of gangs and thugs--is multiplied by the fear of unjust disciplinary actions. Our law enforcement officers face intrusive investigations into their professional and personal lives--oftentimes at the behest of some recently arrested criminal looking for a payback. 
   Unfortunately, many police officers are denied the same basic procedural and due process rights that the rest of us enjoy and take for granted. As a result, our officers live in the fear of: being investigated without notice; being interrogated without an attorney; and, being dismissed without a hearing. 
   We insist that police officers respect the constitutional rights of the citizens they serve. We insist that they adhere to the letter and spirit of our laws. We insist that they respect due process in their work. It is past time for us to give them the same kind of legal rights that every other citizen has come to enjoy. That is why Senator BIDEN and I have introduced this bill. 
   This bill strikes an important balance: it makes sure every police officer has basic fundamental procedural rights, while at the same time ensuring that citizens have the opportunity to raise legitimate complaints and concerns about police officer accountability. 
   For example, the bill guarantees due process rights to every police officer subject to investigation for noncriminal disciplinary action. Some of these rights include: the right to be informed of the administrative charges prior to being questioned; the right to be advised of the results of an investigation; the right to a hearing and an opportunity to respond; and the right to be represented by counsel or other representative. 
   At the same time the bill ensures that legitimate citizen complaints against police officers will be actively investigated, and that citizens will be informed of the progress and outcome of those investigations. 
   Finally, I must conclude by explaining that this bill is a product of years of input from the men and women who have experienced the daily pressures of police service, and continue to endure them. This legislation has benefitted from the thoughtful ideas and past support of many law enforcement groups, including the Fraternal Order of Police, the National Association of Police Organizations, and the International Brotherhood of Police Officers. 
   In particular, I am grateful to the contribution made by the Fraternal Order of Police. Over the past 8 years, I have worked closely with the Kentucky FOP to develop and promote this legislation. 
   The time has come to protect those who protect us. We must give our law enforcement officers the basic and fundamental rights that they desperately need and richly deserve.

   Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I come to the floor to support the Affordable Education Act, which addresses an important issue facing American families today--the education of their children. It is my long-held belief that we need to make a college education more affordable, and this legislation will do that by providing tax incentives to families who save for their children's future education needs. 
   While I strongly support this legislative package, I want to focus on a provision which I have championed for the past six years. Section 102 of the bill makes savings in qualified state tuition plans tax free. This provision would reward savings and allow students and families who are participating in these state-sponsored plans to be exempt from federal income tax when the funds are used for qualified education purposes. This legislation also recognizes the leadership that states have provided in helping families save for college. Nationwide, 44 savings plans will be established in 2000, serving over one million savers who have contributed over $7 billion in education savings. In my state of Kentucky, over 3,000 families have established accounts, which amount to $9.3 million in savings. 
   This legislation will reward long-term saving by making savings for education tax-free. It is important that we not forget that compounded interest cuts both ways. By saving, participants can keep pace with, or even ahead of, tuition increases while putting a little away at a time. By borrowing, students bear added interest costs that add thousands to the total cost of tuition. Savings will have a positive impact, by reducing the need for students to borrow tens of thousands of dollars in student loans. This will help make need-based grants, which target low-income families, go much further. 
   Anyone with a child in college knows first-hand the expense of higher education. Throughout the 1990s, education costs have continually outstripped the gains in income. Tuition rates have not become the greatest obstacle students face in attending college. In fact, the astronomical increase in college costs has been well documented. According to a study conducted by the College Board, over the ten-year period ending in 1999-00, tuition and fees at both pubic and private four-year colleges have increased on average more than 110 percent over inflation since 1980-81, with costs at public colleges rising 51 percent compared to the 34 percent for private four-year colleges. While average, inflation-adjusted tuition has more than doubled, median family income has risen only 22 percent since 1981. To compound this problem, room and board charges are between 3.6 and 4.8 percent higher this year than last year. 
   Due to the high cost of education, more and more families have come to rely on financial aid to meet tuition costs. In fact, a majority of all college students utilize some amount of financial assistance. The College Board estimates that most of the growth in financial aid has been in the form of student borrowing. In 1998-99, $64.1 billion in financial aid was available to students and their families from federal, state, and institutional sources. However, despite the fact that student aid has increased in value, it has not increased enough to keep pace with the rise in tuition. 
   Many Kentuckians are drawn to tuition savings plans because they offer a low-cost, disciplined approach to savings. In fact, the average monthly contribution in Kentucky is just $52--clearly this benefits middle-class savers. By exempting all interest earnings  from federal taxes, this legislation rewards parents who are serious about their children's future and who are committed over the long-term to the education of their children.

   Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, despite the Administration's objection to expanding the favorable tax treatment of these state plans, I am pleased that Congress has achieved real reform over the past several years. 
   In 1996, Congress took the first step in providing tax relief to families investing in these programs. In the Small Business Job Protection Act of 1996, I was able to include a provision that clarified the tax treatment of state-sponsored savings plans and the participants' investment. This measure put an end to the tax uncertainty that has hampered the effectiveness of these state-sponsored programs and helped families who are trying to save for their children's education. 
   In 1997, the Taxpayer Relief Act made revisions to provide increased flexibility to families saving for their children's college education. The most significant reform was to expand the definition of ``qualified education costs'' to include room and board, thus doubling the amount families could save tax-free. 
   As a result of our actions over the last several years, more and more state plans have implemented tuition savings and prepaid plans for their residents. It is projected that there will be 44 states with tuition savings plans by the year 2000. I believe that we have a real opportunity to go even further toward making college affordable to American families. It is in our best interest as a nation to maintain a quality and affordable education system for everyone. By passing this legislation, we can help families help themselves by rewarding savings. This will reduce the cost of education and will not unnecessarily burden future generations with thousands of dollars in loans. 
   In addition to making savings in qualified State and private college tuition plans completely tax-free, this legislation makes a number of other changes that are essential to helping families afford a quality education. Specifically, this legislation increases the contributions for K-12 education savings accounts to help families meet the expenses of a primary education. This legislation creates incentives for employer-provided educational assistance so that individuals can continue their education while working. This legislation also changes the rules for interest deductions so that qualified education loans are more affordable for students. Additionally, this legislation revises the National Health Corps Scholarships Exclusion, increases the arbitrage rebate exception on tax-exempt bonds, provides for private activity bonds for qualified education facilities, and allows the Federal Home Loan Bank to guarantee school construction bonds. These important reforms are critical to helping families save for the future. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this valuable legislation this year to reward those who save in order to provide a college education for their children.

    Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to fellow Kentuckian Steve Higdon on his recent success in becoming president and chief executive officer of Greater Louisville, Inc. 
   Steve Higdon grew up in Hikes Point and graduated from Trinity High School. He received a bachelor's degree in business administration from the University of Kentucky and began work with Yellow Freight Systems in Louisville after college. 
   Steve made his way to the top of the Louisville business world through hard work and determination. After his work at Yellow Freight Systems, he held several positions of leadership within the United Parcel Service (UPS), including economic development manager. Steve's work at UPS led to his involvement with Greater Louisville, Inc., and to his being hired as executive vice president for economic development and chief operating officer. 
   Many of Steve's colleagues have noted his extraordinary leadership skills. Steve's co-workers at UPS and colleagues within Greater Louisville, Inc. have all spoken of his drive and ambition, his work ethic and intelligence. From everything I've observed, Steve deserves all of these compliments--and more. He has taken on a huge responsibility in the Louisville community, and his past experience and success is a sign of good things to come for the city, its residents and its workers. 
   Steve also is involved in efforts to build a better Louisville community. He holds positions on the Workforce Investment Board, Housing Partnership Board, Kentucky Industrial Development Council, Industrial Development Research Council, and the Trinity High School Alumni association. This is further evidence that Steve's commitment to the community goes beyond mere business interests--he genuinely cares about Louisville's children and families. 
   Steve, on behalf of my colleagues and myself, thank you for your dedicated service to Louisville and to the people of Kentucky. I have every confidence in your ability to lead Greater Louisville, Inc. and its efforts to build great accomplishments and successes in the years to come.

    Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Lloyd Redman on the occasion of a special recognition of his commitment to Kentucky's youth. 
   Lloyd Redman has led a life that is certainly worthy of recognition. First and foremost, Lloyd is a dedicated family man. He and his wife of 55 years, Loretta, are the proud parents of two children, who have blessed them with three grandchildren and one great grandchild. 
   Lloyd also is a tried and true Kentuckian. He grew up in Kentucky and played basketball and football at Okalona High School. After high school Lloyd played football for Western Kentucky University and the University of Louisville, where he received a bachelor of science degree in 1949, and a masters degree in 1955. Lloyd's football talent also earned him a place on the 1944 U.S. Navy team. Lloyd was skilled at baseball too, and served as captain of the U of L baseball team in 1949. He gave a great deal of his time and energy playing and coaching sports in Kentucky. Lloyd has coached at Okalona High School, Southern High School, and Durrett High School and was named ``Jefferson County Football Coach of the Year'' in 1959. He also coached football, basketball and softball at The Cabbage Patch for eleven years. Lloyd currently works with the Cabbage Patch Settlement House in Louisville to help provide athletic, arts and educational programs for children. 
   While Lloyd obviously loves youth athletics, he is equally as concerned for the educational well-being of Kentucky's children. He received administration certification from Eastern Kentucky University in 1962, and served in numerous administrative positions within the Jefferson County school system including director of adult education and administrative problems, assistant and associate superintendent, and he currently serves as a consultant at the Kentucky State Department of Education. 
   Lloyd Redman has had a positive influence on Kentucky's youth throughout his many years as administrator, coach, and mentor--and I am certain his concern for and service to the community and its children will not end here. Lloyd, on behalf of my colleagues and myself, thank you for your service and congratulations on your worthy efforts.

    Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a dedicated public servant and friend of the Congress for many years, Lester S. Jayson, former director of the Congressional Research Service, who died on December 30, 1999, in Orlando, Florida. 
   Mr. Jayson joined the staff of what was then the Legislative Reference Service in October 1960 as Senior Specialist in American Public Law and Chief of the American Law Division. He was promoted to Deputy Director of the Service in May 1962, and served as Director from February 1966 through September 1975. 
   Mr. Jayson was influential in helping to develop the modern Congressional Research Service during his tenure as director of CRS between 1971 and 1975, the years in which the Service began implementation of the Legislative Reorganization Act of 1970. This Act changed the name of the Service and fundamentally enhanced its role by emphasizing the provision of policy analysis in all services to Members and committees of the Congress. The staff of the Service more than doubled during this time, and Mr. Jayson helped guide CRS to fulfill its congressional mandate and continue the tradition of responding to congressional requests for comprehensive and reliable information, research, and analysis to the Congress at all stages of the legislative process. 
   A graduate of New York City College in 1936 and Harvard Law School in 1939, Mr. Jayson was admitted to the bar of the State of New York and practiced law in New York City until 1942, when he was appointed Special Assistant to the U.S. Attorney General to handle trial and appellate proceedings in civil cases in the New York field office of the Department of Justice. In 1950, he joined the Appellate Section of the Civil Division of the Justice Department, and in 1957, he became Assistant Chief of the Torts Section, Civil Division, and then was promoted to Chief of that division. Mr. Jayson was also a member of the bar of the U.S. Supreme Court, the U.S. Court of Claims, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, and various other Federal courts. He served as Chairman  and Vice Chairman of the Federal Tort Claims Committee of the Federal Bar Association. 
   His 1,200-page book, Federal Tort Claims: Administrative and Judicial Remedies, was considered by many to be the preeminent volume on federal tort law. He wrote the volume as an extracurricular activity in 1964 and continued to update it regularly until several years ago. 
   On behalf of the Members of Congress who knew and worked with Mr. Jayson, I would like to thank his family for sharing him with us during the years he served the Congress and hope they are comforted by his legacy. Our thoughts and prayers are with his wife, Evelyn, his daughters Jill and Diane, and his four grandchildren.

    Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I rise today to pay tribute to a fine Kentuckian, Wini Yunker, as she prepares to serve the Peace Corps in the Ukraine. 
   Choosing to serve in the Peace Corps is an admirable decision for anyone to make but, especially for Ms. Yunker, who is making this decision later in life. At a time in her life when most people are beginning to think of retirement and slowing the pace of their lives, Ms. Yunker is instead boldly venturing out on a new journey. She is reaching high for a new goal that will not only make a lasting impact on her own life, but also on the lives of those she leaves the country to help. 
   Ms. Yunker enters the Peace Corps with the benefit of a lifetime of learning and preparation, making her an ideal candidate for service. She completed the necessary academic requirements by earning a college degree, and further earned a master's degree from the Patterson School of Diplomacy and International Commerce at the University of Kentucky. 
   The Peace Corps was created in 1961, by President John F. Kennedy, and is an international service organization dedicated to helping developing countries. My wife, Elaine L. Chao, headed the Peace Corps from 1991 to 1992, and it was under her tenure that service programs in the newly independent states of the former Soviet Union, including Ukraine, began. We take great personal pleasure that Ms. Yunker, a fellow Kentuckian, will be working in a service program Elaine helped create. Elaine's leadership of the Peace Corps made us both acutely aware of the kind of committed, hands-on approach to service that participation in the Corps entails. We applaud you, Ms. Yunker, for accepting the challenges the Peace Corps will surely present you over the next two years. The commitment you have made is admirable and your passion to serve others is an example to us all. 
   Congratulations, Ms. Yunker, on your acceptance into the Peace Corps, and thank you for your enthusiastic willingness to serve. On behalf of myself, my wife, and my colleagues in the United States Senate, I wish you the all the best.

    Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I rise today to pay tribute to my friend and fellow Kentuckian C.M. Newton on the occasion of his retirement as Athletics Director at the University of Kentucky. 
   C.M. Newton has made contributions to the University that are as great in number as they are significant in accomplishment in his 11 years as Wildcats Athletics Director. The positive changes and improvements he implemented over the years culminate into an unmatched legacy of excellence for C.M. and for the entire University of Kentucky community. 
   C.M.'s involvement with the Wildcats began long before his tenure as Athletics Director. He attended U.K. and received a bachelor's degree in 1952, and earned a masters degree in 1957. During his undergraduate years, C.M. played on the Wildcats basketball team and lettered on their 1951 NCAA championship team. He also pitched for the U.K. baseball team, and played quarterback for a Wildcats intramural football team. 
   In the years between his graduation from the University of Kentucky and his return in 1989, C.M. began his professional career in athletics. While serving in the Air Force in 1953, C.M. held his first official leadership position in athletics as the athletic officer for Andrews Air Force Base in Washington, D.C. He served as head basketball coach with Transylvania University, the University of Alabama, and Vanderbilt University, with a lifetime coaching record of 509 wins and 375 losses. He also served as Assistant Commissioner for the Southeastern Conference (SEC). C.M. approached these positions of leadership with a vigor, integrity, and enthusiasm that the world of sports took notice of by naming him Associated Press Southeastern Conference Coach of the Year in 1972, 1976, 1988 and 1989 and United Press International SEC Coach of the Year in 1972, 1978, and 1988. 
   C.M. also achieved a number of other honors, including membership on the Board of Directors of the National Association of Basketball Coaches, Chairman of the NCAA Basketball Rules Committee, Vice President and President of USA Basketball, Chairman of the USA Basketball Games Committee, membership in the NCAA Division I Basketball Committee, Chairman of the NCAA Basketball Officiating Committee, and membership on the FIBA Central Board. 
   It was with this vast list of accomplishments and honors that C.M. chose to return to the University of Kentucky on April 1, 1989. C.M. hit the ground running as Athletics Director and with his already well-established reputation for excellence and integrity, brought winning coaches and players to the Wildcats athletics programs. During C.M.'s leadership at U.K., the basketball and football teams soared, the men's and women's soccer teams received national attention, and the program grew to include 22 varsity sports--more than any other school in the SEC. The Wildcats athletic budget has more than tripled under C.M.'s tenure, allowing the school to expand and renovate several of the campus athletic facilities. 
   More than anything, though, C.M. Newton rejuvenated an excitement about athletics at the University of Kentucky. He led the Wildcats in a way that commanded respect--he led with dignity and embodied integrity. 
   Thank you, C.M., for your 11 years of dedicated service to the University of Kentucky, which resulted in winning teams, winning kids, and a top-quality program. Your spirit and legacy will continue to drive the Wildcats to victory for years to come. Best wishes in your retirement and may God bless you, Evelyn, and your family in this next phase of your life.

   Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. Chairman, I would like to engage with you in a colloquy concerning the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) list-sharing prohibition in the Intellectual Property and Communications Reform Act. 
</TEXT>

<DOC>
<DOCNO>106-mcconnell-ky-2-19991119</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MCCONNELL. The bill amends Section 396(h) of the Communications Act to prevent public broadcasting entities that receive federal funds from renting or exchanging lists with political candidates, parties or committees. 
   Mr. Chairman, am I correct in reading this language as providing that the list-sharing restriction only applies to the CPB and not any other organizations?

<DOCNO>106-mcconnell-ky-3-19991119</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. Chairman, in my view, CPB is a unique entity and its unique nature may be used by supporters of this provision to justify the restrictions on list sharing. CPB is unique because it is created, controlled and funded by the government with a legal obligation to be balanced and objective. 
   Many non-profit organizations rely upon exchanges of lists with political organizations as a way to attract new members to their organizations to support their charitable works. A number of mainstream non-profit organizations, such as the Disabled Veterans of America, have expressed concern that this CPB provision may set a precedent for future restrictions on list sharing by other non-profit organizations. It is my understanding, however, that this list sharing restriction is not a precedent for similar restrictions on other non-profits that are not: (1) created by the federal government; (2) controlled by the federal government; (3) funded by the federal government; and (4) legally required to be balanced and objective. Thus, I do not think this provision relating to CPB is a precedent for imposing such restrictions on other non-profits. Does the Chairman agree with my assessment?

   Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today on a personal note. I had  planned to make these remarks as we passed the midnight milestone on our way to cloture on the appropriations bill, because, as the clock strikes twelve, and November 20 begins, my Committee colleague, our Ranking Member, ROBERT C. BYRD will celebrate a birthday. I wish my colleague a happy and productive 82nd year. 
   Senator BYRD has a wonderful and widely quoted sign up on his office wall: ``There are four things people in West Virginia believe: God Almighty, Sears Roebuck, Carter's Little Liver Pills, and Robert C. Byrd.'' I'd like to take a little literary license to suggest that there are four things that ROBERT C. BYRD believes in: God Almighty, his 62 year long love affair with his wife, Erma, his constituents and the Senate. 
   And, Senator BYRD is not just your run of the mill believer. I have listened many times to the wisdom and intensity of his words, words which flow from a faith that runs as deep as his West Virginia roots, as deep as the coal mines which seam the earth of Appalachia. His words are what have led many to see Senator BYRD as the faithful historian and effective guardian of the precedents and privileges, of the rules and Constitutional role of the United States Senate. But, Senator BYRD is more than an institutional advocate, he is a living history of the Senate and democracy. The Senator from West Virginia gives a clear voice both to our finest traditions and what he sees as his life long purpose, serving what he so nobly refers to as ``my people.'' His reverence and respect for the Senate are surpassed by the deep regard and abiding passion he has for the needs of his constituents. 
   He speaks of those needs virtually every week. Senator BYRD breathes life into images of each West Virginian he introduces to us in remarks on the floor--even those who have passed from the scene. When he describes a man who dies in a slate fall while mining West Virginia's coal, he speaks softly of a man, alone, who died in the dark. The illuminating power of this image flows from the passion of his commitment. 
   It is his commitment which crosses partisan lines and has earned Senator BYRD legendary respect. In the last week, I have been privileged to experience this commitment while working with him to protect our coal miner's from the predatory reach of an overbearing judge. 
   As Senator BYRD begins another year and the Senate another session, I will look forward to continuing our work together, succeeding in reversing the devastating consequences of a bad decision, and serving well our constituents.

   Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, I first thank my friend from West Virginia for his leadership on this extraordinarily important issue to my State and to his and, for that matter, to all the people of Appalachia where coal is mined. 
   Thanks to my friend from West Virginia, I had a unique experience last week. As the proud possessor of a zero rating from the AFL-CIO, I had never been invited to a rally by the United Mine Workers of America. Thanks to the distinguished Senator from West Virginia, who I assume warned the crowd to say nice things or at least to refrain from throwing anything, I joined him on the west front of the Capitol last Tuesday and had an opportunity to watch Senator BYRD in action in a different environment. I have seen him many times on the floor, always persuasive and always effective, but never before a rally largely of his people and my people who make their livelihood mining coal. 
   I must say, it was a memorable experience. If I ever do my memoirs, I say to my friend from West Virginia, that experience will be in it. We have joined together today. And there are many others on this side of the aisle, and I hope we will have some on that side of the aisle, who have had enough of this administration declaring war on legal industries engaged in an honest effort to keep the engines of this country moving forward. We have a number of Republican Senators from the West, and they all informed us over the years about the war on the West. Senator DOMENICI and Senator CRAIG have educated some of us southerners about the problems they have had. 
   And I am pleased to say I have supported them over the years, without exception, in their efforts to preserve those jobs in the mining industry out west. 
   Well, I would say the war on the West is moving east, and we are beginning to feel the sting. Even though this amendment was generated by a very poorly reasoned district court decision in the Federal court in West Virginia, let me say that is just the beginning, as the Senator from West Virginia has pointed out; it is just the beginning. 
   All the Byrd-McConnell amendment seeks to do--not just for coal mining but for hard rock mining as well--is to restore us to the existing law, at least with regard to coal mining, as the distinguished Senator from West Virginia has pointed out. The letter from the White House, from Chief of Staff John Podesta to the President, either lies or is woefully ill informed. 
   It is clear to this Senator that the people downtown don't care what the facts are. They don't care about the 20,000 coal miners in West Virginia and the 15,000 coal miners in Kentucky. They really don't care. I don't think they have bothered to read the amendment of the Senator from West Virginia because, as he pointed out a few moments ago with regard to coal mining, we are seeking to reestablish the status quo, agreed to and entered into by the most radical EPA in the history of the country. There is no question in my mind that whenever any environmental group in America hiccups, it is felt downtown. Anytime they object to anything, the administration falls in line. 
   It has been fascinating to watch this issue develop because it pits the environmentalists against the unions--truly a Hobson's choice for the administration. When they had to pick a side between the environmentalists and the coal miners in West Virginia and in Kentucky, it is pretty clear whose side they chose. They don't care about these jobs. They are not interested in reading this amendment. They really don't care what is in the amendment. They are willing to sacrifice the 20,000 coal-mining jobs in West Virginia and the 15,000 coal-mining jobs in Kentucky in order to score points with a lot of environmentalists--who, I assume, enjoy having electricity all the time so they can read their reports--decrying the people who work in the industry so important to our States. Clinton and GORE are determined to put the agenda of the fringe environmental groups and Presidential political concerns ahead of the needs of coal miners in Appalachia. 
   As I said earlier in a colloquy with the Senator from West Virginia, and as he referred to in his speech, the President came to Appalachia last summer. He happened to have picked my State. He came to Hazard, KY. It was a large crowd. They were honored to have him there. The mayor of Hazard is still talking about it. It was one of the high points of his life. The President looked out at the people in Hazard, many of whom make a living in the coal mines, and he said, ``I am here to help you.'' 
   Well, Mr. President, we need your help. I assume the whole idea behind coming to Kentucky was not to increase unemployment. My recollection of what that visit was about was how the Federal Government could actually produce new jobs for the mountains--something a lot of people have talked about and few have been able to deliver. Well, we would like to have new jobs, Mr. President, but I can tell you this: We would rather not lose any more of the few jobs we have remaining. That is not a step 
   in the right direction. 
   We don't have as many coal jobs as we used to. The production is about the same. The employment is much smaller. Every time there has been an improvement in the coal-mining industry--whether on top of the mountain or underneath the mountain--safety has gone up, and that is important. But employment has gone down. We are not yet ready to walk away from coal in this country. We have not built a new nuclear plant in 20 years and are not likely to build any more. These people are engaged in an indispensable activity. They would like to have a little support from down on Pennsylvania Avenue. Where is the compassion? Where is the concern about these existing jobs in a critically important industry for our country? 
   Senator BYRD has really covered the subject, and there is not much I could add, other than just to read once again what this amendment is about. Nothing in our amendment modifies, supersedes, undermines, displaces, or amends any requirement of or regulation issued under the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, commonly referred to as the Clean Water Act, or the Surface Mining Act of 1977. So in response to this outrageous and ridiculous court decision, we have not proposed changing the law. The judge, in his decision, has made it clear that he expects us to clear this up. He is inviting us to legislate. That is what we are hoping to do. 
   The EPA, the Office of Surface Mining, the Corps of Engineers, and other  relevant agencies are in the process of conducting a thorough environmental impact study. At the conclusion of this process, if any of these agencies believe it is necessary, they may create new environmental regulations addressing the practice of mountaintop mining. Some might say that Senator BYRD and I and others are trying to delay the inevitable. I argue just the opposite. I argue that, by maintaining the status quo and allowing the EIS to move forward, you allow coal operators the ability to make the long-term plans essential to the viability of this industry. 
   So there are only two things you need to remember about our amendment: No. 1, it doesn't alter the Clean Water Act. No. 2, it doesn't alter the Surface Mining Act. It seeks to preserve the status quo. 
   I say to all of you who you are going to be down here asking us someday to help you save jobs in your State because of some outrageous action on the part of this administration--and some of you have done that already--we need your help. We need your help. This is an extraordinarily important vote to our States. The honest, hard-working people who make their living in the mines are under assault by this administration, and we would like to call a halt to it. We hope we will have your help in doing that. 
   Let me conclude by thanking again the Senator from West Virginia for his extraordinary leadership on this important issue to his State and to my State and, frankly, we believe, to a whole lot of other States because the principle is very sound. We call on our colleagues from the West--even those of us who have been voting with you over the years weren't quite sure what it was all about, but we have figured it out. This whole thing is moving its way east. We need your help. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from West Virginia. I appreciate his leadership not only on behalf of the coal miners of Kentucky but miners all across America.  
   The President of the United States came to Hazard, KY, this summer. He bit his lip; he felt our pain. He said he wanted to help us. We said: We need jobs. And when the opportunity came to support the Byrd amendment which would at least keep the jobs we have now, the President would not support him. 
   This administration is trying to destroy the mining industry in America, make no mistake about it. That is what this amendment is about. 
   I thank the Senator from West Virginia for his leadership, and we hope very much our colleagues will be able to support us.

    Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a dear friend, a successful businessman, and community leader, the late Henry Heuser, Sr. I also would like to extend my condolences to his two sons, Henry, Jr. and Marshall. 
   Henry has made it easy for us to remember him--leaving behind an impressive list of accomplishments that most people only hope to achieve in their lifetime. Henry will be remembered for many different reasons, not least of which is his generosity to the Louisville community. Henry gave much of his time, energy and monetary resources to benefit others. Aware that he had resources which not everyone was privileged to have, he shared his wealth both of knowledge and of money with the city over his lifetime. Henry often gave to charity and community groups that needed support, including a recent $1 million donation to the Louisville Deaf Oral School for a much-needed expansion project. He made the donation in memory of his late wife, Edith, who volunteered for and supported the school for many years. 
   Henry also will be remembered as a dedicated civic leader for Louisville--Henry had a heart for the city of Louisville, and a vision for its bright future. Henry was a founder of Leadership Louisville, a group of community leaders that were committed to making a difference in the city. Henry also was very involved in the religious community of Louisville, and even led the effort to bring the Presbyterian Church's headquarters to the city several years ago. Another of the legacies Henry leaves behind is that of ``The Derby Clock,'' as it has come to be known. Henry was an integral part of the planning and design for the clock, and I know I will think of him when I see it repaired, reassembled, and prominently displayed in our city. 
   Henry also will be remembered for his success in business, with the Henry Vogt Machine Company and his more recent enterprises, Unistar and Equisource. Henry's sharp mind and innate common sense clearly served him in the business world and in the community. 
   I am certain that the legacy of excellence that Henry Heuser, Sr. has left will continue on, and will encourage and inspire others. Hopefully it will be a comfort to the family and friends he leaves behind to know that his efforts to better the community will be felt for years to come. On behalf of myself and my colleagues, I offer my deepest condolences to Henry's loved ones, and express my gratitude for all he contributed to Jefferson County, the State of Kentucky, and to our great nation.

   Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, the scourge of illegal drugs is one of the greatest problems facing our nation today. We have all heard stories about the wreckage of crime and shattered lives that drugs leave in their wake. Tragically, after years of steady progress in the war on drugs we have seen a reversal in hopeful trend lines under the current administration. I believe that the Ashcroft-Hatch-Abraham amendment can be an important step towards reducing the trend of increased drug use and putting our nation back on the road to victory in the war on drugs. 
   I am pleased that this legislation takes special aim at methamphetamines. In recent years, ``meth'' as it is called, has emerged as the leading illegal drug of choice, replacing cocaine as the most popularly used drug. In some ways ``meth'' is even worse than cocaine. It is cheap, easy to produce, highly addictive, and it kills. This drug is proving especially devastating in rural America. In my State of Kentucky, ``meth'' labs have been springing up like a deadly cancer in our communities. The methamphetamines produced in these labs are addicting adults and children at an alarming rate. We need to do something to combat this threat to our families and communities. 
   This antidrug legislation contains some important provisions to strengthen the war on drugs. The increased sentences for methamphetamines related offenses will send a clear message to dealers, producers, and users that we will not tolerate the problems they are bringing to our communities. This legislation also directs the DEA to mount a comprehensive offensive against this drug. Finally, it will provide additional resources for hard hit areas--especially those in rural America--that are struggling with the rising tide of ``meth'' production and use. The legislation will help these areas combat methamphetamine trafficking and implement abuse prevention efforts. 
   Mr. President, methamphetamine production and use has become a very serious problem in our country. It is time that Congress took aim at this issue. I support this legislation and urge all of my colleagues to do likewise.

   Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, I first met Senator CHAFEE in December of 1984. We had a small incoming Republican freshman class that year. It was the Senator from Texas, Senator GRAMM, and myself. Senator GRAMM was already a national figure. He had burst onto the stage in his home State of Texas and had served in the House of Representatives for awhile. 
   I had been in local government. Frankly, I didn't know many people, and it was sort of a lonely first year in many ways. 
   I met JOHN CHAFEE in the Old Senate Chamber. That is where we had rather spirited elections for leadership in December 1984. The one most people noticed was Bob Dole being elected Republican leader to replace Howard Baker. But also on that day, Senator CHAFEE was elected chairman of the Republican conference, as I recall, by one vote. I think JOHN getting elected chairman of the Republican conference by one vote kind of summed up the odds he was frequently up against, not only in our conference, where he was one of the most moderate Members and frequently at variance with the majority of the conference, but he was a survivor because people recognized his personal qualities. 
   I don't know a great deal about Rhode Island, but I am told only 8 percent of the people of Rhode Island consider themselves Republicans. Someone earlier today described it as the most  Democratic State in America. I suspect that is true. And yet we had here a man with such enormous personal qualities that he was elected Governor multiple times and served in the Senate from 1976 until his death. Clearly, there was something special about JOHN CHAFEE that people came to recognize and understand. 
   Most of the causes JOHN pursued were, shall I say, not particularly good for the Commonwealth of Kentucky. He always thought it would be a good idea to raise cigarette taxes. Well, as you can imagine, the State has an enormous number of tobacco growers. That was rarely something I was enthusiastic about. Also, at least part of our State of Kentucky is in the Tennessee Valley Authority. JOHN always thought the TVA was something that ought to be terminated, and I must say over a period of years, having watched TVA operate, I am more and more open to JOHN's views on the matter, although I haven't gone quite that far. 
   Other speakers have said it, but I think the hallmark of JOHN CHAFEE was the fact you knew no matter what he said and did, it was based upon a great sense of objectiveness. He operated with enormous personal integrity and clearly was one of the most popular Members of the Senate. He always had an open mind. He was willing to revisit an issue. 
   For example, just last week, in a rather contentious debate that we frequently have around here on campaign finance reform, JOHN, whose views were fundamentally different from mine on the subject, actually ended up agreeing with me on one of the proposals we had before us. 
   It was a tribute to his willingness to revisit an issue, or at least part of an issue, where he had a longstanding commitment. But he took a look at a particular version that we had before us and reached a different conclusion. 
   At the beginning of this Congress--we have our desks here on the floor on a seniority basis--I had finally been around here long enough where I moved over in the area where a lot of senior Members are. JOHN was right here, two desks over. I think it was really during the impeachment hearing, when we were all here so much of the time and I felt I got to know JOHN even better. We were frequently talking, both in the cloakroom and out here on the floor, during that very difficult time. 
   It is hard for me to imagine a finer human being than JOHN CHAFEE, who was an effective Senator, an outstanding Senator, and really a fine human being. So we celebrate his remarkable life, which others have spoken about--from his courage under fire in World War II and again in Korea, to his exemplary service to the Nation in the U.S. Senate. So I say to you, Ginny, and to all the family, we share your grief. We will miss JOHN more than words can express. Not only have you lost a husband, but the Senate has lost a great Member, and America has lost one of its finest statesmen. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, we have just completed the 20th cloture vote on this subject since 1987. Since my party took over the majority in the Senate, the 52-48 vote was the highest watermark actually during that period, and going all the way back over the 20 years I have been involved in this issue. 
   So I thank the 48 Senators--regretfully, all of them were Republican--who resisted the temptation to support a measure that would have quieted the voices of American citizens and destroyed the effectiveness of our national political parties. 
   Then, on the second vote, which was narrowed to only affect the two great political parties, there were 47 votes against that proposal, which is more than we had gotten on a much broader measure back in the first Congress after my party took over the Senate. 
   So I think it is safe to say there is no momentum whatsoever for this kind of measure which seeks to put the Government in charge of what people may say, when they may say it, and attempts to take the two great American political parties out of the process. 
   I thank the Senator from Arizona for retracting his statements on his web site which were highly offensive to the Senator from Utah and the Senator from Washington State. We took a look at the web site. Those have been deleted and we thank the Senator from Arizona for doing that. 
   Turning to the sequence of events over the last week, we began the debate on Wednesday, October 13. Admittedly, it was later in the day than the majority leader had intended. That was the day of the vote on the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, but those who were on the floor were ready to go and suggested we begin Wednesday night at 7:30 p.m. and get started on the bill. There seemed to be not a whole lot of desire on either side to begin at that time of the night. 
   On Thursday, Republicans offered Senator MCCAIN and Democrats an overall agreement providing for a vote on the Daschle-Shays-Meehan amendment, and providing that all other amendments must be offered by 5:30 on Monday. Consequently, this agreement would have outlined an orderly fashion for debate and final disposition of the campaign finance reform bill. That agreement was objected to by Senator MCCAIN and our Democratic colleagues. 
   On Friday, Republicans offered Senator MCCAIN and the Democrats an agreement that would provide for a time limit for debate on the Daschle-Shays-Meehan amendment and a vote in relation to that amendment. That agreement was also objected to by our Democratic colleagues. 
   Also on Friday, several efforts were made on behalf of the Republicans to proceed with amendments to the pending campaign finance reform bill. The minority leader and the assistant minority leader then offered first and second-degree amendments, thereby filling up the amendment tree. The first-degree amendment offered was the Shays-Meehan bill and the second degree was the McCain-Feingold bill. Cloture was then filed on each amendment in the order stated. Those cloture votes, of course, have just occurred. 
   Again, on Friday, numerous unanimous consent agreements were offered, largely by this Senator, in an effort to lay aside the pending Democratic amendments in order to proceed with the amending process. Those consent agreements were objected to by the Democrats and thus the Senate was put in a holding pattern awaiting today's cloture votes. 
   Yesterday, the Senate debated throughout the day the pending two amendments, and the Senator from Arizona made a motion to table the Reid second-degree amendment and the motion to table vote occurred at 5:45 yesterday and was defeated by a vote of 92-1. 
   The consent was offered to debate between 9:30 and 12:30 on Tuesday--today--calling for the cloture votes at 2 p.m. on Tuesday. That was objected to. Therefore, the Senate had no alternative than to convene at 1:15 today and use the cloture rule to have the cloture votes occur at 2:15. 
   For the benefit of those who may not have followed this debate quite as closely as the Senator from Kentucky, I wanted to lay out the sequence of events since last Wednesday when we went to the bill and the numerous efforts were made to have an open amending process so we could have a chance to improve a bill that obviously is fatally flawed. 
   As is the case in all measures of any controversy in the Senate, I think it is important to remember every controversial measure has to achieve a 60-vote threshold. That is not unusual. That is the norm. It should not be surprising that this highly controversial measure, which many people on my side believe is not bipartisan and not properly crafted, would be subjected to the same 60 votes as other controversial measures. 
   The majority leader and the Republicans lived up to their end of the agreement. We are disappointed the Democrats refuse to abide by it. I am equally disappointed to hear the Senator from Arizona and the Senator from Wisconsin have announced they now refuse to honor that agreement.

   Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, the first amendment does not permit regulation of contributions or expenditures for issue advocacy. The Supreme Court has allowed regulation of contributions and expenditures that are (1) coordinated with a candidate--and thus a contribution--as well as (2) those that can be used to expressly advocate the election or defeat of a candidate, including independent expenditures by corporations and unions--but not independent expenditures of political parties. The Supreme Court has never allowed regulation of contributions and expenditures for issue advocacy and other activities that are (1) not coordinated with a candidate and (2) do not include express advocacy of the election or defeat of a candidate. 
   Buckley and its progeny prohibit regulation of issue ads and contributions  and expenditures used to engage in issue advocacy. As originally drafted, the Federal Election Campaign Act FECA would have required disclosure of all contributions over $10 received by any organization which publicly referred to any candidate or any candidate's voting record, positions, or official acts of candidates who were federal officeholders.

   Mr. McCONNELL. I say to the Senator from Arizona, he is correct. My understanding Friday was and remains that the right side of the tree, which is what we normally amend around here, was filled by the two amendments and the two cloture votes. That effectively made additional amendments somewhat an exercise in futility. What I recommended to our side--and it has  been happening today--is that they discuss their amendments--I know Senator HAGEL is here to discuss his--and indicate that they would like to have had a vote, a meaningful vote, which would have been on the right side of the tree. 
   So the Senator from Arizona does correctly state my opinion of Friday, which remains my opinion today.

Would the Senator from New Jersey agree that, as a practical matter, the result of the most recent version of McCain-Feingold is to take away 35 percent of the budget of the Democratic Senatorial Committee, 35 percent of the budget of the Republican Senatorial Committee, and roughly 40 percent of the budgets of the RNC and the DNC; is that not correct?

   Mr. MCCONNELL. So I say to my friend from New Jersey, another maybe unintended consequence of the proposal that is targeted right at the heart of America's two great political parties is that it will make it even more difficult for challengers to be competitive in elections across America.

   Mr. MCCONNELL. I say to my friend, we don't agree on the underlying issue. But selective disarmament of the two great political parties, some would argue, is not a step forward in having more and more competitive elections, which presumably would be a good thing for the American political system. As the Senator knows, I don't want to disarm anybody. I don't think we have a problem in America because we have too few voices speaking on issues. 
   My view is, a government that spends $1.8 trillion a year is a government that can threaten an awful lot of people. It is not at all surprising these citizens, groups, and parties want to have an impact on a government that has the ability to take away everything they have. So I am not surprised, nor am I offended, by all of these voices having the opportunity to speak out. 
   But I thank the Senator from New Jersey for making the very important point that it is a sort of selective quieting of voices, a singling out of six committees. I think there are something like 3,000 committees registered with the Federal Election Commission. If this particular version of McCain-Feingold were passed, I say to my friend from New Jersey, 6 committees out of 3,000 would be unable to engage in issue advocacy, raising an important fifth amendment problem under the equal protection clause. Is it possible for the Government to single out 6 committees out of 3,000 and say only those committees cannot engage in issue advocacy? 
   So this thing has an important fifth amendment problem. We have talked a lot about the first amendment in this debate. This proposal has a serious fifth amendment problem. 
   I thank my friend from New Jersey for his observations about what is going to happen, practically, if you simply target the parties.

   Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, there are a number of Republican Senators anxious to offer amendments, and I would like to create an environment in which people can come over, offer their amendment, discuss it, and lay it aside. 
   Senator BENNETT has been sitting here patiently for some time. He and Senator BURNS have an important amendment related to the Internet. 
   Therefore, I ask unanimous consent the pending two amendments be laid aside in order for Senator BENNETT to offer an amendment, along with Senator BURNS, regarding Internet free speech, and that no second-degree amendments be in order prior to a vote in relation to the amendment. I further ask----

   Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, what we have is a debate that is proceeding in such a way that amendments are not being allowed. 
   One of the things we talked about this year, and Senator MCCAIN indicated he wanted, was an open debate, in which Senators would be able to lay down their amendments, get debate, and get votes. 
   I say to all of my colleagues, we have Senator BENNETT and Senator BURNS here with a very important amendment they would like to get offered. Senator SESSIONS is on the floor. He has an amendment he would like to offer. Senator THOMPSON and Senator LIEBERMAN have an amendment they would like to offer. Senator NICKLES has an amendment he would like to offer; Senator HATCH, in all likelihood. Senator HAGEL has indicated he may be offering an amendment, as well. 
   We have an opportunity here to lay down and discuss these amendments, lay them aside, and guarantee these Senators an opportunity to vote. 
   I am somewhat confused about where we are. I thought the whole idea behind having 4 or 5 days of debate, I would say to my friend from Arizona--although he did not object; it was the assistant minority leader--I guess I am perplexed about where we are. I would like to protect the opportunity of my colleagues on the Republican side to offer amendments about which they feel strongly about.

I am not prepared to withdraw that yet, as Senator MCCAIN indicated that that could be displaced, in any event, by some substitute, which the Senator from Nevada has already offered. I reject the notion that there is some devious notion at work. Besides, I don't even want to get into that. The only issue before us, I say to the Senator from Nevada, is whether or not we can get consent to have some other Senators take advantage --we have had all this discussion about having an open debate on campaign finance reform. We can't even get amendments laid down for discussion. We are not talking about controversial amendments, I don't think. People do have the option to vote against them.

   Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I am told by the parliamentary experts who serve us that to amend the rest of the tree is essentially a waste of time. So as a practical matter, what our Democratic colleagues are doing is preventing Republicans from offering amendments. This has the result of putting us back to the way we have handled this in the past, which the Senator from Arizona and I thought the other side had agreed we would not do this time, which was to allow amendments. The practical effect of where we are now is we are going to have two cloture votes, which is the way this issue has been dealt with in recent years, and it prevents Senators from offering amendments, having them debated, and having them voted on. I think that is unfortunate. 
   Mr. President, on the substance of the issue, unless there is some change of heart on the part of my good friend from Nevada, and I see he, with a determined look on his face, has taken his seat, I assume the last word on that issue has been uttered.

   Mr. McCONNELL. There are two cloture votes. The Democratic leader laid down what is typically referred to as Shays-Meehan, the bill that passed the House. The assistant Democratic leader second-degreed that with the underlying ``McCain-Feingold lite'' and filed cloture on both. 
   Under the rules of the Senate, those votes would occur Tuesday morning. The dilemma we now have is, we are in a position where colleagues on our side of the aisle are unable to offer amendments.

   What I suggest to both of the Senators, who have been waiting patiently, is to describe the amendment that would have been offered had the Senator been given an opportunity to do so, and put that in the RECORD. Maybe at some point between now and Tuesday, there will be some change of heart. But I think we ought to say to the Senate what the Senator wanted to be able to do had he been permitted.

   Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, as a practical matter, I repeat what I said earlier. The offering of amendments to the rest of the tree would be a waste of time. Several of the amendments my colleagues want to offer would not be germane postcloture. 
   We are, as a result of the actions of the other side, on a glidepath to two cloture votes on Tuesday. But we will have an opportunity to discuss amendments that would have been offered could they have been offered and that would have been offered, if this parliamentary situation would have allowed it. 
   I encourage, in addition, Senator BURNS, who has already talked about his amendment, and Senators SESSIONS, THOMPSON, LIEBERMAN, NICKLES, HATCH, and HAGEL to take the opportunity--if not today at least on Monday--to come over to the Senate and describe the amendments they would have offered and put them in the RECORD so everyone is aware of the opportunities that were missed. 
   I was listening with some interest to the Senator from Arizona earlier in describing what he perceived to be the position of the business community in this country with regard to non-Federal money. The Senator described the views of a business group which until a few months ago no one had ever heard of, and more specifically the recommendations of a subcommittee of that group that was dominated by businessmen who have contributed to Democrats over 2-to-1 and leaving out of the description the remainder of that business groups' views on campaign finance reform, which are for public funding, taxpayer funding, of elections and spending limits, which is such a bizarre position these days. It hasn't even been advocated by the other side in the last few years. I think it is safe to say that this little-known business group does not represent the views of American business. 
   Let me take a few moments to outline the views of American business on the issue before us. 
   There are 10 business groups representing over 4 million businesses, and 40 million employees representing the Business and Industry Political Action Committee, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the National Mining Association, the National Restaurant Association, the National Association of Realtors, the National Association of Manufacturers, the National Association of Business Political Action Committees, the Associated Builders and Contractors, the National Association of Wholesaler-Distributors, and the National Association of Broadcasters, a media group, all of whom signed the following letter:  
   As the leading business associations in America, we oppose the current campaign finance reform legislation being debated in the Senate and strongly oppose that which recently passed the U.S. House of Representatives. *.*.* the tenets of McCain-Feingold and the House-passed Shays-Meehan Bill run contrary to the First Amendment guarantees of freedom of speech. * * * * * 
   Further regulating issue advocacy should be rejected as an infringement on the basic right of free speech. We are also concerned that these bills decrease opportunities and incentives for citizen participation in the election process. * * * * * 
   Just as over-regulation distorts the commercial marketplace, so can over-regulation distort the marketplace of political ideas. * * * * *

   Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, it has been suggested that somehow members of the business community believe they have to contribute to political campaigns. Nothing could be further from the truth. I am familiar with a number of companies that do not contribute non-Federal money, as is their right. We appreciate those who do choose to support our party and give us an opportunity to engage in issue advocacy, voter turnout, and other projects that are funded by non-Federal money, which gives us an opportunity to compete in the marketplace of ideas and gives us a chance to win elections. For those who do choose to participate, we want to thank you. 
   I also suggest to those who do not want to, don't feel obliged to. There are plenty other members of the business community who want to get involved, who want to help advance the cause that my party stands for, and we are grateful for their support. 
   I don't know whether we are going to have any more speakers. I want to check with our floor staff and see if we might not be at a point to wrap it up.

   Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, here we are again. I think it is appropriate to say that campaign finance is a clinical term for ``constitutional freedom.'' 
   Make no mistake, the essence of this debate is indeed freedom--fundamental first amendment freedom of speech and association guaranteed to every American, citizen group, candidate, and party. That is the view of the U.S. Supreme Court, the view of the American Civil Liberties Union, and the view of most Republicans. Soft money, issue advocacy, express advocacy, PACs, and all the rest are nothing more than euphemisms for first-amendment-protected political speech and association means of amplifying one's voice in this vast Nation of 270 million people. 
   It is important to remember that Dan Rather and Peter Jennings have a lot of speech, and the editorial page of the New York Times has a big audience. But the typical American citizen and the typical candidate, unless he or she can amass the resources to project their voices to a larger audience, just simply doesn't have as much speech as the press. So the means to amplify one's voice in this vast Nation of 270 million people is critical and constitutionally protected. It is no more complicated than that and no less vital to our democracy than the freedom of the press, which has taken a great interest in this issue. 
   Just thinking of the New York Times editorial page, for example, I think they have had 113 editorials on this subject since the beginning of 1997. That is an average of about one every nine days--issue advocacy, if you will, paid for by corporate soft money, expressing their view, which they have a right to do, on this important issue before us. 
   But as we look at this long odyssey of campaign finance reform, we have come a long way in the last decade, those of us who see through the reform patina--from the push 10 years ago for taxpayer financing of congressional campaigns and spending limits, and even such lunacy as taxpayer-financed entitlement programs for candidates to counteract independent expenditures, a truly bizarre scheme long gone from the congressional proposals but now echoed, interestingly enough, in the campaign reform platform of Presidential candidate Bill Bradley, who advocates a 100-percent tax--a 100-percent tax on issue advocacy. So if you were so audacious as to go out and want to express yourself on an issue, the Government would levy a 100-percent tax on your expression and give the money to whoever the Government thought was entitled to respond to it--a truly loony idea. 
   That was actually in the campaign finance bills we used to debate in the late 1980s and early 1990s and now is in the platform of one of the candidates for President of the United States, believe it or not. 
   So it was just 2 years ago that spending limits were thrown overboard from the McCain-Feingold bill and that the PAC and bundling bans were thrown overboard as well. Now the focus becomes solely directed at citizens groups and parties, which is the form McCain-Feingold took last year. Now, this month, the McCain-Feingold odyssey has arrived at the point that if it were whittled down any further, only the effective date would remain. As it is, McCain-Feingold now amounts to an effective date on an ineffectual provision. 
   Obviously, it is not surprising that that is my view. But it is also the view of the League of Women Voters, which opposes the current version of McCain-Feingold. 
   To achieve what proponents of this legislation profess to want to achieve--a reduction of special interest influence--if you want to do that, I think that is not a good idea at all, it is blatantly unconstitutional and the wrong thing to do. But if you wanted to do it, you would certainly have to deal with all the avenues of participation, not just political parties. Nonparty 
   soft money as well as party soft money, independent expenditures, candidate spending--all of the gimmicks advanced through the years in the guise of reform--all would have to be treated, if you truly wanted to quiet the voices of all of these citizens, which is what the reformers initially sought to do. 
   The latest and leanest version of McCain-Feingold falls far short of that which would be needed if you were inclined to want to do this sort of thing to limit special interest influence. As the League of Women Voters contends--mind you, there is the first time I have ever agreed with them on anything--as they contend, you would have to treat all of the special interests if you were truly interested in quieting the voices of all of these Americans who belong to groups. 
   It could not be more clear that this sort of McCain-Feingold-light that is currently before us is designed only to penalize the parties and to shift the influence to other avenues. That is precisely what it would do. It could not be more clear. Prohibiting only party soft money accomplishes absolutely nothing. It is only fodder for press releases and would make the present system worse and not better. 
   That is quite aside from the matter of unconstitutionality and whether the parties have less first amendment rights to engage in soft money activities than other groups. If this were to be enacted, that issue would surely be settled by the Supreme Court, which is, of course, the Catch-22 of the reformers. The choice is between the ineffectual unconstitutional and the comprehensively unconstitutional. A younger generation would call that a choice between ``dumb and dumber.'' 
   For reality ever to square with reformer rhetoric, the Constitution would have to be amended and political speech specifically carved out of the first amendment scope of protection. 
   There are those in this body who have actually proposed amending the Constitution. We had that debate in March of 1997. And, believe it or not, 38 Senators out of 100 voted to do just that--to amend the first amendment for the first time in 200 years to give the Government the power to restrict all spending, and in support of or in opposition to candidates. The ACLU calls that a ``recipe for repression.'' But that got 38 votes. You could at least give those people credit for honesty. They understand that in order to do what the reformers seek to do, you really would have to change the first amendment for the first time in 200 years. 
   So what the McCain-Feingold saga comes down to is an effort to have the Government control all spending by, in support of, or in opposition to candidates, with a little loophole carving out the media's own spending, of course. 
   That this effort is allowed to be advanced as reform is one of the tragedies of our time. Fortunately, enough Senators on this side of the aisle have had the courage to forestall this assault on freedom for the past decade and have proven by example that there is a constituency for protecting constitutional freedom.

   Mr. MCCONNELL. Let me read some of the letter.  
   The AFL-CIO is writing to express its opposition to the new seemingly watered down McCain-Feingold bill. While it is true that the most obvious direct legislative attacks on issue advocacy have been removed from the bill, S. 1593 continues to abridge the first amendment rights of those who want to support party issue advocacy. The soft money restrictions proposed in S. 1593 are just another less direct way to restrain issue advocacy and therefore should be opposed.  
   I think that, plus the balance of the letter, sums up the constitutional arguments against the latest version of McCain-Feingold. 
   Earlier it had been my hope there would be an amendment offered by the other side. Seeing that is not the case, I am prepared to move forward and lay down the first amendment of this debate in which we are engaged.

   Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, the Senator from Wisconsin is here. We want to talk a little bit in the course of this debate on the amendment that I sent to the desk about the issue of corruption. There have been a lot of charges of corruption both on and off the floor. I think these are very serious charges and I think they warrant some discussion, not only for our colleagues but for the members of the public who are interested in this issue.  
   My colleague from Arizona gave a moving speech in Bedford, NH, a few months ago to kick off his Presidential campaign. In that speech, my friend from Arizona laid out his vision of America with strong, and I must say, compelling statements about what he firmly believes to be corruption in American politics. If there is one thing that is often said about our colleague from Arizona, it is that he is a straight shooter and that he calls it as he sees it. I certainly wouldn't argue with that. 
   Based on the Senator's speech in New Hampshire and his remarks about his legislation, I assume I am correct in inferring that the Senator from Arizona believes the legislative process has been corrupted. I think he said that in the Wall Street Journal today. I don't believe I am misquoting him. I hope I am not. I see his staffer on the floor. I don't want to be talking about your boss in his absence, and I hope I am not misquoting him. I certainly hope he will come back to the floor for this debate. 
   What I will do is run through a few of the recent statements of the Senator from Arizona about corruption to be sure that the Senate fully understands his strongly held views on this subject. 
   Again, I encourage my friend from Arizona to come back to the floor because I certainly don't want to be talking about him in his absence, although I will say these quotes are quite precise and I assure him that I am not misquoting his observations in any way. 
   The Senator from Arizona, in discussing the subject of campaign finance reform in Bedford, NH, on June 30 of this year said:  
   I think most Republicans understand that soft money, the enormous sums of money given to both parties by just about every special interest in the country, corrupts our political ideals, whether it comes from big business or from labor bosses and trial lawyers.  
   Quoting further from my friend from Arizona, he says:  
   In truth, we are all shortchanged by soft money, liberal and conservative alike. All of our ideals are sacrificed. We are all corrupted. I know this is a harsh judgment, [says Senator MCCAIN] but it is, I'm sorry to say, a fair one.  
   So the principal quote from my friend from Arizona is that ``We are all corrupted.'' 
   He goes on to say:  
   Pork barrel spending is a direct result of unlimited contributions from special interests.  
   My friend from Arizona, also on CNN Early Edition, July 1 of this year, said:  
   We have seen debasement of the institutions of government, including the corruption of Congress because of the influence of special interests.  
   Further, my friend from Arizona said:  
   Soft money is corrupting the process.  
   Then on Fox News, Sunday, on June 27 of this year, my friend from Arizona said:  
   I talked to Republicans all over America, including up here in New Hampshire, and when I tell them about the corruption that exists they nod their heads.  
   My friend from Arizona goes on:  
   I think that Americans don't hold us in the esteem and with the respect that the profession deserves and that's because the profession has become permeated with special interests, which have caused corruption, which have then caused them to lose confidence in government.  
   And the Senator from Arizona went on:  
   I'm trying to eliminate the soft money which has corrupted our legislative process, and I think soft money has permeated American politics. It has corrupted the process and it has to be eliminated.  
   And then in New Hampshire on July 3:  
   Young people think politicians are corrupt. Know what? We are [said the Senator from Arizona] all corrupt.  
   Then on This Week on ABC, October 3, 1999, George Will said to the Senator from Arizona:  
   Have you ever been or can you name a Republican who has ever been corrupted by the Republican National Committee?  
   The Senator from Arizona said:  
   Not by the Republican National Committee, but all of us have been corrupted by the process where big money and big influence--and you can include me in the list where big money has bought access which has bought influence. Anybody who glances at the so-called 1996 Telecommunications Reform Act and then looks at the results--which is an increase in cable rates, phone rates, mergers, and lack of competition--clearly knows that the special interests are protected in Washington at the public. And the public interest is submerged.  
   George Will said:  
   This is soft money to parties, that itself leads to corruption of Republicans?  
   And the Senator from Arizona says:  
   Of course it does, George, and you work there and you see it.  
   Now my colleague from Arizona, on the Telecommunications Act of 1996, said:  
   During hearings for the 1996 Telecommunications Act, every company affected by the legislation had purchased a seat at the table with soft money.  
   Now that was in a Bedford, NH, speech of June 30 of this year. 
   Referring now to the web site of my colleague from Arizona, there are charts that list accusations and lists of projects. Let me quote from the web site:  
   In the last several years while Republicans have controlled Congress, special interest earmarks in appropriations bills have dramatically increased. The rise in pork barrel spending is directly related to the rise of soft money, as Republicans and Democrats scramble to reward major donors to our campaigns.  
   Straight from the web site, ``It's Your Country.'' And then there are projects listed as examples of projects presumably inserted into bills as a result of soft money contributions. 
   There is $26 million to compensate fishermen, fish processors, and fishing crews negatively affected by restrictions on fishing in Glacier Bay National Park, and $70 million for expanding a livestock assistance program to include reindeer, both those projects in Alaska, projects which--I assume the allegation is--were inserted in a bill as a result of a soft money contribution, which, as we all know, can only go to political parties. 
   In the State of Utah, the site lists $2.2 million for sewer infrastructure associated with the 2002 winter games in Utah as an example of an appropriations insertion, presumably as a result of some soft money contribution to a political party. 
   Then it lists the State of Washington, $1.3 million for the WTO Ministerial Meeting in Seattle, WA, and an exemption for the Crown Jewel Mine, in Washington, to deposit mining waste on land adjacent to the mine. 
   Further, on September 26, 1999, the Daily Outrage from the web site says:  
   The largest producer of ethanol, Archer-Daniels-Midland Corporation, who gave lavishly to both political parties--for their contribution, ADM recently received an extension of ethanol subsidies totaling $75 million. It also suggested that ADM also benefits from sugar support programs that keep the price of corn syrup artificially high. This sweetheart deal gets ADM another $200 million a year.  
   Then today in the Wall Street Journal, the Senator from Arizona says:  
   In the past several years, while Republicans controlled Congress, earmarks in appropriations bills have dramatically increased. The reason for this pork barrel spending is that Republicans and Democrats are scrambling to reward major donors to their campaigns.  
   The Senator from Arizona, I see, is on the floor. I am just interested in engaging in some discussion here about what specifically--which specific Senators he believes have been engaged in corruption. 
   I know he said from time to time the process is corrupted. But I think it is important to note, for there to be corruption, someone must be corrupt. Someone must be corrupt for there to be corruption. 
   So I just ask my friend from Arizona what he has in mind here, in suggesting that corruption is permeating our body and listing these projects for the benefit of several States as examples.

   Mr. MCCONNELL. By the way, I only quoted the Senator's comments and everything was quoted accurately. I raised the Senator's own words in the debate, words he has used as a justification for this bill that is currently before us. 
   I ask the Senator from Arizona, how can it be corruption if no one is corrupt? That is like saying the gang is corrupt but none of the gangsters are. If there is corruption, someone must be corrupt. 
   On the Senator's web site, he names some projects that he specifically says are in these bills as a result of soft money contributions which, of course, as we all know, cannot be received by anybody who votes anyway; they are given to a party. 
   I repeat my question to the Senator from Arizona: Who is corrupt?

   Mr. MCCONNELL. If the Senator will yield for one observation before Senator MCCAIN responds, Senate rule XLIII seems to be the rule that applies here. It says: The decision to provide assistance may not be made on the basis of contributions or services, or on promises of contributions or services, to the Member's political campaigns or to other organizations in which the Member has a political, personal, or financial interest. That is Senate rule XLIII relating to constituent service, which appears to be the applicable Senate rule in this situation.

   Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, the Senator from Arizona has not named the Senators who were allegedly responsible for inserting all of the provisions that he listed in various and assorted bills, which he suggests were inserted as a result of soft money contributions to political parties. 
   So the question remains: Who were the Senators? 
   There was, however, at the end of his remarks, a not-so-veiled reference to this Senator, to which I would like to respond. Senator MCCAIN suggested, I assume, as I heard him correctly a few moments ago, that as a result of the tobacco debate last year--and I might mention to my colleagues I have 45,000 tobacco growers; before the Clinton administration, I had 60,000 tobacco growers, and they are falling daily. These are the hard-working farmers engaged in producing a legal crop that representatives of Kentucky, regardless of party, seek to defend. 
   In any event, Senator MCCAIN brought up the way the tobacco debate ended last year, and there were allegations in the paper that this Senator, the Senator from Kentucky, had said to everyone: Don't worry about defeating the tobacco bill, the tobacco companies will be out there doing issue ads. 
   As a result of that assertion, there was a complaint filed against me, and I want to refer to a letter from the Justice Department of January 29, 1999, to Chairman ORRIN HATCH:  
   I am writing in further response to your letter of September 8, 1998, regarding the complaint filed with the Federal Election Commission by the National Center For Tobacco-Free Kids. Consistent with the Department's longstanding practice, we deferred any inquiry until issues arising under the Federal election laws have been reviewed by the FEC. We did, however, agree to review the portions of that complaint related to 18 U.S.C. 201 [which is a criminal statute]. After careful examination, the criminal division has concluded that there is insufficient  evidence to warrant a criminal investigation.  
   So the suggestion that the Senator from Arizona was making was that I, representing 45,000 tobacco growers, was somehow trying to defeat a tobacco bill because of some alleged assistance by the tobacco industry to political parties. I might say to the Senator from Arizona, I am deeply offended by that. I don't know who are the most important and largest number of constituents in Arizona that he works for, but I try to help the 45,000 tobacco growers in my State. I try to defeat tobacco bills when they come before the body, as did Wendell Ford of the Democratic Party when he was here all those years. I don't need any contribution from anybody to myself, to the National Republican Senatorial Committee, any of our 
   parties, or anybody, to stand up and defend the 45,000 tobacco growers from my State. 
   So I repeat to the Senator from Arizona, the question before us is not reading a list of what he considers to be inappropriate projects. That is not the issue. The issue is, where is the corruption? You cannot have corruption unless somebody is corrupt. There is not corruption without somebody being corrupt. You can't say the gang is corrupt and none of the gangsters are. If the Senator from Arizona believes there is corruption, he has an obligation, under the Senate rules and the Federal bribery statute, to name the people. Who is being corrupt? Who are the people putting all of these items in these bills? What was their impetus for doing it? Who made the contribution, as the Senator from Utah said, and to whom? Where is the corruption?

   Mr. President, we are not bogged down; we are just getting started. We just took the bill up a few moments ago. At the heart of this whole debate--elevated now to a Presidential campaign--are allegations of corruption. 
   All I am asking is a very simple question: Where is the corruption? The Senator from Utah is trying to get an answer to his question, and I haven't heard it yet. I know the State of Washington is also listed on the web site. I wonder if the Senator from Washington would also like to take the floor. I ask my colleague from Washington if he has also noted the web site that we were discussing earlier, in which a couple of projects from Washington are referred to.

Listed on the web site of Senator MCCAIN are examples of ``pork barrel spending is a direct result of unlimited contributions from special interests.''

I do not recall a situation where you have corporate contributions to the government that might then--it is a mysterious thing to think that kind of a proposal could be a result of soft money. It is important to remember that candidates for office can't receive soft money anyway. The contribution is to a party, and parties don't vote. I am astonished by the allegation. I am not sure I can answer the question because it is a mystery.

   We have here rampant charges of corruption and yet no names are named, no transactions are named. You know it is not unusual for the newspapers looking to sell copies or talking heads looking for air time to point to an alignment of interests among member parties, issue groups, and contributors and speculators maybe even going so far as to infer that official actions were taken in exchange for campaign support.

   How can there be corruption unless someone is engaging in corrupt activity? I say to my friend from Washington, as I said earlier in this debate, that is similar to saying the gang is corrupt but none of the gangsters is.

   What we really are talking about in this particular debate on this particular amendment, which I will describe in a moment and have not described yet, is the whole notion that there is corruption. Yet no one is named. Somebody is alluded to, as the Senator from Utah and the Senator from Washington were, yet there is no proof.

   Mr. MCCONNELL. If to appropriate an unauthorized sum of funds were a violation of Senate rules, there would be a lot of Senators in trouble around here. We try to do it through the authorization and then appropriations process, but to suggest that it is somehow unsavory or inappropriate behavior for there to be an appropriation without an authorization I think is stretching the matter quite a distance. There is certainly nothing improper about it. 
   We can have a policy argument about whether every single item ought to be authorized--and most of them are--but it certainly would not be appropriate to cast aspersions on the integrity of a Member of the Senate for trying to deliver something for his or her home State that might have at some point not been authorized by an authorizing committee. 
   What is new is Senators who serve here, walking these Halls every day, who meet with their fellow Senators every day, who watch their fellow Members take official actions every day, go before the American people and declare openly and with great conviction that votes are being bought in the Halls of the U.S. Capitol. When Senators make those kinds of allegations about their colleagues, I think we are suggesting they ought to back it up. They ought to back it up. 
   There are specific rules in the Senate that prevent taking an official action in order to reward somebody for a contribution. In addition to that, we have bribery statutes involving public officials:  
   Any public official who ``directly or indirectly,'' corruptly, demands, seeks, receives,  accepts, or agrees to receive or accept anything of value personally or for any other person or entity, in return for ..... being influenced in the performance of any official act ..... shall be fined under this title ..... or imprisoned for not more than 15 years, or both, and may be disqualified from holding any office of honor, trust, or profit under the United States.  
   We have suggestions of violations not only of Senate rules but 
   of Federal bribery statutes, without specifics. That is unfair to the Members of this body who are doing their very best to represent their constituents who are honest, hard-working, and good citizens. It is unfair to the Members of the Senate to have these aspersions cast on their honor and the honor of this institution. 
   There is an amendment at the desk which is the subject of this debate. Let me describe what it would do. It is an amendment that would amend the Senate Code of Conduct to create an affirmative duty for all Senators who report any credible information of corruption directly to the Ethics Committee. As a former chairman of the Ethics Committee, I am familiar with Ethics Committee rule 3 that requires every member of the Ethics Committee to report credible information of corruption to the committee. 
   The charges of corruption that are being made in this body require Members to extend the Ethics Committee rule to the full Senate. In the past, there has been an affirmative duty on the part of members of the Ethics Committee to report information about corruption directly to the committee. I think that now should be extended to the whole Senate because we have a number--at least two Members of the Senate--who have been alleging corruption. They have an affirmative duty, if this amendment passes, to report that corruption to the Ethics Committee so we can all get to the bottom of it because these allegations demean the entire Senate. 
   The message of this amendment is simple. If any Member of this body knows of corruption, he or she must formally report it to the Ethics Committee. In addition, the amendment also amends the Federal Criminal Code to establish mandatory minimum penalties for public officials who engage in corruption. 
   Our criminal law is full of mandatory minimum penalties already. We have imposed them for a variety of different offenses over the years. For example, arson on Federal property requires a mandatory minimum penalty of 5 years in prison; special immigration attorneys disclosing classified information requires a mandatory minimum penalty of 10 years imprisonment; bribery involving meat inspectors requires a minimum of 3 years imprisonment; bribery involving harbor employees requires a minimum of 6 months imprisonment. 
   We have mandatory minimum penalties for bribery involving harbor employees and meat inspectors. Surely it is not too much to ask we establish mandatory minimum penalties for bribery involving public officials. 
   My amendment establishes that a conviction involving bribery of public officials as set forth in 18 USC 201 triggers a mandatory minimum penalty of $100,000, 1 year imprisonment, and disqualification from holding any office of honor, trust, or profit under the United States. 
   As Henry Clay once stated, ``Government is a trust and the officers of the government are trustees.'' I believe that principle to be true. These amendments firmly establish the principle in our Senate Code of Conduct in our criminal law. 
   Before we pass laws that restrict the free speech rights of every American citizen, we should restrict ourselves. Let's regulate the 100 men and women who cast votes in this great body before we regulate the speech of more than 250 million Americans. 
   I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   I agree with the suggestions that have been made that we go back and forth. As you know, this is not a straight party-line issue. So I think back and forth means people who are generally in sympathy with this legislation offer an amendment; people who are not do not offer an amendment.

   Mr. MCCONNELL. I am going to take a couple minutes, and then I will yield the floor. I know the Senator from New York has been waiting patiently. 
   The debate we just had has been an effort--toward the end of it--to shift it in a different direction. We are going to come back to this over and over again for the next 3 or 4 days. 
   We are not just talking about the appearance of corruption. What the Senator from Arizona has repeatedly said is things such as, ``corrupts our political ideals,'' ``we are all corrupted,'' ``the corruption of Congress,'' ``soft money is corrupting the process.'' 
   These have been allegations of corruption, which is a violation of Senate rules and a violation of Federal bribery statutes. 
   I would suggest to all of our colleagues, in our exuberance to pursue our different points of view on this issue, do not suggest corruption unless you have evidence of corruption. It demeans the Senate, and in the instances of Senators BENNETT and GORTON, it demeans a specific Senator. It is clear from this debate, there is no evidence--none whatsoever--of corruption. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. McCONNELL. I am grateful they did because it gave us an opportunity to compete with the newspapers and the special interest groups that have a constitutional right to participate in the political process. I am extraordinarily grateful that all of these disclosed contributions--and this is why my friend from Tennessee knows who contributed--extraordinarily grateful that these companies are giving us the opportunity to engage in vote buying, engage in getting out the vote, engage in issue advocacy, and the other things that benefit our parties. 
   I am extremely grateful they do that. And anybody who wants to make an issue out of it, it is fully disclosed, which is why my friend from Tennessee has the list.

   May I ask the Senator a question? 
   The Senator from Arizona was talking--again, I am trying to understand what he said and you said, I say to Senator THOMPSON--that the appearance is the problem and not the reality. I guess the argument then is, based on appearance, we should enact legislation. Appearance we can only ascertain by looking at polls, so let me----

   Mr. McCONNELL. Let me give you poll data of how people feel about newspapers and see if the Senator thinks we ought to legislate based on the appearance there to restrict the activities of newspapers. 
   A poll taken in September of 1997 indicated that 86 percent of the American people believe newspapers should be required to provide equal coverage of congressional candidates; 80 percent want restrictions placed on the way newspapers cover political 
   campaigns; 68 percent believe newspaper editorials are more influential than a $1,000 contribution; 70 percent believe reporter bias influences the coverage of politics; 61 percent believe the candidate preferred by a reporter will beat the candidate with more money; and 42 percent believe newspaper editorial boards should be required to have both Republicans and Democrats. 
   This is the public's perception of the newspapers, which operate under the first amendment, just as American citizens and parties do. 
   If the argument is that we should pass legislation restricting first amendment rights based upon perception, I am wondering if the Senators also believe we ought to eliminate the newspaper exemption from the Federal Election Campaign Act and react to the public perception that newspapers need a bit of this Government regulation of speech as well?

   Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, let me second what the assistant Democratic leader has said. That is the anticipation with regard to the VA-HUD. 
   Mr. President, seeing no one on the floor at the moment, I thought I might make a few observations about the debate in which we are currently engaged. 
   One of the commonly stated myths that we have heard throughout the day is that soft money in our current campaign finance system is the cause of unprecedented public cynicism about, and distrust of, government. The truth is, according to a study published by Oxford Press in 1999, which was coordinated by the faculty of the Kennedy school and which benefited from the participation of scholars from the University of Michigan, the University of Arizona, and the University of Illinois, public trust in government and cynicism about government predates not only soft money but also the events that prompted the original Federal Election Campaign Act. According to this study, public trust in the Federal Government has suffered a fairly steady decline since 1958, when 75 percent of the American people trusted the Federal Government most of the time. 
   By the end of the Carter administration, this number had dropped to approximately 25 percent. This trend was temporarily reversed during the Reagan administration, but during the subsequent administrations, it again declined to near pre-Reagan levels of distrust. The fact that our campaign finance system and soft money have not caused a precipitous drop in public trust and an unprecedented increase in cynicism is confirmed by an even more recent study by two Harvard professors, which is going to press at the Princeton University Press. This study shows that trust in government did not precipitously decline during the scandal-ridden 1996 Presidential campaign. 
   These studies show that, according to most recent data available to these distinguished scholars, levels of public trust in government are currently no higher than they were in 
   1994 or at the end of the Carter administration in 1980. Simply put, the best and most recent scholarship establishes that public distrust of government predates our current campaign finance system and soft money, and the advent of our current campaign finance system and soft money have not accelerated the relatively steady decline in public trust that began in 1958. So it is clear that this debate we are having has absolutely nothing to do with the steady decline of confidence in our government. 
   Now, the prescription for this steady decline that has been offered by a variety of so-called reformers around here has been tried in some other democracies. 
   Let's look at Canada, for example. Our neighbors to the north already have passed many of the types of regulations supported by the proponents of the various reforms that are before the Senate or have been before the Senate in recent years. Canada has adopted the following regulations of political speech: spending limits that all national candidates must abide by to be eligible to receive taxpayer matching funds. Candidates can spend $2 per voter for the first 15,000 votes they get, $1 per voter for all the votes up to 25,000, and 50 cents per voter beyond 25,000. 
   Canada also has spending limits on parties that restrict parties to spending the product of a multiple used to account for cost of living times the number of registered voters in each electoral district in which the party has a candidate running for office. Right now, it comes out to about a dollar a voter. 
   Canada also has indirect funding via media subsidies. The Canadian Government requires that radio and television networks provide all parties with a specified amount of free air time during the month prior to an election. The government also provides subsidies to defray the costs of political publishing and gives tax credits to individuals and corporations which donate to candidates and/or parties. 
   That is the prescription in Canada. It is not all that dissimilar to the ones that have been promoted here in recent years, up to and including the bill we currently have before us.  
   Let's look at the attitude about government in Canada after all of these reforms. The most recent political science studies of Canada demonstrate that, despite all of this regulation of political speech by candidates and parties, the number of Canadians who feel ``the government doesn't care what people like me think'' has grown from roughly 45 percent to 67 percent. Confidence in the national legislature, after the enactment of all of these speech controls, has dropped from 49 percent to 21 percent. The number of Canadians satisfied with their system of government has declined from 51 percent to 34 percent. 
   Let's take a look at Japan. According to the Congressional Research Service:  
   Japanese election campaigns, including campaign financing, are governed by a set of comprehensive laws that are the most restrictive among democratic nations.  
   After forming a seven-party coalition government in August 1993, Prime Minister Hosokawa placed campaign finance reform at the top of his agenda. He asserted that his reforms would restore democracy in Japan. In November 1994, his reform legislation passed. After this legislation, the Japanese Government imposed the following restrictions on political speech: 
   Candidates are forbidden from donating to their own campaigns. Any corporation that is a party to a government contract, grant, loan, or subsidy is prohibited from making or receiving any political contributions for 1 year after they receive such a contract, grant, loan, or subsidy. 
   There are strict limits on what corporations and unions and individuals may give to candidates and parties. There are limits on how much candidates may spend on their own campaigns. 
   Candidates are prohibited from buying any advertising in magazines and newspapers beyond the five print media ads of a specified length that the government purchases for each candidate. 
   Parties are allotted a specified number of government-purchased ads of a specified length. The number of ads a party gets is based on the number of candidates they have running. It is illegal for these party ads to discuss individual candidates. 
   In Japan, candidates and parties spend nothing on media advertising because not only are they prohibited from purchasing print media ads, but they are also prohibited from buying time on television or radio. 
   The government requires TV stations to permit parties and each candidate a set number of television and radio ads during the 12 days prior to the election. 
   Each candidate gets one government-subsidized televised broadcast. 
   The government's election management committee provides each candidate with a set number of signboards and posters that subscribe to the standard government-mandated format. 
   The Election Management Committee also designates the places and times candidates may give speeches. 
   The government says when candidates may speak, and where they may speak. 
   You may ask: What happened after these exacting regulations on political speech that amount to a reformer's wish list were imposed in Japan? Did cynicism decline? Did trust in government increase? Not so, as you notice. 
   Following the imposition of these regulations, the number of Japanese saying they had no confidence in legislators rose to 70 percent. 
   Following these regulations, only 12 percent of Japanese believe the government is responsive to the people's opinions and wishes. 
   The percentage of Japanese satisfied with the Nation's political system fell to 5 percent. 
   Voter turnout continued to decline. 
   Let's take a look at France. 
   In France, there is significant regulation of political speech with government funding of candidates, government funding of parties, free radio and television time, reimbursement for printing posters, and for campaign-related transportation. 
   In France, they ban contributions to candidates by any entity except parties to PACs. 
   Individual contributions to parties are limited. 
   Strict expenditure limits are set for each electoral district in place. 
   Every single candidate's finances are audited by the Commission Nationale, generally known as CCFP, to ensure compliance with the rules. 
   Despite all of these regulations on political speech in France, the latest studies indicate the French people's confidence in their government and political institutions has continued to decline. Voter turnout has continued to decline. 
   Let's look at Sweden. 
   Sweden imposed the following regulations on political speech: There is no fundraising for spending for individual candidates at all. Citizens merely vote for parties which assign seats on the proportion of votes they receive. 
   The government subsidizes print ads by the parties. 
   Despite the fact that Sweden allows no fundraising or spending for individual candidates, since these requirements have been in force the number of Swedes disagreeing with the statement that ``parties are only interested in people's votes, not in their opinions'' has declined from 51 percent to 28 percent. 
   The number of people expressing confidence in the Swedish Parliament has declined from 51 percent to 19 percent. 
   So it is clear that many assertions made by the proponents of additional campaign finance regarding the causal link between the campaign finance system or soft money, and voter turnout, public cynicism, national pride, and the health of our democracy are not supported but actually contradicted by the best and most recent scholarship and empirical data available from prestigious academics at institutions such as the Kennedy School at Harvard and the University of California System's Center for the Study of Democracy, and contrary to the experience of the other industrialized democracies that have passed the type of measures desired by proponents of more regulation of political speech. 
   The rationale for all of this has been that we need to clean up the system, squeezing out all of these private interests so everybody will have more confidence in the government. 
   That didn't work anywhere overseas. So let's take a look at the United States. 
   Voter turnout at home: In the end, we don't even have to look at other countries to see that speech controls do not increase confidence, nor do they increase voter turnout. In 1974, as we all know, the Federal Election Campaign Act was expanded to limit the amount of money that Presidential candidates could raise and spend. That is the system under which the current candidates for President operate. 
   So if the reformers premise that limiting speech increases 
   turnout is true, then surely voting in American Presidential elections would have increased over the last 25 years. Let's look at the statistics. 
   In the 1950s and 1960s, before the passage of the Federal Election Campaign Act, the average voter turnout was consistently at 60 percent or higher. 
   So post-1974 must have been higher, right? After all, we passed the Federal Election Campaign Act. After all, the Congress supposedly gave us ``comprehensive reform'' for the Presidential system in 1974. 
   But the numbers show the emptiness of the reformers' rhetoric. The voter turnout for every Presidential election postreform has never reached 60 percent. In fact, the postreform high was 1992 when voter turnout reached 55 percent. 
   Even if one accepts the reformers' notion that voter turnout and voter confidence are problems in America, banning issue speech by political parties is clearly not the solution. Having less speech, less debate, and less discussion is clearly not going to have a positive impact on voter turnout, and there are simply no statistics--none whatsoever--to substantiate the claim that passing the kind of legislation which is before us today, or the kind that has been before us seemingly annually for the last 10 or 12 years, would have any impact whatsoever on reducing cynicism or raising turnout. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, there has been a lot of talk about where the so-called constitutional scholars are on the constitutionality of this measure and its other incarnations we have had before us in the last few years. 
   One of the scholars cited by the proponents of this legislation, Professor Robert W. Benson of Loyola Law School, wrote an article before NAFTA was enacted called, ``Free Trade as an Extremist Ideology.'' The article, to put it mildly, is critical of the North American Free Trade Agreement. 
   In it, Benson states:  
   Ideological extremism ..... is pushing an agenda of radical risk taking in the form of the North American Free Trade Agreement and the General Agreement on Tariffs.  
   He says free trade is ``a classic extremist ideology, just as, until recently, Marxism and Leninism was.'' 
   He says the idea of free trade fits ``two criteria that characterize extremist ideologies ..... [its] adherents are oblivious to cognitive dissonance contradicting their analyses, and (2) ..... [they] are willing to plunge themselves and others into great risks in the name of ideology.'' 
   He argued that enacting NAFTA would ``erode Democratic government in the United States.'' 
   This is one of the so-called constitutional scholars on this lengthy list being quoted. 
   He also wrote an article that purported to be about legal theory entitled, ``Deconstruction's Critics, the TV Scramble Effect and the Fajita Pita Syndrome.'' 
   Among academics, he is considered an expert on international law. He is not a constitutional law professor. 
   Many in favor of campaign finance reform and relying on Professor Benson's view of campaign finance reform disregarded Professor Benson's warnings about the North American Free Trade Agreement, an issue within his area of expertise. These Members, of course, include a number of the proponents of this legislation. 
   Another one of the constitutional scholars quoted by the other side is Professor Daan Braveman of Syracuse University College of Law. This outstanding scholar wrote an article discussing the first amendment----

   Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, it is my understanding that the tobacco provisions of this bill, will provide an additional $328,000,000 in funds for farmers who produce the major cigarette tobaccos--burley and flue-cured tobacco. It is those farmers who have been the most affected by recent developments with respect to the manufacture and use of cigarettes. It is those farmers also who are the subject of the recent ``Phase II Settlement'' in which moneys are being made available to burley and flue-cured tobacco growers through the use of State trusts. It is also my understanding that the bill's reference to those farms who receive ``quotas'' under the Agriculture Adjustment Act of 1938, is intentional, and does limit the relief, to burley and flue-cured tobacco. The reference to ``quotas'' is to poundage quotas and burley and flue-cured tobacco are the only tobaccos under the current regulatory scheme that receive poundage ``quotas'' as opposed to acreage allotments. This limitation to burley and flue-cured tobaccos is intentional and reflects recent developments.

   Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, to my amazement, we received a letter indicating the President might want to veto the foreign operations appropriations bill, a stunning development, it seems to me, almost inexplicable. 
   This bill, while not as much as the President requested, is as large as he signed last year and includes a number of items important not only to many of us but to him as well. 
   For example, if this bill were to ultimately be vetoed, the President would be vetoing--would be stopping--aid to the Newly Independent States of the former Soviet Union of $735 million; developmental assistance, which was $83 million over his request in this bill that he is threatening to veto; narcotics assistance at $285 million, which is $24 million above last year, the bill that he signed; for AIDS, $180 million to fight AIDS, which is $55 million above the bill that he signed last year; for UNICEF, an important program of the United Nations, there is $110 million in this bill for UNICEF, which is $5 million more than in the bill last year that he signed.

   Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, other items in this bill of interest: Child health, immunization, and education initiatives. For Kosovo--we fought a war there a few months ago--there is $535 million for Kosovo and for some of the countries surrounding Kosovo that were impacted by the war that was fought there. That is $142 million more than the President requested. 
   In addition, there is money in this bill for the environment, for biodiversity, for tropical rain forests, unique ecosystems initiatives. All of that will be denied if the President vetoes this bill. 
   For Lebanon and Cyprus, to help in the reconciliation process there, there is $15 million for Lebanon and $15 million for Cyprus. 
   Infectious diseases, especially polio and TB campaigns, which have been priorities of Senator LEAHY, all of that would be vetoed by this bill. 
   Funds for Georgia, for Ukraine, for Armenia, for Poland--all of which is supported vigorously by Americans of Georgian, Ukrainian, Armenian, and Polish descent--all of that would not go forward if this bill were vetoed. 
   The vote on this bill, when it went through the Senate--and it is not all that different now from the way it was when it cleared the Senate--was 97-2. This is virtually the same bill, at $12.6 billion, which protects virtually all of the Senate priorities passed here at 97-2. On the threat reduction initiative, we have spent $5.9 billion in Russia over the years. There are no restrictions on the $735 million we provide for that area of the world preventing funding of this new $250 million initiative to control the nuclear problem there. 
   On development assistance, the President claims it is dramatically underfunded. In fact, we not only exceeded last year's level--that is the bill President Clinton signed--we exceeded last year's level of spending and we have exceeded his request for this year. The President requested $83 million less than the conference has provided. 
   The veto threat to the Senator from Kentucky is inexplicable. It doesn't make any sense, unless this important bill for the assistance of Israel and Egypt and Armenia and Georgia and Ukraine and a number of other worthwhile causes that are supported around the world is somehow being made part of a larger strategy by the administration to veto all of these bills. 
   This bill enjoys strong support from AIPAC, from Armenian Americans, from Georgian Americans, Polish Americans, Latvian, Lithuanian, Estonian, and Ukranian Americans. They are but a few of the Americans who appreciate this bill. 
   As I indicated, all of these items are threatened by the President's inexplicable decision to threaten to veto this bill. 
   Finally, let me say, before turning to my friend and colleague from Vermont, Senator LEAHY, I don't know where the President wants to get more money for this bill. Are we going to take it out of the Social Security trust fund to spend on foreign aid? Is that what the President is suggesting we do? Does President Clinton want us to take money  out of the Social Security trust fund and spend it on foreign aid? I don't think that is something we ought to be doing. I don't think the American people would like that. 
   I repeat, this is a bill that was supported overwhelmingly on a bipartisan basis when it cleared the Senate the first time. It is about the same size as the bill the President signed last year. 
   I don't think there is any rational basis for the vetoing of this bill. I encourage the Senate to speak once again on a broad bipartisan basis with a large vote to support this important bill which means so much to peace and stability around the world. 
   With that, Mr. President, I understand we are planning on voting around noon. I yield the floor. 
   Mr. LEAHY addressed the Chair.

   Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, I am sorry my friend and colleague, the Senator from Vermont, is not going to be able to support the bill. But I do want to commend him for his ongoing effort with regard to demining. The Leahy War Victims Fund has had a dramatic impact not only on rehabilitation but also on safety; in addition, Senator LEAHY's interest in and devotion to the subject of infectious diseases. He has single-handedly driven the funding levels up. The surveillance, control, and treatment have improved throughout the world because of his commitment. 
   I commend him for that. 
   Mr. President, it is my understanding that both sides are interested in having this vote at noon. I am prepared to yield back my time, if Senator LEAHY is, and we will proceed with the vote.

    Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Bill Greely on the occasion of his retirement. My good friend Bill served as assistant manager and general manager of the Keeneland Association for 14 years, and is now stepping down from his successful 13-year post as the Association's president. 
   Bill is a true horseman. He grew up in the Keeneland community, and began spending time at the horse track when he was a small child. Bill began taking on responsibilities at the horse track when he was just seven years old, and has worked in almost every aspect of horse racing in tracks around the country--but it is clear that Bill has always been partial to Keeneland. In 1972, after years of moving around the country from track to track, he finally got his chance to return to his hometown, working at the track he loved. 
   Bill's long-time affiliation with Keeneland and love of horse racing made him an ideal candidate to manage the track and eventually become president. Bill's knowledge of the horse industry prepared him for his leadership role at Keeneland, and enabled him to make Keeneland one of the nation's premiere horse tracks. During his time at Keeneland, Bill updated the track's betting options, improved the grandstands and grounds, and brought Keeneland to a level of growth that will be hard to exceed or even match. 
   Keeneland would not be what it is today without Bill's leadership and guidance over the last 27 years--and Bill would not be where he is today without the love and support of his family. His wife Norma, and their children Sean, Kevin and Kara, endured numerous moves before they finally settled down in Lexington, and they have helped sustain Bill during his demanding career at Keeneland. A third generation horseman, Bill has seen first-hand what it takes to simultaneously work the track and raise a family--and he has happy, successful children to prove he made it work. 
   Thank you, Bill, for putting so much of yourself into Keeneland to make it a better place for others. Your hard work and successes have become your legacy, and will continue to impact the entire horse industry for years to come. My colleagues join me in congratulating you on a job well done, and wish you all the best as you enter this new stage in life.

    Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to offer a tribute to Kentucky State Senator David Williams,  as sincere congratulations for 15 years of service in the General Assembly and as encouragement for many more years of accomplishments and victories still to come. 
   David is one of the sharpest politicians and smartest people I know. His long-time passion for politics and desire to serve Kentucky is evidenced in his hard work in the Kentucky Senate--and in his perseverance getting there. David's strong convictions about issues and principles important to Kentuckians have helped him become a prominent figure in the State legislature, but his climb to the top was not an easy one. David lost his first campaign for public office when he ran for county judge-executive, and has often faced tough opposition in the Senate. To his credit, David has remained committed to his constituents and to the values they elected him to represent. 
   When he was elected to the Kentucky House of Representatives 15 years ago, David was a country lawyer from Burkesville, Kentucky. His sharp mind and peerless rhetorical skills were evident right from the start, and helped David eventually come to lead the now-Republican Majority in the Senate. 
   As a fellow public servant, I know first-hand the kinds of commitments and sacrifices that have to be made in order to effectively serve a constituency. Clearly, David has demonstrated his willingness to take on that responsibility, and has been an example through his ability to handle the daily demands of being a Senate leader. Additionally, he is a great family man. David's wife Elaine has surely been a great support and encouragement to him, and deserves commendation for her tireless work in the field of education, as the instructional supervisor for Cumberland County Schools. David is also devoted to his parents, Lewis and Flossie Williams, of Cumberland County. David's father served as Cumberland County clerk for nine consecutive terms, and was a high school principal and basketball coach when David was growing up. His parents' work in education and politics gave David a solid background that has prepared him well for his current leadership role in the State Senate, and will certainly continue to inspire him in future endeavors. 
   David, on behalf of my colleagues and myself, thank you for your fifteen years of service to the 16th district and to the people of Kentucky. I have every confidence in your ability to lead the State Senate, and know that your best days are yet to come.

    Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate Heather Renee French of Maysville, Kentucky, on her recent crowning as Miss America 1999. 
   Ms. French is an outstanding young woman who made all Kentuckians proud of her impressive showing at this year's prestigious Miss America pageant. She made history with her win on September 18, 1999, as the first Miss Kentucky ever to be named as the reigning Miss America--and the goal to help homeless Veterans she's set for her year-long term will likely make history as well. 
   Though young, Ms. French has accomplished a great deal in her 24 years. A graduate of the University of Cincinnati (U of C) undergraduate program and a student in the U of C Masters of Design school, she currently teaches at the U of C design school, and is working on a textbook for college-level design students. 
   Her resume boasts extensive service and volunteer experience, including working with the Make-A-Wish Foundation, volunteering at VA hospitals and with the Statewide Vietnam Veterans Awareness Campaign. It is refreshing to see an intelligent, successful young woman who takes the time to spend unpaid hours working to help others. 
   According to post-pageant interviews, Ms. French has indicated that the top priority with her newly-won title is to lobby Congress on behalf of America's Veterans. The daughter of a disabled Vietnam Veteran, Ms. French has become acutely aware of the problems Veterans face and the obstacles they often have to overcome. 
   I also would like to congratulate the French family, as this is their victory as well. They are to be commended for the love and support they provided throughout Heather's life, and throughout what was surely a busy summer preparing for the September pageant. Her father, Ron, deserves recognition as the inspiration for Heather's strong desire to help America's Veterans and for the Purple Heart he earned during the Vietnam War. As a father, it would encourage me to know that my daughters had learned something from a parents' adversity that would drive them to help others with similar experiences. 
   My colleagues and I join in congratulating you, Ms. French, on your success and wish you all the best in what will surely be an exciting year.

    Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the life of George P. Crounse, who passed away on August 22, 1999. His death marked the end of a five-decade career of entrepreneurship, community building, and philanthropy in Paducah, Kentucky. 
   A native of Minneapolis, Minnesota, George worked for the Tennessee Valley Authority and then Arrow Transportation Company, an Alabama firm. George served his country in the U.S. Navy during World War II, and came to Paducah in 1945, to work for Igert Towing. George realized the potential of his new hometown as a crossroads of the nation's major river ways, and Crounse Corporation began operations in 1949, when its first towboat, The Alice, began operation on the Ohio River. This was the beginning of George's dream to have his own company. 
   Crounse Corporation continued to grow over the years, and expanded operations to other parts of the inland waterway system. From that single boat, the Alice, grew one of the nation's largest towing companies which presently operates 25 towboats and 750 barges. Even more amazing, the only time George borrowed money for his operation was the $60,000 he borrowed to help construct that first boat. Aside from that initial loan, the Crounse Corporation balance sheets never showed debt. George continued to run the company as its chairman until only a few weeks prior to his death. 
   George led not only his own company to prosperity, but helped establish Paducah as a major center for river shipping, bringing economic growth and jobs to the area. His business acumen also was highly sought out in other areas such as banking. George was a firm believer in the principle of giving back to the community that had been so good to him, his family, and business. Entities such as the Paducah Public Library, Tilghman High School, and the new River Heritage Museum benefitted from George's generosity and guidance. We will probably never know the true extent of George's work to better the lives of all those in his community, and that's just the way George, a humble and modest man, would have wanted it. 
   George Crounse perhaps will best be remembered as a dogged advocate for education. In 1968, as a board member of Paducah Junior College, he helped bring the school into the statewide network of the University of Kentucky Community College System. George made sure that PJC retained ownership  of the property and buildings, making it the only community college in Kentucky controlled by the local community. When it appeared that the area was handicapped by the lack of an engineering school to serve college students in the area, George worked to establish an extension of the UK engineering school in Paducah. In fact, George and his wife, Eleanor, gave $4 million to help build a suitable facility to house the program. Though George was reluctant, the building was named Crounse Hall to acknowledge his leadership and generosity in bringing the dream to reality. 
   George's passing leaves a great void is left in Western Kentucky. His was truly a life well lived. I offer condolences to his wife of many years, Eleanor, and the entire Crounse family. I ask that my colleagues join me in honoring the achievements and contributions of this outstanding Kentuckian, and that an article from the Paducah Sun be printed in the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD. 
   The article follows. 
   Crounse's Legacy One of Generosity  
   People who knew barge company mogul George P. Crounse Sr. remember him for his ceaseless giving to the Paducah area and helping mold it into a hub of the nation's river industry. 
   ``I was honored to be able to tell people that George Crounse was my friend,'' said Paducah Community College President Len O'Hara. ``He was a wise, visionary and generous man. There's no doubt that he did more to shape the face of the college--both Paducah Community College and Paducah Junior College--than any other individual.'' 
   Mr. Crounse, 86, died at 8:24 p.m. Sunday at Western Baptist Hospital. Friends may call at Roth Funeral Chapel from 5 to 8 p.m. today. 
   Memorial services will be at 11 a.m. Wednesday at First Presbyterian Church, where he was a member. The Rev. Lynn Shurley will officiate. Burial will be private. 
   He was founder and past chairman of Crounse Corp., which he built from a single, leased boat to one of the nation's largest barge lines. He started the firm in 1948 after having worked with the Tennessee Valley Authority and seen how its dams improved navigation on the Tennessee River. He also knew Paducah was ideally situated near the confluence of two major rivers. 
   ``I had learned earlier that the Tennessee (river) is a side street,'' be once wrote, ``and the Ohio and Mississippi are the main highways.'' 
   About a month ago, in failing health, Mr. Crounse became chairman emeritus of the firm, making way for President Bill Dibert to take over as chairman. Mr. Crounse's son, Avery, a noted filmmaker, assumed the role of vice chairman. 
   My father was the first to show us to always plan for the inevitable,'' said Avery Crounse, who returned to Paducah to help run the business while continuing to make films. ``We've often said that no one will fill his shoes, but several of us will try to do that.'' 
   The same is true for Paducah, which will miss Mr. Crounse immeasurably, said O'Hara. ``People don't have any idea how much he's given to this community, not only with his mind, but also contributions of money.'' 
   In 1968, as a member of the Paducah Junior College Board of Trustees, Mr. Crounse fashioned the legal structure that brought the school into the University of Kentucky community college system while maintaining local ownership. 
   ``He made sure PJC retained ownership of the property and buildings, so the community still owns the college,'' O'Hara said. ``It's the only one in the nation that is locally owned.'' 
   Mr. Crounse, who told O'Hara repeatedly that higher education was Paducah's greatest need, and his wife, Eleanor, gave $4 million toward the PCC engineering school. But O'Hara said Mr. Crounse was reluctant to publicize the gift or have the school named after him and his wife. 
   ``I told my staff this morning that I'm so happy to have been able to get it finished and for it to become a community icon before his passing,'' O'Hara said. 
   Because of Mr. Counse's modesty, Paducahans will never know the real extent of his beneficence, O'Hara said. 
   ``The (public) library owes a great deal to George Crounse. Paducah Tilghman High School does, too, and a lot of other less visible charities,'' he said. ``He was very quiet about it and didn't want his named passed around, but he was always there.'' 
   In the 1960s, Mr. Crounse used his business savvy to boost the growth of Peoples First Corp., which became a large, regional banking firm before merging with Union Planters last year Aubrey Lippert, head of Union Planters' Paducah operation, was executive vice president when Mr. Crounse was a Peoples board member. 
   ``He was probably one of the best thinkers I've seen in being able to put together business plans and concepts and then methodically talk through how you would execute them,'' Lippert said. ``He was always very quiet, but as we used to say around our board table, when Mr. Crounse speaks, you need to listen because he always has his thoughts in order.'' 
   Lippert said Mr. Crounse's generosity began when he came to Paducah in 1948 and continued throughout his life. 
   ``He was a fine family man, had a great family and I have great admiration for Eleanor,'' Lippert said. ``He was the kind of citizen that you would love to have as many of as you could possibly have in the community. We'll sure miss George Crounse.'' 
   A native of Minneapolis, Mr. Crounse worked for TVA and later Arrow Transportation, a river towing company in Sheffield, Ala. After serving in the U.S. Navy in World War II, he joined Igert Towing in late 1945 and moved to Paducah. All along, he had a desire to form his own company. 
   That happened three years later when Mr. Crounse put down $40,000 in cash and borrowed $60,000, which he said gave him $88,000 to build his first towboat and $12,000 for working capital. He rented a towboat to get started. 
   In 1949, Mr. Crounse finished construction. The Alice, named after his aunt, and immediately starting towing chemical barges on the Ohio River. Steady growth of the company led to purchasing barges in 1951 and finishing a second towboat. The Louise, in 1952. By then, coal was the main cargo. 
   John Cathey remembers working on The Alice and becoming pilot of The Louise, named after Mr. Crounse's mother. As the firm added towboats, Mr. Crounse ran out of family names and began naming vessels after the wives of employees like Cathey's wife, Hazel. 
   ``That was a real honor at that time,'' Cathey said. ``He was a really smart man, and he had a good relationship with all the employees. There were times when people came in off the boats and were troubled, and he'd talk to them.'' 
   Cathey saw the firm grow gradually, expanding to the Green River in 1956 and buying Clifton Towing Co. in 1959. Renamed Southern Barge Line Corp., the Clifton operation remained a subsidiary until 1980. 
   In June 1965, Crounse Corp., moved from a converted residence into its current headquarters at 2626 Broadway. In 1969, Mr. Crounse completed another major expansion by opening a branch in Maysville in eastern Kentucky to serve the upper Ohio River. 
   Cathey remained with Crounse Corp. for nearly 30 years, retiring as senior vice president. Aside from his initial loan to build The Alice, Mr. Crounse ran the firm in the black, Cathey said. 
   ``One of the things I always admired him for was, we never went into debt,'' he said. ``We paid as we went. 
   Mr. Crounse is survived by his wife Eleanor Buchanan Crounse; his son, Avery Crounse of Paducah; his sister, Barbara Kleet of Naples, Fla.; nine grandchildren; and eight great-grandchildren. 
   He was preceded in death by a son, George P. Crounse Jr.; and his daughter, Virginia Cramp. His parents were Avery Fitch Crounse and Louise Ray Crounse. 
   Expressions of sympathy may take the form of contributions to the Paducah Cooperative Ministry, 1359 S. 6th St., Paudcah, KY 42001; Paducah Junior College Board, P.O. Box 7380, Pducah, KY 42002; or First Presbyterian Church, 200 N. 7th St., Paudcah, Ky 42001.

    Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a fine businessman, family man and all-around great Kentuckian, Sherman Henderson. 
   Sherm is a man who exudes the kind of enthusiasm and spunk everybody wants to possess. He has a genuine zest for life. Sherm's energy has helped him found and run one of the countries top 20 fastest-growing private companies, UniDial Communications, Inc. Sherm founded UniDial just six years ago with six employees and, in that short time, has turned UniDial into a 600-employee operation and an unbelievable success story. 
   Some of the most successful businessmen become great because they see an untapped market and make it theirs--and that is what Sherm has done with the communications industry in UniDial. Intuitively picking up on emerging opportunities in the communications field after the telephone industry was deregulated, Sherm dove into the business head first. He started by investing in other telecommunications companies, and then founded the now-booming UniDial in 1993. 
   As well as being a great businessman, Sherm has always been a good friend and family man. He boasts a terrific wife, two wonderful children, and two (soon-to-be-three) much-doted-upon grandchildren. Sherm, on behalf of my colleagues and myself, I express my heartfelt admiration for your accomplishments, congratulate you on your success, and wish you the best in your future endeavors. Thank you for creating hundreds of jobs for your fellow Kentuckians, and for making such a significant contribution to our state's economies and communities.

   Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to express may great concern and dismay at President Clinton's decision to offer clemency to sixteen convicted terrorists. These individuals were members of the FALN, the Armed Forced for National Liberation, which uses violence and terror to further its cause of making Puerto Rico an independent nation. As a result of their involvement in a series of terrorist bomb attacks on United States soil, these individuals have been convicted of very serious offenses. 
   Terrorism is a deplorable act. In recent years we have seen tragic attacks on our embassies overseas, and hideous murders in Oklahoma City and the World Trade Center. This harvest of death and suffering is what terrorism is about. By releasing these terrorists President Clinton has made a terrible mistake. For years our message to terrorist has been simple: ``If you attack, maim, and kill Americans, the United States will hunt you down and punish you. We do not forget, and we will bring you to justice.'' Now the President is saying that we will forget, and that justice can give way to other considerations. That is the wrong thing to do.

    Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a fellow Kentuckian and friend Charles Bennett Greenwood of Central City, who died July 16, 1999, at his home. 
   Charles, or C.B. to his friends, was a unique individual who loved his home state of Kentucky and revered life in small-town Central City. You see, C.B. lived all of his 93 years within a four block area of downtown Central City. Almost all of the milestones of his life occurred within the same four blocks of Central City. C.B. never went away to college and took very few vacations. It was obvious to everybody who knew him that C.B. was satisfied with his view of the world from Central City. 
   C.B. was born to William H. and Viola ``Louisa'' Greenwood on March 6, 1906, at the family home on Fourth Street and went to school just a few hundred feet from his birthplace. In 1934, C.B. and his bride, Louise Batsel, were married at the minister's residence on Third Street, just one block away from the homeplace. All of C.B.'s children--daughter Margaret Ann Long of Oklahoma City; and sons Charles Jr., William and David of Central City--were born at their home on Fourth Street. 
   Incredibly, C.B. never worked more than four blocks from his birthplace. In the 1920s, C.B. worked for J.C. Batsel Meat Market and Perry Drugstore and in 1932, he went to work for J.C. Penney, all of which were located downtown. In 1945, C.B. purchased Barnes Mercantile Clothing Store on Broad Street, again just four blocks away from his birthplace and residence. He worked at the store until he retired in 1989. For 75 years C.B. walked to and from his jobs in downtown Central City in deep snow or 100 degree weather. 
   An active community leader, C.B. was a member of the First Baptist Church of Central City, and served on both the Central City Council and the Central City School Board. C.B. was laid to rest in the Rose Hill Cemetery in Central City, four city blocks from where he was born, lived his life, raised his children, worked and ran his business, and served his community. 
   In today's highly mobile society, few people live their lives like C.B., rooted in their hometown. C.B. was a special person who was happy in his life and lived life to the fullest. I express my condolences to C.B.'s family--his wife, Louise, and children, Charles, Jr.; my close friend Bill and his wife Leslie; and David, and Margaret; 10 grandchildren, 9 great-grandchildren, and one great-great grandchild.

   Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, the amendment I submitted would reduce the capital gains holding period for horses from 24 months to 12 months and would correct an inequity in the tax code that has discriminated against the horse industry since 1969. Currently, all capital assets--with the exception of horses and cattle--qualify for the lowest capital gains tax rate if held for 12 months. This discrepancy in the tax code is simply not fair to the horse industry and must be changed. 
   The horse industry is extremely important to our economy, and accounts for thousands of jobs. Whether it is owning, breeding, racing, or showing horses--or simply enjoying an afternoon ride along a trail--one in thirty-five Americans is touched by the horse industry. In Kentucky alone, the horse industry has an economic impact of $3.4 billion, involving 150,000 horses and more than 50,000 employees. 
   What supports this industry is the investment in the horses themselves. Much like other businesses, outside investments are essential to the operation and growth of the horse industry. Without others willing to buy and breed horses, it is impossible for the industry to remain competitive. The 2-year holding period ultimately discourages investment, putting this industry--and the 1.4 million jobs it supports nationwide--at risk. Clearly, this is bad economic policy and must be changed. 
   The two-year holding period for horses is sorely outdated. It was established in 1969, primarily as an anti-tax shelter provision. Since then, there have been a number of changes in the tax code. Specifically, the passive loss limitations have been adopted, putting an end to these previous tax loopholes. 
   Although horses are categorized as livestock, they have an entirely different function than other animals, like cattle. While both are livestock, the investment in these two animals is entirely different. Beef is a commodity, with a finite and generally short life span. However, horses--whether they are used for racing, showing, or working--are frequently bought and sold multiple times over their longer life in order to maximize the return on the owner's investment. Additionally, once horses retire from the track or show arena, they continue to enhance their value through breeding. 
   The cost of my amendment will be completely offset by postponing for one year the 7.5 percent Air Passenger Ticket Tax that has been proposed on the frequent flier miles for persons with foreign addresses. Changes to the capital gains holding period for horses would go into effect in 2001 and the Air Passenger Ticket Tax would also go into effect in 2001. 
   There is no sound argument for distinguishing horses from other capital assets. The two-year holding period discriminates against the horse industry and must be reduced. I urge my colleagues to join me in correcting this unfair tax policy.

In Kentucky alone, the horse industry has an economic impact of $3.4 billion, involving 150,000 horses and more than 50,000 employees. 
   What supports this industry is the investment in the horses themselves. Much like other businesses, outside investments are essential to the operation and growth of the horse industry. Without others willing to buy and breed horses, it is impossible for the industry to remain competitive. The two-year holding period ultimately discourages investment, putting this industry --and the 1.4 million jobs it supports nationwide--at risk. Clearly, this is bad economic policy and must be changed. 
   Mr. President, the two-year holding period for horses is sorely outdated. It was established in 1969, primarily as an anti-tax shelter provision. Since then, there have been a number of changes in the tax code. Specifically, the passive loss limitations have been adopted, putting an end to these previous tax loopholes. 
   Although horses are categorized as livestock, they have an entirely different function than other animals, like cattle. While both are livestock, the investment in these two animals is entirely different. Beef is a commodity, with a finite and generally short life span. However, horses--whether they are used for racing, showing, or working--are frequently bought and sold multiple times over their longer life in order to maximize the return on the owner's investment. Additionally, once horses retire from the track or show arena, they continue to enhance their value through breeding.

   Mr. McCONNELL. Let me say to the Senator from Arizona and the majority leader that I think this is a fair compromise. It would give the Senator from Arizona and the Senator from Wisconsin, as well as others who historically have been on the other side of this issue, an opportunity to offer amendments. It also will give us an opportunity, as the Senator from Arizona has indicated, to know what bill will be called up for debate on September 14. So I think this is a reasonable way to dispose of this issue that is fair to everyone, and it gives us an opportunity to proceed with the Senate's much more important business between now and the August recess. 
   I thank the majority leader for his good work on this, and I look forward to the debate later this year.

    Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Alex ``Ray'' Lackey for his recent appointment as the Eighth Command Sergeant Major of the Army Reserve. 
   Ray has been serving as supervisor of customer services at the Bowling Green post office for almost 20 years, and now embarks on a three-year tour of duty at the Pentagon. Ray has served in numerous capacities in the U.S. military for more than 28 years, with his most recent assignment as Command Sergeant Major for the 100th Division in Louisville. Ray's supervisors have commended him for his ability to maintain a professional balance between his demanding positions in both the U.S. Postal Service and the Department of the Army. 
   Ray's experience in military service is broad, including service as Squad Leader with the 82nd Airborne Division, Drill Sergeant at Fort Knox, Platoon Sergeant with the 2nd Infantry Division in Korea, Battalion Operations Sergeant, First Sergeant, and Commandant of the 100th Division Drill Sergeant School. In 1982, he received the distinction of U.S. Army Reserve Drill Sergeant of the year. 
   Ray has been decorated with an impressive number of awards and honors over the years, including being awarded the Meritorious Service Medal five times, the Army Commendation Medal two times, the Good Conduct Medal twice, the Army Reserve Component Achievement Medal five times, and the Army Achievement Medal, the National Defense Service Medal with Bronze Star, the Armed Forces Reserve Medal with ``M'' device, the Noncommissioned Officers Professional Development Ribbon with numeral four, the Army Service Ribbon and the Overseas Service Ribbon. He has also earned the Expert Infantryman Badge and the Parachutist Badge. 
   As is evidenced by the lengthy list of Ray's achievements and honors, he has served his State and his country well. It is also clear that the Department of the Army has great confidence in Ray's experience, and it seems only fitting that someone with his expertise and seasoned skills will be working in such a significant capacity at the Pentagon. My colleagues and I extend our gratitude for Ray's willingness to continue serving the country in this new post, and wish him the best in his next stage of service.

   Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to express my strong support for the Republican Patient's Bill of Rights Plus Act. As private health coverage has shifted toward coordinated care, many consumers are concerned that their health plan focuses more on cost than on quality. Many consumers fear that they might be denied the health care they need. To respond to these concerns, both parties have developed patient protection legislation. 
   Our colleagues Senators DASCHLE and KENNEDY have offered a proposal which I believe takes the wrong direction. Their bill tries to impose a one-size-fits-all solution in a manner which would override many of the reforms our states have decided--or, equally important, decided not to--enact. Their proposal includes liability provisions which will dramatically increase premiums and further expand the medical malpractice industry in this country. In fact, their bill should be called the ``Lawyers' Right to Bill'' not the Patients' Bill of Rights and the tragedy of their lawsuit saturated approach is that it would make health insurance unaffordable to 1.8 million Americans--including 30,000 Kentuckians. 
   I am pleased to say that we have crafted a better proposal for protecting America's families which is embodied in the Patient's Bill of Rights Plus Act. The Patient's Bill of Rights Plus Act provides needed protections for Americans in a way which won't increase the number of uninsured Americans by driving up health care costs. 
   The Patients' Bill of Rights Plus Act guarantees access to emergency care. It requires plans to pay for emergency medical screening and stabilization under a ``prudent layperson'' standard. If we pass this legislation, we will never again have to hear heart-wrenching stories about families with desperately ill children who bypass the nearest hospital in order to make it to a hospital which is in their plan's network. Under our plan, if you have what a normal person would consider an emergency, you can go to the nearest hospital, period. 
   The Patients' Bill of Rights Plus Act would provide direct access to pediatricians and OB/GYN's. This common-sense provision would allow parents to take their children directly to one of the plan's pediatricians without having to get a referral from their family's primary care physician. Similarly our legislation would allow women to go directly to a participating OB/GYN, without having to get a referral from their primary care physician. 
   The Patients' Bill of Rights Plus Act also bans ``gag clauses''. Gag clauses are contractual agreements between a doctor and a managed care organization that restrict the doctor's ability to discuss freely with the patient information about the patient's diagnosis, medical care, and treatment options. Our legislation would put an end to this practice. I believe a doctor should be able to discuss treatment alternatives with a patient and provide the patient with their best medical advice, regardless of whether or not those treatment options are covered by the health plan. 
   The Patient's Bill of Rights Plus Act also provides strong, independent external appeals procedures to ensure that patients receive the care they need. Many Americans are concerned that their health plan can deny them care. If a plan denies a treatment on the basis that it is experimental or not medically necessary, a patient can appeal that decision. The reviewer must be an independent, medical expert with expertise in the diagnosis and treatment of the condition under review. In routine reviews, the independent reviewer must make a decision within 30 days, but in urgent cases, they must do so in 72 hours. As opposed to the Kennedy plan which mandates a broad, one-size-fits-all definition of medical necessity, our plan allows those decisions to be made on a case by case basis by an independent external medical doctor. Unlike the Kennedy bill which encourages lawsuits, the Patient's Bill of Rights Plus Act focuses instead on giving patients the care they need. After all, when you're sick, don't you really need an appointment with your doctor, not your lawyer? 
   The most troubling aspect of Senator KENNEDY's legislation is that it will further swell the numbers of uninsured Americans. 
   The Kennedy plan drives up health care costs and makes health insurance unaffordable for more Americans. According to the very conservative estimates of the Congressional Budget Office, the Kennedy Patients Bill of Rights would increase insurance premiums 6.1 percent (Source: Congressional Budget Office Report on S.6, 4/23/99). This means that 1.8 million Americans would likely lose their health insurance. 
   In Kentucky, 30,095 people would likely lose their health insurance. 
   In California, 271,927 people would likely lose their health insurance. 
   In New York, 118,091 people would likely lose their health insurance. 
   In Minnesota, 36,315 people would likely lose their health insurance. 
   Even if the Kennedy bill does not pass, it is expected that health insurance premiums will rise an average of seven percent next year (Source: Towers Perrins 1999 Health Care Cost Survey 1/99). At a time when premiums are rising well above the rate of inflation, do we really want to pass legislation which raise premiums even more? The answer is clearly no. 
   Our Patients' Bill of Rights' Plus Act takes a better approach to the problem of the uninsured. While avoiding provisions which will drastically raise premiums, it includes important tax provisions to make insurance more affordable. Earlier this week we passed the Nickles Amendment which will allow self-employed individuals to deduct 100% of the cost of their health insurance. This is particularly important to the 124,000 of Kentucky's farmers, ministers, stay-at-home moms, and young entrepreneurs who are self-employed. According to a study by the Employee Benefits Research Initiative, nearly 1/2 (43.6 percent) of all workers in the agriculture, forestry, and fishing sectors have no health insurance. By allowing the self-insured to fully deduct the costs of health insurance, we are taking an important step in reducing the numbers of uninsured.  
   There are certainly significant differences between our two bills. However, no single issue distinguishes the two more than the question of liability. I believe we can and should find bi-partisan agreement on the important issues of providing emergency care, ensuring direct access to pediatricians and OB/GYN's, banning gag orders, deductibility of health insurance for the self-employed, and a whole myriad of issues except for one thing: The Kennedy bill insists on new powers to sue. Leafing with abandon through the yellow pages under the word ``attorney'' is not what most Americans would call health care reform. 
   Simply put, I believe that when you are sick, you need a doctor, not a lawyer. I am opposed to increasing litigation because it will drive up premiums, drive 1.8 million Americans out of the health insurance market, prevent millions more uninsured from being able to purchase insurance, and aggravate an already seriously flawed medical malpractice system. 
   If 1.8 million Americans lose their health insurance, 189,000 fewer women will have access to mamograms and 238,000 fewer women will have access to pelvic exams. I have a question for the supporters of Sen. Kennedy's bill. What kind of reform makes preventative services less available? What kind of reform is that? 
   As if driving 1.8 million Americans out of the health insurance market wasn't reason enough to oppose the Kennedy bill, I am also strongly opposed to expanding liability because it will exacerbate the problems in our already flawed medical malpractice system. Typically these lawsuits drag on for an average of 33 months. Even if at the end of this 33 months, only 43 cents of every dollar spent on medical liability actually reaches the victims of malpractice (Source: RAND Corporation, 1985). Most of the rest of the judgement goes to the lawyers. That's right, over half of the injured person's damages are grabbed by the lawyers. Why would anyone want to expand this flawed system which is so heavily skewed in favor of the trial lawyers? 
   The Washington Post said last March that ``the threat of litigation is the wrong way to enforce the rational decision making that everyone claims to have as a goal'' (Source: Washington Post 3/16/99). More recently the Post said that the Senate should enact an external appeals process ``before subjecting an even greater share of medical practice to the vagaries of litigation'' (Source: Washington Post 7/13/99). The Los Angeles Times Editorial page called expanding liability to health plans ``bad medicine for both employees and employers'' and stated that ``The key to fixing ERISA is not in radical measures like more lawsuits.....'' (Source: Los Angeles Times 2/29/98) 
   Mr, President, I have always felt that this debate is about improving private health insurance in America. That the debate was about providing better care, for more Americans not less. 
   We can and we should guarantee access to emergency services. 
   We can and we should ensure direct access to pediatricians. 
   We can and we should ban gag clauses. 
   We can and we should provide an independent external appeals process. 
   We can and we should provide full deductibility for the self-employed. 
   By voting for the Patients' Bill of Rights Plus Act, we will have taken all of these important steps and more. However, what we must not do is take action which will deprive 1.8 million Americans of health insurance. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to vote for this common-sense health care reform.

    Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the late Lillian A. Hart, a committed public servant and devoted wife, mother and grandmother, who bravely battled cancer in the last several months of her life. 
   Lillian has made it easy for us to remember her--she has left behind an impressive list of accomplishments that most people only hope to achieve in their lifetime. Lillian was a leader in the community and a role model for many women. She was a pioneer, exploring occupations and civic positions women had never held before. 
   Lillian was the first woman to be the state executive director of the Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service in Kentucky, her most recent public position. Lillian served Kentucky in this capacity from 1981 to 1989, and received a national award in 1987, for her work on behalf of farmers and all Kentuckians. 
   Before Lillian became state executive director, she was also the first woman to be appointed a district director of the Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service. She served 19 Northern Kentucky counties as district director for 12 years, including in her home county of Pendleton. 
   Lillian was active in her community, once serving as president of the Pendleton County Republican Women's Club and being chosen as a delegate to the Republican National Convention. She also founded a chapter of Habitat for Humanity in Pendleton County, and was a member of the Kincaid Regional Theatre board of directors. 
   I am certain that the legacy of excellence that Lillian Hart has left will continue on, and will encourage and inspire others. Hopefully it will be a comfort to the family and friends she leaves behind to know that her efforts to better the community will be felt for years to come. On behalf of myself and my colleagues, we offer our deepest condolences to Lillian's loved ones, and express our gratitude for all she contributed to Pendleton County, the State of Kentucky, and to our great Nation.

    Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to honor a fine Kentucky businessman, Tom Rechtin, Sr., President of Tom Rechtin Heating, Air Conditioning and Electric Company. 
   Tom was recently named ``1999 Outstanding Business Person'' by the Northern Kentucky Chamber of Commerce for his community leadership and 35 years of education advocacy. The honor was given as part of the A.D. Albright awards program, which is named for Northern Kentucky University's president emeritus, who was known for encouraging educational excellence in the region. 
   The Albright Award recognizes Tom's commitment to supporting and encouraging educational activities in the workplace and in the community. His own company serves as a model for his philosophy, as his employees attend and participate in numerous classes and seminars he facilitates. Tom Rechtin's company also employs student interns who are seeking certification. 
   Tom was also recently named the ``1998 National Contractor of the Year''  by the National Association of Plumbing, Heating and Cooling Contractors, and ``Kentucky Contractor of the Year'' by the Kentucky Association of Plumbing, Heating and Cooling Contractors. 
   Tom began working in the industry after high school and, over the years, moved through the ranks from an entry-level position to eventually owning his own company. Today, Tom is one of the most well-known and well-respected businessmen in the state, with over 12,000 customers in Northern Kentucky, Eastern Indiana, and Southern Ohio. 
   Tom is a three-time appointee by the Governor to the Kentucky HVAC Licensing Board, which oversees the licensing and continuing education programs for the state's HVAC journeymen and Master License holders. He has been an example to board members and the entire industry by implementing his own rigorous employee training programs. His leadership and success in the field is one of the reasons Tom has been named Vice President of the Kentucky HVAC Licensing Board. 
   My colleagues and I congratulate you, Tom, on your recent accomplishments and commend your many years of service to Northern Kentucky's business community. Best wishes for many years of continued success.

   Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, others have said it probably better than I can, but what is really at stake is whether we are going to dramatically diminish, if not gut, the war on drugs. 
   The junior Senator from Kentucky has outlined the progress made on the teenage drinking front in the last 20 years, and it is, indeed, significant. No one argues with any of the observations that have been made by Senator BYRD and Senator LAUTENBERG, and others, about the devastating nature of the problem of teenage drinking, although it is encouraging that progress is being made. 
   The industry itself advertises against underage drinking extensively. The alcohol industry has spent $100 million over the last 8 years, and the beer industry has spent $250 million over the last 10 years, for a total of $350 million, in their own financed effort to get at the problem of teenage drinking, which is a horrendous problem. But as Senator BUNNING has pointed out, it is a problem upon which we have made significant progress. 
   What is before us today with the Lautenberg amendment is whether we are going to gut the war on drugs. Regretfully, since President Clinton came to office, teenage drug use in this country has gone up 46 percent. We are going backwards in the war on drugs. While it may be an unintended consequence of what Senator LAUTENBERG is seeking to achieve today, the practical effect of this amendment is to gut the advertising campaign designed to go after teenage drug use, as Senator DORGAN has pointed out. 
   Let's have no misunderstandings; nobody is in favor of teenage drinking. Nobody thinks that we should not do more about this problem. However, the issue before us is: Are we going to gut the advertising effort in the war on drugs? 
   The National Youth Antidrug Media campaign is underway. This amendment, according to drug czar Barry McCaffrey, would undermine that. The Partnership for a Drug Free America, which is the nonprofit group that works with General McCaffrey to run this antidrug campaign, opposes this amendment. 
   General McCaffrey said just 3 weeks ago that proposals such as this amendment ``could dilute the focus of the successful media campaign advertising effort to change attitudes of youth and parents toward illegal drug use.'' He also said, ``An anti-underage drinking message to youth is largely a separate and distinct message from the anti-drug message, requiring a significantly different strategic approach based on scientific and behavioral knowledge.'' 
   So what we are doing is mixing up apples and oranges. A campaign, designed, properly researched, and underway, to deal with youth drug abuse would be diverted in an entirely different direction by the Lautenberg amendment. 
   Others have referred to the letters from Mario Cuomo, Bill Bennett, and Jim Burke, the cochairs of the Partnership for a Drug-Free America. They  oppose the Lautenberg amendment. Obviously, it is not because they are in favor of teenage drinking, but they don't want to gut the effort to have an effective antidrug campaign among America's young people. 
   Chairman Burke, of the Partnership for a Drug-free America, said: ``We don't believe . . . an effective campaign targeting underage drinking can be carved out of the current appropriation for the National Youth Antidrug Media Campaign. 
   He went on:  
   I can tell you that forcing the campaign to address underage drinking (something it was not originally designed to do) will seriously jeopardize the success of this effort.  
   He is referring to their effort to deal with teenage drug use, which, remember, is going up while teenage drinking is going down. 
   Cochairman Mario Cuomo, former Governor of New York, said this amendment ``threatens the success of one media campaign by creating another that simply cannot and will not work given the current limitations.'' 
   Governor Cuomo also said that ``this type of program will require hundreds of millions more dollars--if not billions--to be effective.'' 
   Governor Cuomo's cochairman, Bill Bennett, said:  
   Advocates are wrong to suggest that this enormous problem of teenage drinking can be addressed effectively within the current appropriation for the antidrug campaign. We read this amendment as the beginning of the end of the antidrug campaign.  
   Mr. President, we don't need to end the antidrug campaign. Drug use is going up; drug use among high school seniors has gone up 46 percent since 1992. It needs to be addressed. That is what this appropriation is for. Certainly, a program to address underage drinking, which all three of the men I have just quoted would tell us, would have to be of a tremendous size. That is an activity Congress would need to analyze carefully before embarking on. 
   I know that there are probably many Senators who are thinking that if they oppose the Lautenberg amendment, it is going to be very difficult to explain in a campaign contest. Let me say this. What would be even more difficult to explain, it seems to me, is a vote that would gut the effort to combat drug use in this country--teenage drug use in particular--which is on the increase. That is what this appropriation is designed to try to impact. 
   So if we are going to address teenage drinking, let's not do it at the expense of the war on drugs. The war on drugs has not been very effectively fought in the last few years. I am not here to cast any particular aspersions against anybody for that, but it is a cold, hard reality that teenage drug use has gone up 46 percent since 1992 in this country. It was previously tracking down. We need to get back on track and address this youth drug use. That is what the original appropriation was designed to do. 
   I hope we will resist the temptation to gut the war on drugs so that we can pursue it effectively. As evidence, we have the testimony of Jim Burke, Mario Cuomo, and Bill Bennett. 
   I ask that the record include copies of a letter from Bill Bennett of the Partnership for a Drug-Free America, opposing the Lautenberg amendment; a letter from Mario Cuomo of the Partnership for a Drug-Free America, opposing the Lautenberg amendment; and a statement of Richard D. Bonnette, President and CEO of the Partnership for a Drug-Free America, opposing the amendment, along with a press release from the Office of National Drug Control Policy.

   Mr. MCCONNELL. Let me reiterate that the practical effect of the Lautenberg amendment is to gut the effort to reduce teenage drug use. 
   I wouldn't argue with a single thing that any of our colleagues has said about the importance of combating teenage drinking. Everybody thinks it is important to combat teenage drinking. Fortunately, over the past 20 years teenager drinking has gone down. However, according to a highly respected University of Michigan study, teenage drug use has gone up 46 percent since 1992. 
   We should let this effort to combat teenage drug use, which is dramatically on the increase, go forward. On another day in another contest, let's pursue an effort to deal with teenage drinking. 
   This amendment, regretfully, would gut a very important campaign to combat teenage drug use. That is not me speaking. That is Mario Cuomo and Bill Bennett, chairman of the Partnership for a Drug-Free America, who oppose this amendment, which is not to say that either one of those men is in favor of teenage drinking. 
   Let's keep this antidrug effort intact and let what we hope will be an effective advertising campaign go forward. 
   I thank Senator CAMPBELL for yielding time to me.

   Mr. MCCONNELL.  
   Mr. President, I have come to the Senate floor today to introduce a bill known as the TVA Customer Protection Act. This legislation will implement a number of consumer protections that will make TVA accountable to ratepayers and better prepare TVA to compete in a restructured electricity market. I am pleased to have Senator BUNNING as an original cosponsor on this bill. 
   The legislation I am introducing, which is virtually identical to the legislation I introduced in the 105th Congress, provides Valley ratepayers protections against unchecked and unjustified increases in their power rates. Included in this bill are checks against future increases in TVA's massive debt. This bill will put an end to TVA's ability to compete unfairly with its regional distributors and will prohibit TVA from sticking ratepayers with the bill for its international forays that have no relevance to its responsibility to provide low-cost power to the Valley. Finally, this bill also codifies an agreement between TVA and several industry associations to limit TVA's authority as a government entity to compete with small businesses in non-electric services. 
   Mr. President, TVA is a federal corporation that was first established in 1933, to tame the Tennessee River, our nation's fifth largest river, and to bring economic development to this once poverty stricken region. Today, TVA provides power to nearly all of Tennessee and to parts of six other states covering over 80,000 square miles and serving eight million consumers. The bulk of TVA's power sales are made through municipal and cooperative distributors, which in turn are responsible for delivering that power to every home, office and farm in the Valley. TVA has exclusive power contracts with its distributors and the three-member TVA board sets the retail rates offered by distributors. 
   Mr. President, while TVA has achieved significant success, it has not come without a price. Today, TVA customers are paying a premium for TVA's excesses and mismanagement. For example, TVA has accumulated an enormous debt of nearly $26 billion, despite its monopoly status and the Board's unilateral rate making authority. As a result, in 1998, TVA customers paid an astronomical 30 cents of every $1 to interest expenses. When you match TVA's interest charge of 30 cents to the 11 cents paid by the Federal Government, it makes Uncle Sam look like a conservative financial planner. When compared to the average regulated public utility, which pays a mere 7 percent in finance cost, it is obvious that this isn't a good deal for TVA ratepayers. 
   In a 1994 study, the General Accounting Office determined that TVA's financial condition ``threatens its long-term viability and places the federal government at risk.'' Only through years of unaccountability and fiscal irresponsibility could a power company have ever reached this level of debt, despite the fact that TVA is a monopoly provider of electricity. 
   As a result of TVA's fiscal mismanagement and bloated budgets, TVA rates are higher than those of FERC-regulated utilities in Kentucky. Since 1988, wholesale power rates of regulated utilities in Kentucky have steadily fallen, while TVA has maintained the same level, albeit higher than Kentucky utilities. Then, in 1997, TVA was forced to raise rates by 7 percent in an effort to get its fiscal house back in order. It is apparent that due to TVA's past financial mismanagement, thousands of Kentucky residents are paying more for power than Kentucky residents who are outside the TVA fence. 
   Mr. President, another way to quantify the impact of TVA's fiscal irresponsibility is to compare the electric rates paid by Kentuckians. Mr. President I have a chart here that displays the rate premiums paid by the 211,427 TVA customers living in Kentucky. I have used the rates filed by Kentucky Utilities and TVA's publicly disclosed rates between 1999 and 2003. Based on these rates, Kentuckians will pay an average of $50 million more annually for the privilege of being served by TVA. Over the next five years this amounts to a $250 million ``TVA membership fee.'' It is painfully clear the Kentuckians who are served by TVA are getting a raw deal from this New Deal program.  
   Mr. President, I have come to the conclusion that TVA needs to be made more accountable for its actions. Not more accountable to Congress or the President, but the people TVA is charged to serve--Valley customers. 
   Mr. President, it is my desire to provide TVA customers with a clear picture of TVA's financial situation including its rates, charges and costs. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) is authorized under the Federal Power Act with regulating electric utilities. FERC currently provides regulatory oversight to over 200 utilities for wholesale and transmission power rates to ensure that their electric rates and charges are ``just and reasonable and not unduly discriminatory or preferential.'' At present, TVA is entirely exempt from these necessary regulations allowing it to operate as a self-regulating monopoly, with no such mandate for openness, fairness or oversight. 
   Mr. President, I am not alone in this belief. The distributors serving Memphis, Tennessee, Knoxville, Tennessee, and Paducah, Kentucky, share my views that TVA should fully comply with the FERC authority. Recently, before the House Commerce Committee, Mr. Herman Morris, Jr., President and CEO of the Memphis Light, Gas and Water Division testified on behalf of MLGWD and the Knoxville Utilities Board that FERC would ``provide a neutral forum for resolving disputes regarding TVA transmission, wholesale sales pricing, terms and conditions.'' Mr. Morris went on to say that FERC jurisdiction is ``necessary to provide Tennessee Valley distributors the same level of protection that the rest of the country enjoys.'' 
   Requiring TVA to comply with FERC regulations will serve two purposes. First, it will allow customers to accurately evaluate TVA's wholesale and transmission pricing to ensure the rates charged are ``just and reasonable'' and will provide customers with a forum for challenging future rate increases just as every other regulated utility does. 
   Second, this information will provide FERC with a better understanding of the costs TVA has accumulated. Understanding the full scope of these costs will be critical in an open transmission and wholesale market. It will also have a significant impact in determining how competitive TVA will be in the future. 
   Another measure which I have added this year builds on the full disclosure provisions by requiring FERC to conduct an investigation to determine TVA's total stranded cost liability. I have heard from a number of distributors who are very concerned about the potential stranded cost liability they might be assessed. They adamantly oppose paying for any costs or services they haven't paid for. For example, residents of Paducah, Kentucky don't want to pay for the costs TVA incurred in providing service to Nashville. Unfortunately, nobody has any idea of the total stranded cost liability TVA has incurred or can be recovered. This investigation will uncover those costs that were prudently incurred and are eligible for recovery as stranded costs. 
   In order to ensure that TVA keeps its promise of lowering its debt, I have proposed that TVA be required to meet four need-based criteria before it is able to add costly generating capacity. For my colleagues who are not familiar with TVA, it is important to note that TVA's tremendous level of debt is a result of TVA's aggressive and unchecked plan to add new generating capacity in the Valley. In 1966, TVA announced a plan to build 17 nuclear facilities throughout the Valley. Today less than half of these facilities are in commercial service. 
   As a result, TVA is $26 billion in debt and has invested $14 billion in non-performing nuclear assets which have driven rates up in the Valley. To prevent history from repeating itself, I believe it is necessary to apply safeguards against overbuilding. TVA must demonstrate a legitimate need before committing such significant resources again. 
   This legislation will also prohibit TVA from using Valley ratepayers to subsidize power sales outside the Valley in the future. All new generation will be required to meet the needs of Valley ratepayers. 
   Mr. President, let me take a moment to go through the other important customer reforms included in the bill. Section Four of the bill prohibits TVA from continuing to subsidize their foreign endeavors at ratepayer's expense. Quarter million dollar conferences in China and other points on the globe are not consistent with either TVA's deficit reduction goals or its mission to be a low-cost power provider to the Valley. 
   Another provision that I have included is a measure proposed by the TVA distributors. Section Five in the bill protects distributors from unfair competition by ending TVA's ability to directly serve large industrial customers. In the past, TVA has been able to directly serve some of the valley's largest industrial customers. Through this loophole, TVA is able to use its considerable market power to unfairly compete with distributors. 
   Section Seven of this bill will increase TVA's level of accountability by applying all federal antitrust laws and penalties. I have included this provision in response to heavy-handed tactics used by TVA to punish the City of Bristol, Virginia, for signing a contract with another energy provider. 
   TVA applied heavy-handed tactics by predicting unreliable electricity services as a disincentive to leaving, and TVA attempted to syphon-off Bristol's industrial customers by offering direct-serve power contracts at 2 percent below any rate offered by Bristol. I find these predatory practices to be entirely unacceptable, especially applied to one of its own customers. It is my belief that since TVA's activities were performed in a commercial endeavor, they should be held to the same standards as any other corporation under the antitrust laws. 
   I understand that TVA is willing to subject themselves to federal antitrust laws, so long as they aren't subject to any penalties. Mr. President, I have some advice for TVA. 
   If you can't pay the fine, don't do the crime. 
   Finally, this legislation limits TVA's ability to branch out into other businesses beyond power generation and transmission. TVA has attempted to diversify into equipment leasing as well as engineering and other contracting services in direct competition with other Valley businesses. I don't believe that TVA should be permitted to use its considerable advantages, like its tax-exempt status, to compete against Valley businesses. TVA has signed a Memorandum of Agreement with Valley businesses not to compete against them. 
   My legislation codifies that agreement. Mr. President, I hope these reforms will offer TVA customers--both distributors and individuals alike--the means to make TVA more accountable and put an end, once and for all, to TVA's unaccountability and unchecked fiscal irresponsibility. I want to put an end to TVA membership premium and let all Kentuckians benefit from some of the lowest power rates in the nation.

   Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, today the Senate will immediately begin consideration of the foreign operations appropriations bill. It is hoped that significant progress can be made in an effort to complete action on the bill today. I might interject that I think that is certainly possible, maybe by early afternoon. 
   During today's session, the Senate may also begin consideration of any other appropriations bills on the calendar. It is the intention of the majority leader to complete action on a number of appropriations bills prior to the Fourth of July recess. Therefore, Senators can expect votes throughout the remainder of the week.

<TEXT>
   Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, the committee was provided an allocation virtually identical to last year's bill of $12.6 billion. Although it is $1.8 billion below the request, I think it effectively manages our global responsibilities, and it does so within the budget caps. 
   For the past few years, the bill has emphasized funding in two areas--export promotion and growth in the New Independent States of the former Soviet Union. This bill sustains that commitment--in fact, expands support for export promotion by $20 million for a total of $785 million to the Export-Import Bank. 
   This year, we have added recovery and reconstruction in Southeast Europe to our priority list. 
   While I expect the Europeans to bear the lion's share of responsibility for reconstruction, we have concrete trade interests in regional economic recovery and security interests in promoting stability and democracy. 
   With funds straight lined, this becomes a zero sum game. We have to reach consensus on tradeoffs and priorities. 
   There is no question that this will mean reductions in other accounts--but it's time to recognize priorities. There are obvious and easy cuts that the administration can make. Just as one example, the administration has asked for another $70 million for Haiti after spending billions in Haiti, with little to show for it. In fact, recent press accounts report an increase in drug trafficking through Haiti, and we have failed at every turn to restore a legitimate government. 
   This is just one example where I think the administration could cut back in order to serve more urgent priorities. 
   There are others. The request from the administration is redundant in the area of peacekeeping. They have asked for funds for a global peace keeping initiative, a regional Africa peacekeeping account and the Africa Crisis Response Initiative which trains peacekeepers.  
   I think we can and should shift priorities. We have just waged a war in Europe, and we need to build the foundation for sustaining the peace in the aftermath of that war. 
   The Balkans Initiative in this bill does three things to serve what I see as our long term interests: It rids the region of Milosevic by declaring Serbia a terrorist state; we increase funding for stability and recovery; and we condition funds to Russia on total cooperation with NATO in Kosovo. 
   Let me elaborate. 
   In section 525, the bill establishes Serbia's status as a terrorist nation. With this terrorist designation, the administration cannot provide bilateral or support multilateral aid, and Belgrade is stripped of protections under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act. 
   This in turn, will allow Kosovars to take Milosevic to court for damages rendered during his brutal war of ethnic annihilation. 
   The administration has complained that this designation is inflexible and unreasonable, that Serbia is not the same as the other countries on the terrorism list because they don't sponsor groups such as Hezbollah. 
   Frankly, I am hard pressed to understand the difference between thugs blowing up a village with a car bomb or thugs shelling and burning a village to the ground. 
   The intent and the impact are the same. In both instances, innocent civilians are the targets and the victims. 
   The second important change in the bill affects funding. We have increased and changed the funding mix to fulfill two goals. We have tried to promote refugee confidence to return home, and relieve the pressure on the front-line states. 
   The administration requested $393 million for Eastern and Central Europe which included $55 million for Serbia and $175 million for Bosnia. 
   I have taken out Serbia's funds, cut back on Bosnia and added $142 million for a total of $535 million. 
   Of the total the bill earmarks $150 million for Kosovo, $85 million for Albania, $60 million for Romania, $55 million for Macedonia, $45 million for Bulgaria, and $35 million for Montenegro, leaving $105 million unallocated for other regional uses. 
   We have also earmarked funds within the Kosovo account to promote internal stability and confidence including the provision of $20 million to train and equip a Kosovo security force. Again, the administration had complained bitterly about this provision on the grounds that it arms the KLA at a time when the agreement is seeking to dismantle their capabilities. 
   There is nothing in the bill which calls for arming or supporting the KLA. In fact, the administration has plans to train and equip a police force and has estimated that this will cost $25 million. The bill is not consistent with the planning underway. It simply earmarks funds for a security force which I view as essential to any Kosovar having confidence the past will not be repeated. 
   Members of the KLA may very well be included in a security force, but that is not a decision for us to make. A Kosovo civilian government should make all decisions regarding recruitment standards, organization and supervision of internal security. Autonomy can not be preserved without security--that is just what this $20 million will launch. 
   In addition, to strengthen democracy, we have provided $20 million to support the development of local government institutions. This support should help the Kosovars rebuild independent judicial, legislative, and executive branches of self-government, as well as help at the local municipal level. 
   The United States made a commitment at Rambouillet to support a three year period of autonomy which would be followed by some kind of final decision on political status. Specifically, the Secretary of State pledged to support a referendum on independence if that is the course Kosovars chose. 
   I think we all hope that a change of government in Belgrade might produce conditions which would allow Kosovo to maintain some kind of tie with a democratic federation. In the interim, however, Kosovo must develop the capabilities and institutions to govern themselves, which I believe these funds will support. 
   Finally, the bill conditions future Russian aid on total cooperation with NATO on peacekeeping. The administration seemed caught by surprise when Russian troops marched into and took up positions at the Pristina airport. Frankly, I was 
   surprised that they did not take up positions along the Belgrade-Pristina road. This move was calculated and inevitable--notwithstanding senior officials' attempts to explain it was just a few rogue troops. 
   If stability is to be restored in Kosovo, the Russian's cannot be allowed to maintain a client relationship with Serbia which may lead to de facto partition of the country. 
   To prevent this outcome, we link Russian aid to the Secretary of State certifying that the Russians have not established a separate zone of operational control, and that their forces are completely integrated under NATO command and control. 
   In the last few days, the Secretary of Defense seems to have worked out an arrangement that may secure these objectives. We all certainly hope so. But, just as the administration was surprised by the dash to control the Pristina airport, they could be surprised by difficulties in implementing the agreement. We must maintain some leverage to assure there is full compliance with the current expectations. 
   And, lest anyone doubt the relevance of this leverage, I suggest a review of the vote to condition aid to Russia on a withdrawal timetable from the Baltics. This was a few years back. Every leader in the region called me after the 89-11 Senate vote to congratulate the Senate for securing immediate negotiations which produced the desired result. 
   In other words, what we did in the early nineties was to condition Russian aid on withdrawal of troops from the Baltic countries. Shortly after we had that vote in the Senate, the Russian troops were out of the Baltic countries. 
   Beyond, the Balkans, this bill maintains United States interests in the New Independent States of the former Soviet Union and sustains our financial commitment to crucial allies ranging from Israel to Indonesia. 
   I also want to mention the increase in this bill's funding levels for the surveillance and treatment of infectious diseases. A recent process report noted that children and vulnerable populations are dying at a staggering rate of treatable and often preventable diseases. Thanks to Senator LEAHY's commitment, we are now in our third year of a multi-year strategy to significantly increase the U.S. commitment to control and prevent infectious diseases. 
   Finally, let me say that there is no question we could have spent more on foreign operations program. Senators LEAHY and I have both expressed strong support for increasing foreign assistance initiatives. However, working together, we have produced a bill which lives within the budget caps. It is very similar to the bill we passed in the Senate just 1 year ago with an overwhelming bipartisan majority vote of 90-3. 
   Senator LEAHY and I certainly hope that will be the result again this year. 
   Before passing the baton over to my friend and colleague from Vermont, I thank him, at the beginning of what we think will be a rather short debate, for his leadership and cooperation in producing a bipartisan bill that went through the Appropriations Committee without dissent and we think has widely accommodated the interests of Members who take a particular interest in this bill every year. 
   We anticipate very few amendments. I will say in advance what I hope to do is, sometime before noon, seek consent that all amendments be in by a reasonable time today--probably by noon --within an hour from now. What I hope we can do is ask for a consent agreement to have all amendments filed before noon. There is every reason to believe this bill should be handled very quickly, and we hope we will have maximum cooperation from other Members of the Senate to do that. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. MCCONNELL. I thank my good friend from Vermont for his cooperation in developing this bill on a bipartisan basis. I agree with him that without the allocation that Senator STEVENS and Senator BYRD provided for us, we couldn't have even done this well. I do think that even with this, some would argue inadequate allocation, we can meet our responsibilities around the globe. I believe we have done that in this bill. 
   Now the Senator from Kansas is here and has an important amendment to be offered. 
   Let me just mention to all Members of the Senate, Senator LEAHY and I, at about 10:30, are going to propound a unanimous consent request asking that all amendments to this bill be submitted by noon, which we think will help the Senate dispose of this measure in a timely fashion.

   Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, I want to commend my friend and colleague from Kansas, first of all, for taking an interest in a part of the world that very few Members of Congress probably can find on a map. I share his view that this is an extraordinarily important part of the world. 
   As the Senator from Kansas pointed out, all of these countries are part of what used to be the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union very early on, in the wake of the end of the cold war, said: This is our ``near abroad,'' sort of their version of the Monroe Doctrine, their  territory, and we were not thereby expected by them to be in that area. Nevertheless, the Russians don't make foreign policy for the United States. And we are in the process of trying to develop our own strong bilateral relations with each of those countries. 
   The Senator from Kansas has been in the forefront of advocating the importance of the United States having its own bilateral relations with each of those countries. I commend him for it because he has been very farsighted in understanding the significance of this part of the world to the United States. 
   I think all other aspects of the Silk Road proposal are good. Where we differ, as the Senator from Kansas indicated, is on that portion of the Silk Road called the ``repeal of section 907.'' 
   Reasonable people can look at this and reach different conclusions. What the Senator from Kansas would like to see--I am perfectly confident in what I would like to see--is a settlement of this dispute between Azerbaijan and Armenia. 
   For our colleagues who have not paid a whole lot of attention to this part of the world, Nagorno-Karabakh is an almost entirely Armenian enclave, as the Senator from Kansas pointed out, within the territory of Azerbaijan connected by an area called the Lachin corridor. It is this area which is in dispute. 
   As the Senator from Kansas pointed out, Armenia won the conflict that occurred with the breakup of the Soviet Union, and it occupies not only Nagorno-Karabakh but the other territory adjacent thereto, which is Azeri. 
   The sad aftermath of that war is large refugee camps, which I visited, and the Senator from Kansas visited as well, 
   of displaced people stuck in these refugee camps now for some 6 years, with the hopelessness and despair that develops in that atmosphere, reminiscent of an entire generation of Palestinians who have grown up in these camps in the Middle East. It breeds a fanaticism, a terrorism, that is an enormous unsettling aspect of life in that part of the world. Nothing could be better for that area than getting that dispute settled. I am sure the Senator from Kansas and I agree on that. 
   The question is, How do you best get there? The Senator from Kansas mentioned the Minsk Group. I am not very optimistic that the Minsk Group is going to bring about a settlement. The Minsk Group, in addition to including Azerbaijan and Armenia, includes Russia, France, and the United States. I think the Senator from Kansas and I probably agree that the Russians like things the way they are around there. There are Russian troops in all of those republics still, with the exception of Azerbaijan. Some are there by invitation, some are not by invitation. I think the Russians enjoy keeping the Caucasus destabilized, with all due respect to our occasional friends, the Russians. The French, who most of the time are our allies, I think frequently are difficult in these negotiating situations. 
   These are the players: The French, the Russians, the Americans, the Armenians, and Azeris. Nothing has happened, and I am not optimistic something will happen until the United States thinks this is important. 
   Think of the money, time, and effort we have spent in the Balkans over the last 3 or 4 years. I happen to be in the minority in our party who think we have a national interest in the Balkans. I wish we had the interest in the Caucasus that we had in the Balkans, because we might have settled the dispute between Armenia and Azerbaijan. We have not had that, and nothing has happened. 
   The question before the Senate is, What kind of condition makes peace more or less likely to occur? Reasonable people can look at the same set of facts and reach a different conclusion. 
   The Senator from Michigan, Mr. ABRAHAM, and I have offered this second-degree amendment because we believe that section 907 --even though it has been constantly stripped down--is important to give the Azeris some incentive for ultimate settlement. It is the view of the Senator from Kentucky that the lifting of 907 ought to be part of the final settlement between Armenia and Azerbaijan. To give it away in advance of final settlement makes final settlement less likely. 
   I completely respect the observations of the Senator from Kansas. As I said, reasonable people can differ about this. I think removing the last element of leverage in advance of the final settlement is not a step in the right direction. 
   We will have at some point today--although no time agreement can be entered at this point--a decision on this. I hope my colleagues will consider whether or not lifting this sanction in advance of a final settlement of the dispute is helpful in achieving a final settlement of the dispute. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, I commend the Senator from California. I think she has it exactly right. The issue is whether, in the absence of a peace agreement between Azerbaijan and Armenia, the United States will have completely normal relations with Azerbaijan. I would like to see normal relations between our country and Azerbaijan. I would also like to see normal relations between Armenia and Azerbaijan. If all the leverage is removed in advance of an agreement, it seems to most of us that it makes the agreement less likely. 
   So I commend the Senator from California. She is absolutely correct on the merits. We hope the second-degree amendment will prevail.

   Mr. MCCONNELL. I ask my friend from Maryland, is it not true one of the things that Azerbaijan wants more than anything is a normal relationship with the United States? If they can achieve that without negotiation, this Senator is very pessimistic about the possibility of ever settling this conflict. 
   I have had the opportunity to visit refugee camps in both of these countries. I must say to my friend from Maryland, I don't see any end to it. These people have been living in refugee camps now for 5 or 6 years. If this conflict isn't settled some time soon, with its sense of hopelessness and despair, we will have children being born, growing up, and reaching adulthood in these refugee camps with no hope of a normal life. 
   It seems to me, as the Senator from Maryland has indicated, and I agree  with him totally, we ought to be doing everything we can to encourage the end of this dispute--not to take steps that could well lead to an inevitable and lengthy process. Conceivably, this could never be settled. 
   You could have these refugee camps there 10, 20 years from now, breeding hopelessness and terrorism and all the rest that we have seen coming out of refugee camps in other parts of the world.

   Mr. McCONNELL. If I could pick right up on the comments made by the Senator from Maryland and the Senator from Michigan, we are talking about a major change in American foreign policy in this amendment. This is a very serious change in our policy toward that part of the world. It is not as if, as the Senator from Maryland has pointed out and as the Senator from Michigan has pointed out, the United States has no relationship with Azerbaijan. 
   The administration already, without the repeal of 907, can do Export-Import Bank loan guarantees and support. It can do OPIC insurance and support. It can do Trade Development Agency feasibility studies and support. It can do any activities sponsored by the U.S. Foreign Commercial Service. It can do election and democracy support. It can do Nunn-Lugar nonproliferation support. And last but not least, it can do humanitarian support, which includes food, medicine, and related relief. 
   In other words, 907 has basically been stripped down over the last few years so that all of those activities between our Government and Azerbaijan can take place. So there is not much left of 907. 
   But as the Senators from Maryland and Michigan have pointed out, what is left is significant because without it there is no real reason for Azerbaijan to pursue the much-needed peace with Armenia that the citizens of both countries richly deserve. 
   So I thank both Senator SARBANES and Senator ABRAHAM for their contributions to this important debate. 
   I yield the floor. 
   Mr. BROWNBACK addressed the Chair.

   Mr. MCCONNELL. The Senator from Maryland makes a very good point. I visited these countries. American business is there. The American oil companies are there. I do not know why the American oil companies are so interested in the repeal of 907 because it is certainly not inhibiting their ability to do business in Azerbaijan or to drill in the Caspian Sea. Some of us have had an opportunity to see those offshore wells. I might say that the American  oil industry is doing a wonderful job, 
   very environmentally sound drilling practices in the Caspian Sea. It is high time because the Russians committed a number of environmental atrocities both onshore and offshore in Azerbaijan during their decades there. 
   No American business I am aware of is being inhibited from doing business in Azerbaijan by what little remains of 907. I think the Senator from Maryland is correct in his interpretation of what remains of section 907.

   Mr. MCCONNELL. We do not yet have an agreement to move to a vote on this amendment. That may come later in the day. We do have a number of amendments we hope to be able to accept momentarily. So I can inform the Senate, I hope we are down to just a handful of remaining amendments that might require rollcall votes. Obviously, the Brownback amendment, as amended by the McConnell-Abraham amendment, is one that is going to require a rollcall vote. Before we get to that, we are going to dispose of a number of amendments by consent very shortly.

We believe we are down to the amendment we have been discussing all day, the Brownback amendment, as second-degreed by myself and Senator ABRAHAM regarding section 907, and the amendment we are in the process of debating, the Leahy-Dodd amendment with regard to travel restrictions to Cuba. And final passage. That is where I believe we are at this moment--with the need to wrap up the debate on the Dodd-Leahy amendment, the need to give Senator KERRY an opportunity to speak on the 907 issue and Senator TORRICELLI an opportunity to speak to the 907 issue.

   Mr. MCCONNELL. The Senator from Colorado is exactly right. Considering the fact that barely 40 percent of the interest to be derived from the investment of the proceeds from the sale of the IMF gold would actually be available to the HIPC nations for debt relief, it seems to me that this amounts to a cruel hoax. Of particular concern to me is the fact that the sale of the IMF gold would reduce gold prices to such an extent that the harm done to HIPC nations' economies will likely exceed any benefit from this debt relief effort. I believe the issue of debt relief for the HIPC nations is important and must be dealt with, but such a program must be designed to reduce the economic burden on these countries not compound them.

I would point out to the Senator,  as I am sure he is already aware, that absent an act of Congress, the statute makes it clear that neither the President nor any person or agency acting on behalf of the United States can vote to approve the sale of IMF gold.

   Mr. MCCONNELL. The Senator from Colorado is absolutely correct. For the reasons I have outlined, I believe the proposal to sell IMF gold as part of the HIPC Initiative is misguided and just plain bad policy. I could not support legislation authorizing such a sale as part of this or any bill. And, I will say to the distinguished Senator from Colorado, that when I take this bill to conference with the House, we will include a Statement of Manager's language that will reiterate that the sale of IMF gold cannot go forward unless we in Congress specifically provide authorization.

   Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Litigation Fairness Act of 1999. This common sense legislation says that whenever the government sues private-sector companies to recover costs, the government plaintiff gets no more rights than the ordinary plaintiff. If the law is good enough for the average citizen, then it's good enough for the government. 
   This legislation to codify rules of fair play for government-sponsored lawsuits is necessary for three reasons: 
   First, the Litigation Fairness Act is necessary to prevent an avalanche of lawsuits against law-abiding companies. Let me say at the outset: this legislation is not about tobacco. Tobacco was just the beginning--the Model Act for hungry and enterprising trial lawyers. 
   After tobacco, there was speculation that the government would sue the men and women who manufacture and sell guns in America. The speculation was right. And now that we've got government-sponsored lawsuits against gun companies, the speculation turns to other legal industries, such as automobile manufacturers, paint manufacturers, and--yes, even the fast food industry. 
   Before some of you begin to shake your head about this widespread speculation, let me share some recent theories I've heard that verify that the theater of the absurd continues to move ever closer to legal reality. As reported recently by the Associated Press, a Yale professor is espousing a theory that, ``There is no difference between Ronald McDonald and Joe Camel.'' Both market products that are--and I quote this Professor from a recent seminar--``luring our children into killer habits'' ultimately increasing healthcare costs for the public--so the theory goes. And I promise that I'm not making this up. This Ivy League professor was in Washington just yesterday discussing this emerging theory. 
   Second, this legislation ensures basic fairness for individual citizens. Under established principles of tort law, private plaintiffs are often barred from recovering damages based on a failure to prove direct causation. For example, if a person is injured in an automobile accident, but cannot prove that his or her injuries were caused by a defect of the  automobile then that person cannot recover from the manufacturer. This legislation simply says that if the injured party couldn't recover from the auto manufacturer, then the government should not be able to sue the manufacturer to recover the health care expenses incurred by the government on behalf of the injured person. 
   In short: Government plaintiffs should not have rights superior to those rights of private plaintiffs. 
   Third, the Litigation Fairness Act is necessary to prevent taxation through litigation. The power to tax is a legislative function and those who raise taxes should be directly accountable to the voters. Fortunately, it is getting more and more difficult to raise taxes in the Congress and the State legislatures--so money-hungry trial lawyers and big-government public officials are bypassing legislatures to engage in taxation and regulation through litigation. The Litigation Fairness Act will discourage lawyer-driven tax increases being dressed up and passed off as government lawsuits. 
   In closing, I want to point out some things that the Litigation Fairness Act does not do: it does not prohibit government lawsuits; it does not close the courthouse door to injured parties; it does not place caps on recoveries or limits on lawyer fees. Further, the Litigation Fairness Act cannot be construed to create or authorize any cause of action for any governmental entity. 
   In fact, the Litigation Fairness Act does not even prohibit the unholy marriage between plaintiffs' lawyers and government officials--although it admittedly makes such a marriage of money and convenience a bit less desirable. My legislation will simply ensure that the government plays by the same rules as its citizens. 
   This bill has broad support. I ask unanimous consent that the RECORD include statements in support of the bill from the United States Chamber of Commerce, the American Tort Reform Association, and Citizens for a Sound Economy.

    Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the Rev. H. Donald Cockerham for 30 years of dedicated service to the members of Zion Missionary Baptist Church in Louisville. His devoted congregation recently honored him by writing and performing a play about his life, and I am proud to join in their celebration of this milestone anniversary for both Rev. Cockerham and the church body. 
   Rev. Cockerham, born in McComb, Mississippi, first came to Louisville in 1969, to preach at a foreign missions rally. At that time, he was the minister at Calvary Baptist Church in Chicago, but after filling-in as speaker at Zion one Sunday, Zion began to pursue Cockerham as a candidate for pastor. Although he was serving another church, he said he felt called to accept the invitation to lead Zion's congregation. 
   By all accounts, Zion flourished under Rev. Cockerham's leadership. During his 30 years as pastor, the church building changed significantly, with the construction of a new wing. Also, the addition of a new organ and piano have surely been a blessing to the church choir when they perform their well-known presentation of the ``Messiah'' each Christmas. During Rev. Cockerham's time as pastor, Zion has also significantly increased opportunities for youth through additional ministry programs. 
   Rev. Cockerham was not only deeply involved in his church, but was also an integral part of the community. Over the years, he has been involved in the WHAS Crusade for Children, a project which raises funds to help with the care and treatment of handicapped children in Kentucky and southern Indiana. Reverend Cockerham has won numerous awards and distinctions during the past 30 years, and was recognized most recently by the Louisville YMCA as a 1999 Adult Black Achiever. 
   I am certain that the legacy of commitment to faith that Rev. Cockerham has left will continue on, and will encourage and inspire those who follow. Reverend, best wishes for many more years of service, and know that your efforts to better Zion Missionary Baptist Church and the Louisville community will be felt for years to come. On behalf of myself and my colleagues in the United States Senate, thank you for giving so much of yourself for so many others.

    Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Roberta Foust, or ``Bobbie'' as she is known to her many friends and readers. With her recent retirement from The Paducah Sun, Bobbie completes a distinguished career as a journalist. 
   Her byline has long been a familiar one to news readers in the western part of Kentucky. She worked for The Calvert News in Calvert City in the 1960's. In 1972, she began working as a reporter and photographer for The Tribune Courier in Marshall County, in the heart of Kentucky's Western Lakes region. After 5 years, she moved to the rival Marshall County Messenger, where she was responsible for all news content, layout, and design. She returned to The Tribune Courier in a similar capacity in 1979. In 1988, she became the editor of the weekly Herald Ledger in Eddyville, a position she held until the local ownership sold the paper in 1991. 
   Bobbie then joined the largest newspaper in far Western Kentucky, The Paducah Sun, a daily with a circulation of 31,000. With the Sun, Bobbie served as a general assignment reporter. In this position, she worked in Marshall, Lyon, and other lakes-area counties. Besides the usual broad assortment of news she covered in her day-to-day duties, Bobbie covered certain continuing stories, and developed an in-depth knowledge in these areas that was widely recognized. Among these were the Land Between the Lakes and the role of the Tennessee Valley Authority in LBL and Western Kentucky. During this time, Bobbie earned broad respect in the region she covered, as well as at TVA headquarters in Knoxville and Washington. 
   I have not only been a regular reader of Bobbie's, but have often been covered in her stories. Over the years, I have had the opportunity to get to  know her first-hand, and feel that I am in a uniquely qualified position to comment upon her journalistic legacy. Bobbie has earned a reputation of persistence, thoroughness, and objectivity--the three lodestars of her profession. Always firm in getting the story for her readers, she was unflappably cordial in personal demeanor in the performance of her duties. 
   Bobbie's retirement plans include the possibility of taking some college course work, and hopefully, the role of occasional contributor to The Paducah Sun. Along with Bobbie's husband, Ray, and children, Donna, Terrie, Jackie, and Dennis, I wish Bobbie an enjoyable and productive retirement. I ask that my colleagues join me in recognizing the career of this outstanding Kentuckian.

    Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to four brave individuals who lost their lives last week in a tragic helicopter crash in Breathitt County, Kentucky. Sheila Zellers, Brian Harden, Ernie Jones, and Don Green, were crew members on a helicopter providing emergency medical service to rural Eastern Kentucky. On Monday June 14, 1999, these dedicated care-givers were returning to the University of Kentucky's Chandler Medical Center in Lexington, Kentucky, from Breathitt County Airport. Tragically, they did not make it. 
   Mrs. Sheila Zellers, of Elizabethtown, Kentucky, served as the flight nurse on the helicopter and had worked with the University of Kentucky's hospital for more than twenty years. She served in the hospital's neonatal intensive care unit and emergency room before becoming a flight nurse in 1991. More importantly, she was a loving wife and mother. Our hearts and prayers go out to her husband Jeffrey and their four sons. 
   Mr. Brian Harden, from Richmond, Kentucky, was the paramedic on Monday's flight crew. While only 33, he had already had a distinguished career providing emergency medical services in Kentucky as a paramedic. Flight paramedics, such as Mr. Harden, are critical in providing emergency care from the time they leave the scene until they reach the hospital. I would like to extend the Senate's deepest sympathies to his wife Patricia, and their two young daughters. 
   The helicopter's two pilots, Ernie Jones and Don Green, were both well-known among their colleagues as experienced, highly-skilled pilots. Frequently, the pilots who fly these emergency helicopters are called upon to land their helicopters in small parking lots, highways, pastures, and gorges, in order to safely evacuate their patients. Their families and friends will be in our prayers. 
   It is important that we recognize the impact these individuals and their colleagues have on the citizens of Eastern Kentucky. Like so much of rural America, the residents of Eastern Kentucky lack easy access to the advanced medical resources and trauma centers available in more metropolitan areas. In order to provide this much needed care to Eastern Kentucky, the University of Kentucky Medical Center began helicopter flights to the region in 1987. For 12 years, these emergency medical crews have ferried accident victims, critically ill children, cardiac patients, and infants too ill to travel by ambulance to the UK Medical Center. It is not unusual for these dedicated caregivers to work twelve hour shifts and fly up to seven missions a day, each time making a difference in the lives of their patients. It is with this in mind that we recognize the sacrifices of these dedicated care-givers and note that they will be forever missed by their families, friends, colleagues, and the Commonwealth of Kentucky.

   Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today in support of S. 1205, the Military Construction Appropriations bill. I congratulate Chairman BURNS and the ranking member, Senator MURRAY, for crafting a spending bill which addresses the critical priorities of America's soldiers in a prudent and effective manner. 
   This year's Administration submission made the task of the Committee more difficult than at any time since I have been a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee. By suggesting that Congress incrementally fund all military construction programs, the Administration charted a course for failure and left Senators BURNS and MURRAY to clean up the mess. They have done so admirably and I am proud to support their efforts. 
   While I strongly support the entire bill before the Senate today, I would like to take just a moment of the Senate's time to explain a particular section of the bill. Section 129 of this measure was included at my request and deals with the construction of chemical demilitarization facilities at the Bluegrass Army Depot in Kentucky. Specifically, this provision would prohibit such construction until the Secretary of Defense reports on the completed demonstration of 6 alternatives to baseline incineration as a means of destroying America's chemical weapons stockpile. 
   I think it is important to state first what this amendment does not do. This language will have no impact on any proposed funding in the FY00 military construction bill. The reason is that the prohibition on spending for construction at Bluegrass Army Depot applies only to facilities which are technology specific. This means that construction for buildings which will be necessary regardless of the method of destruction employed at Bluegrass is permitted. This allows for progress on necessary components for eventual demilitarization activities such as administrative facilities, but prohibits construction of the actual treatment facility to be deployed in Kentucky until the Secretary certifies that demonstration of the six alternatives is complete. 
   It is also not my intent to delay or avoid destruction of the stockpile in Kentucky. My sole purpose is to ensure that when the weapons stored in Kentucky are destroyed only the safest most effective method is utilized. Once the Secretary certifies that all six alternative technologies have been demonstrated--and this can occur in the very near future--technology specific efforts at Bluegrass may begin. I supported ratification of the Chemical Weapons Convention and believe that the United States should do everything it can to meet the April 2007 deadline. The language contained in Section 129 should have no adverse impact on the  U.S. being able to satisfy its Chemical Weapons Convention obligations. 
   Now that I have offered an explanation as to what this language will not do, let me describe what I hope it will accomplish. Quite simply, this is a continuation of my efforts to push the military to recognize that public safety should be the top priority as America eliminates its chemical weapons in compliance with the CWC. The Army's selection of incineration as their preferred technology dates all the way back to 1982--almost 20 years ago. It is unreasonable, and in fact irresponsible, to assume that there have been no technological advancements since that time which could lead to improved methods of disposal. Only ten years ago few would have predicted the dynamic nature of the Internet would provide Americans instant access to information around the globe. Given that example, why has the department chosen to ignore potential strides in chemical weapons destruction? Why then has the safety of those Americans who live near chemical weapons destruction sites taken a back seat to fiscal and calendar concerns? 
   In an effort to force the Department to consider the possibility of alternatives to incineration, I offered and the Senate accepted an amendment to the FY97 Defense Appropriations bill which established the Assembled Chemical Weapons Assessment program. As I previously stated, this program identified a total of six technologies as suitable for demonstration. Unfortunately the Department has chosen to fund only three. As a result of the Department's decision to not fully test each technology, much of the good will established by the program has eroded. Continued DOD intransigence will lead to well deserved skepticism regarding the eventual report issued by ACWA. The citizens who are counting on the federal government's honest assessment of how to proceed deserve the security of knowing that all viable options were appropriately considered. 
   I have outlined the hypocrisy of the Department's argument in a floor statement I made on June 8, 1999, and so I will not repeat myself at this point. Regardless of the Department's contention that funding for further testing is limited, I believe the interests of public safety far outweigh any limited fiscal concerns. This is not a case of one Senator screaming that the ``sky is falling.'' Rather, this is an effort to hold the Department of Defense accountable for what should have always been its first priority--the safety of potentially impacted citizens. I will continue to press for full testing and accountability. 
   I thank my colleagues and urge their support for the Military Construction bill.

    Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to commend members of the American and international business communities who are providing resources and technical expertise to help the United Nations and other international relief organizations alleviate the suffering of hundreds of thousands of Kosovar refugees. 
   Today, as we embark on the initial stages of a peace agreement, hundreds of thousands of Kosovar refugees remain scattered across the globe. Slobodan Milosevic and his troops have driven these victims out of their country, separated families, destroyed homes, and stripped the refugees of their personal identification papers. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) reports that over 800,000 people have been forced to flee Kosovo since the Serb Army intensified ethnic purges two and a half months ago. 
   Refugee situations are always difficult. The Kosovar situation, however, has been exacerbated and complicated greatly by Milosevic's attempts at ``identity erasure.'' Servian soldiers have stripped the Kosovars of all identification documents and systematically destroyed civil records. Adding to the complexity of the situation, the refugees are spread over 30 different countries. 
   Companies such as Hewlett-Packard, Compaq, Microsoft, Securit World, Ericsson, and ScreenCheck are partnering with the Red Cross, UNHCR, the International Organisation for Migration and other international organizations on projects that will register the refugees, provide them with identification documents, and reunite them with their families. These companies are providing technical expertise, equipment, personnel and other resources that are allowing the refugees to be registered and located much more efficiently and effectively than ever before. 
   We are certainly witnessing a situation where the Internet and other recent technological innovations are providing solutions for real life problems. For example, Microsoft, Hewlett-Packard, Compaq and Securit have developed and provided systems that allow refugees to be registered, added to an international database, and to obtain identification cards--all within minutes. Further, the Red Cross is working with Compaq and Ericsson to launch the Family News Network, which is the first Internet-based refugee tracing system. 
   These companies are to be commended for their contributions to help restore the Kosovar community. It is my hope that in the future more members of the business community will enter into such beneficial partnerships to help address problems facing our country and our world.

   Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, the senior Senator from New Hampshire, Mr. BOB SMITH, introduced a rules  change which I, as chairman of the Rules Committee, am happy to cosponsor. I commend our colleague, Senator BOB SMITH, for an excellent and outstanding idea. 
   Since 1892, Americans have expressed their reverence for the flag of this Nation and all it represents by reciting the Pledge of Allegiance. The Pledge was first recited at the 1892 World's Fair to commemorate the 400th anniversary of the discovery of America. Since that time, hundreds and thousands of civic organizations and schoolchildren have taken time before turning to their work to recite these moving words:  
   I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one Nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.  
   Mr. President, I can remember as a schoolchild in Athens, Alabama, standing at my desk, placing my hand over my heart, fixing my eyes upon the flag, and reciting these eloquent words. I suspect many of our colleagues here in the Senate had the same experience in school as they were growing up. 
   Even at that early age, pledging allegiance to the flag encouraged me to think about the history and ideals of this Nation. It was an important ritual for schoolchildren then. It should be an important ritual for the Senate now. 
   Presently, we begin each day's business here in the Senate with a prayer. This solemn act reminds us of certain principles and values that we as a people hold dear. Similarly, daily recitation of the pledge would serve as an inspirational start to each legislative day. 
   The pledge is a time for reflecting on the inspiring history and ideals of liberty and freedom that the Stars and Stripes represents. Setting aside this time each day will serve to remind Americans of the venerated place the flag holds in our country and our culture. 
   Mr. President, among my most prized possessions is the American flag which honored, as he was laid to rest, my father's service to our Nation. That flag rests proudly on the marble mantel in my Senate office. 
   A clinical assessment of that flag would conclude that it is some mixture of cotton fabric, dyed red, white, and blue. But for me, it harkens back to the selfless patriotism of a father who fought for his Nation during World War II, a father who instilled in his son an awe and abiding respect for this great Nation we are all so fortunate to call home. 
   Old Glory has been a beacon of hope for over 200 years, a touchstone for patriotic Americans, and a source of comfort and pride for individuals at home and abroad. In the words of Senator Charles Sumner, ``In a foreign land, the flag is companionship, and country itself, with all its endearments.'' 
   The flag is, without question, a powerful symbol the world over. For nearly every American, it is the most powerful patriotic inspiration. 
   It is my distinct honor today to cosponsor this resolution as chairman of the Senate Rules Committee. I also want to commend my good friend from New Hampshire, Senator BOB SMITH, for an excellent idea and for his leadership on this issue. The Senate should promptly pass this resolution to begin every day in the Senate Chamber with the pledge of allegiance to our flag and to the Republic for which it stands, the Republic to which we have dedicated ourselves as Senators.

   Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, my request for $8 million for ``Improved HMMWV Research'' under Army RDT&E, ``Combat Vehicle and Automotive Advanced Technology'' was incorporated in this year's defense appropriations bill. These funds are intended to initiate a third phase of the design, demonstration and validation of ultra-light, steel-based structures and advanced powertrain architectures on high volume truck platforms. 
   This research effort, competitively selected by the Army in fiscal year 1999 subsequent to the submittal of the President's Budget is titled ``Improved Materials Powertrain Architectures for 21st Century Trucks,'' IMPACT. The full program will cover light/medium military payloads up to five tons, including applications with an open or closed bed configuration currently serviced by several of the Army's HMMWV variants. 
   Kentucky is a large commercial producer and Army base user of such vehicles, and now, through the University of Louisville's involvement in this effort, it will also play an important research role in their design and testing. The military should realize significant procurement and O&M cost savings as a result.

   Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss an issue that is both important and timely--the security of our nation's secrets and classified material. 
   Two days ago a bipartisan committee released a report detailing a level of espionage that few Americans expected. American's most vital nuclear information was stolen from the very places that were supposed to be the most secure. I am not here to cast blame but, rather, wish to discuss a program designed to help reduce the risk of this type of travesty. 
   The Department of Defense has in place a Federal Specification, FF-L-2740, which sets the minimum requirements for locks to be used on any container storing classified materials. The Department, to its credit, is near completion of a program to retro-fit all containers which do not currently meet that specification. 
   However, there remains an area where our classified materials are vulnerable. As Senator STEVENS knows, contractors also store classified documents throughout the country. Unfortunately, they often do so in containers bearing locks which do not meet Federal Specification FF-L-2740. So, I would ask my colleague, Senator STEVENS, does he believe that our nation's classified documents should be properly stored, whether housed at a governmental agency or contractor's office?

   I also want to make the entire Senate aware of a letter written by the Chairman and Vice Chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee. Senators SHELBY and KERREY wrote to the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Command, Control, Communications and Intelligence and pointed out that ``It appears the outdated, non-compliant locks still employed by Defense contractors cannot adequately prevent surreptitious entry.'' They go on to state that ``FF-L-2740 compliant locks are more cost-effective than the devices currently in use.'' Finally, they close by stating that they ``believe DOD should consider directing the retrofit of Defense contractors' equipment.'' 
   I thank the Senator from Alaska for his support of the $10 million appropriation for this retrofit program. His leadership will help prevent the type of espionage that has dominated the news in recent days.

   Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to address the issue of Chemical Weapons Demilitarization. I do so in order to point out that the Department of Defense has consistently ignored Congressional directive and intent. 
   In 1996, I offered and the Senate accepted an amendment which directed the Army to identify and demonstrate technologies other than baseline incineration which could be utilized in the destruction of America's chemical weapons stockpile. This program, which came to be known as the Assembled Chemical Weapons Assessment, or ACWA, enjoyed tremendous inititial success. Through the involvement of the DoD, the Army, technology providers and citizens advocacy groups--disparate interests, indeed--agreement was reached on how the process should proceed as well as the criteria for success. It is also critical to point out that one area of consensus was that the timely destruction of the stockpiles remained a top priority. Nobody involved in this process advocates unnecessary delay in efforts to comply with the Chemical Weapons Convention 2007 deadline. Certainly, I never viewed my efforts as anything other than a safeguard to ensure that once the destruction of the stockpile located in Kentucky began, only the safest method available was utilized. 
   Unfortunately, this is where the good news ends. 
   After rigorous evaluation and discussions, the decision was announced that six separate methods met the technological criteria necessary in order to be tested as alternatives to baseline incineration. These six were the only proposals of the almost 20 originally submitted for consideration which were deemed capable of producing safer methods. Unfortunately the Army and the Department of Defense made the decision to move forward and evaluate only three of the qualified technologies, leaving three untested. Further, this decision was made not on the basis of what was technologically feasible, but solely on the basis on what was cost-efficient. Not in the interests of finding the safest manner available to destroy the weapons, but on satisfying the minimum requirements so that the incineration could continue regardless of the results of the testing. 
   To help ease this budget difficulty, I offered and the Senate accepted, an amendment to the FY99 Department of Defense Appropriations Bill which gave the Secretary of Defense the Authority to reprogram up to $25 million in order to fully test each of the technologies which met the criteria for selection as potential alternatives to incineration. This provision was included in the final version of the Defense bill, and was eventually signed into law. 
   Mr. President, despite this clear expression of Congressional intent, the Army, the Department and the Administration have consistently refused to allocate sufficient funds to complete the testing. As a result, the ACWA program is in danger of losing its credibility--the very quality that led to its initial successes. If the testing of the three technologies does not produce a viable alternative to incineration, then the legitimate question will be posed, ``What about the additional proposals which were viewed to have merit as alternatives to incineration?''

   Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to join my esteemed colleagues in the introduction of the Small Business Liability Reform Act of 1999. 
   Over the last 30 years, the American civil justice system has become inefficient, unpredictable and costly. Consequently, I have spent a great deal of my time in the United States Senate working to reform the legal system. I was particularly pleased to help lead in the efforts to pass the Volunteer Protection Act, which offers much-needed litigation protection for our country's battalion of volunteers. America's litigation crisis, however, goes well beyond our volunteers. 
   Lawsuits and the mere threat of lawsuits impede invention and innovation, and the competitive position our nation has enjoyed in the world marketplace. The litigation craze has several perverse effects. For example, it discourages the production of more and better products, while encouraging the production of more and more attorneys. In the 1950s, there was one lawyer for every 695 Americans. Today, in contrast, there is one lawyer for every 290 people. In fact, we have more lawyers per capita than any other western democracy. 
   Mr. President, don't get me wrong--there is nothing inherently wrong with being a lawyer. I am proud to be a graduate of the University of Kentucky College of Law. My point, however, is simple: government and society should promote a world where its more desirable to create goods and services than it is to create lawsuits. 
   The chilling effects of our country's litigation epidemic are felt throughout our national economy--especially by our small businesses. We must act to remove the litigation harness that constrains our nation's small businesses. 
   Small businesses are vital to our nation's economy. My state provides a perfect example of the importance of small business. In Kentucky, more than 85% of our businesses are small businesses. 
   The Small Business Lawsuit Abuse Protection Act is a narrowly-crafted bill which seeks to restore some rationality, certainty and civility to the legal system. 
   First, Title I of this bill would offer limited relief to businesses or organizations that have fewer than 25 full-time employees. Title I seeks to provide some reasonable limits on punitive damages, which typically serve as a windfall to plaintiffs. It also provides that a business's responsibility for noneconomic losses would be in proportion to the business's responsibility for causing the harm. 
   The other Title in the bill includes liability reforms for innocent product sellers--which are very often small businesses. These businesses are often dragged into product liability cases even though they did not produce, design or manufacture the product, and are not in any way to blame for the harm that the product is alleged to have caused. Title II would help protect product sellers from being subjected to frivolous lawsuits when they are not responsible for the alleged harm. 
   Now, let me explain what this bill does not do. It does not close the courthouse door to plaintiffs who sue small businesses. For example, this bill does not limit a plaintiff's ability to sue a small business for an act of negligence, or any other act, for that manner. It also does not prevent a plaintiff from recovering from product sellers when those sellers are responsible for harm. 
   Mr. President, this is a sensible, narrowly-tailored piece of legislation that is greatly needed to free up the enterprising spirit of our small businesses. I look forward to the Senate's consideration of this important legislation.

   Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I would like to make three comments on the nomination of Mr. Kent Wiedemann, a career foreign service officer slated to be the next U.S. Ambassador to the Kingdom of Cambodia. Let me say at the outset: I strongly oppose this nomination. 
   First, it is apparent that Mr. Wiedemann has done little to further the cause of democracy in Burma where he has been Charge in Rangoon for the past several years. When we met in my office a few months ago, I asked him to cite specific instance where he supported Burmese democracy activists. Mr. Wiedemann produced a single letter from demoracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi. However, he could not cite a single action or activity that he undertook on the ground to help strengthen justice and freedom in Burma. Not one. 
   In addition, I asked the Senate Foreign Relations Committee to request copies of all statements or speeches Mr. Wiedemann gave while serving in Burma which support the U.S. policy to restore the legitimate government of Aung San Suu Kyi to office. During his entire tenure, he could not provide a single example of remarks made at a Burmese forum supporting U.S. policy or democracy. 
   Pro-democracy Burmese activists wrote to me to share their views of Mr. Wiedemann's tenure in Rangoon:  
   The arrival of Mr. Wiedemann.......has not changed much in respect to our democracy movement. 
   [Wiedemann] remained inactive and ignorant to our vital problems, human rights, democracy and refugee, and made no efforts at seeking cooperation with our NGOs who had extensive experience in these regards.*.*.*. We were left in the cold. 
   [There was] no coordination or effort on the part of the embassy, to help the democracy movement of the exiles.*.*.*. Apart from regular meetings with Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi, we knew of no efforts by Mr. Wiedemann.  
   These are not my words; they are those of courageous Burmese men and women who dare to stand for principles and justice. Yet, less than one month after the passing of Aung San Suu Kyi's husband, I understand that Mr. Wiedemann again requested a letter from her in support of his nomination. He seems more interested in personal and career promotion than advancing the cause of freedom in Burma. 
   Second, Mr. Wiedemann is simply the wrong American representative to send to Cambodia at this difficult time. My colleagues may be interested to know that in March, I visited that war ravaged country and was not encouraged by what I saw and heard. From Khmer Rouge trials to narcotics trafficking by the Cambodian military to rampant corruption and pervasive lawlessness, the next U.S. Ambassador must be a vocal advocate of human rights and the rule of law. When Mr. Wiedemann's nomination was being considered last year, Prince Norodom Ranariddh--then the First Prime Minister who had been outsted in a bloody coup d'etat in July 1997--and Sam Rainsy--an opposition leader who has survived two assassination attempts since March 1997--expressed their grave concerns:  
   We urge you not to replace Ambassador Kenneth Quinn after his term expires in Phnom Penh, and certianly not with Kent Wiedemann who we believe may be less than supportive of the cause of democracy in Cambodia.  
   Other Cambodian democracy activists have since joined the chorus of concern with his nomination. Again, in their own words:  
   [We are] deeply concerned that Mr. Wiedemann will court CPP [the Cambodian People's Party] strongman Hun Sen--at the expense of the democratic opposition--in an attempt to win him over. 
   This particular nomination sends the wrong message at the wrong time to a government characterized by lawlessness and corruption. Mr. Wiedemann may lack the credentials to effectively promote American interests in Cambodia.*.*.*. He is not known as a vocal supporter of democracy in Southeast Asia.  
   Despite my strong beliefs and the legitimate fears of those who would be most affected by Mr. Wiedemann's appointment, it is clear that he will be confirmed by the Senate. Therefore, let me make clear my expectations of Mr. Wiedemann once he receives his credentials in Phnom Penh. 
   I expect him to meet regularly and publicly with opposition political party leaders as well as democracy and human rights activists. I expect him to openly embrace and actively encourage the rule of law in Cambodia, even if this causes tensions with Prime Minister Hun Sen and the ruling CPP party. I expect him to support international and local nongovernmental organizations in Phnom Penh committed to legal and political reforms. And, I expect that he will not shirk the awesome responsibilities as the American people's representative to Cambodia, a task that President Ronald Reagan described in February 1983:  
   The task that has fallen to us as Americans is to move the conscience of the world, to keep alive the hope and dream of freedom. For if we fail or falter, there'll be no place for the world's oppressed to flee to. This is not the role we sought. We preach no manifest destiny. But like the Americans who brought a new nation into the world 200  years ago, history has asked much of us in our time. (February 18, 1983)  
   Mr. President, it is my hope that Mr. Wiedemann will do a more noteworthy job in Cambodia supporting democracy, human rights, and the rule of law than his lackluster performance in Burma. I will be following his tenure in Cambodia to ensure that he does. 
   I have had this nomination on hold for more than a year. During that time, Mr. Wiedemann has waged a campaign to support his nomination, energy which might have been better directed by securing the declared U.S. goal of restoring the National League for Democracy to office. Nonetheless, I do not think one Senator should thwart the nomination process. So, I leave it to my colleagues to allow his nomination to move forward. I, for one, vote no.

   Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Bear Protection Act. This legislation, which I sponsored in the 105th Congress, is aimed at eliminating the poaching of America's bears for profit. As you may know, bear parts, such as gall bladders and bile, which are commonly referred to as ``viscera,'' have traditionally been used in myriad Asian medicines--for everything from diabetes to heart disease to hangovers, and in luxury shampoos and cosmetics. Due to the popularity of these products containing bear viscera, Asian bear populations have been decimated, causing poachers to run to American bears to meet the increasing demand. 
   Mr. President, the practice of poaching bears for viscera is both a national and international problem. Asian and American bear populations are threatened by high demand for and low supply of bear parts and by the black market trade in exotic and traditional medicine cures. The problem is compounded by the fact that the poaching of bears for their viscera is a very profitable enterprise, and one in which at least 18 Asian countries are known to participate. In fact, bear gall bladders in South Korea, for instance, are worth more than their weight in gold, fetching a price of about $10,000 a piece. 
   Mr. President, each year, nearly 40,000 black bears are legally hunted in 36 States and Canada. Unfortunately, it has been estimated that roughly the same number is illegally poached every year, according to a former chief law enforcement officer with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. While I am pleased to report that for the most part, U.S. bear populations have remained stable or are increasing, I continue to remain concerned about the threat posed by unchecked poaching. 
   Since 1981, State and Federal wildlife agents have conducted many successful undercover operations to aimed at exposing the illegal slaughter of American bears. As recently as this past February, a group of State and Federal officers arrested 25 people in Virginia and charged them with 112 wildlife violations including bear poaching as part of Operations SOUP, or ``Special Operation to Uncover Poaching.'' Operation SOUP is a major undercover investigation, which has been ongoing for three years and is aimed at the trafficking of gall bladders and other bear parts from black bears in Virginia and Shenandoah National Park. 
   Mr. President, I have with me two press releases from the Virginia Department of Game and Inland Fishing, as well as an article from the Washington Post which I would like to have placed in the RECORD. 
   Mr. President, as these and other news reports will attest, this problem with poaching and trading bear parts must be addressed. Although many States and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service are making efforts to combat this problem, these agencies have neither the funds nor the resources to adequately solve the problem. Moreover, there are loopholes created by a patchwork of State laws that allow these illegal practices to flourish. There are fourteen States in which the sale of bear gall bladders is legal--eight of those States limit the sale to viscera taken from bears in other States, and there are five States that have no law in this regard. This patchwork of State laws enables poachers to ``launder'' the gall through the States that permit the sale of gall bladders. As long as a few States allow this action to go on, poaching for profit will continue. 
   Mr. President, as I mentioned earlier, this is both a national and international problem--and it is a growing problem. The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES), to which the United States is a party, has recognized the issue of bear conservation as a global issue. In fact, CITES has noted that ``the continued illegal trade is bear parts and derivatives of bear parts undermines the effectiveness of the Convention and that if CITES parties ..... do not take action to eliminate such trade, poaching may cause declines of wild bears that could lead to the extirpation of certain populations or even species.'' The Convention goes on to say that in order to achieve this goal, ``submitted and measurable action'' must be taken--this includes adopting national legislation. 
   I would like to point out that members of the U.S. delegation to the CITES Convention contributed to the drafting of that resolution, and in doing so, made a strong statement about the need to strengthen our national commitment to eradicating the poaching of bears. Recently, the Secretariat pointed out that bear poaching is most likely to flourish in countries that have inconsistent internal trade, import, and export controls. In such instances where there are differences in national, Federal, and State laws, the Secretariat asserts that confusion and enforcement difficulties arise which will contribute to the availability of bear viscera that can become available for international trade. 
   Mr. President, in order to halt the poaching of America's bears, we need to effectuate legislation that not only prohibits the import and export of bear viscera, but we need to close the loopholes in State laws that encourage poachers to evade the law. To effectively reduce the laundering of bear viscera through the United States, all states must have a minimum level of protection. We must also stop the import and export of bear viscera, so that we can shut off the international trade before America's bear populations suffer the same fate as Asian bear populations. 
   The Bear Protection Act will do just that. It will establish national guidelines for trade in bear parts, but will not weaken any existing state laws that have been instituted to deal with this issue. The outright ban on the trade, sale or barter of bear viscera, including items that claim to contain bear parts, will close the existing loopholes and will allow State and Federal wildlife officials to focus their limited resources on much needed conservation efforts.  
   Mr. President, let me underscore that my bill would in no way infringe on the rights of hunters to legally hunt bears. These sportsmen would still be allowed to keep trophies and furs of bears killed during legal hunts. 
   The Bear Protection Act will also bolster America's efforts to curtail the international bear trade by directing the Secretaries of the Interior and State, as well as the United States Trade Representative to establish a dialogue with the counties that share our interest in conserving bear species. This, too, is an important element of the legislation because I believe efforts to both reduce the demand for bear parts in Asia and encourage the increased usage of synthetic and other natural products as an alternative to beargall should be made a priority. 
   Mr. President, it is important that we act now to protect the American bear population. The United States must take a stand and be an example to the rest of the world by prohibiting the illegal taking and smuggling of American bears. If we act now, we can stop the poaching of bears, which left unchecked, will lead us down a path toward these magnificent creatures' extinction. That is why I urge my colleagues to join me in support of this worthwhile legislation.

   Mr. McCONNELL. I ask the Chair to notify me when I have 3 minutes left. 
   Mr. President, the amendment that is now pending would require that when granting permits necessary for filming a movie or a TV show on Federal property, or with Federal equipment, the relevant agency's approval criteria now would include a consideration of whether the film glorifies or endorses wanton and gratuitous violence. The message is simple: The Federal Government will not allow Hollywood to promote excessive and wanton violence in our house. 
   America's children are exposed to incessant and endless hours of violent movies and television productions each year. Exposure to this violence desensitizes our children to brutality and killing and gives them ``glamorous'' murderous acts to emulate. This exposure is like pouring gasoline on fire. 
   Yes, the children who commit terrible acts of violence must have a number of deep and troubling problems. However, the glorified wanton violence depicted in movies and on TV is fuel that Hollywood is dousing on those children and their smoldering internal problems. This is not a revelation. Indeed, a 1996 American Medical Association Study concluded that, ``The link between media violence and real life violence has been proven by science time and time again.'' 
   Most people know, intuitively, that there is a strong link between media violence and real life. Why is it that no one in Hollywood seems to care? Are they the only ones who are oblivious to this phenomenon? Why is there no shame about the violent junk they are making and MARKETING to our kids? Why do we hear Hollywood give speech after speech after speech on every fad-driven cause under the sun, and yet rarely ever do we hear them mention reforming themselves and refraining from marketing violence to our children. 
   Let's take a look at some of the media violence that our children are exposed to. 
   First, let's go to the movies. 
   Now, I'm told that Leonardo DiCaprio and Keanu Reeves are two of the biggest teen idols out there today. These photographs are both from recent hit movies--``The Basketball Diaries'' and ``The Matrix''. 
   Thanks to the occupant of the Chair, Senator BROWNBACK, the Republican Senators had an opportunity to see some of the scenes from ``Basketball Diaries'' recently. That is one of the scenes from it here on my left. 
   The ``Matrix,'' featuring Keanu Reeves, is here on my right. 
   You can see from these photographs that Hollywood is taking the biggest teen idols and creating these glamorous, powerful, violent images to send out to our young people. These are role models for children. 
   As you can see here, in ``Basketball Diaries,'' teen idol DiCaprio is wearing a long, black trenchcoat and packing a shotgun. In this movie, DiCaprio's character has a fantasy of walking into his high school classroom and opening fire on his schoolmates and his teacher. 
   Thanks to the Senator from Kansas, Mr. BROWNBACK, we had an opportunity to see this scene from that film. I think we would all agree--those of us who saw it--it literally turns your stomach. 
   These violent images became reality in the community of Paducah, Kentucky, barely 17 months ago. In a Paducah high school, the DiCaprio Dream was played out in real life. I'd like to read for my colleagues an excerpt from a Newsweek article about ``Basketball Diaries'' and the senseless tragedy in Paducah.  
   ``The Basketball Diaries'' may not have been 14-year-old Michael Carneal's favorite  movie. But one scene in particular stayed with the awkward Paducah, Ky., freshman: a young character's narcotic-tinged dream of striding into his school, pulling a shotgun from a black leather coat and opening fire. The real-life scene in the bloodied halls of Heath High School last Monday was a long way from Hollywood. Unlike handsome actor Leonardo DiCaprio's dramatic entrance in 1995's ``Diaries,'' skinny, bespectacled Michael bummed a ride to school that day from his 17-year-old sister, Kelly. Instead of cinematically kicking down a classroom door, Michael quietly followed Kelly into the school through the band room, where he told a curious teacher that the four guns bound together with duct tape and wrapped in an old blanket were ``a poster for my science project.'' Loitering in the hall, Michael waited for a prayer group of 35 students to lift their bowed heads and say ``Amen.'' He then took a fifth gun, a semiautomatic .22, from his backpack and fired off 12 shots, killing three students and wounding five. Before the police arrived, Carneal would tell a teacher, `it was like I was in a dream.'  
   Looking back at Paducah, and now Littleton--and looking at these Hollywood images of teen idols--can leave no doubts. Hollywood violence DOES influence our children, in the worst way. 
   Let me tell you about this other hit movie--``The Matrix.'' The image of this character is strikingly similar to that over here of Mr. DiCaprio. Let me read to you how an article in the Washington Post described watching the Matrix.  
   The sold-out theatre was filled with younger teens, despite the R rating, and at times I felt as if I were watching a dramatization of the killings that had just occurred in Littleton, Colorado. 
   In one scene, protagonists played by Keanu Reaves and Carrie-Anne Moss arrive at an office building where their adversaries are holed up. Dressed in black leather coats, the pair sprays the lobby with automatic weapons fire. The scene is a gorgeously choreographed ballet of mass killing, a triumph of Hollywood's ability to represent graphic violence. As bullets riddle a dozen twitching bodies, spent shell casings cascade downward in slow motion. The victims of this orgy of killing are police officers. 
   I have heard some in Hollywood say that these violent movies are for adults--not for our impressionable children. Those comments simply are not credible. The reality is that Hollywood markets many such movies to teenagers. For proof, one need only to look as far as the hit Teen Movie--``Scream.'' In this movie young, beautiful high school students slay, stab and butcher each other and their teachers for two non-stop hours. ``The movie builds to a finale in which one of the killers announces that he and his accomplice started off by murdering strangers but then realized it was a lot more fun to kill their friends.'' Where is the Shame, Hollywood? 
   Mr. President, if the sights and sounds of Hollywood were not enough for you, let me take you to the next level: the gutter of the new millennium--violent videogames. This is a dimension where our children are not limited to be mere watchers. Rather, in videogames they are participants--active participants. America's children can descend as low as a twisted, demented videogame will take them. 
   I think these games have been best-described by Retired Lieutenant Colonel David Grossman, a former professor of psychology at West Point who now teaches a course to green berets on the psychology of killing. He calls them ``Murder Simulators.'' These are the ``games" our children are playing. 
   In the videogame ``Postal'' the goal is straightforward: kill as many townfolk as possible without being killed yourself. The maker of this game boasts, ``Chilling realism as victims actually beg for mercy, scream for their lives and bodies pile up on the street.'' That game maker certainly has no shame. 
   I want to share with you some fascinating excerpts from a recent ``60 Minutes'' episode with Retired Lieutenant Colonel David Grossman, the former West Point professor I mentioned earlier. They discussed the ``skills'' these games are teaching our children.  
   Colonel GROSSMAN. The same basic mechanisms that we use, step by step, to make killing a conditioned response in our soldiers, are being done in the games that the kids go and play.  
   Mr. President, let me tell you what Colonel Grossman had to say about Paducah, Kentucky and Michael Carneal.  
   Colonel GROSSMAN. Michael Carneal, a 14-year-old boy, has never fired a pistol before in his life. His total experience was countless, thousands and thousands of rounds in the video games. When Michael Carneal opened fire; he fired eight shots. ..... [H]e got eight hits on eight different kids. Five of them were head shots. The other three were upper torso. Now, the F.B.I. says in the average engagement, the average officer hits with less than one bullet in five.  
   Grossman concluded:  
   GROSSMAN. Here's what's fascinating about this crime. ..... He held that gun and he fired one shot at every target. Now, that is not natural. [A]nybody that's ever been in combat will tell you that the natural thing is to fire at a target until it drops. But the video games train you--if you're very, very, very good, what you'll do is you'll fire one shot--don't even wait for the target to drop--you don't have time--go to the next, and the next. And the video games give bonus effects for head shots.  
   Mr. President, I understand that the Motion Picture Association has been lobbying heavily against this amendment. 
   I want to make sure everybody understands what this amendment really does. It is quite mild. 
   The problems evidenced by these video games and movies are complicated and complex. We are not going to solve them overnight. I do believe it is time that Hollywood take more responsibility. We need to send the message to Hollywood: Don't bombard our children with glamorous portrayals of gratuitous and wanton violence. 
   Under the first amendment, we cannot and we should not seek to deny the right of free speech to anyone. However, as the Senate, we can encourage Hollywood to take responsible steps to protect our children. We can make sure the Federal Government does not costar with Hollywood in any movies that glorify or endorse wanton and gratuitous violence. 
   The Federal Government already currently grants permits to Hollywood, allowing them to film on Federal property or allowing them to borrow Federal equipment such as jeeps or weapons to use in these films. Many government agencies and departments currently decide whether or not to cooperate with a film or TV production based on the nature and message of the proposed production. 
   For example, DOD decides whether to grant Federal filming privileges based on whether a production ``appear[s] to condone or endorse activities . . . [that] are contrary to U.S. Government policy.'' 
   In other words, ``Top Gun'' is OK, but ``GI Jane'' is not. The military rolled out the red carpet for ``Top Gun'' while ``GI Jane'' had the door shut in her face. 
   When deciding whether to cooperate with a movie, NASA determines whether the ``story is reasonably plausible, does not advocate or glorify unlawful acts, . . . or present as factual history things which did not take place.'' 
   The Coast Guard looks at whether, among other things, the Coast Guard's cooperation ``is in the public interest.'' Let me quote to you from 14 United States Code Section 659, where Congress has mandated in federal statute that the Coast Guard cannot provide facilities or assistance to film producers unless it determines ``that it is appropriate, and that it will not interfere with Coast Guard missions.'' 
   The point is the Federal Government is already engaged in a clearance process when a motion picture seeks to be made on Federal property. We are not adding requirements that are not already there, with one exception. In this amendment where Federal agencies are already engaged in a subjective clearance process, either through statute or through policy, we add to it this standard: Promoting and endorsing or glorifying violence. 
   Clearly, this is not infringing on the movie industry's first amendment rights. They can simply go out and make their movies somewhere else. What we are saying here, if we are going to use our property, Federal property, and the agency already has a subjective clearance process, gratuitous, wanton and gratuitous violence needs to be added as a factor. 
   I reserve the remainder of my time.

   Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I would like to respond that the observations made by the other side have nothing to do with the amendment, nothing whatsoever to do with the amendment. 
   Any movie company is free to go make a movie anywhere it wants to in the country and say anything it wants to and be as depraved as it wants to be without interference from Government. This amendment is only related to the use of Federal property. 
   In many federal agencies and departments there are subjective standards being used now to approve or deny cooperation with film production companies. The thing the Senator from Vermont and the Senator from California are complaining about is already occurring. The Department of Defense has very subjective standards it applies to movies now. For example, it did not allow ``GI Jane'' to be made on Federal property or with DOD assistance. It did not keep the movie from being made, but the Defense Department did not like it; it had a very subjective standard. They said go make your movie somewhere else. They liked ``Top Gun.'' They allowed it to be made. There is a very subjective standard that applies now. 
   DOD considers whether a production ``appears to condone or endorse activities that are contrary to U.S. Government policy.'' That is clearly very subjective. Factors in NASA's policy include whether the story is reasonably plausible, does not advocate or glorify unlawful acts or present as factual history things which did not take place--that is fairly subjective. 
   At the Coast Guard, under statute, the Coast Guard does not provide facilities or assistance to film producers unless the Guard determines it is ``appropriate''--very subjective--and that it will not interfere with Coast Guard missions. 
   Mr. President, a movie company now does not have the inalienable right or constitutional right to come onto Federal property and do anything it wants to. All we are saying, to Federal agencies that have either a policy or a statute giving them the authority to clear these movies for content--and we've seen that some have them now--that they simply add to the list of subjective evaluations they already make a consideration of wanton and gratuitous violence. Surely our colleagues who have spoken on the other side of this are not arguing we ought to repeal the current standards because they are very subjective. Maybe they do not want any standard at all to apply with respect to the use of Federal property. 
   With regard to the parks system, they do not currently have subjective criteria and standard, so this would not apply to them. They are clearly outside of this. 
   This is a very narrowly crafted message to Hollywood not to produce this kind of gratuitous and wanton violence on Federal property with federal cooperation. It certainly does not take away anybody's constitutional right to go out and act in as awful a manner as they want to and put it on film. They just wouldn't be able to do it on Federal property. 
   I reserve the remainder of my time.

   Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, it is interesting, in Hollywood lobbying efforts, they always scream censorship. This amendment has nothing to do with censorship. It has to do with the use of Federal property and federal assistance, which is a privilege, not a right. 
   The Federal Government, through various departments and agencies, already has very subjective standards. We are simply adding to those kinds of standards one more factor--wanton and gratuitous violence. No movie company in America has a right to use any and all Federal property and to get federal assistance anyway. We are just adding one more criterion. 
   This is a very reasonable amendment. I hope it will be approved by my colleagues.

   Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, the amendment we are about to vote on is very narrowly drafted to add one additional factor to those Federal agencies that have subjective standards they apply prior to allowing the shooting of a movie on Federal property. 
   The subject of the amendment is the making of movies on Federal property and with federal assistance. There are at least three federal entities--the Defense Department, NASA, and the Coast Guard--that currently have quite subjective standards which they apply to the movie industry when asked for permission to make a movie on Federal property or with their cooperation and assistance. 
   All this amendment does is add one more factor--one, wanton and gratuitous violence--to those standards. Bear in mind this amendment has no first amendment implications at all. Any movie company that wants to make a movie and do anything and say anything and depict anything they want to can continue to do that. They just won't do it on Federal property. 
   This is a mild amendment that sends a message to Hollywood. 
   I hope my colleagues will support it.

   Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, in 1941, Monroe, North Carolina, lost Bud Nance, a favorite home grown boy, who traveled north to the U.S. Naval Academy. Last week, we all suffered the loss of Admiral Nance to a different journey. He passed away after a life time of dedicated and successful service to his country. But, what most of us will recall beyond his distinguished record and credentials is the support and friendship Bud offered many of us, especially to Senator HELMS. 
   Bud brought the quiet confidence and certain purpose he had gained from growing up in a close knit community to each challenge and task he faced. When he arrived to serve Senator HELMS as chief of staff of the Foreign Relations Committee there were no shortages to the variety and complexity of those challenges. But, Bud had a gift for dissecting and analyzing complicated issues--whether personnel or policy--cutting with certainty to the heart of any matter, giving guidance then moving on to the next challenge. He saw each problem as an opportunity to support his friends and serve his country. 
   The many conversations I enjoyed with Bud flowed from our common reverence for the history and stories so familiar in the South. He represented the best of North Carolina traditions--he had that strong streak of country sense, yet was ever sentimental; his wisdom twinkled with humor. He brought these strengths to every discussion we had on a wide range of issues from arms control to foreign aid--he made a difference with Southern distinction. 
   Bud's loss will be felt most deeply by his life long and good friend, ``JESSE''. I thank him for sharing Bud with us for the past 8 years. The Senate and its Members are the richer for his contribution and service.

    Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to honor Dr. Kenneth Winters on the occasion of his retirement as president of Campbellsville University. Ken is a good personal friend and an admired leader in Taylor County. 
   Ken served as Campbellsville's president for the past 11 years, and accomplished much during his tenure. Under Ken's leadership, the school gained university status after having been known as Campbellsville College since its inception in 1909. The added prestige that comes with university status, coupled with Ken's hard work to make the school an academic success, helped increase Campbellsville enrollment by stunning 150 percent. The university also has been duly recognized by publications such as U.S. News & World Report, Money and Newsweek for its outstanding academic reputation. Ken's presidency brought a strong, guiding presence to Campbellsville, leaving a legacy of growth and progress. 
   As importantly, Ken showed unswerving commitment to the students and faculty at CU, and was well-liked and respected by all. Ken's colleagues describe him as a man with great strength of character--a man who demonstrated honesty and integrity, and who served as a campus role-model. 
   I am certain that the legacy of excellence that Ken Winters has left will continue on, and will encourage and inspire others toward that same goal. Ken, best wishes on your future endeavors, and know that your efforts to better Christian higher education will be felt for years to come. On behalf of myself and my colleagues, thank you for your contribution to Taylor County, the State of Kentucky, and to our great Nation.

    Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the career and civic contributions of Mr. Ken Wheeler, an industry leader and community builder in Paducah, Kentucky. Ken's recent retirement is the culmination of a forty-two year career in the maritime industry spanning shipbuilding to inland shipping. 
   Ken earned a degree in mechanical engineering at Southern Methodist University and worked for twenty-four years for Ingalls Shipbuilding in the company's nuclear-submarine division. By the time he left Ingalls Shipbuilding, he was the company's vice-president of submarine programs. Contributions from individuals such as Ken Wheeler helped make our nation's nuclear-submarine fleet the safest, quietest, and most effective in the world. In the early 1980's, Ken and his wife, Jean, relocated to Paducah following Ken's career move to Midland Enterprises, which operates tow boats on the nations inland riverways. 
   Since joining Midland Enterprises, Ken has held various positions including vice-president of repair and maintenance, Port Allen Marine; president, Walker Boat Yard; vice-president, Harley Marine Corp.; president, R & W Marine, Inc.; and vice-president, maintenance and repair for all the Midland Enterprise companies. 
   Ken has been a key player in establishing Paducah as a national hub for river trade. The city currently boasts about twenty towing companies, and more than 130 supporting businesses. The towing industry in Paducah accounts for approximately 1,300 jobs and a $35,000,000 annual payroll. Ken has used his position within the industry as a ``bully pulpit'' to advocate needed infrastructure improvements on the riverways, our nation's internal trade lifeline. From the new Olmsted Dam on the Ohio River, not far from its confluence with the mighty Mississippi, to the expanded lock facilities at Kentucky Dam on the Tennessee River, Ken has worked to make sure that the general public as well as those in government understand the importance of a strong and vital river-transportation network. A network which has a great, but often unrecognized impact on our American way of life. Ken's goal as we cross the threshold into a new millennia has simply been to make certain that America's riverways continue to supply the economical transportation which we have so long enjoyed. As other countries around the world improve their inland transportation networks, we must work to ensure that increased costs of transportation do not put our exports at a competitive disadvantage. 
   In other areas of civic concern, Ken has also worked to better Western Kentucky by serving on the boards of Paducah Community College, and West Kentucky Technical College. He is a past president of the Propeller Club of the United States. Additionally, he chairs the River Heritage Center, an exciting new development which will showcase the history of the inland rivers and their importance. 
   Mr. President, I commend Ken Wheeler for his outstanding service to Kentucky and the nation. Whether it be building systems that helped win the Cold War, or championing an industry vital to our national commerce, Ken Wheeler's contributions will have long-lasting effect. I ask that my fellow colleagues join me in recognizing the career of this outstanding Kentuckian.

    Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to thank my good friend Howard Schnellenberger for making University of Louisville football the success that it is, and wish him the best in his latest endeavor to build a completely new football program at Florida Atlantic University. 
   Howard was the Cardinal's football coach for nine years and, when he left, had re-created the program to be unlike any the University of Louisville had ever seen. Howard didn't just talk about what he wanted to accomplish at U of L, he delivered. He recruited better players, he initiated plans for a brand new state-of-the-art stadium, and most importantly he inspired a kind of spirit in the Cardinals' faculty, fans and players that they had never experienced before. It was this winning spirit that helped Howard lead Cardinals football to its present glory. 
   Howard believed in his team and his school, and set no meager goals for them. He wanted nothing less than to transform them from a team that hadn't had a winning season in years, to a team that would be a legitimate bowl contender. While U of L may still have some progress to make, the Cards have played in, and won, several bowl games in recent years--and for that, Howard is largely responsible. 
   I have no doubt that Howard will have as significant an effect on Florida Atlantic University as he had on U of L. Howard will have a chance to build this program from the ground-up--as of yet, FAU doesn't even have a team. As FAU's Director of Football Operations, Howard will hand-pick the staff and the players and mold the football program in the likeness of his previous  success stories. With Howard's track record, FAU can expect an exciting program that will build steadily toward future success. 
   Thank you, Howard, for your nine years of dedicated service to the University of Louisville, which resulted in a winning team and a top-quality program. Five years after your departure, your spirit continues to drive the Cardinals football program toward victory. Best wishes at Florida Atlantic University, and may God bless you and Beverlee in this exciting adventure.

   Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, having just returned from Cambodia, Indonesia, Australia and New Zealand, I was impressed by how deeply concerned regional leaders were over the status and conditions in East Timor. 
   Although the first really democratic elections to be held in Indonesia are coming up in June, the U.N. autonomy agreement, which should be announced today, was the focus of most of my discussions. While I was in the region, there was yet another explosive round of violence which left 17 dead. There is absolutely no question that most of these attacks are being carried out by  militias which enjoy military support from the Indonesian armed forces. 
   I do not believe these militias are directly commanded by Indonesian officers. However, I do think these militias are both encouraged and equipped by individuals in the military who oppose autonomy or independence for East Timor. There clearly are officers with a vested interest in controlling the ports and trade through Timor. These individuals have put self interest above their nation's interest. 
   While in Jakarta I raised these specific concerns directly with General Wiranto. I believe he recognizes that these events damage Indonesia's stability and stature. I hope he will pursue a more aggressive course in the days to come to assure this spiral of violence ends. 
   In the meantime, I think we should make clear we will not allow US equipment to be used to further the violence in East Timor. I also believe it is essential to deploy civilian poll watchers and police to restore calm and credibility to the election process. To accomplish this goal in a timely and effective manner, I have initiated discussions with key congressional members to add funds to the supplemental bill to support a peacekeeping presence in East Timor. I understand that the UN estimates an election team supported by civilian police observers may cost as much as $50 million. I fully expect our regional partners and Portugal to assume a leadership role in meeting these needs, but we have key interests in promoting Indonesian stability and security. I would hope we can commit roughly $10 million to this endeavor. I am convinced that our support for an international monitoring initiative administered through the United Nations Trust Fund will help ease this crisis and offer the citizens of East Timor a real opportunity for reconciliation, peace and democracy.

   Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, the American flag is our most precious national symbol and the Constitution is our most revered national document. They both represent the ideas, values and traditions that unify us as a people and a nation. Brave men and women have fought and given their lives in defense of the freedom and way of life that they both represent. 
   Today, I am proud to introduce, along with my colleague from Utah, Senator BENNETT, and my colleagues from North Dakota, Senator CONRAD and Senator DORGAN, the Flag Protection Act of 1999. This legislation would ensure that acts of deliberately confrontational flag-burnings are punished with stiff fines and even jail time. My bill will help prevent desecration of the flag, and at the same time, protect the Constitution. 
   Those malcontents who desecrate the flag do so to grab attention for themselves and to inflame the passions of patriotic Americans. And, speech that incites lawlessness or is intended to do so merits no First Amendment protection, as the Supreme Court has made abundantly clear. From Chaplinsky's ``fighting words'' doctrine in 1942 to Brandenburg's ``incitement'' test in 1969 to Wisconsin v. Mitchell's ``physical assault'' standard in 1993, the Supreme Court has never protected speech which causes or intends to cause physical harm to others. 
   And, that, Mr. President, is the basis for this legislation. My bill outlaws three types of illegal flag desecration. First, anyone who destroys or damages a U.S. flag with a clear intent to incite imminent violence or a breach of the peace may be punished by a fine of up to $100,000, or up to one year in jail, or both. 
   Second, anyone who steals a flag that belongs to the United States and destroys or damages that flag may be fined up to $250,000 or imprisoned up to 2 years, or both. 
   And third, anyone who steals a flag from U.S. property and destroys or damages that flag may also be fined up to $250,000 or imprisoned up to 2 years, or both. 
   Some of my colleagues will argue that we've been down the statutory road before and the Supreme Court has rejected it. However, the Senate's previous statutory effort wasn't pegged to the well-established Supreme Court precedents in this area. 
   This bill differs from the statutes reviewed by the Supreme Court in the two leading cases: Texas v. Johnson, (1989) and U.S. v. Eichman, (1990). 
   In Johnson, the defendant violated a Texas law banning the desecration of a venerated object, including the flag, in a way that will offend one or more persons. Johnson took a stolen flag and burned it as part of a political protest staged outside the 1984 Republican convention in Dallas. The state of Texas argued that its interest in enforcing the law centered on preventing breaches of the peace. But the government, according to the Supreme Court, may not ``assume every expression of a provocative idea will incite a riot. .....'' Johnson, according to the Court, was prosecuted for the expression of his particular ideas: dissatisfaction with government policies. And it is a bedrock principle underlying the First Amendment, said the Court, that an individual cannot be punished for expressing an idea that offends. 
   The Johnson decision started a national debate on flag-burning and as a result, Congress, in 1989, enacted the Flag Protection Act. In seeking to safeguard the flag as the symbol of our nation, Congress took a different tack from the Texas legislature. The federal statute simply outlawed the mutilation or other desecration of the flag. 
   The Supreme Court, however, ruled in Eichman that the federal statute was unconstitutional. Specifically, the Court found that Congressional intent to protect the national symbol was insufficient to overcome the First Amendment protection for the expressive conduct exhibited by flag-burning. 
   Notwithstanding these decisions, the Court clearly left the door open for outlawing flag-burning that incites lawlessness: ``the mere destruction or disfigurement of a particular physical manifestation of the symbol, without more, does not diminish or otherwise affect the symbol itself in any way.'' 
   But Mr. President, you don't have to take my word on it. The Congressional Research Service has offered legal opinions concluding that this initiative will withstand constitutional scrutiny:  
   The judicial precedents establish that the [Flag Protection and Free Speech Act], if enacted, while not reversing Johnson and Eichman, should survive constitutional attack on First Amendment grounds.  
   In addition, Bruce Fein, a former official in the Reagan Administration and respected constitutional scholar, concurs:  
   In holding flag desecration statutes unconstitutional in Johnson, the Court cast no doubt on the continuing vitality of Brandenburg and Chaplinsky as applied to expression through use or abuse of the flag. [The Flag Protection and Free Speech Act] falls well within the protective constitutional umbrella of Brandenburg and Chaplinsky.......[and it] also avoids content-based discrimination which is generally frowned on by the First Amendment.  
   And several other constitutional specialists also agree that this initiative respects the First Amendment and will withstand constitutional challenge. A memo by Robert Peck, and Professors Robert O'Neil and Erwin Chemerinsky concludes that this legislation ``conforms to constitutional requirements in both its purpose and its provisions.'' 
   And, these same three respected men have looked at the few State court cases which have been decided since we had this debate 3 years ago and have reiterated their original finding of constitutionality. In a recent memo, they explained:  
   Three years ago.......[w]e expressed our strongly held opinion that [the Flag Protection and Free Speech Act] would be compatible with the U.S. Supreme Court's rulings in Texas v. Johnson, 491 U.S. 397 (1989) and United States v. Eichman, 496 U.S. 310 (1990). We write now to reiterate that position, finding that nothing that has occurred in the interim casts any doubt on our conclusion.

    Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to my dear friend Gil Clark. I have admired and respected Gil as a friend and coach for many, many years. My thoughts and prayers go out to him and his family today, as Gil continues a brave fight against liver cancer. 
   Gil and I go way back. I met Gil in the 1950's, when he was my little league baseball coach in Louisville. Gil began coaching with the Beechmont Youth Program at its inception in 1955, and served faithfully as president of the program for more than 35 years. 
   Gil always taught our little league team that the most important thing about sports was that you practice hard and play your best, not necessarily that you win. He loved baseball without qualification, and all of us on the team could tell. His enthusiasm for the game was infectious, and his desire to teach us lessons about life through sports was inspiring. Gil wanted our team of aspiring players to understand that in life, you're not always going to win--but you should always perform to the very best of your ability. Gil certainly made a lasting impression on my life, and I'm sure that in his many years as a coach he has positively influenced the lives of numerous other young people as well. 
   Gil committed himself to teaching and coaching young people at Beechmont, and worked on the administration of the Louisville/Jefferson County Metro Parks service for many years. Gil practiced what he preached to those around him, and showed runners year after year that perseverance and spirit could get the job done. 
   In 1974, Gil was asked by Louisville's mayor to take on the challenge of directing the ``Kentucky Derby Festival miniMarathon.'' Gil organized many races during his tenure with Metro Parks, but he especially enjoyed putting on the miniMarathon each year. Gil took the mayor's challenge seriously, built the race to its present glory, and is now known in Kentucky as the ``father of the miniMarathon.'' 
   Gil, thank you for working with me and coaching me as a young little leaguer at Beechmont, and thank you for your dedication to so many other young people throughout the years. I am certain that your service to the Louisville/Jefferson County community is appreciated by all, and I am amazed at your continued commitment to others even in your time of illness. May God continue to bless you, and give you strength in your valiant fight. 
   Mr. President, please include a copy of a Louisville Courier-Journal article from Sunday, April 25, 1999 recognizing Gil Clark's accomplishments.  
   There's Always Been Gil Clark  
   Gil Clark stood on a slope beside Iroquois Park at 7:59:50 a.m. yesterday (runners never round off their minutes) and beheld what he had built: A wide river of 6,500 runners was standing in place, looking up at him. 
   ``Ten,'' he said into the microphone. 
   ``Nine,'' he said, firm of voice. 
   ``Eight,'' he said. He waived a starting pistol above the pith helmet he was wearing, the trademark headpiece some might think is stitched to his scalp. 
   This moment could last no more than 10 seconds, of course, but it was a sight that caused the hearts of some of Louisville's serious road runners to soar yesterday at the start of the 26th Kentucky Derby Festival miniMarathon. 
   That's because the 78-year-old Clark--director of the 13.1-mile race since its inauguration on a Monday morning in 1974--was diagnosed with liver cancer last fall. Just a month ago, he lay unconscious in a hospital for five days; at death's door. 
   A stream of runners appeared at his bedside last month to say their personal farewells to the man who almost everyone acknowledges has done more than anyone else for road racing in Louisville. 
   He didn't invent the pre-Derby race--a politician did that--but Clark took it, built it, shaped it and nurtured it, and so a lot of people call him the father of the miniMarathon. The way the runners talk about him, he actually seems more like its favorite uncle. 
   ``He's the one that made running in Louisville,'' said Jack La Plante, who has run in more than 20 miniMarathons and who stopped to grin for a picture with Clark yesterday morning. ``He put the city on the map, as far as runners go,'' La Plante said right before running the race gain. 
   ``He's it,'' said Stan Clark, long one of the leading runners in the miniMarathon, who is not related to Gil Clark. At last month's City Run, Gil Clark's absence was a huge hole, Stan Clark said. ``He's always present; he's always there. There's always been Gil Clark. 
   Mary Anne Lyons, the leading female runner in the miniMarathon in recent years, tells this story: An acquaintance told her that years ago, she had set the miniMarathon as a personal goal and had trained long for it, but then ran into an unyielding schedule conflict on race day--a sister's wedding, Lyons thought it was. 
   Grasping at straws, the woman--unsure why--called Clark to explain her dilemma. Ever sympathetic, Clark listened, then told the woman to go out and run the route on her own and record her time, Lyons said--and that woman told her that her name appeared on a listing of race finishers that year. 
   The story captures the essence of what runners clearly feel about Clark. ``He's for the middle and the back of the pack,'' said Kathy Priddy, Clark's assistant for 18 years when he was Metro Parks' manager for recreation services. He's been an advocate of what's fair and decent. 
   His view is at the very core of the miniMarathon itself, a race open to everyone, where neighbors run against neighbors, co-workers against co-workers. 
   The miniMarathon has always known it could be flashier and draw a different type of runner if it wanted to, but Clark has never thought much of those impulses. ``I don't want to be director of a race that gives away money,'' he said in a telephone interview Friday. ``If we can't do it for the fun of it, for the fitness of it, and for the camaraderie, then I would want it to die. 
   Clark was an unlikely road-race god on Feb. 4. 1974, when he was hired for the park job at age 53 after a career in sales. No one in his family has ever raced. Clark himself has always been a baseball man; he played in high school in Alton, Ill., and spent decades running the youth baseball league in Louisville's Beechmont neighborhood. 
   But within two days, he was transformed from baseball man to running man. ``On the sixth day of February, the mayor (Harvey Sloane) came to see me and told me we were going to have a mini. I think he called it a half-marathon,'' Clark said. ``I'll give them an audience,'' Clark said Sloane declared--and indeed the finish, then at the Riverfront Plaza and Belvedere, was generously attended by City Hall workers liberated for the occasion. 
   It was, Clark said, the first road race of its kind in Kentucky. 
   Businesses soon griped about work-day traffic tie-ups when the first miniMarathons were run on Mondays; the religious community wasn't happy when Sunday was considered as an alternative. So Saturday got the miniMarathon by default. 
   Today, Clark said, he believes Louisville has the only park department in the nation that oversees 20 or more races in a year--``for the good of the public,'' he added. ``We have developed a lot of fine races in Louisville, Kentucky, and I'm proud of that,'' he said. 
   Priddy, Clark's assistant, said he actually retired and moved to Florida in 1997 with his wife Lorene, Whom he always called ``Mom.'' But she died in March of that same year, just days after the move, and Clark canceled his retirement and came back to the city where he'd lived since 1948. ``Louisville was his life,'' Priddy said. ``He would have had nothing in Florida.'' 
   Back in Louisville, he also continued to be involved with the mini, although the Derby Festival had by then taken over official management of the race. 
   And he also had the unending appreciation of the running community--a community that seems to doubt it would even exist were it not for him. Runner Lyons, for example, who is 30, believes that if Metro Park's running program had not been built, she might not be running today. Running in that case would have required travel, she said, and she very well might not have done it. 
   Clark worked with the program he loved until late last year. He said he did well after surgery for his liver cancer, but early this year, ``for some reason I can't explain, it all went berserk.'' 
   One of his two sons, Marvin Clark, said yesterday that in late March, it truly appeared that his father would die. Doctors held out little hope, then no hope, and prayers were said for a peaceful exit. 
   Then, Gil Clark began moving--first a leg, then he opened an eye, and soon he spoke. Marvin and his father both said a doctor wrote on his chart these two words: ``Devine intervention.'' 
   ``God's got something else for me to do, I guess,'' Clark said Friday. ``I might see another Vencor (the road race that precedes the miniMarathon), but if He lets me live to tomorrow night, I will be most grateful.'' 
   Aside from whatever God has in mind for Clark, the Derby Festival had some ideas, too. Yesterday, it wanted him to fire the starting pistol for he mini-Marathon. 
   Friends Tandy Patrick and Jim Woosley, a Louisville police officer, picked Clark up at his son's home in eastern Jefferson County in Patrick's Camaro convertible--with the top down and the heater on. 
   Clark wore a white-and-purple jogging suite and his multicolored pith helmet--he doesn't remember who gave the helmet to him, and by now it's been through so many races it appears entirely held together by duct tape and paint. He was bundled in a blanket and scarf in the front seat of the Camaro. But this was the way he wanted it, so he could wave at the runners. 
   To travel the 25 feet from the Camaro to the starter's stage, Clark used a wheelchair, but stood strong when Mayor Dave Armstrong gave him a glass plaque, the Derby Festival's Lifetime Achievement Award. 
   And then the countdown to another race began.

   Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Kosovo Self-Defense Act. I am pleased to be joined by my good friend from Connecticut, Senator LIEBERMAN, in offering this bill. Our proposal would provide $25 million to arm and train members of the Kosovo Liberation Army, or KLA. This would equip 10,000 men or 10 battalions with small arms, antitank weapons, for up to 18 months. Let me repeat that: For less than the cost of one evening's air raids, we can provide significant defensive capabilities to those most willing to fight Serb aggression inside Kosovo. 
   I know the administration questions why the United States should take this bold step. My question is, Why haven't we already made the decision to arm and train the Kosovar Albanians who are on the ground fighting for their homes, their loved ones, and their rights? It seems to me that the question is not why, but why not? It took 4 years of bloodshed to recognize we should arm the Bosnians. How many lives will be lost before we do the right thing in Kosovo? 
   There is widespread agreement that President Clinton and his National Security Advisers have made a grave tactical error in removing even the threat of U.S. ground troops. With this declaration seemingly repeated hourly by top Clinton officials, the United States has signaled to Milosevic that, regardless of his actions--including genocide--America does not have the determination to stop this outrageous behavior. After months of hollow American threats, we are now crippling our prospects for success by signaling to Milosevic just how far we are willing to go. No option should have been taken off the table. 
   Just last October, with great fanfare, the President announced a cease-fire, but it was a farce. The Serbs continued their brutal war against the Kosovars. In Pristina, cynics were heard to say, ``If they only burn a village a day it keeps NATO away.'' The Serb campaign to exterminate all semblance of Albanian society raged daily--just not on a massive, headline-grabbing scale. 
   Unless faced with serious and sustained military pressure on the ground, this war will go on until Kosovo is empty of all Albanians. Given administration and public reluctance to deploy U.S. troops, there is only one option: The KLA must be given the means to defend their homeland. All reports indicate that the KLA is growing in number and remains willing to fight Serb aggression. Given the right equipment and limited training, the KLA could offer a significant deterrent to Milosevic's murderous thugs. 
   If the administration had armed the Kosovar Albanians in January when I first suggested that approach, I believe the daily tragic exodus of refugees could have been avoided.

   Mr. MCCONNELL. Rather than choosing this course, the U.S. and NATO have relied solely on the use of controlled airstrikes. Now, I supported this use of force and believe we should come to the defense of the Kosovar Albanians, the victims of genocide. However, the nightly strikes on Milosevic's terror machine have not stopped the massive killing. In fact, the atrocities have dramatically increased since NATO action began. Our halfhearted effort has allowed Milosevic the freedom to feed the most evil of instincts. Police, paramilitary, and army units are engaged in an effort to deport or exterminate 2 million Albanians. 
   Air power alone cannot stop this slaughter. This week the Albanian Government recognized this fact and called on the United States Government to arm the KLA. That was a shift in position of the Albanian Government. Recognizing the growing strength and tenacity of the KLA, the Albanian Government has switched positions and said we ought to arm the KLA.

   Mr. MCCONNELL. Milosevic's storm troopers must face operations in the air and on the ground. The KLA is willing to wage this war on the ground. It is their homes that are being burned,  their businesses destroyed; and, worse, their wives and sisters being raped, their families being slaughtered. They don't need convincing to summon the will to fight. What they need is international support. 
   Senator LIEBERMAN and I have a proposal which will begin this effort. If the only people willing to fight are the KLA, we should do what we can to see that they have the ability to do so. Who else will provide the necessary deterrent to Milosevic and his army? The administration has made it clear that it will not be America's sons and daughters. I don't want to see United States soldiers fighting this war, but I also cannot abide the continued extermination of the people of Kosovo. They are entitled to defend themselves. We should not delay any further in our commitment to their legitimate cause. 
   Let me sum this up as I see my friend from Connecticut is here. What we have is a situation with the KLA where their leaders are in communication with the State Department and our military on a daily basis. We have an organization which, by telephone, is identifying military targets inside Kosovo for our planes. We are dealing with the KLA multiple times a day, both diplomatically and militarily. We are obviously pulling for them. We are egging them on. We are saying, ``Go out there and do it.'' But when they request an opportunity to be adequately armed, we say no. It is an utterly absurd position. 
   We have heard the rumors around town. We heard these in the 1980s, when the issue was supporting the contras, that there are some bad characters in the KLA. I don't think we have time to run a background check on everybody involved in this effort. The question is simply this: Who else is willing to fight the fight on the ground inside Kosovo on behalf of the Kosovar Albanians? There is nobody else willing to fight this war on the turf. We are already cooperating with them. We already deal with them on a daily basis. We are encouraging them. They are our allies. Why not give them the opportunity to engage in a fair fight on the ground inside Kosovo where the atrocities are occurring? 
   The growing suspicion of all of us is that this air war can go on forever and not have an impact on the real problem, which is inside Kosovo. The Senator from Connecticut and I believe we are advocating here a proposal that is in the best interests of the United States of America and of NATO. We have obviously picked a side. We are on their side. The question is whether we should fight this war entirely on their behalf or whether we should give them an opportunity to help us fight it--since it is their land, their family, and their principal concern. We think we have a proposal here that makes sense. 
   Finally, for a mere $25 million--which is less than we are spending on these air raids per night--we could arm the KLA for up to 18 months to give them a chance to defend their wives, their homes, and their families. 
   So I thank the Senator from Connecticut for joining with me on this proposal. I see he is here now to speak on its behalf.

   Mr. MCCONNELL. Does the Senator from Connecticut not agree that if your house is being burned and your wife is being raped, you are not likely to ask the question: Who is this person who is offering to help me? And if our Government were truly offended or if our Government were truly convinced about all these rumors that have been spread around about the KLA, does not my friend from Connecticut agree we would not be taking their phone calls at the State Department and the military and we would not be accepting their advice about what military targets to hit? Is that a reasonable assumption?

   Mr. McCONNELL. I say to my friend from Connecticut, what our bill is all about is really an effort to call on the President to change this policy. We should not have to offer the bill that we are offering. We are offering it, but we should not have to offer it because  it makes elementary good sense to give the people, on whose behalf we are fighting this war, a chance to participate themselves. 
   I say to my friend from Connecticut, does he not agree, this is what this is about, to give the people, on whose behalf we are fighting this war, a chance to participate themselves?

   Mr. McCONNELL. In fact, I say to my friend from Connecticut, isn't it reasonable to argue that the only reason these refugees have been created is because there was no effective fighting force on the ground inside Kosovo? No way to defend your home, no way to defend your family, and what do you do when you are afraid? You run. That is what has created the refugee problem, which is presumably what our European allies care about most--the spillover into their countries. 
   The only effective way, the Senator from Connecticut and I are saying, to prevent a further accumulation of refugees is for there to be some fighting force on the ground in Kosovo adequately trained and equipped in order to fight this battle where it counts.

   Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a progressive, bipartisan bill to allow hard-working Americans to keep more of what they earn. 
   Imagine for a moment a tax cut that could save families $193 billion over the next five years. Better yet, this tax cut would not add a single penny to the deficit. Sound impossible? Not really. It's called Auto Choice. 
   The Auto Choice Reform Act offers the equivalent of a massive across-the-board tax cut to every American motorist. Based on a study by the RAND Institute for Civil Justice, the Joint Economic Committee (``JEC'') in Congress issued a 1998 report estimating that Auto Choice could save consumers as much as $35 billion a year--at no cost to the government. 
   In fact, the 5-year net savings described in the JEC report could reach $193 billion. Let me say that again, Mr. President: a potential savings of $193 billion--that is $50 million more than five-year tax cut savings projected in our budget resolution. 
   So what does this mean for the average American? 
   It would mean that the average American driver could keep more of what he or she earns to the tune of nearly $200 per year, per vehicle. And, Mr. President, low-income families would be the greatest beneficiaries of this bill. According to the JEC, the typical low-income household spends more on auto insurance in two years than the entire value of their car. Auto choice would change that by allowing low-income drivers to save 36 percent on their overall automobile premium. For a low-income household, these savings are the equivalent of five weeks of groceries or nearly four months of electric bills. 
   And, Mr. President, let me say again--Auto Choice would not add one penny to the deficit. It wouldn't cost the government a cent. 
   I expect that there will be a good deal of discussion over the next few months about Auto Choice and the effort to repair the broken-down automobile insurance tort system. But, Mr. President, everything you will hear about Auto Choice can be summed up in two words: Choice and Savings. 
   Consumers want, need, and deserve both. 
   Very simply, the Auto Choice Reform Act offers consumers the choice of opting out of the current pain and suffering litigation lottery. The consumers who make this choice will achieve a substantial savings on automobile insurance premiums by reducing fraud, pain-and-suffering litigation and lawyer fees. 
   Mr. President, before you can truly comprehend the benefits of this pro-consumer, pro-inner city, pro-tax cut bill, you must understand the terrible costs of the current tort liability system. 
   The current trial-lawyer insurance system desperately needs an overhaul. And nobody knows this better than the American motorist--who is now paying on average nearly $800 per year per vehicle for automobile insurance. Between 1987 and 1994, average premiums rose 44 percent--nearly one-and-a-half times the rate of inflation. 
   Why are consumers forced to pay so much? 
   Because the auto insurance tort system is fundamentally flawed. It is clogged and bloated by fraud, wasteful litigation, and abuse. 
   Fundamental flaw #1: The first flaw of the current system is rampant fraud and abuse. In 1995, the F.B.I. announced a wave of indictments stemming from Operation Sudden Impact, the most wide-ranging investigation of criminal fraud schemes involving staged car accidents and massive fraud in the health care system. The F.B.I uncovered criminal enterprises staging bus and car accidents in order to bring lawsuits and collect money from innocent people, businesses and governments. In fact, F.B.I. Director Louis Freeh has estimated that every American household is burdened by an additional $200 in unnecessary insurance premiums to cover this enormous amount of fraud. 
   In addition to the pervasive criminal fraud that exists, the incentives of our  litigation system encourage injured parties to make excessive medical claims to drive up their damage claims in lawsuits. The RAND institute for Civil Justice, in a study released in 1995, concluded that 35 to 42 percent of claimed medical costs in car accident cases are excessive and unnecessary. Let me repeat that in simple English: well over one-third of doctor, hospital, physical therapy and other medical costs claimed in car accident cases are for nonexistent injuries or for unnecessary treatment. 
   The value of this wasteful health care? Four billion dollars annually. I don't need to remind anyone of the ongoing local and national debate over our health care system. While people have strongly-held differences over the causes and solutions to that problem, the RAND data make one thing certain--lawsuits, and the potential for hitting the jackpot, drive overuse and abuse of the health care system. Reducing those costs by $4 billion annually, without depriving one person of needed medial care, is clearly in our national interest. 
   Why would an injured party inflate their medical claims, you might ask. It's simple arithmetic. For every $1 of economic loss, a party stands to recover up to $3 in pain and suffering awards. In short, the more you go to the chiropractor, the more you get from the jury. And, the more you get from the jury, the more money your attorney puts in his own pocket. 
   Which leads us to Fundamental Flaw #2--that is, the excessive amounts of consumer dollars that are wasted on lawsuits and trial lawyers. Based on data from the Insurance Information Institute and the Joint Economic Committee, it is estimated that lawyers rake in nearly two times the amount of money that injured parties receive for actual economic losses. Surely we would all agree that a system is broken down when it pays lawyers more than it pays injured parties for actual economic losses. 
   Fundamental Flaw #3: Seriously injured people are grossly undercompensated under the tort system. A 1991 RAND study reveals that people with economic losses $25,000 and $100,000 recover on average barely half of their economic losses--and no pain-and-suffering damages. People with losses in excess of $100,000 recover only 9 percent of their economic losses--and no pain-and-suffering damages. So, the hard facts demonstrate that seriously-injured victims do not receive pain-and-suffering damages today--event though they are paying to play in a system that promises pain-and-suffering damages. 
   Fundamental Flaw #4: Not only does the current system force you to typically hire a lawyer just to recover from a car accident, it also forces you to wait for that payment. One study indicates that the average time to recover is 16 months, and of course, it takes much longer in serious injury cases. 
   Auto Choice gives consumers a way out of this system of high premiums, rampant fraud, and slow, inequitable compensation. Our bill would remove the perverse incentives of lawsuits, while ensuring that accident victims recover fully for their economic loss. 
   So, what is auto choice? Let me first answer with what it is not. It does not abolish lawsuits, and it does not eliminate the concept of fault within the legal system. Undoubtedly, there will be more equitable compensation of injured parties, and thus less reason to go to court--but the right to sue will not be abolished. 
   Auto Choice allows drivers to decide how they want to be insured. In establishing the choice mechanism, the bill unbundles economic and non-economic losses and allows the driver to choose whether to be covered for non-economic losses (that is, pain and suffering losses). 
   In other words, if a driver wants to have the chance to recover pain and suffering, he says in the current system. If he wants to opt-out of the pain and suffering regime and receive lower premiums with prompt, guaranteed compensation for economic losses, then he chooses the personal injury protection system. 
   This choice, which sounds amazingly simple and imminently reasonable, is, believe it or not, currently unavailable anywhere in our country. Auto Choice will change that. 
   Let me briefly explain the choices that our bill will offer every consumer. A consumer will be able to choose one of two insurance systems. 
   The first choice in the Tort Maintenance System. Drivers who wish to stay in their current system would choose this system and be able to sue each other for pain and suffering. These drivers would essentially buy the same type of insurance that they currently carry--and would recover, or fail to recover, in the same way that they do today. The only change for these tort drivers would be that, in the event that they are hit by a personal protection driver, the tort driver would recover both economic and noneconomic damages from his own insurance policy. This supplemental first-party policy for tort drivers will be called tort maintenance coverage. 
   The second choice is the Personal Injury Protection System. Consumers choosing this system would be guaranteed prompt recovery of their economic losses, up to the levels of their own insurance policy. Personal protection drivers would achieve substantially reduced premiums because the personal injury protection system would dramatically reduce: (1) fraud, (2) pain and suffering lawsuits, and (3) attorney fees. These drivers would give up the chance to sue for pain and suffering damages in exchange for lower premiums, guaranteed compensation of economic losses, and relief from pain and suffering lawsuits. 
   Under both insurance systems--tort maintenance and personal protection--the injured party whose economic losses exceed his own coverage will have the chance to sue the other driver for excess economic losses. Moreover, tort drivers will retain the chance to sue each other for both economic and noneconomic loss. Critics who say the right to sue is abolished by this bill are plain wrong. 
   The advantages of personal protection coverage are enormous. 
   First, personal protection coverage assures that those who suffer injury, regardless of whether someone else is responsible, will be paid for their economic losses. The driver does not have to leave compensation up to the vagaries of how an accident occurs and how much coverage the other driver has. A driver whose car goes off a slippery road will be able to recover for his economic losses. Such a blameless driver could not recover under the tort 
   system because no other person was at fault. No matter when and how a driver or a member of his family is injured, the driver will have peace of mind knowing that his insurance will help protect his family. 
   Second, the choice as to how much insurance protection to purchase is in the hands of the driver, who is in the best position to know how much coverage he and his family need. He can choose as much or as little insurance as his circumstances require, from $20,000 to $1 million of protection. 
   Third, people who elect the personal protection option will, in the event they are injured, be paid promptly, as their losses accrue. 
   Fourth, we will have more rational use of precious health care resources. Insuring on a first-party basis helps eliminate the incentives for excess medical claiming. When a person chooses to be compensated for actual economic loss, the tort system's incentives for padding one's claims disappear. If there's no pain-and-suffering lottery, then there's no reason to play the game. 
   Fifth, Auto Choice offers real benefits for low-income drivers because the savings are both dramatic and progressive. Low-income drivers will see the biggest savings because they pay a higher proportion of their disposal income in insurance costs. A study of low income residents of Maricopa County, Arizona, revealed that households below 50 percent of the poverty line spent an amazing 31.6 percent of disposable income on car insurance. 
   For many low-income families the choices are stark: car insurance and the ability to get to the job, or medicine, new clothing and extra food for the children. Too often these families feel forced to drive without any insurance. In fact, some areas in our country have uninsured motorist rates exceeding ninety percent. I would hope that this Senate would not sit back and allow our litigation system to promote this kind of lose-lose scenario for consumers. 
   Moreover, Auto Choice offers benefits to all taxpayers, even those who don't  drive. For example, local governments will save taxpayer dollars through decreased insurance and litigation costs. This will allow governments to use our tax dollars to more directly benefit the community. Think of all the additional police and firefighters that could be hired with money now spent on lawsuits, Or, schools and playgrounds that could be better equipped. New York City spends more on liability claims than it spends on libraries, botanical gardens, the Bronx Zoo, the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Department of Youth Services, combined. Imagine the improved quality of life in our urban areas if governments were free of spending on needless lawsuits. 
   The bottom line? We think that consumers should be able to make one simple choice: ``Do you want to continue to pay nearly $800 per year per vehicle for auto insurance and have the chance to recover pain and suffering damages? Or would you rather save roughly $200 per year per vehicle, be promptly reimbursed for your economic losses, and forego pain and suffering damages?'' 
   It's really that simple. And, we're not even going to tell them which answer is the right one. Because that's not up to us. It's up to the consumer. We simply want to give them the choice. 
   In closing, I'd like to quote The New York Times, which has summed up the benefits, and indeed, the simplicity of our bill: ``[Auto Choice] would give families the option of foregoing suits for nonmonetary losses in exchange for quick and complete reimbursement for every blow to their pocketbook. Everyone would win--except the lawyers.'' 
   Mr. President, this bill is bipartisan and bicameral. I am proud today to again have the support of Senators MOYNIHAN  and LIEBERMAN. We first introduced this bill in the 104th Congress, and I want to take a minute to say how much I appreciate their ongoing commitment to provide meaningful relief for consumers across the country, especially low-income families. And, we have now added another heavy hitter to our list of original cosponsors, Senator JOHN MCCAIN, the chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee. 
   I also want to thank House Majority Leader DICK ARMEY and Congressman JIM MORAN. They joined our team in the last Congress, and I am pleased to say that they will again be leading the charge in the House. 
   Auto Choice has broad support from across the spectrum. It should be obvious by the support and endorsements that Auto Choice is not conservative or liberal legislation. It is consumer legislation. To show this range of support, I ask unanimous consent that the RECORD include the statements in support of Auto Choice from the Republican Mayor of New York City, Rudolph Giuliani; the former Massachusetts Governor and Democratic presidential candidate, Michael Dukakis; and award-winning consumer advocate Andrew Tobias. I also ask unanimous consent that the RECORD include statements on behalf of Americans for Tax Reform, Citizens for a Sound Economy, and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.

    Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Ralph Boling for his service to the state of Kentucky and the people of Hancock County. Ralph recently completed a special five-year term as Hancock County's Judge/Executive, during which he led the county through a remarkable period of growth and progress. 
   Before beginning his political career, Ralph was a farmer and businessman in Hancock County, working as an oil field driller, farmer, Hancock County Road Foreman and as the Hawesville Water Superintendent. His work outside of public service gave him the advantage of having first-hand knowledge of the struggles of working families, and shaped his desire to make a difference in the Hawesville community. 
   Following in his father's footsteps, Ralph's first endeavor in politics was a run for Hancock County Sheriff. He ran successfully in 1969, and again in 1977, serving two terms as Sheriff. In the final months of his second term, President Ronald Reagan appointed Ralph as a United States Marshal for the Western district of Kentucky. He excelled as a U.S. Marshal and received a second appointment under President Reagan and a third appointment under President George Bush. During his 12 years of service, Ralph received two of the highly distinguished ``Awards for Excellent Performance.'' 
   While Ralph was honored to work in the Marshal's service, and loved his work under both President Reagan and President Bush's administrations, after his third term he decided it was time to exclusively serve the people of Hancock County. Ralph ran for Hancock County Judge/Executive and was elected to serve a special five-year term. Ralph always had the best interest of the county at heart, and encouraged the fiscal court to work together as a team despite political differences. 
   During his term as Judge/Executive, Ralph made great strides for Hancock County. He successfully led the effort to close the county landfill and was instrumental in assuring the construction of a new Emergency Services Building. The county also built a new fire station, and purchased additional fire trucks and police cruisers for increased public safety. 
   One of Ralph's achievements as Judge/Executive was his successful effort to build and repair many county roads. During Ralph's last two years as Judge, the fiscal court spent $2 million on Hancock roads, and obtained state funding to pave roads to Commonwealth Aluminum and Willamette and build bridges on Indian Hill and Goernig Road. He also helped establish the Hancock County Career Center. Ralph envisioned a bright future for Hancock County's workers and businesses, and he believed this center would be to the long-term benefit of the county. 
   Ralph's term as Judge/Executive has ended, but Hancock County will feel the effects of his accomplishments for years to come. His motto was ``Together we can make a difference,'' and he has certainly proven this to be true. Ralph worked together with local law enforcement, state government, the U.S. Marshal's service and the Fiscal Court to make tremendous differences in people's lives. My colleagues and I thank you, Ralph, for your many years of service to Hancock County, the State of Kentucky and the United States.

   Mr. McCONNELL. I thank the Senator from Texas for her outstanding leadership on this issue. As has been stated by all the speakers, basically this is an amendment to tell the States how to spend money that they achieve through a settlement with the tobacco industry. Not only money, but a huge amount of money--$40 billion--just on  tobacco use reduction advertising and programs. 
   To contrast that with the advertising budgets of private enterprise in this country, ``Advertising Age'' said U.S. companies spend a total of $208 billion on advertising all of their products last year. The top 100 advertisers spent a total of $58 billion last year. In California and New York, this would mean $5 billion worth of ads to each of those States; in Pennsylvania, $2.25 billion worth of ads; and in my State, $700 million worth of ads. 
   Mr. President, this would be one of the most massive advertising campaigns in the history of the country, probably the most massive in the history of the country--public or private. Because advertising rates in my home State are not particularly high, that could translate into over 1,000 days of nonstop TV commercials. That is almost 3 years. And we think political campaigns go on too long. 
   Contrast this with all Federal Government drug control spending of $16 billion. Members get the picture. If the Specter amendment were approved, we would have the Federal Government spending more money, by far, attacking a legal product than the Clinton administration currently spends in its war on drugs. There is $40 billion targeted at tobacco use, $16 billion against illegal drug use. It makes a person wonder if it would be better to simply pay America's 40 million smokers $1,000 apiece to quit. Send them $1,000 checks each, to quit. 
   It would be a lot cheaper than what we have before the Senate. 
   As has been stated by other speakers, the National Governors' Association has strongly committed itself to supporting antitobacco programs in the respective States. The States know better how to spend this money and will do so efficiently through existing State mechanisms. If the Federal Government dictates how the States should spend the money and the mechanisms are not there, the States will have to create them--creating even more bureaucracy. 
   The final outrage is that this amendment requires the elected Governors of the States to report to Secretary Shalala on how they are going to spend their money. This is truly an egregious effort by the Federal Government to dictate to the States how they ought to spend money that they are entirely entitled to under any system of justice. 
   Let me repeat: This calls for a $40 billion advertising campaign against a legal product, yet the Federal Government currently spends only $16 billion in its illegal drug enforcement effort. 
   The Hutchison proposal is the correct one. This amendment should be defeated.

    Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Male High School's Championship Football team in Louisville, Kentucky on the occasion of their annual awards banquet. 
   The Male High School Bulldogs have long held a reputation for excellence in Kentucky and throughout the nation. With the leadership of The Bluegrass State's finest high school football coach, Bobby Redman, it's no wonder the team has gone so far. It is clear to players, parents, coaches and students alike when they see Bobby on the field with his team that his heart and soul are rooted in Bulldogs football. Bobby's marked dedication to his team and his school are admirable, and I'm certain my feelings are shared by the entire Male family. 
   Tonight I congratulate you, the Male High School football team, on your commitment to excellence both on the field and in the classroom, and thank you for working so hard to continue giving high school football in Louisville an honorable name. Players become great because of their hard work and commitment to themselves and their team. You have each spent countless hours before and after school lifting weights, memorizing plays, and practicing and preparing for games. You have each spent Friday afternoons at pep rallys getting ready for evening games, felt the stress of wanting to play your best and win, and experienced the emotional high as you finally rush the field. You have dedicated your high school careers to Male and to its football team, and my colleagues and I commend you. 
   Not only is Male High School known for their powerhouse of a football team, most recently leading the Bulldogs to victory as 1998-99 4-A State Champions, but they also are known for their commitment to academic success. Male has been recognized as a National Exemplary School twice in recent years by the United States Department of Education, and has received the Flag of Excellence by the State of Kentucky for consistently high academic achievement. Ninety percent of Male graduates continue their education at colleges and universities, and many of them receive partial or full scholarships to attend. It is commendable that students so profoundly talented on the football field are also concerned about their academic achievements. 
   I am certain that the legacy of excellence that Male High School football players and coaches have left will continue on, and will encourage and inspire others toward that same goal. On behalf of myself and my colleagues, thank you for your contribution to the Louisville community, the State of Kentucky, and to our great nation.

    Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the accomplishments of a dynamic Kentucky judge-executive and dedicated teacher, Wilbur MacDonald Norris, Jr. 
   Wilbur ``Buzz'' Norris served the State of Kentucky for 39 years, first as a teacher of government and politics for 30 years at Daviess County High School, and then for 9 years as Daviess County's judge-executive, the county's highest ranking elected official. Buzz also served his country with service in the United States Army for two years. 
   Buzz is truly a product of Kentucky. He completed his undergraduate degree at Kentucky Wesleyan College, and received a master's degree from Western Kentucky University. Buzz's deep-rooted background in Kentucky certainly served him well in his years of commendable service to our great state. 
   Buzz's career in Daviess County politics was marked by his willingness to fight for what was best for the county. He was heralded for his ability to work with county officials of both parties, and was effective numerous times in bringing the sometimes opposing sides together in a compromise that pleased almost everyone and was always of benefit to Daviess County. 
   Buzz was praised for bringing hundreds of jobs to the county with the creation of MidAmerica Airpark and bringing Scott Paper, now Kimberly-Clark, to Daviess County. It is widely speculated that, without these two companies' presence in Daviess County and Buzz's essential role in bringing them to the Owensboro, the county's economy would never have reached its current level of growth. 
   The legacy Buzz has left in Kentucky county politics also includes his efforts to build and maintain a much-needed landfill in Daviess County. The completion of the landfill will save the county countless dollars in fees in the future, and leaves yet another lasting impact from Buzz's priceless leadership. 
   Aside from Buzz's successful career holding county office, some of his proudest accomplishments come from his 30 admirable years as a teacher. Buzz taught high school politics and government classes at Daviess County High School and served the county by teaching a ``Problems in Government'' class for the Daviess community. Students in the class followed Buzz' example and plunged into the politics of local concerns, impacting decisions about topics such as highways and downtown revitalization. 
   Buzz Norris left his mark on Daviess County, and I have no doubt he will continue to contribute his time, effort and energy to the community for many years to come. I thank Buzz for his service to Kentucky, and I am confident my colleagues join me in my commendation of his work.

    Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to commend Wayne Perkey for 30 years of dedicated service to WHAS-AM radio and his listeners in Louisville, Kentucky. 
   Wayne's voice has been heard by thousands of listeners over the past 30 years as a constant in the life of morning talk radio. He has made an unforgettable impression on WHAS radio, and has carefully molded the station into what it is today. When Wayne began work at WHAS the station had primarily an all-music format, and Wayne spent years transforming the station from that format into the all-talk format that they have today. 
   Most stations would not have been able to accomplish that kind of transition without losing a number of listeners, but Wayne's voice on the morning airwaves clenched listener support and WHAS has enjoyed long-lived success. Wayne's positive, up-beat morning program made Wayne an icon in the Louisville market. Certainly he is a mainstay that will be missed. 
   He presented up-to-the-minute news to hundreds of thousands of Kentuckians for the past 30 years and used his position at WHAS to serve the community. Wayne says that one of the things that drew him to work at WHAS in the first place was the stations' Crusade for Children program. He immediately took an interest in the Crusade, and played an integral role as master of ceremonies for many of his 30 years. 
   The Crusade is known as the most successful single-station telethon in the United States, raising $70 million for the care and treatment of handicapped children in Kentucky and Southern Indiana since its inception in 1954. Wayne saw how vital this program was to the millions of children who benefit from the Crusade each year, and has committed to emcee the telethon for one last year. His sincere concern for Kentucky's children is admirable, and we commend him for his 30 years of commitment to this cause.

    Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, Senate Standing Rule XXVI requires each committee to adopt rules to govern the procedures of the Committee and to publish those rules in the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD not later than March 1 of the first year of each Congress. On February 25, 1999, the Committee on Rules and Administration held a business meeting during which the members of the committee unanimously adopted the rules to govern the procedures of the committee. 
   Consistent with Standing Rule XXVI, today I am submitting for printing in the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD a copy of the rules of the Senate Committee on Rules and Administration.

   Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, since 1989 the Rules Committee has reported out biennial funding authorizations for committees of the Senate for the two funding periods beginning on March 1. This policy has been strongly supported by the Senate's committee chairmen and ranking members. Before the Senate today is a resolution which authorizes committee expenditures for the remaining seven months of Fiscal Year 1999 at the 1998 salary baseline plus the January 1999 cost of living adjustment (COLA) of 3.1%, as authorized by the President pro tempore. Committees had been previously authorized from October 1st through February 28th by S. Res. 54, in the 105th Congress. 
   This resolution follows on the heels of one that Senator DODD, Ranking Member of the Rules Committee, and I submitted and which was passed on February 12, 1999, which suspended the requirements of paragraph 9 of rule XXVI of the Standing Rules of the Senate and authorized a seven-year continuing resolution such as is before the Senate at this time. 
   As we informed committees in a joint letter on January 22, Y2K concerns had prompted the Senate's recent adoption of the new Financial Management Information System (FMIS). This new financial management system, which is designed to conform to the Federal Government's fiscal year that runs from October 1, to September 30, requires that we consider adjustments in the committee funding system. To allow all due deliberation, we determined that the wisest course was to  authorize the committees through the balance of this fiscal year and use that time to carefully design a committee funding procedure in light of the new FMIS. To that end, the Rules Committee will be conducting hearings and seeking the input of the various Senate committees on these questions. And, of course, we invite the committees to make recommendations on baseline funding, full-time employee levels and other concerns related to authorizing the balance of the biennium. 
   The interim funding resolution also authorizes the use of unexpended committee funds, as has been done in some form since 1989. Section 20 of this resolution authorizes the use of Special Reserves on a committee-by-committee basis. It also provides a mechanism to make unexpended funds as of the close of business on February 28, 1999, available to cover non-recurring needs for committees through September 30. 
   It should be noted that all of the unexpended funds represent previously authorized funds which have not been spent. They are not new authorized funds. This policy has successfully served as an incentive to reduce spending. Without it, the policy would effectively be to spend it or lose it with a predictable outcome that more money would be spent. 
   Mr. President, let me also add that this interim resolution does not increase FTE positions and reiterate that it provides for special reserves funding as needed. Further, this resolution keeps the total authorized amount within the appropriations previously authorized in the Fiscal Year 1999 Legislative Branch Appropriations Bill for ``Inquiries and Investigations.'' 
   I urge the Senate to adopt this resolution, and I yield the floor.

   Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. Chief Justice, as the senior Senator from Kentucky, it is my distinct privilege today to rise and speak at the desk formerly occupied by one of the greatest Senators in the history of our country and the greatest Senator from the commonwealth of Kentucky: Henry Clay. 
   Henry Clay is best remembered for two things: (1) the Compromise of 1850, and (2) a famous statement he made after being told that advocating the Compromise of 1850 would doom his chances for the presidency. At that critical moment Clay replied: ``I had rather be right than be President.'' 
   In many respects, William Jefferson Clinton had a similar choice over the past several months. He could do the right thing. Or he could cling to his Presidency--regardless of the costs and regardless of the consequences. Consequences to his family, to his friends, to his aides, to his Cabinet, and, most importantly, to his country. 
   Time after time, the President came to a fork in the road. Time after time, he had the opportunity to choose the noble and honorable path. Time after time, he chose the path of lies and lawlessness--for the simple reason that he did not want to endanger his hold on public office. 
   Nowhere is the President's cold, calculated choice more clear than in the private conversation he had with his confidant and long-time advisor, Dick Morris, just after he raised his right hand to God and testified under oath in a civil rights lawsuit that he had not had any sexual relations with a young intern named Monica Lewinsky. 
   After that critical denial, the President did what he does best: he put his finger to the wind to determine which path he should take. He asked Mr. Morris to conduct a poll to determine whether the American people would forgive him for adultery, for perjury, and for obstruction of justice. Morris came back with bad news. 
   The public, in Morris's words was ``just not ready for it.'' They would forgive him for adultery, but not for perjury and obstruction of justice. 
   The President then faced a fundamental choice. He could tell the truth--and admit that he perjured himself in the Jones suit. Or he could cling to public office--and deny, delay and obstruct. 
   The choice for President Clinton was clear. He told Morris: ``Well, we just have to win.'' 
   And, thus the course was charted. The President would seek to win at any cost. If it 
   meant lying to the American people. If it meant lying to his Cabinet. If it meant lying to a federal grand jury. If it meant tampering with witnesses and obstructing justice. If it meant falsely branding a young woman with the scarlet labels of liar and ``stalker.'' The name of the game was winning. Winning at any cost. 
   Based on the evidence before the Senate, I want to walk you down the road that Bill Clinton has traveled these past several months. That twisted, tortured road that he has forced the American people and their government to plod along--for what seems to many of us like an eternity. 
   CROSSROADS #1: AN ILLICIT RELATIONSHIP WITH A YOUNG INTERN 
   The first fork in the President's road came on November 15, 1995, when he met a young, White House intern named Monica Lewinsky. He could be her President. He could be her boss. He could even be her friend. Or, he could choose to be in a relationship with her that was clearly inappropriate. 
   The President chose the wrong path. As we heard Ms. Lewinsky testify, on the day of their first meeting, which also happened to be the day of their first sexual encounter, President Clinton looked at Ms. Lewinsky's intern pass, tugged on it and said, ``This is going to be a problem.'' 
   But the President persisted down that problematic path. He had approximately 10 more sexual encounters with Ms. Lewinsky over the next 21 months. 
   It is important, however, to note that had the President stopped there, we would not be here. At that point, the  President's defenders could have credibly argued, ``it's a private matter; it's just about sex.'' 
   But, Bill Clinton didn't stop there. 
   CROSSROADS #2: A JOB AND AN AFFIDAVIT AND GIFTS 
   In December of 1997, the President came to another fork. At that time, he learned the following critical facts: 
   1. Ms. Lewinsky had been placed on the witness list in the Jones case; 
   2. Judge Susan Webber Wright had ordered the President to provide information concerning any government employee with whom he had engaged in sexual activity; and 
   3. Ms. Lewinsky had been served with a subpoena and ordered to produce any gifts she had received from the President. 
   At this point, the President had a choice. He could tell Ms. Lewinsky to obey the law, tell the truth, and turn over the gifts. Or, he could not. 
   Again, President Clinton chose the path of lies and deceit. Let's again, hear this account from Ms. Lewinsky:  
   ``[I]t wasn't as if the President called me and said, ``You know, Monica, you're on the witness list, this is going to be really hard for us, we're going to have to tell the truth ..... And by him not calling me and saying that, you know, I knew what that meant. ..... 
   [A]s we had on every other occasion and every other instance of this relationship, we would deny it.''  
   The evidence indicates that the President was not interested in the truth, but rather, was only interested in getting Ms. Lewinsky to sign a false affidavit and getting her a job in New York where, from the President's way of thinking, she was less apt to be contacted by the Jones lawyers. 
   I must say that I am baffled at how the President of the United States--the leader of the free world--was intimately involved in both of these efforts. The evidence indisputably establishes that the President worked with his close friend Vernon Jordan to secure: (1) a job offer for Ms. Lewinsky in New York, and (2) a lawyer for Ms. Lewinsky to prepare and file her false affidavit. As Mr. Jordan's testimony made clear, his efforts on behalf of Ms. Lewinsky were at the behest of the President. 
   The evidence also indicates that during this same time period the President participated in a scheme to conceal gifts in the Jones civil rights suit. Ms. Lewinsky's testimony is clear that she met with the President on December 28 and suggested to him that she could ``put away or maybe give to Betty or give to someone the gifts[.]'' Ms. Lewinsky further testified that later that same day the President's loyal secretary, Betty Currie, initiated a call to her to pick up the gifts. I find Ms. Lewinsky's testimony to be credible. Moreover, it is corroborated by Ms. Currie's cell phone record. 
   And, of course, the President didn't stop there. 
   CROSSROADS #3: FALSE STATEMENTS IN A CIVIL RIGHTS LAWSUIT 
   The President came to another fork in the road where he had to decide whether to testify truthfully under oath regarding his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky. And, again, the President chose the path of lies and deceit. 
   He walked into the deposition room, raised his right hand, swore to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, and then proceeded to give false statements. In a civil case about alleged sexual misconduct with a subordinate government employee, the President testified under oath that he never had a ``sexual relationship'', a ``sexual affair'' or ``sexual relations'' with a subordinate government employee named Monica Lewinsky. 
   But, again, as egregious as those actions were, had the President stopped there, we still might not be here. 
   CROSSROADS #4: TAMPERING WITH A LOYAL SECRETARY 
   The stakes for President Clinton continued to go higher and higher. Following his deposition, the President had to decide what to do with his loyal secretary, Ms. Betty Currie. And, again, the undisputed evidence shows that the President took the path of lies and deceit. 
   Contrary to federal obstruction of justice laws and contrary to Judge Wright's Protective Order instructing President Clinton ``not to say anything whatsoever about the questions . . . asked, the substance of the deposition, . . ., [or] any details . . . ,'' President Clinton left the deposition, went back to the White House, and called Ms. Currie at home to ask her to come to the White House the next day--which, I might add, was a Sunday. 
   At that somewhat surreal Sunday afternoon meeting, the President--in violation of Judge Wright's Protective Order--told Ms. Currie that he had been asked several questions about Monica Lewinsky at his deposition. Then the President--in violation of the federal obstruction of justice law--fired off a string of fundamentally declarative statements to his secretary.  
   ``You were always there when she was there, right? We were never really alone. 
   You could see and hear everything. 
   Monica came on to me, and I never touched her, right? 
   She wanted to have sex with me and I couldn't do that.''  
   And, of course, the President didn't stop there. According to Ms. Currie, the President again called her into the Oval Office a few days later, and again, repeated the same false statements to her that he had made under oath in his civil deposition. 
   CROSSROADS #5: FALSE STATEMENTS TO SENIOR OFFICIALS AND TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE 
   The winding road continued its perilous twists and turns. The President next came to a point where he had to decide whether to tell the truth to his Cabinet, his top aides, and, most importantly, to the American people. 
   Again, the President rejected the right path, telling his Cabinet and staff that the allegations were untrue. He claimed to his then-Deputy Chief of Staff, John Podesta, for example, that he ``never had sex with [Ms. Lewinsky] in any way whatsoever.'' Specifically, he told Podesta that ``they had not had oral sex.'' And, the President admits in his grand jury testimony that he knew that his aides could be called to testify before the grand jury. Ultimately, his top aides were called to testify, and they repeated his lies. 
   And, as everyone in America knows, the President lied to the nation. I do not need to recite the defiant, indignant, finger-wagging denial that the President gave to 270 million Americans who had placed their trust in him as the chief law enforcement officer of this land. 
   But, it didn't have to go any further. I think that there's still a chance that had the President stopped there at that awful, disgraceful moment, we would not be here, today. 
   CROSSROADS #6: FALSE STATEMENTS TO THE GRAND JURY 
   On August 17, 1998, the President came to the most important crossroads. He stood before a federal criminal grand jury--a federal criminal grand jury that was trying to determine whether he had committed perjury and obstructed justice. He had one last chance to do the right thing. He could tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth to the grand jury. Or, he could commit perjury. 
   Again, President Clinton chose the wrong path. During that criminal probe, the President admitted to an ``inappropriate'' relationship with Ms. Lewinsky, but continued to falsely deny ever having sexual relations with her, in the face of corroborating evidence that included an undisputed DNA test and the testimony of Ms. Lewinsky and two of her therapists. 
   The President's strained, persistent, and--in the words of his own lawyer--``maddening'' denials of the obvious were blatantly and patently false. 
   The President also declared under oath to the grand jury that his post-deposition coaching of Betty Currie about his relationship with Monica Lewinsky was a mere attempt to refresh his ``memory about what the facts were.'' This statement is also blatantly and patently false. 
   In fact, there is no reasonable interpretation that would make the President's statements about coaching Ms. Currie to be true. Ms. Currie was not always there. She could not always see and hear everything. She could not know whether the President ever touched Ms. Lewinsky. And, she did not know whether Ms. Lewinsky ever had sex with the President. It is difficult to comprehend how the President could be refreshing his own memory through the act of making false statements to a potential witness. 
   Moreover, it is my opinion that these false statements by the President under oath were clearly material. A false and misleading denial of a sexual  relationship with a subordinate government employee and a false and misleading denial of tampering with a potential witness goes to the very heart of whether the President obstructed justice or committed perjury. 
   Based on the evidence in the record, I am firmly convinced that the President has committed both perjury and obstruction of justice. He lied to the grand jury about the nature of his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky. He lied to the grand jury about coaching his loyal secretary, Betty Currie. He obstructed justice by encouraging Ms. Lewinsky to give false testimony, by participating in a scheme to conceal gifts that were subpoenaed, by tampering with his secretary on two occasions, and by lying to top aides that he knew could be called to testify before the grand jury.

    Mr. MCCONNELL.  
   Mr. President, I come to the floor today to introduce legislation that addresses an important issue facing American families today--the education of their children. It is my long-held belief that we need to make a college education more affordable, and the legislation I am introducing today, the College Savings Act, will do just that by providing tax incentives to families who save for college. 
   This legislation is a serious effort to reward long-term saving by making savings for education tax-free. It is important that we not forget that compounded interest cuts both ways. By saving, participants can keep pace, or even ahead of, tuition increases while putting a little away at a time. By borrowing, students bear added interest costs that add thousands to the total cost of tuition. Savings will have a positive impact, by reducing the need for students to borrow tens of thousands of dollars in student loans. This will help make need-based grants, which target low-income families, go much further. 
   Mr. President, anyone with a child in college knows first-hand the expense of higher education. Throughout the 1990's, education costs have continually outstripped the gains in income. Tuition rates have now become the greatest obstacle students face in attending college. In fact, the astronomical increase in college costs has been well documented. According to a study conducted by the College Board, tuition and fees for a four-year public university rose 107 percent from 1980-1997, while median household income rose only 12 percent. 
   Due to the high cost of education, more and more families have come to rely on financial aid to meet tuition costs. In fact, a majority of all college students utilize some amount of financial assistance. In 1997-98, $60 billion in financial aid was available to students and their families from federal, state, and institutional sources. This was $3 billion higher than the previous year. A majority of this increase in aid was in the form of loans, which now make up the largest portion of the total federal-aid package at 57 percent. Grants, which a decade ago made up 49 percent of assistance, have been reduced to 42 percent. This shift toward loans further burdens students and families with additional interest costs. 
   We must reverse the dependence on federal assistance and encourage families to save. My legislation would reward savings and allow students and families that are participating in these state-sponsored plans to be exempt from federal income tax when the funds are used for qualified educational purposes. This legislation also recognizes the leadership that states have provided in helping families save for college. In the mid-1980s, states identified the difficulty families had in keeping pace with the rising cost of education. States like Kentucky, Florida, Ohio, and Michigan were the first to start programs in order to help families save for college. Nationwide more than 30 states have established savings programs, and over a dozen states are preparing to implement plans in the near future. Today, there are nearly one million savers who have contributed over $3 billion in education savings. The provision which I authored, which allows tax-free education savings in state-sponsored savings plans for education purposes, provides nearly a $1.5 billion tax break for middle-class savers nationwide. In Kentucky, over 3,720 families have established accounts, which amount to about $7.5 million in savings. 
   Mr. President, I have worked closely with the state plan administrators over the years seeking both their advice and support. Again this year, I am pleased to have the National Association of State Treasurers and the College Savings Plans Network endorse this legislation. They have worked tirelessly in support of this legislation because they know it is in the best interest of plan participants--the families who care about their children's education. 
   Mr. President, many Kentuckians are drawn to this program because it offers a low-cost, disciplined approach to savings. In fact, the average monthly contribution in Kentucky is just $52. It is also important to note that 60 percent of the participants earn under $60,000 per year. By exempting all interest earnings from state taxes, my legislation rewards parents who are serious about their children's future and who are committed over the long-term to the education of their children by providing a significant tax break for middle-class savers nationwide. Clearly, this benefits middle-class families. 
   In 1994, I introduced the first bill to make education savings exempt from taxation. Since then I have won a couple of battles, but still haven't won the war. To win the war, Congress needs to make education savings tax free--from start to finish. The bill I am introducing today will achieve that goal. 
   In 1996, Congress took the first step in providing tax relief to families investing in these programs. In the Small Business Job Protection Act of 1996, I was able to include a provision that clarified the tax treatment of state-sponsored savings plans and the participants' investment. This measure put an end to the tax uncertainty that has hampered the effectiveness of these state-sponsored programs and helped families who are trying to save for their children's education. Also in 1996, Virginia started its plan and was overwhelmed by the positive response. In its first year, the plan sold 16,111 contracts raising $260 million. This success exceeded all goals for this program. 
   In 1997, the Taxpayer Relief Act made revisions to provide maximized flexibility to families saving for their children's college education. The most significant reform was to expand the definition of ``qualified education costs'' to include room and board, thus doubling the amount families could save tax-free. In Kentucky, room and board at a public institution make up half of all college costs. This important legislation also expanded the definition of eligible institutions to include all schools, including certain proprietary schools, and defined the term ``member of family'' to allow rollover eligibility for cousins and step-siblings in the event that the original beneficiary does not attend college. 
   Last year, the Senate passed legislation, sponsored by Senator COVERDELL and Senator TORRICELLI, which would have allowed parents to place as much as $2,000 per year, per child, in an education savings account for kindergarten through high school education. Included in this legislation was my proposal to make savings in state-sponsored tuition plans tax-free. Unfortunately, the bill was vetoed by President Clinton. 
   As a result of our actions over the last several years, more and more state plans have implemented tuition savings and prepaid plans for their residents. It is projected that there will be 43 states with tuition savings plans by the year 2000. I believe that we have a real opportunity to go even further toward making college affordable to American families. It is in our best interest as a nation to maintain a quality and affordable education system for everyone. By passing this legislation, we can help families help themselves by rewarding savings. This will reduce the cost of education and will not unnecessarily burden future generations with thousands of dollars in loans. 
   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the bill and letters endorsing my legislation from the Kentucky Higher Education Assistance Authority and the National Association of State Treasurers be printed in the  RECORD, along with an article from Time magazine that discusses the popularity of state tuition saving programs.

   Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to join my esteemed colleagues--Senators HUTCHISON, GRAHAM, VOINOVICH, ABRAHAM, and others--in sponsoring legislation to protect the States' tobacco settlement funds from the Clinton Administration's spurious recoupment claims. 
   Members of the U.S. Senate will recall quite vividly that this chamber engaged in a lengthy, detailed debate on a national tobacco settlement bill last year. While those discussions proved inconclusive, the States--on their own--achieved much of what Congress and the White House identified as priorities through direct settlement agreements with the tobacco companies. 
   As part of the comprehensive settlement with 46 states and the prior individual State agreements, the tobacco companies are required to take specific action to address public health concerns regarding teen smoking. First, they must fund a major anti-smoking advertising campaign to prevent youth smoking and to educate consumers about tobacco-related illnesses. Second, they must establish a charitable foundation to support the study of programs to reduce teen smoking and substance abuse. Third, the settlement prohibits tobacco advertising that may target youth, like the commercial use of cartoon characters like ``Joe Camel'' and outdoor advertising such as billboard, stadium and transit ads as well as tobacco sponsorship of sporting and cultural events. In addition, the States have plans to spend their tobacco settlement funds for advancing the public health and welfare. 
   Much to the dismay of the nation's governors and state legislators, instead of receiving a commendation from the President for a job well done, they got a multi-billion dollar collection notice. Despite the fact that the States filed lawsuits asserting a number of non-Medicaid claims, the Clinton Administration argues that every state who agreed to the $206 billion settlement should fork over from 50 to 79 percent of their share to the federal government--including states like Kentucky who didn't even file a lawsuit but joined the settlement. As such, the President's FY 2000 budget states that the federal government has the right to withhold at least $16 billion Medicaid dollars from the States over the next five years. 
   Simply put, Mr. President, this bogus claim will deny Kentucky's most needy citizens over $2.4 billion in Medicaid funds over the term of the settlement agreement. I cannot excuse the fundamental conflict created by an Administration that claims it is fighting for the health of our children while it gobbles up the money specifically designated for them. This effort to hold state Medicaid programs hostage in exchange for federal strings on how the States spend their own money is intolerable and unacceptable. 
   Unlike the Administration, I believe all wisdom does not reside in Washington. It's clear to me that our state's elected officials are in a better position to determine Kentucky's needs than a federal bureaucrat sitting 600 miles away in Washington. I am proud to serve as an original sponsor to this legislation which makes clear that the federal government has no claim to the tobacco settlement funds attained by the States. I commend my fellow sponsors for their commitment to preserving common-sense in government, and urge my colleagues to approve this legislation expediently and without compromise.
