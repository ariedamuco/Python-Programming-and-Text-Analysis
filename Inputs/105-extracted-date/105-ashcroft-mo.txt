Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, We are very fortunate, Will Rogers once observed, that we've never gotten all the Government we've paid for. For most of this century, Mr. Rogers' words have stood the test of time. Unfortunately, I fear that with this omnibus appropriations bill, this 3,000-page, 40-pound, 2 foot high, $500 billion monster, we will be getting all the Government we have paid for and then some. 
This omnibus legislation reflects the Federal budget process at its worst. This package was not the result of democratic votes, open discussion, and legislators reflecting the will of the people. With little debate and lots of backroom deals, 8 of the 13 annual appropriations bills have been tossed into one enormous heap of spending. This is wrong. 
Who has read this pile of programs and pork? Not a single Senator has. 
We didn't get a peek at a summary of this Government colossus until Monday afternoon, just 2 days ago. We won't see it in the Congressional Record until after the vote. 
The truth of the matter is, no one knows what is in this colossal creation, and no one claims to be its father. It is said that victory has a thousand fathers, but defeat is an orphan. This forsaken monstrosity, which no one claims, nor has anyone read, deserved defeat today. We don't know much, but here is some of what we do know about this measure. 
The Social Security trust fund has been raided for spending more on the programs and pork in this bill. Billions of dollars will be added to the national debt that our children will one day have to pay. 
This legislation also breaks the much-heralded Balanced Budget Agreement. 
And finally, we know that taxes, which are at record high levels, will not be cut. Washington thinks it needs the people s money more than the people need it. 
When I came to the Senate in 1995, at the same time that the new Republican majority assumed control of Congress, I hoped that Congress would downsize the Federal Government and return money and power to the American people. After 40 years of Democratic control of one or both Houses, it was finally time for Congress to uphold its responsibility, to minimize the Federal Government's intrusion into our citizens' lives and pocketbooks, to lower taxes and to reduce the size of Government. 
Unfortunately, President Clinton remains the chief obstacle to lower taxes and smaller Government, despite his claim in the 1996 State of the Union Address that `the era of big Government is over.' That famous line from President Clinton is about as accurate as his pronouncement in January of 1998 that he wanted to save `every penny of any surplus' to preserve the Social Security system. Both are intentionally misleading and factually wrong. 
But Congress also shares the blame. The 105th Congress has been either unable or unwilling to cut spending, has been, at best, reluctant to fight for tax cuts, and has now cut a budget deal that guarantees that Bill Clinton's vision of a costly and intrusive Federal Government survives for at least one more year. 
The cost of the Federal Government is so staggering that numbers alone do not convey its enormity. We are spending more money today than our Founding Fathers ever thought possible. As Stephen Moore of the Cato Institute has indicated:  
Adjusted for inflation, the . . . [Federal] spending total of $7.5 trillion for 1998-2002 is more money than America spent to fight both world wars, the Civil War and the Revolutionary War [combined]. In fact, in today's dollars, it is more money than the U.S. Government spent on everything from 1787 to 1960. 
In the fiscal year 1999 alone, the Federal Government will spend more than the entire Federal Government spent from our founding until 1920. 
Without taking into account the $21 billion in new emergency spending contained in this omnibus legislation, the Congressional Budget Office estimates that Federal spending has increased $205 billion over the last 4 years. By comparison, in the previous 4 years, Federal spending increased only $192 billion. 
Last year, the Congress passed, and the President signed, the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. There was much rejoicing, celebration and self-congratulations surrounding the passage of the bill, congratulations from the Halls of Congress and down Pennsylvania Avenue to the White House. The backers of the bill proclaimed fiscal discipline was being imposed on Washington. 
Mr. President, I did not join in that celebration, nor share in Washington's enthusiasm. The 1997 budget deal spent too much, provided too little tax relief and was unenforceable. The bill contained no meaningful enforcement provisions, nothing to guarantee that future Congresses and administrations would limit spending or require the budget caps to be strictly enforced. 
As a matter of fact, I proposed an amendment to impose the spending controls on the balanced budget agreement, and that amendment to that agreement was defeated. As a result, we have seen just today that the balanced budget agreement has been broken. Now promises made one year are ignored the next. Promises made last year for a balanced budget are ignored this year. This omnibus bill we have voted on today confirms my worst fears: It breaks the budget limits set just 1 year ago, spends the budget surpluses instead of saving it for Social Security, and keeps more money in Washington without returning it to the rightful owners--the families that work day and night to earn it. 
Mr. President, Americans are working longer than ever before to pay their taxes. According to the nonpartisan Tax Foundation, the average American now works until May 10 to pay Federal, State and local taxes. In a typical workweek, the average American works until late Tuesday afternoon just to pay taxes. And the tax burden is getting worse, not better. 
For the past 5 consecutive years, the growth in personal tax payments has outstripped that of wages and salaries. Americans deserve better than this tax burden and better than a spending bill for which no one is accountable. 
America needs a real tax cut. The Federal Government has collected more taxes than the year before every year since 1983. We have been on an ascending, accelerating juggernaut of tax collections, and that means that the American people have not had a true tax cut in 15 years, while Washington has increased taxes twice in this decade, in 1990 and 1993. Those two tax hikes will take a combined $600 billion extra from the American people over the next 5 years. 
It reminds me a bit of President Reagan's telling definition of a taxpayer. Reagan defined the taxpayer as `someone who works for the Federal Government but doesn't have to take a Civil Service exam.' 
During the debate on the Senate budget resolution last April, a number of fiscally conservative Senators and I announced that we were prepared to vote against the resolution because it planned to spend too much and cut taxes too little--only $30 billion over 5 years, or a whopping $1.83 per month in tax relief for every person in the country. We asked instead for a meaningful tax cut and the elimination of the marriage penalty which unfairly burdens 21 million couples simply because they are married. 
In response to our concerns, the Senate leadership pledged to support the larger of the tax cuts contained in either the House- or Senate-passed budget resolution. The leadership also agreed to make repeal of the marriage penalty the Senate's top tax priority. 
After the House adopted its budget resolution last May, the budget resolution process screeched to a halt. Why? The House budget resolution recommended cutting taxes $101 billion over 5 years. Given the agreement we had with the leadership, the Senate was to have pushed the House proposal. Unfortunately, many Senators would have rather seen the budget resolution die than have Congress pass even modest tax relief, equal about 1 percent of the revenue the Federal Government is projected to collect over the next 5 years. 
For the first time since the process was established in 1974, Congress failed to produce a budget resolution and killed any chance for meaningful tax or spending cuts this year. 
This unwillingness to cut taxes comes during a period in which we anticipate over $500 billion in surpluses over the next 5 years. 
This unwillingness comes from President Clinton's misleading political promise to `protect' the surplus for Social Security. In his 1998 State of the Union Address, President Clinton proposed reserving, in his words, `100 percent of the surplus--that's every penny of any surplus--for Social Security.' 
Well, promises made, promises broken. The mantra here in Washington lives on: `You send it, we spend it.' 
Despite President Clinton's promise not to use the Social Security for anything but Social Security, the Administration has raided Social Security to fund a series of new spending initiatives--paid for by the same surplus he is purporting to save for Social Security. 
While the 1997 balanced budget agreement limits discretionary spending through fiscal year 2002, this new spending has overridden these discretionary spending caps, shrinking the budget surplus and consuming money that could be used to `save' Social Security. 
It took Congress and the White House only 1 year to breach the budget caps--1 year to break the promises made to the American people. 
The Washington Post reported on Tuesday, October 20, that congressional aides have confessed that the omnibus bill not only contains $20.9 billion in `emergency' spending, but also busts the caps by another $7 billion in nonemergency discretionary spending. That is $7 billion in broken promises--$7 billion in spending that under the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 should not be allowed to occur. 
It is not surprising that the President found a way around the spending limits so quickly. As I have said on many occasions, taxes and spending are the only things in Washington more addictive than nicotine. In fact, this bad habit of resorting to bogus `emergency' spending to circumvent the discretionary caps resembles the behavior of an addict trying to rationalize his inability to stay sober. 
Since 1991, Congress has passed $53.7 billion in emergency spending; that is excluding Desert Shield and Desert Storm. Unfortunately, the President's `emergency' spending requests do not meet any emergency other than his inability to get all he wants to spend. There are no eleventh hour developments that have made Social Security solvency a secondary concern. 
The President is proposing that the equivalent of at least 24 percent of this year's surplus be spent on a Bosnia deployment that is now 4 years old, Government computer repairs--we have known about these needs--increased embassy security, and a variety of other initiatives. 
Now, many of these requests constitute real and important funding issues. But emergencies? Mr. President, the well-being of our elderly is too important for half-truths and doublespeak. Nothing but the President's unwillingness has prevented the Administration from offering $21 billion in emergency spending reductions out of the Federal Government's $1.7 trillion budget. 
In other words, the President could have offered to reduce spending elsewhere to accommodate his emergencies. But apparently the President would rather see our seniors' Social Security checks shipped overseas in the form of foreign aid or squandered on more Washington bureaucrats than find savings amounting to less than 1 percent of the Federal budget. 
Mr. President, as I am sure you know, the Congressional Budget Office projects the Federal Government will run a $137 billion on-budget deficit over the next 5 years--fiscal years 1999 to 2003. In other words, 21 percent of the $657 billion Social Security surplus over that period will be used to finance non-Social Security spending. Yet, the administration is strangely silent about this matter. 
If the administration sincerely opposes using the surplus for anything but Social Security, it should call upon Congress--as I have--to reduce projected spending by $137 billion over the next 5 years in order to eliminate the on budget deficit. Of course, the President will not do this. He prefers to block tax cuts by scaremongering vulnerable older Americans on Social Security, while spending all the money he can through budget loopholes--like the designation of his needs or desires as `emergencies.' 
Mr. President, we are here today almost 3 weeks into the 1999 fiscal year. We voted on the omnibus appropriations package, one which I voted against, that will fund the Federal Government for the next 11 months. This omnibus bill contains eight complete appropriations bills; but it also contains increased funding for the other five appropriations bills that have either been signed by the President or await his signature. Every single one of the 13 appropriations bills was affected by the bill we passed today. It even increases spending in the bills already signed into law by the President. Several of the appropriations bills included in this humongous monstrosity were never even considered by the Senate--not at all, not even for 1 day. 
Again, this massive pile of programs and pork, weighing 40 pounds, standing 2 feet high, over 3,000 pages long, was not available until mid-day yesterday. Then there was just one copy in the Cloakroom for all offices to share. This bill is so huge that the Congressional Record could not even print the bill until this morning, to be available after the Senate vote. 
Although the President and congressional leaders announced they had reached an agreement last Thursday, a rough summary was not even available until Monday. We do not know everything that is in this bill. I do not know half of what is in this bill, and not a single Senator does, including the leadership and the appropriators. 
There is something wrong when Congress passes one bill, one huge bill, that spends so much--all 13 appropriations bills are affected, even those already signed by the President--and there is only one copy to be shared. We should be held responsible for the decisions that we make--decisions to spend the people's money, to spend the Social Security surplus, to increase the debt that will be owed by our children and grandchildren. 
Who is responsible here? Who can be accountable when they do not know for what they are accountable? Today, it feels like I was asked to be nothing more than a rubber stamp for a deal made by a handful of individuals who assume they had the power to speak for all of us. 
I know what the press reports say, and what the Appropriations Committee says, and what the President has said, but the bottom line is this: This legislation has not been scored by CBO, the Congressional Budget Office. Nor has the Office of Management and Budget determined that all of the emergency spending requests will be categorized as budgetary `emergencies.' Of course, with no office getting a copy of the bill before it was voted on, and with some 3,000 pages to review, weighing about 40 pounds, such an analysis was impossible. 
So where does this leave the country? Congress has rejected calls for tax relief and has just passed a $500 billion omnibus spending bill that will cut the surplus and boost the size and the intrusiveness of Government. 
The President says he wants to save Social Security, yet his every action has been designed to save a catchy campaign slogan --`Save Social Security First'--while he spends the Social Security surplus on new initiatives. The Government continues to grow, and a tax cut is nowhere in sight. Yes, I fear we may soon get all the Government we have paid for--and then some. But then Congress does not even know what we have just paid for. And we do not know what we have just passed. 
We can do better, and we must do better. Our resolve must stiffen. The people of this country deserve better service from us, and we must provide it. It is with that in mind that I object to the passage of this measure today. 
Mr. President, I thank the Chair and I yield the floor.  
Mr. GRAMS addressed the Chair.

Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, we have made some important advances on the encryption issue during this Congress. We held a hearing in the Senate Constitution Subcommittee, which pointed out the constitutional problems with the Administration's proposed domestic encryption policy and put individual privacy rights back into the discussion. More recently, as everyone is aware, the Administration has taken a few modest steps toward liberalizing its export policy. 
However, we have to be wary of piecemeal approaches to the problem. The Administration's decision to relax its export policy helps out big businesses with subsidiaries in certain selected countries, but it leaves most ordinary consumers out in the cold. 
In the Judiciary Committee, I resisted another piecemeal approach--making the use of encryption in furtherance of a felony a separate crime, without addressing the broader encryption issue. As a former Attorney General of Missouri, I am keenly aware of the interests of law enforcement in not having encryption unduly hinder law enforcement. On the other hand, in my work on the encryption issue, I have come to appreciate the concerns of privacy groups who are opposed to this proposal. I explored some ways of working this issue out with my colleagues in this Congress, but we could not work out an acceptable compromise. In the next Congress, I look forward to working with my colleagues--on and off the Judiciary Committee--to fashion a comprehensive resolution of the encryption issues that balances the needs of law enforcement and law-abiding citizens. 
In the next Congress, our goal must be to move beyond such piecemeal approaches to find a comprehensive solution to computer privacy issues. This will not be easy. 
Twice recently, President Clinton has told high-tech audiences that `we've reached broad agreement on encryption policy.' Unfortunately, that is just not true--at least not yet. The Administration's water torture approach to encryption--liberalizing export policy drip by drip--demonstrates that they do not understand two fundamental principles: (1) that robust and reliable encryption is available on the world market, and (2) that ordinary Americans should have access to the best available encryption to protect their privacy. 
In short, it does us no good to talk about `broad agreement' that does not actually exist. Instead, we need to work hard to make such broad agreement a reality. That is the task for the next Congress, and I look forward to working with my colleagues to get the job done.

Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, recently, both the House and Senate voted unanimously to pass the conference report on S. 2206, the `Coats Human Services Reauthorization Act of 1998.' During House debate on the conference report, some members expressed concerns regarding bill language described as the `charitable choice' provision, which is similar to language I drafted for the welfare reform law passed in the 104th Congress and signed by the President in August of 1996. 
As I have said in a previous floor statement, the charitable choice provision will expand the opportunities for private, charitable, and religious organizations to serve their communities with Community Services Block Grant (CSBG) funds. This provision expresses the judgment of Congress that these organizations can play a crucial role in helping people out of poverty through the CSBG program. 
I am confident that the charitable choice language in the Community Services Block Grant reauthorization is constitutional and represents sound public policy. However, I want to respond to the comments made regarding this provision, as critics of the provision seem to overlook recent case law of the Supreme Court regarding this issue, and even mischaracterize certain sections of the charitable choice provision. 
First, most of the concerns expressed by certain House members are based upon case law that does not represent the current jurisprudence of the Supreme Court. In recent years, the general trajectory of the Supreme Court's Establishment Clause cases has been in the direction of what constitutional scholars describe as `neutrality theory.' Under this theory, private organizations are eligible to provide government-funded services to beneficiaries through contracts, grants, or vouchers without regard to religious character. Moreover, there are serious constitutional problems when the government screens potential service providers based upon religious beliefs and practices--which is what the critics of charitable choice want to do. 
The charitable choice provision in the 1996 welfare reform law and the Child Care Development Block Grant Program of 1990 conform to the principle of religious neutrality. Under the first legislation, charitable and faith-based organizations are eligible, on the same basis as all other non-governmental organizations, to receive federal funds to provide services to welfare recipients. Similarly, the child care law allows low-income parents to choose among an array of private providers--including religious ones--in obtaining federally funded day care services. 
The test the Supreme Court has used over the years to analyze Establishment Clause cases has been the `Lemon test,' which has the two-fold requirement that the government action in question must have a valid secular legislative purpose, and a primary effect that neither enhances nor inhibits religion. (In the recent case of Agostini v. Felton, the Court took the third prong, the `entanglement' analysis, and folded it into the second prong of the test). The first prong, requiring a valid secular purpose, is usually not subject to much controversy, as the Court has been highly deferential to the legislature's action. In its review of the Adolescent Family Life Act (AFLA), for example, the Court noted that the `provisions of the statute reflect at most Congress' considered judgment that religious organizations can help solve the problems to which the AFLA is addressed. Nothing in our previous cases prevents Congress from making such a judgment or from recognizing the important part that religion or religious organizations may play in resolving certain secular problems.' 
The serious debate generally concerns the second prong of the Lemon test, namely, whether the `primary effect' of these social welfare initiatives is to advance religion. In neutrality theory, Lemon's primary-effect inquiry is accomplished by examining how a service provider actually spends the program monies. Obviously, the test is whether funds are being spent in accordance with the valid secular purposes set out in the governing statute, and as expressed in the service contract or grant at issue. These purposes necessarily exclude use of the monies for inherently religious programming. 
On the other hand, critics of charitable choice would argue that the primary-effect inquiry should focus on whether a service provider is religious in character, and if so, how religious. An organization found `too religious' is dubbed `pervasively sectarian,' thereby disqualifying the organization as a provider of government-funded services. 
In recent years, the Supreme Court has been moving away from this `too religious' versus `secular enough' inquiry, and toward the neutrality approach. Two of the Court's most recent pronouncements on this issue are Agostini v. Felton and Rosenberger v. Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia. Although the Court did not embrace the neutrality principle in these cases without certain qualifications, the law today is far closer to neutrality than to the `no-aid separationism' of the 1970s and mid-1980s espoused by critics of charitable choice. 
In Agostini, decided in 1997, the Court held that remedial education for disadvantaged students could be provided on the premises of K through 12 religious schools--the only entities the Court has declared in the past to be `pervasively sectarian.' The Court was no longer willing to assume that direct assistance would be diverted to the inculcation of religion by authorities at Roman Catholic elementary and secondary schools. 
In the 1995 Rosenberger case, the Court held that a state university could not deny student activity fund money, which was generally available to all students groups for student publications, to a certain student group based upon the religious content of its publication. The Court warned that the government's attempt to draw distinctions regarding religious content would require the government--and ultimately the courts--`to inquire into the significance of words and practices to different religious faiths, and in varying circumstances by the same faith. Such inquiries would tend inevitably to entangle the State with religion in a manner forbidden by our cases.' The critics would ignore this warning in order to apply their `too religious' test. 
Several prominent constitutional law scholars have recognized the Court's movement toward neutrality, including Professor Douglas Laycock of the University of Texas, Professor John Garvey of Notre Dame, Professor Michael McConnell of the University of Utah, Professor Michael Paulsen of the University of Minnesota, and finally, Professor Carl H. Esbeck of the University of Missouri. Professor Esbeck worked closely with my staff to draft the charitable choice provision of the welfare law, as well as my Charitable Choice Expansion Act, which I introduced earlier this year. 
The consequences of relying upon the view propounded by critics of the charitable choice concept go beyond ignoring recent constitutional jurisprudence. They also result in bad public policy. Demanding that religious ministries `secularize' in order to qualify to be a government-funded provider of services hurts intended beneficiaries of social services, as it eliminates a fuller range of provider choices for the poor and needy, frustrating those beneficiaries with spiritual interests. 
In examining a neutral program that includes both religious and secular providers, what matters is how the government money is actually spent, not the ideological character of the provider. Strict adherence to the `too religious' distinction perpetuated by the critics could actually eliminate current successful providers from eligibility to receive government funds. 
Congress should continue to find ways to encourage successful charitable and faith-based organizations to unleash their effective good works upon society. The charitable choice provision is one such way to accomplish this goal. 
In their discussion of the charitable choice provisions in the CSBG reauthorization bill, critics fail to acknowledge a valid distinction made by the Supreme Court: the difference between direct and indirect funding of government programs. When a program is administered through the use of certificates or vouchers given to beneficiaries, the religious nature of the organization at which the beneficiary redeems the voucher is irrelevant. 
The Supreme Court has consistently held that government may confer a benefit on individuals, who exercise personal choice in the use of their benefit at similarly situated institutions, whether public, private nonsectarian, or religious, even if the benefit indirectly advances religion. The Court has made these rulings in Zobrest v. Catalina Foothills School District (1993), a case holding that the provision of special education services to a Catholic high student was not prohibited by Establishment Clause; in Mueller v. Allen (1983), where it upheld a state income tax deduction for parents paying religious school tuition; and in Witters v. Washington Department of Services for the Blind (1986), where the Court upheld a state vocational rehabilitation grant to disabled student choosing to use his grant for training as a cleric. 
Moreover, the Child Care and Development Block Grant program, which has been in existence since 1990, allows parents to send their children to day care centers that are unquestionably `pervasively sectarian' in nature. This program has never been challenged as being violative of the Establishment Clause. 
Should a community wish to set up a Community Services Block Grant program that gives individual beneficiaries vouchers or certificates to redeem at the location of their choice, there is no constitutional concern as to the religious nature of the organization providing services to that beneficiary. 
There were also concerns expressed on the House floor that individuals would be directed by the government to religious organizations to receive Community Services Block Grant Services and forced to participate in religious activities. These concerns indicate that some members may not fully understand how the Community Services Block Grant program operates. Under this program, beneficiaries choose where they want to receive CSBG services--the government does not force certain individuals into certain programs. 
CSBG services are not federal entitlements. This program was designed in the 1960s to provide flexible federal funding to communities to identify problems and needs in the community, and to then fashion and design a local solution. This is not a federally-directed solution. Rather, the CSBG program allows the community to find the most appropriate organizations in the community to offer different types of services to individuals. 
Community Services Block Grant services are offered voluntarily to individuals in the community. People are not directed into these programs by the government. In fact, there are most likely existing government programs in the community, offering similar types of services, such as job training, basic education courses, and housing services. The Community Services Block Grant program maximizes individual choice at the local level by providing services to those who are fighting their way out of poverty. 
Therefore, those who say that the charitable choice provision in the CSBG program is going to force individuals into religious programs and provide no alternatives misunderstand how the CSBG program operates. 
The critics are also wrong when they say that a faith-based provider can compel a beneficiary to go to worship services or to submit to an attempt of proselytization. The argument fails to acknowledge that the charitable choice provision contains language stating that `[n]o funds provided directly to organizations shall be expended for sectarian worship, instruction, or proselytization.' Thus, CSBG funds must not be used to carry out inherently religious purposes. Rather, the funds are for the secular public purposes of the legislation, which include reducing poverty, revitalizing low-income communities, and empowering low-income families and individuals in rural and urban areas to become fully self-sufficient, especially those families who are attempting to transition off of welfare. 
Therefore, the structure of the Community Services Block Grant program, along with the clearly spelled-out uses of and prohibitions on CSBG funding, ensure that beneficiaries will have maximized choices of where to receive services to help them escape poverty and reach self-sufficiency. 
One argument was made that the charitable choice provision could result in the government having to provide financial audits of churches and other religious organizations who might be eligible for funds under a charitable choice program. 
This statement appears to express a concern that a religious organization would subject itself to government intrusion by its receipt of CSBG funds. I share this concern, and for that reason, I included in the charitable choice provision language protecting a religious organization from such intrusion. This language requires a religious organization to segregate government funds from funds received from non-government sources. Additionally, the provision states explicitly that only government funds are subject to government audit. 
Therefore, the charitable choice provision protects participating religious organizations from unwarranted governmental oversight, while also holding such organizations financially accountable in the same way as all other non-governmental providers receiving government funding. 
There was also a statement made on the House floor that the charitable choice provision `would seek to enact exemptions from the religious discrimination clauses of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.' This is a misstatement of what the provision says. Charitable choice does not create an exemption from the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Rather, it states that it preserves the exemption in the law allowing religious organizations to make employment decisions based on religion. The Supreme Court affirmed the constitutionality of this provision in Corporation of the Presiding Bishop v. Amos (1987). Receiving government funds for a secular purpose does not, of course, result in a waiver of this exemption. See, e.g., Siegel v. Truett-McConnell College, 1994 WL 932771 (N.D. Ga. 1994). 
If a religious nonprofit organization must hire persons in open disagreement with the religious background and mission of the organization, its religious autonomy would be severely infringed. In fact, many successful faith-based organizations have stated that they would not take government funding if it would require them to hire employees who did not hold the same religious beliefs of the organization. For example, the International Union of Gospel Missions conducted a survey of their missions and found that some of these missions refused government funding if it required them to hire non-Christians. 
The Charitable Choice makes clear that a religious organization maintains its Title VII exemption when it receives government funds to provide social services. 
There was also an argument made that the charitable choice provision would require the government to consider using fringe religious groups to provide CSBG services. Although I find this to be more of a scare tactic than a legitimate argument, I think it is obvious that the charitable choice provision will not require the government to blindly select any non-governmental organization that applies for CSBG funds. The government may require legitimate, neutral criteria to all who apply. No organization, religious or otherwise, can become a provider unless it can deliver on its grant or contract. 
Finally, there was an argument that the charitable choice provision could override the constitutional language of states prohibiting public funds from going to religious organizations. I would simply respond that the charitable choice provisions are in federal law dealing with federal dollars. We do not tell the states how to spend their own state tax funds. 
In conclusion, the opponents of the charitable choice concept have not taken into account the latest Establishment Clause jurisprudence. If there is a comprehensive, religiously neutral program, the question is not whether an organization is of a religious character, but how it spends the government funds. 
To reject charitable choice is to jeopardize Congress' ability to encourage proven, effective religious organizations to provide social services to our nation's needy with government funds. For years, these organizations have been transforming broken lives by addressing the deeper needs of individuals--by instilling hope and values that help change behavior and attitudes. By contrast, government-run programs have often failed in moving people from dependency and despair to independence. We must continue to find ways to allow private, charitable, and religious organizations to help administer the cultural remedy that our society so desperately needs. The charitable choice provision in the `Coats Human Services Reauthorization Act of 1998' is one way of accomplishing this goal.

Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I believe these are times in which anyone, anywhere would wish to live--times of boundless opportunity when distant horizons are brought near. Since the second year of Ronald Reagan's first term, America has seen her GDP climb every year but one. Our unemployment rate stands at a historic low. Poverty has dropped by more than ten percent. And our budget is in surplus for the first time in a generation. 
For the first time since 1969, the federal government will run a surplus estimated to be $70 billion. It is a surplus that could allow us to do so much for so many. We could free American families from a debilitating tax burden or help the forgotten middle class keep more of what they earn with tax relief. 
Beyond meaningful tax relief, the surplus offers another great potential--ensuring the long-term solvency of the Social Security Trust Fund. 
The surplus is an opportunity for us to honor our commitment to the men who scaled the cliffs at Normandy and the mothers who sent their son to defend America's freedom halfway around the world. It is, Mr. President, a once in a lifetime chance for us to make the paper IOUs in the Social Security Trust Fund real--to pay our debts and keep our word. We can use the surplus to do this. 
Unfortunately, the President and his apologists on Capitol Hill have a different plan. It is an attack given to platitudes rather than principle, an approach long on meaningless rhetoric and short on meaningful reform. It is a plan that calls for a return to the profligate spending of yesterday at the cost of a brighter tomorrow. 
As I suggested last Monday on the Senate floor, since late September the President has submitted a series of requests to fund new `emergency' spending initiatives. And, because current law subjects discretionary spending to annual caps through FY 2002, this so-called `emergency' spending would increase the discretionary spending caps, decrease the budget surplus, and take money from the Social Security Trust Fund. 
And what are the President's `emergency' spending requests? What are the eleventh hour developments that have made Social Security's solvency a low priority instead of a high one? The President is proposing that the equivalent of at least 24% of this year's surplus--$14.4 billion to date--be spent on a Bosnia deployment that is now four years old, government computer repairs, increased embassy security and a variety of other initiatives. 
Now, I will be the first to concede that many of the President's requests constitute real and important funding issues. But emergencies? Mr. President, the lives of our elderly are too important for half-truths and doublespeak. 
Social Security should not be betrayed by emergencies that are conjured up and have been anticipated for quite some time. The definition of an emergency is not something that we have known about for 4 years or 2 years or something that we are really trying to get money to spend in the last fiscal year and not in this one. 
In his January 1998 State of the Union address, President Clinton made the following statement: `What should we do with this projected surplus? I have a simple four word answer: Save Social Security first. . . . I propose that we reserve 100 percent of the surplus--that's every penny of any surplus--for Social Security.' 
And just 10 days ago, the President repeated his demand again (October 2, 1998). `I made it clear and I want to make it clear again. . . . We simply have to set aside every penny of it [the budget surplus], . . . to save Social Security first.' 
Unfortunately, Mr. President, you can't have it both ways. We can't hide from the truth. 
More to the point, you can't save Social Security by wasting the surplus on mislabeled emergencies or more big spending. Even as I speak here, the President and his aides are working to see that our seniors' Social Security checks either are shipped overseas or squandered on more bureaucrats in Washington, DC, with more spending programs proposed for money to be shipped overseas or bigger bureaucracies here in the nation's capital. Tragically it is what Chairman Greenspan warned us about just weeks ago. Referring to whether the surplus should be spent, saved, or returned to the taxpayers, Greenspan said, `. . . I am also, however, aware of the pressures that will exist to spend it, and that in my judgment would be the worst of all outcomes.' 
Greenspan says, `. . . the pressures . . . to spend it . . . would be the worst of all outcomes.' 
Mr. President, if increased spending is labeled as `emergency' as an accounting gimmick in order to authorize us to spend the surplus, I will not be a party to it. Labeling the taxpayers' money `emergency' doesn't make it any less wasteful. Just because it is called emergency doesn't prevent it from adding government and adding bureaucracy. As was said by another, putting a sign on a pig and calling it a dog doesn't make the pig any less of a pig. And there is going to be plenty of pork in this `Mother of All Pigs,' that is coming to the Senate for its approval by way of a proposal for spending. 
For example, the Wall Street Journal this morning reported that Labor, Health and Human Services and Education account for the single largest part of the Omnibus 
bill in terms of add-ons sought by the Administration. The President wants a total of $1.6 billion, including almost $1.2 billion for his `class size' initiative and another $182 million for a child care block grant. 
Mr. President, all of this $1.6 billion dollars in increased education spending is paid for from the Social Security Trust Fund. The President has not offered one dime in spending cuts to pay for his `priorities,' which he has labeled as `emergencies.' 
What is equally as shocking is that the underlying Labor/HHS/Education appropriations bill is estimated to be about $4 billion over its spending allocation even before accounting for the extra money sought by the Administration this weekend. 
The President should explain to the voters that his pledge to `save every penny of any surplus' was untrue. His promise to `save Social Security first' was just a slogan--offered during his State of the Union with a wink and a nod, and broken days later. 
Only days after first promising to save the surplus, he submitted a budget to Congress calling for $150 billion in additional spending. And in the entire legislative year since the President made his pledge, he has done nothing to fix the Social Security problem--and far too much to fix the blame. He has wasted this entire year, just as he is proposing to waste our senior's Social Security checks on overseas deployments and projects. 
If the President truly meant what he said about Social Security, he would propose real fixes instead of empty promises. If the President truly meant what he said about saving the surplus, he would not be trying to spend the taxpayer's money under the camouflage of bogus `emergencies.' 
This whole notion of false `emergency' spending is a dangerous ploy. It puts the President of the United States in the position of the little boy who cried wolf. If and when we face a true emergency, we will be forced to fund it through this discredited process. And when that time comes, we will regret having engaged in this sleight-of-hand, in this legerdemain, in this charade. Words should have real meaning, Mr. President, and actions should have consequences. Two lessons we would do well to remember. 
Mr. President, the normal appropriations process is what every American family does when they plan their spending for the upcoming week, or month, or year. Families measure how much they can afford to spend, and where they have to cut back. In some years, when there is an illness or a recession, they may have emergency savings that they use. Perhaps it is a rare occurrence--one they take only in extraordinary circumstances. 
But think what would happen if families used their savings for non-emergencies--for a new car or a new dress. They would quickly find themselves unprepared for true emergencies. 
The Federal Government should treat its emergencies the same way families do. Necessary but non-emergency problems should be addressed by achieving savings in lower priority federal spending programs. 
The President's commitment to send troops to Bosnia was made 4 years ago. It is time to account for that in the normal appropriations process. The Year 2000 problem is a very real threat. But it is also a problem that we have known about for some period of time--since we do have calendars here in Washington. No, instead of anticipating the need and including it in the regular budget process, the President has chosen to ask for this kind of additional funding in the `emergency' category. The President is crying wolf and I only hope the Republican Congress has the good sense say, `No.' 
Mr. President, I don't agree always with what I read in the newspaper, but here's an editorial with which I do agree. `Republicans rightly point out,' the Christian Science Monitor recently noted, `that there's a double standard here: It's OK for Clinton and the Democrats to propose spending $20 billion of the coming surplus for `emergencies,' but when the GOP suggests returning some of it to taxpayers, that's a `threat' to Social Security.' (Christian Science Monitor editorial, September 28, 1998) 
The Christian Science Monitor had it right in that editorial. And the double standard is even worse than the Monitor suggests. For when this $20 billion is spent, the money will be gone. Whereas if we had given it back to the taxpayer, at least we would have provided some measure of relief from the highest tax burden in the history of this republic--a helping hand to the forgotten middle class. 
And that is the key question here. Who owns the surplus? President Clinton and the Democrat Party see the surplus as own private slush funds--money he can hoard with the shield of false promises, but spends whenever it suits them. 
I would argue that the American people own the surplus. And it is time to give it back. As we have learned with all too great a frequency in recent years, if we leave the surplus in Washington, supposedly far-sighted bureaucrats will find a way to spend it. 
For there is no end to the good Washington believes it can do with their brains and our money. This town specializes in spending. 
I believe it is time for us to make the American people aware of the deceitful and dishonorable efforts to use the budget surplus on mislabeled emergencies and increased spending. I came to Washington 4 years ago to cut taxes and decrease government interference in our lives. 
I also made a sacred commitment that I would protect and defend the Social Security Trust Fund. I intend, therefore, to oppose any effort to spend the elderly's Social Security checks on overseas deployments or the bureaucracy in Washington, D.C., 
and mislabeling those things as `emergencies' will not change my commitment or determination. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, the International Religious Freedom Act of 1998 represents a vitally important piece of legislation to raise awareness of and combat religious persecution overseas. Some would downplay the problem of religious persecution abroad, but preserving religious freedom at home and promoting it in other countries is central to the purpose and objectives of the United States. 
In our own history as a nation and in the histories of countries around the world, religious freedom has been at the center of movements for broader civil liberty. Efforts to restrict religious freedom strike at the heart of liberty itself. Thus, the United States has a duty to stand for religious liberty abroad as we continue to preserve it at home. 
If the Administration had been more aggressive in confronting religious persecution, such legislation might not be necessary. In fact, at a White House meeting to discuss one of the major bills on religious persecution, President Clinton told religious leaders that legislation which actually required him to confront persecution abroad would put `enormous pressure on whoever is in the executive branch to fudge an evaluation of the facts of what is going on.' 
That is a troubling statement by the President of the United States, which not only calls us to question this Administration's commitment to fight religious persecution, but the reliability of other presidential certifications on issues such as Chinese missile and nuclear proliferation. Such statements by Administration officials make it clear why legislation to address religious persecution is needed. 
Religious persecution is a tragic fact of life in many countries, from Latin America to Asia to Africa. Religious persecution in Sudan and China has been of particular concern to me. As Chairman of the Africa Subcommittee, I held a hearing on religious persecution in Sudan in September of last year. 
Religious persecution has become enmeshed in a brutal Sudanese civil war that has taken more than 1.5 million civilians since 1983, with over 4 million more being displaced by the fighting. An estimated 430,000 refugees have fled Sudan to seek safety in neighboring countries. 
Human rights organizations working in Sudan have testified before Congress that the government uses `aerial bombardment and burning of villages, arbitrary arrests, torture, chattel slavery--especially child slavery--hostage taking, summary execution, inciting deadly tribal conflict, the abduction and brainwashing of children, the arrest of Christian pastors and lay church workers, and the imprisonment of moderate Muslim religious leaders' to suppress dissent and form a radical Islamic state. Such barbarous atrocities, along with Sudan's support for international terrorism, has led me to introduce legislation to cut off financial transactions with the Sudanese government. 
The viciousness of religious persecution in Sudan should not callous us to the very real and brutal oppression taking place in other countries. As Nina Shea notes in The Lion's Den, China has more Christians in prison because of religious activities than any other nation. The State Department's first comprehensive review of persecution against Christians, issued in July 1997 and entitled `U.S. Policy in Support of Religious Freedom,' says, `The Government of China has sought to restrict all actual religious practice to government-subsidized religious organizations and registered places of worship.' 
China's efforts to restrict religious freedom are driven by oppressive policies which seek to make all religion subservient to the state's secular objectives. In the book China: State Control of Religion, Human Rights Watch states that `the Chinese government believes that religion breeds disloyalty, separatism, and subversion.' The book goes on to note: `Chinese authorities are keenly aware of the role that the church played in Eastern Europe during the disintegration of the Soviet empire.' 
Rather than embrace and encourage the free expression of faith, the Chinese government is engaged in a massive, ongoing, and brutal effort to repress non-sanctioned religious activity. Ministers or lay people who seek to practice their faith free from bureaucratic interference and oppression are subjected to imprisonment, torture, and worse. The Far Eastern Economic Review noted that 15,000 religious sites were destroyed by government police in the first five months of 1996 alone. Paul Marshall and Nina Shea note that `China's underground Christians are the target of what they themselves describe as the most brutal repression since the early 1980s when China was just emerging from the terror of the Cultural Revolution.' 
And yet, in spite of such repression by the Chinese Communist government, this Administration declined even to sponsor a resolution at the U.N. Commission on Human Rights condemning China's human rights record. Apparently, some type of back door deal was made with the Chinese government in which a few prisoners would be released and we would turn our head and close our ears to the thousands that remain in Chinese prisons and labor camps. 
I am aware of mounting concern in the U.S. business community on the damage done to U.S. competitiveness due to unilateral sanctions. I want U.S. companies to compete and succeed in the international marketplace. The Nickles legislation, however, is a carefully crafted bill which offers the President an array of options to promote religious liberty abroad and will target any resulting sanctions on those countries most deserving of reproach for religious persecution. This legislation is a necessary first step to address the problem of religious persecution. 
Mr. President, I submit that it is time for the Senate of the United States to take a stand on this issue of religious persecution, and passage of the Nickles legislation offers just such an opportunity. It is also time for the Executive Branch to take a stand on this issue. Rather than look at how we might `fudge' legislative requirements to avoid confronting oppression abroad, let us have the courage of our convictions. Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate the members of the conference committee on S. 2206 for their hard work on this legislation which reauthorizes the Head Start program, the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance program, and the Community Services Block Grant (CSBG) program. I am particularly grateful to the conferees for including in this legislation language that will expand the opportunities for charitable and religious organizations to serve their communities with Community Services Block Grant funds. This language, which is based upon my Charitable Choice provision in the 1996 welfare reform law, will encourage successful charitable and faith-based organizations to expand their services to the poor while assuring them that they will not have to extinguish their religious character as a result of receiving government funds. 
This provision makes clear that states may use CSBG funds to contract with charitable, religious and private organizations to run programs intended to fight poverty and alleviate its effects on people and their communities. When states do choose to partner with the private sector, the charitable choice concept ensures that religious organizations are considered on an equal basis with all other private organizations. 
For years, America's charities and churches have been transforming shattered lives by addressing the deeper needs of people--by instilling hope and values which help change behavior and attitudes. By contrast, government social programs have often failed miserably in moving recipients from dependency and despair to responsibility and independence. We in Congress need to find ways to allow successful faith-based organizations to succeed where government has failed, and to unleash the cultural remedy that our society so desperately needs. 
Unfortunately, in the past, many faith-based organizations have been afraid--often rightfully so--of accepting governmental funds in order to help the poor and downtrodden. They fear that participation in government programs would not only require them to alter their buildings, internal governance, and employment practices, but also make them compromise the very religious character which motivates them to reach out to people in the first place. 
My charitable choice measure is intended to allay such fears and to prevent government officials from misconstruing constitutional law by banning faith-based organizations from the mix of private providers for fear of violating the Establishment Clause. Even when religious organizations are permitted to participate, government officials have often gone overboard by requiring such organizations to sterilize buildings or property of religious character and to remove any sectarian connections from their programs. This discrimination can destroy the character of many faith-based programs and diminish their effectiveness in helping people climb from despair and dependence to dignity and independence. 
Charitable choice embodies existing U.S. Supreme Court case precedents in an effort to clarify to government officials and charitable organizations alike what is constitutionally permissible when involving religiously-affiliated institutions. Based upon these precedents, the legislation provides specific protections for religious organizations when they provide services with government funds. For example, the government cannot discriminate against an organization on the basis of its religious character. A participating faith-based organization also retains its religious character and its control over the definition, development, practice, and expression of its religious beliefs. 
Additionally, the government cannot require a religious organization to alter its form of internal governance or remove religious art, icons, or symbols to be eligible to participate. Finally, religious organizations may consider religious beliefs and practices in their employment decisions. I have been told by numerous faith-based entities and attorneys representing them that autonomy in employment decisions is crucial in maintaining an organization's mission and character. 
Charitable choice also states that funds going directly to religious organizations cannot be used for sectarian worship, instruction, or proselytization. 
In recent years, Congress has begun to recognize more and more that government alone will never cure our societal ills. We must find ways to enlist America's faith-based charities and nongovernmental organizations to help fight poverty and lift the downtrodden. The legislation before us today provides us with such an opportunity. 
Again, I want to express my appreciation to the conferees and their staff that worked on this legislation: Senators Jeffords, Coats, Gregg, Kennedy and Dodd, and Congressmen Goodling, Castle, Souder, Clay, and Martinez. I especially want to commend Senator Dan Coats, the Chairman of the Labor Committee's Subcommittee on Children and Families, for his desire to include my charitable choice language in the Community Services Block Grant Reauthorization. Senator Coats worked very hard in the conference committee to garner bipartisan support for this provision. Thanks to his efforts, and the efforts of this Congress, we will soon expand the opportunities for charitable and faith-based organizations to make a positive impact in their neighborhoods and communities through the Community Services Block Grant program.

Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals is in serious need of improvement. The court is the epicenter of judicial activism in this country. The Ninth Circuit's unique blend of distortion of text, novel innovation, and disregard for precedent caused it to be reversed by the U.S. Supreme Court 27 out of 28 cases in the term before last. That is something very, very serious. When this court's cases were considered by the U.S. Supreme Court in the term before last, 27 out of 28 decisions were considered to be wrong. 
If the people of this country found out that 27 out of 28 decisions of the Senate were considered to be wrong, Senators would not last very long. No tolerance would be provided for virtually any institution that was wrong that much of the time. The Ninth Circuit Court's record improved last year, but barely. According to the National Law Journal, the court was reversed in whole or in part in 14 out of 17 cases last year. Over the last 2 years, that amounts to a reversal rate of 90 percent. In the last 2 terms, 9 out of 10 times the Ninth Circuit has been wrong. 
The Ninth Circuit's disastrous record before the Supreme Court has not been lost on the Justices of the Supreme Court. In a letter sent last month supporting a breakup of the Ninth Circuit, Justice Scalia cited the circuit's `notoriously poor record on appeal.' Justice Scalia explained, `A disproportionate number of cases from the Ninth Circuit are regularly taken by this court for review, and a disproportionate number reversed.' 
The Ninth Circuit's abysmal record cannot be dismissed or minimized because the Supreme Court is there to correct the Ninth Circuit's mistakes. In a typical year, the Ninth Circuit disposes of over 8,500 cases. In about 10 percent of those cases, over 850 cases, the losing party seeks to have a review in the Supreme Court. Although appeals from the Ninth Circuit occupy a disproportionate share of the docket, the Supreme Court grants only between 20 and 30 petitions from the Ninth Circuit in a given year. If they are reversed 90 percent of the time because they are wrong in those cases that have been accepted, I do not know what the error rate would be in the other 8,500 cases that they litigate or consider on appeal, or what would be the error rate in the 850 cases that are sent, begging the Supreme Court to review the cases. But it is very likely, in my judgment, if their error rate is 90 percent in those cases that are accepted by the Supreme Court, that there are a lot of other individuals simply denied justice because of the extremely poor quality of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. 
This really places upon those of us in the U.S. Senate a very serious responsibility, a responsibility of seeking to improve the quality of justice that people who live in the Ninth Circuit receive. Accordingly, of the 8,500 cases decided by the Ninth Circuit in a year, only 20 or 30, or about three-tenths of 1 percent, are reviewed by the Supreme Court. So, if there are errors in the other cases, they are just going to remain there. 
Only three-tenths of 1 percent of the cases decided by the court are reviewed by the Supreme Court. So if we say it is OK for that circuit to be full of error, it is OK for that circuit to be absent the quality and the kind of correctness that is appropriate in the law, if we predicate our approval on the basis that there can be an appeal, the truth of the matter is, the Supreme Court takes only about three-tenths of 1 percent of the cases for appeal. 
The Supreme Court, moreover, selects cases for review predominantly to resolve splits among the circuits, not to correct the most egregious errors. So some of the cases the Supreme Court does not even take may be more blatant injustices than the ones that the Supreme Court does take, because the Supreme Court is trying to resolve differences between the Ninth Circuit and the Second Circuit, or the Eighth Circuit and the Ninth Circuit, or something like that. So we have a real shortfall of justice that exists as a potential whenever we have a court that is so error ridden, and its error-ridden nature is demonstrated because of the correction responsibility that has to be exercised by the U.S. Supreme Court. 
The truth of the matter is, for virtually all litigants within the Ninth Circuit, the decisions of the Ninth Circuit are the final word. How would you like knowing that you were going to court and that the appellate court which would oversee your day in court was reversed 90 percent of the time when it was considered by the Supreme Court, but you only had a three-tenths of 1 percent chance of getting an injustice in your case reversed because the Supreme Court only takes three-tenths of 1 percent of the cases? I think America deserves to have more confidence in its judicial system than that. 
The Ninth Circuit is an activist court in desperate need of therapy and help. After a thorough review of its record, it is my judgment that Professor Fletcher would do more harm than good in the Ninth Circuit, would move that court further outside the judicial mainstream. 
There has been a great deal of discussion about the applicability of Federal antinepotism statutes to this nominee. I commend individuals for raising this issue. It is critical to the respect for law. 
I have heard some people say they do not really care whether this is against the law or not. Frankly, I think we ought to care. I think a disregard for the law, especially as it relates to the appointment of judges, is a very, very serious matter. It is critical to the respect for law in a society as a whole that we in the Senate respect the laws that apply to us. 
However, one of the principles of judicial restraint identified by Justice Brandeis many years ago is that a court should not decide a difficult constitutional or statutory question if there is another straightforward basis for resolving the case. Applying that principle to this nomination, I have concluded that whether or not the statute precludes confirmation of Professor Fletcher, there is ample basis in the record to suggest that Professor Fletcher would exacerbate the Ninth Circuit's activism and I plan to oppose his nomination on that basis. 
A number of Professor Fletcher's writings suggest a troubling tendency toward judicial activism. For example, Professor Fletcher has written in praise of Justice Brennan's mode of constitutional interpretation. He also has criticized the Supreme Court for reading the Constitution in a literalistic way. This is troubling, to say the least. Justice Brennan, as even his admirers would admit, is the godfather of the evolving Constitution and the primary critic of the literal reading of the constitutional text. 
You know, there are those who believe the Constitution can be stretched, and grows, and amends itself to mean what someone wants it to mean at the time a crisis arises. I reject that. I reject Brennan's approach. Professor Fletcher embraces it. Those who believe that the Constitution can be an evolutionary document really are those who would be able to put their stamp of meaning anywhere they want anytime they choose. 
The debate over whether evolving standards of decency or the text should guide judicial decisions is at the heart--the very heart--of my concern over judicial activism. Nowhere in the country is the Constitution `evolving' more rapidly than in the Ninth Circuit. We cannot afford to send another activist to this court. 
Although a number of Professor Fletcher's writings focus on relatively esoteric subjects, they display a disturbing tendency toward activism on the issues addressed. 
He has criticized the current limitations on standing and has advocated an approach that would focus more on the legislative intent--an inherently dubious guide--and would afford standing to plaintiffs excluded by the current doctrine. 
Likewise, he has written that the procedural history of an amendment's enactment can lessen the presumption of constitutionality that would otherwise attach to the enactment. Frankly, we ought to be evaluating the constitutionality on the basis of the Constitution, not the procedural history. This is particularly disturbing in light of the Ninth Circuit's apparent tendency to apply a presumption of unconstitutionality to popular initiatives and other legislation the judges dislike on policy grounds. 
In an opinion piece written in the midst of Justice Thomas' confirmation process, Professor Fletcher wrote that `the Senate must insist nominees articulate their constitutional views as a condition of their confirmation.' 
Professor Fletcher's articles and answers to written questions `articulate' his view of the Constitution. Let's look at them. It is a view with which I disagree and which, in my judgment, will only exacerbate the problems of the Ninth Circuit. 
Finally, I want to acknowledge that I realize we do not appear to have the votes to defeat this nomination. Nonetheless, I believe it is important to come to the floor and debate this nomination, rather than approve it in a midnight session. 
Those of us on the Judiciary Committee have had the opportunity to reflect on the problems of the Ninth Circuit--the shortfall and the injustice for people who live in the Ninth Circuit, the likelihood that they get bad decisions and only three-tenths of 1 percent of them will ever be considered by the U.S. Supreme Court. This nominee would only make that problem worse. I urge my colleagues to oppose the nomination on that basis. 
I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of the time for those opposing the nomination.  
Mr. SPECTER addressed the Chair.

Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I rise in support of the conference report on H.R. 2281, a bill to implement the World Intellectual Property Organization copyright treaties. I am pleased that the final product of the many months of negotiations has produced a bill of appropriate scope and balance, and reflects many of the priorities I established through the introduction of my own bill to implement the WIPO copyright treaties, to begin updating the Copyright Act for the digital era, and to address the potential problem of on-line servicer liability. 
First, with respect to `fair use,' the conferees adopted an alternative to section 1201(a)(1) that would authorize the Librarian of Congress to selectively waive the prohibition against the act of circumvention to prevent a diminution in the availability to individual users (including institutions) of a particular category of copyrighted materials. As originally proposed by the Administration and adopted by the Senate, this section would have established a flat prohibition on the circumvention of technological protection measures to gain access to works for any purpose, and thus raised the specter of moving our Nation towards a `pay-per-use' society. Under the compromise embodied in the conference report, the Librarian of Congress would have authority to address the concerns of libraries, educational institutions, and other information consumers potentially threatened with a denial of access to categories of works in circumstances that otherwise would be lawful today. I trust that the Librarian of Congress will implement this provision in a way that will ensure information consumers may exercise their centuries-old fair use privilege to continue to gain access to copyrighted works. 
Second, the conferees made an important contribution by clarifying the `no mandate' provision of the bill. Because the conference report is silent, I thought that I should explain this provision in some detail. As my colleagues may recall, I had been very concerned that S. 2037 could be interpreted as a mandate on product manufacturers to design products so as to affirmatively respond to or accommodate technological protection measures that copyright owners might use to deny access to or the copying of their works. To address this potential problem, I authored an amendment providing that nothing in the bill required that the design of, or design and selection of parts and components for, a consumer electronics, telecommunications, or computing product 
provide for a response to any particular technological protection measure. The amendment reflected my belief that product manufacturers should remain free to design and produce the best, most advanced consumer electronics, telecommunications, and computing products without the threat of incurring liability for their design decisions. Creative engineers--not risk-averse lawyers--should be principally responsible for product design. As important, the amendment reflected the working assumption of all of my colleagues that this bill is aimed fundamentally at so-called `black boxes' and not at legitimate products that have substantial noninfringing uses. 
As my colleagues know, there had been some concern expressed that the `so long as' clause of section 1201(c)(3) made the provision appear to be circular in its logic. In other words, there was concern that the entire provision could be read to provide in essence that manufacturers were not under any design mandate to respond to technological measures, as long as they `otherwise' designed their devices to respond to existing technological measures. I never shared that perspective. To eliminate any uncertainty, the House Commerce Committee simply deleted the `so long as' clause. As I explained on the floor in September, that change merely confirmed my original conception of the amendment. Now that the conferees have adopted a provision requiring certain analog videocassette recorders to respond to certain existing analog protection measures, the `so long as' clause has a meaning that all should agree is logical: Manufacturers of consumer electronics, telecommunications, and computer products are not under a design mandate generally, but they are otherwise subject to a single, very limited, and carefully defined mandate to design certain analog videocassette recorders to respond to existing analog protection measures. Quite importantly from my perspective, this provision is limited so as not to impair the reasonable and accustomed home taping practices of consumers recognized in the Supreme Court's Betamax decision. 
It thus should be about as clear as can be to a judge or jury that, unless otherwise specified, nothing in this legislation should be interpreted to limit manufacturers of legitimate products with substantial noninfringing uses--such as VCRs and personal computers--in making fundamental design decision or revisions, whether in selecting certain components over others or in choosing particular combinations of parts. 
Third, I am pleased to see that the conferees have addressed the device `playability' problem. As I pointed out in my floor speech just prior to final passage of S. 2037, `playability' problems may arise at two levels. Technological measures may cause noticeable and recurring adverse effects on the normal operation of products, and thus adjustments may be 
necessary at the factory levels to ensure consumers get what they expect. In addition, adjustments to specific products may be necessary after sale to a consumer to maintain their normal, authorized functioning. Subsequently, I was pleased to see that the Commerce Committee's report explicitly reaffirmed my interpretation. 
I also was pleased that the conferees shared my perspective on encouraging all interested parties to strive to work together through a consultative approach before new technological measures are introduced in the market. As the conferees pointed out, one of the benefits of such consultations is to allow the testing of proposed technologies to determine whether they create playability problems, and to have an opportunity to take steps to eliminate or substantially mitigate such adverse effects before new technologies are introduced. As the conferees recognized, however, persons may choose to implement a new technological measure (or copyright management information system) without vetting it through an inter-industry consultative process, or without regard to the input of the affected parties. 
Whether introduced unilaterally or developed with the input of experts in the field, a new protection technology coming to market might materially degrade or otherwise cause recurring appreciable adverse effects on the authorized performance or display of works. Given the multiplicity of ways in which devices might be interconnected, some playability problems may not be foreseeable. I was thus pleased that the conference report unambiguously provides that manufacturers and persons servicing popular consumer electronics, telecommunications, or computing products who make product adjustments solely to mitigate a playability problem--whether or not taken in combination with other lawful product modifications--shall not be deemed to have violated either section 1201(a) or section 1201(b). Having heard directly from a major trade association representing professional servicers, I am pleased we could include such strong language so that they can go about their business without fear of facing crippling liability. 
Fourth, the conferees adopted specific provisions making it clear that the bill is not intended to prohibit legitimate encryption research or security systems testing. As my colleagues know, Senators Burns, Leahy, and I have lead the effort in the Senate to ensure that U.S. business can develop and export world-class encryption products. by explicitly fashioning an affirmative encryption research defense, the conferees made an important contribution to our overall efforts to ensure that U.S. industry remains at the forefront in developing secure encryption methods. In addition, by including a security system testing amendment, the conferees have confirmed that professional 
consultants and other well-established, responsible corporate citizens can survey and test IT security systems for vulnerabilities. 
Finally, the conferees built on my efforts to ensure that this legislation would not harm the efforts of consumers to protect their personal privacy by including two important amendments proposed by the House Commerce Committee. The first amendment would create incentives for website operators to disclose whenever they use technological measures that have the capability to gather personal data, and to give consumers a means of disabling them. The second amendment strengthened section 1202 of this legislation by making explicit that the term `copyright management information' does not include `any personally identifying information about a user of a work or a copy, phonorecord, performance, or display of a work.' In my view, these amendments will help preserve the critical balance that we must maintain between the interests of copyright owners and the privacy interests of information users. 
We should all be gratified that so much has been done to appropriately calibrate the WIPO copyright treaties implementing legislation. Each of us, working alone, would undoubtedly have produced a different bill. But we have a good bill, perhaps one more balanced and limited in scope than might have been thought possible at times throughout the debate. I therefore urge my colleagues to vote in favor of the conference report.

Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I am pleased to have this opportunity to begin a discussion today which should clarify some of the competing rhetoric and certainly some of the misinformation that is being spoken about the potential for tax cuts in our culture. 
We are taxed at the highest rates in history. Never before have the American people been asked to devote so much of their hard-earned resources to government. Yet there are lots of statements made about the incapacity of this government to afford tax cuts to the American people, to give them some more of what they have earned in return for their hard work. 
I rise today to speak the truth about tax cuts, to speak the truth about the so-called emergency spending, about Social Security, and about the budget surplus. A group of like-minded Senators and I have been engaged in a long and arduous fight to return to the American taxpayers more of their own money. We are here to announce that we are not giving up that fight. It may now be clear that the Senate will not be passing a tax cut this year. 
Even if the majority leader were to bring the House-passed bill to the floor, there are just too many Members, big spenders, if you will, who are more interested in spending the surplus than returning the surplus to the rightful owners--those who generated the surplus. I only wish the advocacy groups who attack tax cuts would be honest enough to criticize the President and the other big spenders as they spend the surplus on more and more government programs and projects. 
Senators Inhofe, Grams, Brownback, Bob Smith and I have waged a long battle, battle after battle, as a matter of fact, since May of this year, when we opposed the Senate Budget Committee resolution, because it contained only $30 billion in tax cuts over the next 5 years. Because of our strong and vocal opposition to that particular measure, our leadership made a commitment to us to fight for more tax relief, to adopt the House-passed tax cut number, to make eliminating the marriage penalty a priority of the Senate in a tax cut bill, and to move the budget reconciliation package so that tax cuts would be protected. 
In June, the House did pass a budget resolution that included $101 billion in tax relief. The other Senators and I, in accordance with the previous agreement with the leadership of this House, assumed that this would be the amount of tax relief that would be delivered to hard-working Americans this year. You have $101 billion in the House and an agreement by the Senate that it will go to the House figure; you would think you would be able to get to $101 billion. 
As the August recess loomed before us, the tax cuts remained elusive. That is why on July 17, a group of Senators and I came to the floor during consideration of the legislative branch appropriations bill and attempted to add a marriage penalty elimination amendment to that bill. To eliminate the marriage penalty would effectively reduce taxes for about 21 million couples who are penalized simply because they are married. Our point was simple and clear: Congress should not receive the funding under the legislative branch appropriations before the American people got the opportunity to keep a reasonable amount of what they earned. Why give all the money that Congress wants to Congress while we don't honor the need for the American people to fund their families? 
We were prevented from offering our amendment at that time by the Democrats. We came back 2 weeks later while this body was considering the Treasury-Postal Services appropriations bill and we offered our amendment again. Our amendment would have eliminated the unfair and discriminatory marriage penalty, that extra tax that people pay just because they are married, which affects 21 million American families to the tune of about $29 billion a year. 
We did not rely on spending the surplus in order to advocate that tax cut. We called for reductions in spending. We said that the Government has been on a budget high in fat for too long, it is time for us to provide the people with some relief, and we should do that by cutting spending. So we called for reductions in spending to offset the reduced revenues that would have come as a result of the tax cut. 
On July 29, a majority of the individuals serving in this Senate voted in favor of eliminating the marriage penalty when they voted not to table our amendment. A majority of the Senate said that it is time to stop imposing Washington's values on the people and start imposing the people's values on Washington. The marriage penalty is perhaps one of the best examples of an elitist Washington imposing its values on the principles of the American people. We know that the American people understand the value of marriage and families in our culture. We know that they understand that if we expect to succeed in the next century, if we don't want to sink, if we want to swim, we had better make it possible for families to meet their needs. One way to do that is to stop penalizing people for being families, and we ought to do that. 
Unfortunately, we had to withdraw the amendment because of the constitutional requirement that revenue bills originate in the House of Representatives. But the Senate did go on record supporting a marriage penalty elimination--this tax cut. A majority of this body voted to support eliminating the marriage penalty, but today we are facing the disappointing reality that the Senate will not pass, or probably will not even vote on, tax relief. 
Much has been made about the surplus that is now attendant to the financial situation in Washington. Last week, the President happily announced that, for the first time in almost 30 years, the Federal budget is in balance--not just in balance, but there is a budget surplus of almost $70 billion. President Clinton even took credit for the balanced budget and the budget surplus. 
Well, who is really responsible for the budget surplus? Was it the President and his party who voted for the largest tax increase in American history in 1993? Or was it the Republicans who made balancing the budget a national priority? Let me suggest that it wasn't the President, and let me suggest that it wasn't the Republicans, but that it was the American people who continued to work hard, to pay their taxes, continued to demand from their elected officials that we have some fiscal discipline. The American people should be credited with balancing the budget through their hard work, creativity, innovation, and their industry. Government doesn't generate revenue, it doesn't create wealth, people do, when they work hard. 
Make no mistake, the Federal budget surplus is up because Federal income taxes are up. Income tax revenues have increased $83.7 billion, or 11 percent, just since last year. Where do those tax revenues come from? They come from the American people. 
The President's record on taxes is threefold: Increase, increase, and increase. He has not proposed cutting taxes. Rather, his latest budget proposed increasing taxes by $100 billion over the next 5 years. Americans pay more in taxes today than they have in any other time in our history. President Clinton raised taxes by $242 billion in 1993, the largest hike in U.S. history, and sought to increase them another $290 billion as part of his plan to nationalize the Nation's health care system in 1994. And he sought to increase taxes by another $500 billion-plus this year as part of a tobacco tax bill. In 1995, he vetoed the first major tax cut since Ronald Reagan was President. We all remember when the President mused aloud about his 1993 tax increase. He put it this way: `It might surprise you to know that I think I raised them too much, too.' 
Well, frankly, I believe the President is right that he raised taxes too much. If we raised taxes too much, wouldn't it behoove us to begin to settle the account and start to let the American people have some of their hard-earned resources for expenditure in their families? It is one thing to confess that you raised taxes too much; it is another thing to develop another plan to spend all that you raised when you raised too much. If he really believes we raised taxes too much, we should give some of these hard-earned resources back. The President seems to have forgotten that it is the American people who have led us to this budget surplus. It is their money, not our money. 
Mr. President, I have not forgotten this key fact. That is why I am here today--to say to the American people that they deserve not to have their money squandered on more Government, but they deserve a return on their investment--a return in the form of tax relief that is funded by reducing the spending of a Government addicted to a high-fat diet. This Government should be involved in reducing its invasion of the American culture with more and more Government and thereby consuming more and more of what families need to meet their needs. 
Now, the President has a plan, but his plan is to spend the surplus. When it became clear earlier in the year that the fiscal discipline the Republican Congress had demanded from the President would result in a budget surplus, the President made a statement in his State of the Union Address which he has repeated numerous times since then. He said this, and I have this statement on a chart here:  
But whether the issue is tax cuts or spending, I ask all of you to meet this test: Approve only those priorities that can actually be accomplished without adding a dime to the deficit. Now, if we balance the budget for next year, it is projected that we will then have a sizable surplus in the years that immediately follow. What should we do with this projected surplus? I have a simple four-word answer: Save Social Security first. Tonight, I propose that we reserve 100 percent of the surplus--that's every penny of any surplus--until we have taken all the necessary measures to strengthen the Social Security system for the 21st century. 
That is quite a statement. It is a bold statement. The President has used this statement to attack our plan to eliminate the marriage penalty and provide tax relief. He has used this sort of suggestion that we will just have to save Social Security and therefore you can't have any tax relief for the American people--a tax relief package that we were and are prepared to pay for out of reduced spending. But has the President attempted to keep his pledge to use every penny to save Social Security? There is only one answer. That answer is a resounding no. 
Only days after his Social Security pledge, he sent a budget to Congress that contained $150 billion in new spending, according to the Senate Budget Committee. Without that new spending, the surplus would have been $150 billion larger--hardly every penny of any surplus being used to save Social Security. 
It seems like every week the President has proposed an additional new spending program. His fiscal year 1999 budget, submitted earlier in the year, contained $150 billion in new spending. Just last Thursday, the President was at it again. At a press conference at the White House, he repeated his call for $34 billion to run our schools from Washington and to take control of our children's education away from their parents and teachers with new Federal expenditures of resources that are hard-earned by the American people, which he won't allow them to keep to fund their families. 
The President called for this new spending, as with all his spending requests, without a dime of offsetting savings. He is not talking about reallocating Federal expenditures, he is talking about increasing Federal expenditures. 
That means it can only be financed by dipping into the same surplus that he pledged would be spent for Social Security. 
Every penny of any surplus--the President said, should be reserved until we have taken all the necessary measures to strengthen Social Security. 
The President is gifted with language, so now we're redefining the phrase, every penny. 
It reminds me of the fellow who sat down to dinner every night and put his finger in the wine glass and flipped a little wine off his fingers. His friend said to him, `Why do you do that? Every night you come in, stick your finger in the wine glass, and you flip the wine off your finger.' He said, `Well, I promised my mother on her deathbed that I would never drink a drop of wine. And that is the drop I am not drinking.' 
The truth of the matter is that the President has said we are going to devote every penny of the surplus to Social Security, and there are not any pennies there--just dollars, and billions of dollars. So we are free to spend the billions of dollars. Those are the pennies we are not saving but flipping them off our finger because they are not there. 
In addition to all the increased spending that the President has asked for--spending that breaks the budget caps--this body will be called upon to vote for a package that includes at least $17.8 billion to pay for so-called emergencies--and I will go into what those quote-emergencies-unquote are shortly--that will be paid for out of the surplus. 
The truth is, they have done nothing to save Social Security. They have no proposal. They tried to discredit tax cuts by saying cutting taxes would impair Social Security. They might impair some other invasive government programs but not Social Security. But this is a way of trying to fight against any reduction in government, any ability of this Senate to try to say to families you need to be able to fund your needs rather than just be used as workers to fund the ambitious schemes of spending and big government. 
The truth is that the big spenders don't care about saving Social Security or balancing the budget. They care about reserving their ability to spend the taxpayers' money. 
They do not want their ability to spend curtailed in any way--they want the amounts to continue to increase, and they want to stop any tax cut that infringes on their spending power. 
They look at this surplus as an huge pot of money to finance all their pork barrel pet projects. There is no fiscal discipline here! There is only a strong commitment, an all consuming passion to prevent tax cuts at any expense--even if it means misleading the American people by their demagoguery about saving social security. 
The President said he wanted to save Social Security; devote every penny. The President and the big spenders have feigned their concern for Social Security and fiscal responsibility. It is a mantra that has been repeated thousands of times--sort of a slogan that any time there is a problem, they run and hide behind the Social Security billboards. They stick their heads into the ground and yell, `Social Security,' so they can avoid dealing with issues that count. 
I guess we can expect to hear that mantra another thousand more times in the next month preceding the election. But it is also clear that when we look at the President's record on Social Security reform, that he talks the talk but then takes a walk. 
Despite promising to save Social Security first, the President has never proposed a plan to reform Social Security--not even hinted at it. Clinton's one and only proposal related to Social Security was to promote and to sign into law a $25 billion tax increase for some Social Security beneficiaries. For all his rhetoric, not one plan--not one concrete proposal--to preserve the Social Security program. 
Social Security merely becomes a tool in his hand to try to divert attention from the opportunity to cut government spending and provide Americans with the opportunity to fund their families rather than to fund the bureaucracy. 
While a series of bills have been introduced by Republicans and Democrats addressing Social Security solvency, Congress is still, to this day, waiting upon a plan from the President. 
But the President has one goal, and that is to spend the surplus, and spend it as quickly as he can. Unfortunately, the President is not alone in this goal. It appears that a majority of the Senate is opposed to cutting taxes or cutting spending. They are only interested in one thing as well--stopping tax relief so that they can spend the surplus themselves. 
The President has presented to the American people a false choice--he said it has to be either this or this--and it is a false choice. He has said it is a choice between saving Social Security and Squandering the Surplus on tax relief. But this is a misleading choice. It doesn't have to be one or the other. We can take the surplus, devote it to Social Security, and we can provide tax relief by cutting some of the spending that is wasteful and inappropriate by a bureaucracy which is bloated. 
I believe we can do both. But only if we do not spend the surplus on increased government, as is currently being planned. Congress is planning to spend at least $17.8 billion of the surplus next week in the `emergency supplemental' bill. And we can be sure that the $17.8 billion figure will continue to grow exponentially by the time this Congress adjourns. 
Mr. President, the Administration's spending requests during this Congress have become more than a bad habit. These requests reveal a consistent failure at responsible governance. Twenty billion dollars or more in `emergency' appropriations may be requested before this Congress adjourns. 
Billions of these dollars will pay for expenditures the Administration knew it would incur. 
What are we talking about? These aren't surprise expenditures. These aren't emergencies that have come up. These are expenditures that have long been planned to be put into the emergency spending portion of the budget so they wouldn't come under the caps--so they wouldn't come under the normal limits that are related to balancing the budget. 
First, the administration did not realize--according to this, if it is an emergency--the year 2000 would follow the year 1999. It requested $3.25 billion to clean up the year 2000 computer problem. Why wasn't that in the ordinary spending appropriations request? 
DId anyone in the Administration have a calendar? Not only is the emergency designation of Y2K funding wrong, but experts in the field have informed my office that the Administration could have corrected this computing problem for far less money if the process had been stated earlier. 
So instead, the administration proposes to raid the surplus and to spend money that could have been used to save Social Security. 
Every penny? Maybe there haven't been any pennies, just dollars. 
Second, the administration claims it did not know that we would continue to deploy troops in Bosnia next year. This is an `emergency'--that somehow the Bosnia deployment is unanticipated. 
It has been apparent from the beginning of NATO's Implementation Force (IFOR) that American troops were there to stay much longer than the President had initially promised the American people three years ago. 
In dispatching over 22,000 U.S. soldiers to participate in the NATO Bosnia mission in 1995 and 1996, the President told the American people that the mission would take about one year. Secretary of Defense William Perry and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs John Shalikashvili both confirmed the one-year duration of NATO's Implementation Force (IFOR). Secretary Perry testified before the House International Relations Committee that the total cost of the Bosnia mission would be about $2 billion. 
Now, three years later, after two broken troop withdrawal deadlines and over $6 billion in cost, the Administration is seeking to fund this operation straight out of the surplus, which could be used, 
if we were to take the President at his word, to save Social Security. The President announced in December of 1997 that American troops would stay in Bosnia indefinitely, and yet he asked for an emergency appropriations of $1.9 billion for fiscal year 1999 operational costs. 
Next the Administration proposed to spend the surplus that he proposed be used to save Social Security on building embassies overseas. Yet, after the tragic bombings of Kenya and Tanzania, the State Department could not even tell the Congress how much money they had spent to upgrade embassy security to meet standards set forth in the Inman Report of 1985. An effective accounting system to track these funds had not been established. 
A failure to monitor where the money has been going is not the only problem. In recent years, the State Department has not even spent all the money appropriated by Congress for diplomatic security. In 1995 and 1996, the State Department failed to spend $100 million appropriated by Congress to enhance the security of U.S. overseas posts but now they want to raid the surplus in a so-called `emergency.' 
Mr. President, this administration has not managed fiscal resources in a manner which inspires confidence. The administration will spend over $550 billion in discretionary spending under the budget agreement, but instead of paying for these new spending requests from some other part of the budget, the administration wants to raid the surplus that would save Social Security. 
The real outrage is that the President plans to spend the surplus, not to preserve Social Security. The truth is that the President and some in the Congress have misled the American people about their plans for the surplus. They have no intention of saving the surplus to fix Social Security. They have no plan to fix Social Security. Their plan is to spend the surplus on fake emergencies and increase spending. They are unwilling to use the budget process to live within the budget caps to finance their spending, so they categorize items as emergencies so that they don't have to exist within the framework and discipline that would characterize any family's budget. We have caps on our spending at home. We have limits on what we can take and spend. We can't decide we are going to call something an emergency and create resources out of thin air. It can't be done by the American people. It shouldn't be done by the American President and Congress. So we, the Congress, end up denying hard-working Americans a tax cut and we scare senior citizens about the future of Social Security, and then they spend the surplus. 
One of the things we end up spending the surplus on is pork projects. There are many additional spending items that are being talked about for the omnibus appropriations emergency spending behemoth. I do not mean to say all of these items are without merit. Indeed, there have been natural disasters, floods, embassy bombings and other occurrences which demand our attention and perhaps some additional funding. But to do it all in an emergency rather than to be addressing in the next funding year, very shortly anyhow, where we would put the funding in the stream of limits and discipline that the budget process imposes is to simply not do our job. 
But even these events should not be used to excuse our willingness to deny tax relief or to spend the surplus. The Congress should find the money within the existing budget to pay for these items. As I said before, most of these items are not true emergencies. We have known about Bosnia for a long time. The need to increase our military's readiness we have known, and the Y2K computer problem we have known for years. But by labeling them emergencies, the President wants to use an accounting gimmick to spend the surplus, to spend it outside the normal budget process, and spend it in a way that does not affect the calculation under our spending caps. The fiscally disciplined way to deal with this is to work within the budget, to stop pork barrel spending, and to pay for these priorities. 
Mr. President, I want to share with you some of the items contained in the fiscal year 1999 budget in various appropriations bills that the Congress thinks are more important than saving Social Security because they are willing to spend on this kind of pork. 
Now, the Senator from Arizona, Mr. McCain, has done the American people and this body a great service. He has gone through the appropriations bills and he has identified all the earmarked pork programs and put this information on his home page on the Internet. I recommend it to people who want to spend an evening getting a headache reading about additional Federal spending. Seriously, it is a list that is comprehensive and it is worth looking at. I have looked at the information. Let me share some of it with you. Here are some of the examples of what we are spending for this year, items that the big spenders obviously think are more important than Social Security because they are unwilling to cut these programs in order to save the surplus. If they really wanted these things, thought they were worth it, they should be willing to cut other spending. But they are willing to take them out of the surplus. 
Believe you me, if this list of earmarked expenditures that Senator McCain has on his web site were put up in big print, it would be a stack that would be substantial. Here are a couple things. Here is $3.3 million for the Shrimp Aquaculture project. And let me apologize to the Senate for calling it pork. This isn't pork. This is shrimp. But there is $3.3 million. 
Here is another earmark. Wait a minute. Here is another one that is not pork, either. Pardon me. This is grasshoppers--$750,000 for grasshopper control research. Here is another--pardon me, not pork, not shrimp, not grasshoppers. Here is $150,000 to hire a new potato breeder. Here is $143,200 to continue subterranean termite research. 
Well, we have gotten through virtually everything but pork. Let's see if we can find something related to pigs in the process. Obviously, this is political pork, whether or not it is pork in the nutritional sense. Here is $2 million to unspecified communities in southern California for planning associated with the National Communities Conservation Planning Program. So we have $2 million for communities to plan to be a part of a planning program. We might call it planning squared, I think--planning for planning. I suppose we could have some additional resources to help people plan for planning to plan. Here is an earmark of $1.1 million to rehabilitate priest quarters in an old schoolhouse in a national historic site; an earmark of $1 million for incinerator replacement; an earmark of $3.4 million to meet uncontrollable costs at a wildlife center located in Wisconsin. `Uncontrollable costs' may be a phrase that seems acceptable in government, but families don't allow for uncontrollable costs. We are not allowed to have uncontrollable costs. 
So the bottom line is this. When we are willing to load up our bills with this kind of pork or termites or shrimp or grasshoppers or whatever else it is, it is not about tax cuts, and it is not about saving Social Security. It is about money. It is about spending. It is about power because he who has the money has the power. Someone said it is the Golden Rule: He who has the gold makes the rules. It is a power game here in Washington, and the big spenders just can't allow the American people to control their own money. 
Last week, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan appeared before the Senate Budget Committee and was asked what in his opinion should be done with the surplus. Let's look at his remarks.  
My first preference is to allow the surplus to reduce the debt. I am also, however, aware of the pressures that will exist to spend it. 
This individual, who perhaps knows as much about Washington and knows as much about this country and its financial caps indicates he knows about . . . 
. . . the pressures that will exist to spend it. And that in my judgment would be the worst of all outcomes. And if push came to shove and it was either to spend it or cut taxes, I would strongly and unequivocally be on the side of cutting taxes. 
Alan Greenspan happens to know that the growth and intensity, the kind of opportunity that is presented in the American economy is curtailed when we have more and more spending, and that growth and opportunity is enlarged when we have people with more of their money to spend themselves through tax cuts. 
That is why he says: 
And if push came to shove and it was either to spend it or cut taxes, I would strongly and unequivocally be on the side of cutting taxes. 
He stated that to spend the surplus would be the worst of all outcomes, but that is apparently what this President plans to do. 
I am sad to inform you, Mr. President, that the worst of all outcomes is about to happen. The pressure to spend is just too strong. I am here today to set the record straight. We cannot let the surplus be spent on mislabeled emergencies and increased spending. We must demand fiscal discipline from this Congress. We should demand truth to senior citizens about the fate of the surplus, and we will demand that the President, who decries tax cuts--we will demand that the President stand accountable for his actions as he prepares to spend the surplus rather than to keep his promise to save Social Security. 
The American people will not be fooled. You cannot save Social Security by wasting the surplus on bureaucracy in Washington, DC. You cannot save Social Security when you are sending the elderly's Social Security checks to the shrimp aquaculture project in Hawaii. You cannot save Social Security when the people recognize your posturing for what it is, a political exercise designed not to save Social Security but to save yourself. 
Mr. President, I appreciate this opportunity and yield the remainder of my time to my colleagues. 
I yield the floor to the Senator from Idaho, Senator Craig.

Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I rise today as a co-sponsor of the Fairness in Asbestos Compensation Act of 1998 to speak in favor of this important, bipartisan measure. I support this bill for a simple reason--it makes sense. The problems caused by the manufacture and use of asbestos are well-documented. Although some companies initially denied responsibility and fought suits to recover for asbestos-related injuries in court, the injuries associated with asbestos and the fact that manufacturers are liable for those injuries are now well-established. 
The courts--both state and federal--have done an admirable job of establishing the facts and legal rules concerning asbestos. That is a job the courts do well. However, now that the basic facts and liability rules have been established, the courts are being asked simply to process claims. That is not a job the courts do particularly well. The rules governing court actions give parties rights to dispute facts that have been conclusively established in other proceedings. All the while the meter is running for the lawyers on both sides. Dollars that could go to compensate deserving victims, instead go to lawyers and court costs. 
In the asbestos context, these problems are exacerbated by the finite amount of resources available to compensate victims and the fact that legal rules concerning both punitive damages and what constitutes a sufficient injury to bring suit make for jury awards that do not correspond to the seriousness of the injury. Someone filing suit because of a preliminary manifestation of a minor injury, i.e., pleural thickening, which may never lead to more severe symptoms, may receive more compensation than another person with more serious asbestos-related injuries. None of this is to suggest that it is somehow wrong for plaintiffs with a minor injury to file suit. To the contrary, some state rules concerning when injury occurs obligate plaintiffs to file suit or risk having their suit dismissed as time-barred. What is more, in light of the finite number of remaining solvent asbestos defendants, potential plaintiffs have every incentive to file suit as soon as legally permissible. 
The Fairness in Asbestos Compensation Act of 1998 attempts to address these problems by establishing an administrative claims systems that aims to compensate victims of asbestos rationally and efficiently. The Act accomplishes this goal by ensuring that more serious injuries receive greater awards, by securing a compensation fund so that victims whose conditions are not yet manifest can recover in the future, and by eliminating the statute of limitations and injury rules that force plaintiffs into court prematurely. Although I wish I could claim some pride of authorship in these mechanisms, these basic features were all part of a proposed settlement worked out by representatives of both plaintiffs and defendants. 
At the end of last term, the Supreme Court rejected the proposed global asbestos settlement in Amchem Products versus Windsor. The District Court had certified a settlement class under Rule 23 that included extensive medical and compensation criteria that both plaintiffs and defendants had accepted. The Supreme Court ruled that this type of global, nationwide settlement of tort claims brought under fifty different state laws could not be sustained under Rule 23. The Court recognized that such a global settlement would conserve judicial resources and likely would promote the public interest. Nonetheless, the Court concluded that Rule 23 was too thin a reed to support this massive settlement, and that if the parties desired a nationwide settlement they needed to direct their attention to the Congress, rather than the Courts. 
I believe the Supreme Court was right on both counts--the proposed settlement criteria were in the public interest, but the proposed class simply could not be sustained under Rule 23. The Rules Enabling Act and the inherent limits on the power of federal courts preclude an interpretation of Rule 23 that would result in a federal court overriding or homogenizing varying state laws. However, as the Supreme Court pointed out, Congress has the power to do directly what the courts lack the power to do through a strained interpretation of Rule 23. 
This bill takes up the challenge of the Supreme Court and addresses the tragic problem of asbestos. The bill incorporates the medical and compensation criteria agreed to by the parties in the Amchem settlement and employs them as the basis for a legislative settlement. In the simplest terms, the legislation proposes an administrative claims process to compensate individuals injured by asbestos as a substitute for the tort system (although individuals retain an ability to opt-in to the tort system at the back end). The net effect of this legislation should be to funnel a greater percentage of the pool of limited resources to injured plaintiffs, rather than to lawyers for plaintiffs and defendants. 
I want to be clear, however, that I am not here to suggest that this is a perfect bill. This bill represents a complex solution to a complex problem. A number of groups will be affected by this legislation, and it may be necessary to make changes to make sure that no one is unfairly disadvantaged by this legislation. But that said, I am confident that we can make any needed changes. We have a bipartisan group of Senators who have agreed to cosponsor this legislation, and the bill represents a sufficient improvement in efficiency over the existing litigation quagmire that there should be ample room to work out any differences. 
Finally, let me also note that this bill also plays a minor, but important role in preserving a proper balance in the separation of powers. I have been a strong and consistent critic of judicial activism. Judges who make legal rules out of whole cloth in the absence of constitutional or statutory text damage the standing of the judiciary and our constitutional structure. On the other hand, when judges issue opinions in which they recognize that the outcome sought by the parties might well be in the public interest, but nonetheless is not supported by the existing law, they reinforce the proper, limited role of the judiciary. Too often, federal judges are tempted to reach the result they favor as a policy matter without regard to the law. When judges succumb to that temptation, they are justly criticized. But when they resist that temptation, their self-restraint should be recognized and applauded. The Court in Amchem rightly recognized a problem that the judiciary acting alone could not solve. By offering a legislative solution to that problem the bill provides the proper incentives for courts to be restrained and reinforces the proper roles of Congress and the judiciary. 
In short, this bill provides a proper legislative solution to the asbestos litigation problem. It ensures that in an area in which extensive litigation has already established facts and assigned responsibility, scarce dollars compensate victims, not lawyers. I want to thank Chairman Hatch for his leadership on this issue and to thank my co-sponsors for their work on the bill. I look forward to working with them to ensure final passage of this legislation. The courts have completed their proper role in ascertaining facts and liability. It is time for Congress to step in to provide a better mechanism to direct scarce resources to deserving victims.

Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I rise to speak in favor of overriding President Clinton's veto of the partial birth abortion ban. I would like to begin by thanking the manager of the bill, the Senator from Pennsylvania, for his continuing and outstanding work on this important issue. 
No issue cuts to the core of our values like the issue of abortion. It challenges us to define our notion of liberty and calls into question our most fundamental assumptions about life. Today, we do not debate whether enactment of a measure will positively or negatively affect the welfare of some Americans. Today, we debate life and death. 
Last Congress and again last year, we voted to end the barbaric method of infanticide known as partial birth abortion. Both times, the President vetoed the ban. In so doing, he ignored the testimony of medical experts who assured us that this procedure is never necessary to preserve the life or health of the mother. He also dismissed evidence showing that thousands of partially-born children are routinely and electively killed across the country each year. 
The President not only accepted, but helped disseminate the lies and false testimony of pro-abortion advocates. Though the lies were finally exposed, the President demonstrated that his support for this procedure did not depend on the truth. The distortion reached a point where even his allies in the media could no longer defend the President's veto. Richard Cohen, an avowed liberal and pro-choice columnist with the Washington Post, concluded, 
President Clinton, apparently as misinformed as I was about late-term abortions, now ought to look at the new data. So should the Senate. . . . Late-term abortions once seemed to be the choice of women who, really, had no other choice. The facts are now different. If that's the case, then so should be the law. (Wash. Post, 9/17/96.) 
And yet, once again, the President's apologists have taken to the floor to defend the indefensible. 
This procedure is never necessary to save the life and preserve the health of the unborn child's mother. Four specialists in OB/GYN and fetal medicine representing the Physicians' Ad Hoc Coalition for Truth have written: 
Contrary to what abortion activists would have us believe, partial-birth abortion is never medically indicated to protect a woman's health or her fertility. In fact, the opposite is true: The procedure can pose a significant and immediate threat to both the pregnant woman's health and fertility. (Wall St. Journal, 9/19/96). 
Indeed, former Surgeon General C. Everett Koop stated, 
I believe that Mr. Clinton was misled by his medical advisors on what is fact and what is fiction in reference to late-term abortions. Because in no way can I twist my mind to see that the late-term abortion as described--you know, partial birth, and then the destruction of the unborn child before the head is born--is a medical necessity for the mother. 
Nor should we accept the myth that this procedure is rarely utilized. According to interviews conducted by the Record of Bergen County, New Jersey, physicians in New Jersey alone claim to perform at least 1,500 partial birth abortions each year--three times the number which the National Abortion Federation has claimed occur in the entire country. 
Mr. President, a legislative ban on partial birth abortions is constitutional. Indeed, allowing this life-taking procedure to continue would be inconsistent with our obligation under section 5 of the 14th Amendment to protect life. 
Although opponents will point to decisions in which activist federal judges invalidated state-passed bans, language nearly identical to that which is in this bill has been upheld in a number of courts. The ban's requirement that the abortionist deliberately and intentionally deliver a living fetus that is then killed implicate the partial birth procedure and no other. Judges who deemed the ban unconstitutionally vague ignored the text, and instead, saw fit to substitute their views in place of the views clearly expressed by the various state legislatures. 
Mr. President, I want to share a word of caution with those claiming that a ban on partial birth abortions is unconstitutional. If they truly believe that outlawing this procedure is impermissibly vague, the inevitable conclusion people will draw is that infanticide and abortion are indistinguishable. I do not see how this argument provides any solace to the defenders of this gruesome procedure. 
Finally, before this debate is through, I expect those defending the President's veto will say that opponents of partial birth abortion are really against all abortions. Well, Mr. President, I cannot speak for other Senators, but on that charge, I plead guilty. I believe abortion is the taking of innocent human life and has no place in a culture that values human life. I believe that precious human life should be nurtured in love and protected in law. For this reason, I support a constitutional amendment to protect human life. 
On January 20th of this year, I chaired a hearing in the Constitution Subcommittee on the 25th anniversary of Roe v. Wade. We looked at how the Supreme Court's decision failed to provide a framework for sound constitutional interpretation or to reflect the reality of modern medical practice. This latter failure is not surprising since the Court had neither the capacity to evaluate the accuracy of the medical data, nor a way to foresee the remarkable advances that would make the then-current data obsolete. 
From Dr. Jean Wright of the Egleston Children's Hospital at Emory University, we learned that the age of viability has been pushed back five weeks, from 28 to 23 weeks, since Roe was decided. We learned that surgical advances now allow surgeons to partially remove an unborn child through an incision in the womb, fix a congenital defect, and slip the `pre-viable' infant back into the womb. However, I think the most interesting thing we learned at the hearing is that unborn babies can sense pain in just the 7th week of gestation. 
Mr. President, these facts should help inform this debate. For instance: If we know the unborn can feel pain at seven weeks, why is it such a struggle to convince Senators that stabbing a six month, fully-developed and partially-delivered baby with forceps and extracting its brain is wrong? 
I realize, however, that not everyone agrees with my view on abortion. Indeed, I recognize that the American people remain deeply divided on this issue. But where there is common ground, we need to move forward and protect life. 
One issue on which there is consensus is parental consent. Most Americans agree that parents should be involved in helping their young daughters to make the critically important decision of whether or not to have an abortion. A recent CNN/USA Today survey found that 74 percent of Americans support parental consent before an abortion is performed on a girl under age 18. 
Last month, I introduced the Putting Parents First Act, which would require parental consent before a minor could obtain an abortion. Enactment of this legislation would allow Congress to protect the guiding role of parents as it protects human life. 
Today's vote--to end the cruel practice of partial birth abortion--presents another opportunity for Americans on both sides of the underlying abortion issue to find common ground. The American people agree that a procedure which takes an unborn child, one able to be sustained outside the womb, removes it partially and then kills it is so cruel, so inhumane, so barbaric as to be intolerable. Indeed, after the procedure was described for them, fully 84 percent of the American people said Congress should outlaw it. 
Mr. President, legislatures in more than 20 states have followed Congress's lead and passed laws outlawing this procedure. Two-thirds of the House of Representatives already has voted to overturn the President's veto. And when this chamber voted, more than a dozen Democrat Senators joined us in attempting to override the veto. 
Mr. President, a consensus has formed. The American people and a substantial majority of their elected representatives in Congress want to eliminate this gruesome procedure from our nation's hospitals and clinics. The will of the American people should not be thwarted by the twisted science and moral confusion that has engulfed this Administration. 
Mr. President, let me close by saying that if we are not successful today in overriding the President's veto, this will not be the end of the debate. We will come back next year and we will vote again. We will continue to vote on this issue of life and death until the voice of the American people is heard.

Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill that furthers an important object of government--promoting religious liberty and the free exercise of religion. Specifically, I rise to introduce the Equal Access Improvement Act, a bill that would ensure that benefits currently provided to non-curricular school groups and community groups be extended on a non-discriminatory basis to all groups without regard to the religious nature of the organization. 
This bill reflects and reinforces an important principle that pervades the Supreme Court's decisions concerning religious liberty--the principle of non-discrimination. The Supreme Court has recognized again and again that neutral laws that provide benefits without regard to the religious nature of recipients do not run afoul of our constitutional traditions. What is more, laws that specifically exclude religious entities from a class of beneficiaries are inconsistent with our Constitution's guarantee of the free exercise of religion. Laws that discriminate against specific religions or against religious organizations in general are incompatible with our nation's founding document and with a fundamental respect for people of faith. 
The bill would ensure that student prayer clubs are provided the same access to school facilities as other non-curricular school clubs. Our schools reflect many of the problems that plague our larger culture. Just as in the larger culture, prayer can play an inimitable role in dealing with violence, drugs, and the other challenges in the schools. Denying access to school facilities for student prayer groups, while similar groups are granted access, sends precisely the wrong message. Prayer is an answer. Prayer is not the problem. There is no reason to deny benefits to a group because they engage in prayer or because they have some other religious component. 
Nothing in this bill provides any special treatment to religious groups. The bill removes discrimination against religious groups and religious activities. It does not introduce any new discrimination in favor of religious 
groups. The bill enshrines the principal of neutrality that is at the heart of the Constitution's guarantees of religious liberty. 
The Equal Access Improvement Act builds on the work of the 98th Congress, which passed the original Equal Access Act. The bill extends those provisions to reflect subsequent Supreme Court and lower court decisions and to reflect the experience we have had with the Equal Access Act in the last fourteen years. I have consulted with organizations and individuals who have litigated cases under the Equal Access Act and incorporated many of their suggestions for improving the law. 
Specifically, the bill extends the existing law's provision ensuring equal access to meeting space to include equal access to school facilities, including expense reimbursement. Just as a school prayer club should not be denied access to a class room when it is open to the chess club, so too if the school pays to print a newsletter or pays for refreshments for one club, it should not discriminate on the basis of the religious content of the group's speech or activities. In the same way that the original Equal Access Act extended and reinforced the Supreme Court's decision in Windmar v. Vincent, 454 U.S. 263 (1981), beyond the public university context, this legislation would extend and reinforce the Supreme Court's decision in Rosenberger v. Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, 515 U.S. 819 (1995). 
The legislation also guarantees students a right to distribute literature without regard to the religious content of the literature. It guarantees access to community groups to school facilities on an equal basis without regard to the religious character of the group. Finally, the legislation extends equal access guarantees to intermediate school students. 
Let me emphasize that this bill, like the original Equal Access Act, creates no obligation for a school to provide meeting space or other facilities to any non-curriculum based group or any community group. The legislation simply provides that if a school does make its facilities available to non-curriculum based groups or to community groups, then the school cannot discriminate against other groups on the basis of the religious content of their speeches or activities. What is more, the legislation expressly preserves the ability of schools to enforce content-neutral policies denying or limiting access to all groups. 
Passage of this legislation would have many benefits. However, none more important than to reinforce the principle that nothing in the Constitution requires--or permits--the government to discriminate against groups on the basis of the religious nature of their speech or activities. As the Supreme Court recognized long ago, when the government accommodates religious practice and eliminates discrimination based on religion `it follows the best of our traditions.' Zorach v. Clauson, 343 U.S. 306, 314 (1952). I believe this bill also follows the best of our traditions, and I look forward to working toward its enactment.

Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I come to the floor for the second straight year to offer an amendment to the Interior appropriations bill. This amendment, while dealing with a relatively small amount of money--and I wince a little bit when I call the amount of money small, but in comparison to the multibillion-dollar funding bill it does address a small percentage of that bill--addresses a profound and fundamental issue that is before this body. Should the Federal Government be in the business of judging and funding art? Should the Federal Government be telling the rest of the country this is good art, or this is not good enough for the Federal Government, signaling to the rest of the country this art is superior or this art is worthy of your support while other art is not? 
While my efforts last year to eliminate funding for the National Endowment for the Arts were unsuccessful, I am compelled to continue to raise this issue, hoping to persuade my colleagues that the Federal Government should resign from its role as a national art critic. It seems to me that to have the Federal Government as an art critic which determines what type or types of art are superior to other types of art is not something that a free nation would want to encourage. Government should not be in the business of subsidizing free speech or putting its so-called `Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval' on certain pieces of so-called art. My amendment simply eliminates the $100 million appropriated by the bill to the National Endowment for the Arts, and it takes the available funds and puts them toward the renovation and preservation of our national park system. 
Since the last time we debated this issue, two relevant events have occurred regarding the National Endowment for the Arts. First, news about the play, and I quote the title here, `Corpus Christi,' which the NEA had agreed to fund, has become available; and, secondly, the Supreme Court of the United States has rendered a decision in the case of National Endowment for the Arts v. Finley. 
I would like to discuss each of these developments as well as other arguments and show how they support elimination of funding for the National Endowment for the Arts. 
The play `Corpus Christi' is merely the latest example of why we should defund the National Endowment for the Arts. 
In the last few months, we have heard a great deal about the play planned to be staged by the Manhattan Theatre Club in New York City. This play, entitled `Corpus Christi,' has generated a lot of controversy because of its content and because the National Endowment for the Arts approved a $31,000 grant to the theater to fund production of this play.

Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I rise to oppose the National Endowment for the Arts--not because I am against art, but because I favor art; not because I want to corrupt art, but because I want it to remain uncorrupted. 
Let me address some of the issues that have been raised. It was just said that we lack civility; so we need Government funding for the arts. We have seen that Government funding has frequently meant pornography, obscenity, attacks on religious faith, Mapplethorpe--I don't have to go further. 
We have had great art. We have had great civility in this country. But we have not had an increase of civility, as we have had the National Endowment for the Arts, since the 1960s. I challenge whether that is the case. 
Secondly, it was said that those who study art get better grades in school. Well, undoubtedly they do. But since the 1960s, when we started the National Endowment for the Arts, we have not seen an increase in the Scholastic Aptitude Tests, we have seen a decrease in them. Art is one thing. Federally subsidized art is another. 
It has been alleged that people are grateful for art welfare, that they come and they say, `Thank you for the art money you give us.' Well, I don't know of a single time when the Government hands out money that people don't gratefully come by and say, `Thank you for the money you give us in our community.' 
It has been alleged that the Founding Fathers such as John Adams liked art. Of course they liked art. They had better art to like in many circumstances than we do. It wasn't art corrupted by the Federal Government or a subsidy that demanded that the art be politically correct or that it be on the cutting edge of some social theory. 
The suggestion is that our founders wanted us to have great art. Yes, they did, but they didn't want it in the Constitution, and they specifically rejected authority in the Constitution to fund art. 
Let's just make it clear that the Federal Government does not need to be signaling to the art community or Americans what art is good art or what art is bad art. As a matter of fact, it even corrupts our foundations. About a year ago, the Orange County Register carried an editorial which said that so many foundations don't bother to assess what is going on anymore; they just look for where NEA is sending its grants, and they have their grants follow on. 
I think we would be better off if we urged people consuming or funding art in this country to be careful about it, to think about it in terms of its quality, to think about it in terms of its potential for greatness, to think about what it calls us to. Does it call us to greatness? The Federal Government, with its sense of politics, doesn't need to be signaling that some art is worthy, some speech is worthy, other art is unworthy, other speech is to be disregarded. 
It is not that we do not believe in art in America. All of us understand that the gifts of expression which God has given us are to be developed and they should be developed educationally and by individuals. But because art is expression and because it is related to values and because it is speech, it is inappropriate for the Government to say that some art is to be funded, some art is to be subsidized, and other art is to be disregarded, that other art is somehow unworthy and not to be provided merit. 
I believe that we will be a more civil society if we have a marketplace which determines what happens in the art community rather than a subsidy from Government. I believe we will be a well educated people, but it will be when we understand art for its value to us, not art that we receive at the hand of Government or art that becomes a part of a welfare state for the rich or for others in the community. I believe that art is an expression that ought to be regarded as an individual's choice.

Mr. ASHCROFT. Madam President, let me extend my appreciation to the senior Senator from the State of Missouri, Senator Bond, for having presenting this important resolution; and my thanks as well to the Senator from California, Senator Boxer. 
I was elated when I saw what we had all anticipated for so long--that Mark McGwire would learn uniquely how to pay the price for greatness, would achieve something that some had said could never happen. We watched and I watched in anticipation as I believe it was in the fourth inning last evening when the first pitch was, incidentally, not what I would call a home run pitch. It looked to me like it was a borderline strike zone, low and away, and Mark reached out and, on the low and away pitch, pulled the ball like a rifleshot over the wall in Busch Stadium in St. Louis. 
I stand today to commend him for his outstanding baseball. To see him and Sammy Sosa embrace and salute each other in a friendly kind of competition that brings out the very best is a story about what America really needs and ought to be--how we don't have to be, because we are opponents, enemies. Those two are opponents in most every way and in every sense of the word. But, my goodness, they are not enemies. They elevate each other's performance, and they bring out the best in each other. What a tremendous thing. 
Of course, I was so happy to see this happen in St. Louis, MO, a city whose baseball heritage is--well, frankly, it is just unparalleled; a city with baseball fans who understand the game, who know what it means to take a pitch, to hit behind the runner, to make the sacrifice. They know baseball. They know character. They saluted Mark McGwire last night, and properly so. 
I was very thrilled to see the Missouri fans be consistent in wanting to share the achievement with Mark McGwire, but not necessarily to take it from him, and the willingness of Missouri fans over and over again to give the baseballs back--to make them part of Mark's heritage and history, to make them part of the national treasure. It is kind of an inspiration at a time when some would lead us to believe that America is nothing but a place of greed. 
Too often, sports heroes themselves have participated in the idea that the memorabilia is so valuable that it is only to be sold. I think of these fans who would sort of teach some of our sports heroes lessons that the memorabilia is so valuable that it is not to be sold but it is to be shared. I salute those in St. Louis who decided that this part of American history was too valuable to be sold but it was so valuable that it ought to be shared. 
Let me make a few remarks about Mark. 
In the pictures--and I just hope the rest of America sees these pictures, if they haven't seen them--in the pictures we see a picture of what we need to be, how we need to think, and how we need to act. Perspective and balance are perhaps the most important characteristics of life. Knowing where you stand at the magic of the moment is certainly a valuable thing. Understanding where you stand in the perspective of history is a valuable thing. Having a respect for the future is a valuable thing. In just one tight little moment there on national television, as Mark McGwire finished rounding the bases, he showed us that he was a person who not only understood the magic of the moment--driving the ball over the left field wall and celebrating the incredible exhilaration and joy of that personal achievement, the crowning achievement of years of training, practice, and insistent persistence toward a goal--he understood the magic of the moment, but he also told us that he understood his place in history, because he went to the stands and he embraced the family of Roger Maris. Roger, of course, died tragically young as a result of cancer. But his family was there to understand not only his place in history but to understand that history marches on. Mark McGwire not only understood the moment but he understood his place in history. He embraced history. 
America needs again to have a lesson in embracing history, in respecting our past and understanding that it is only from the greatness of our past that we draw inspiration for surpassing events in the future. 
What a tremendous thing that picture was of Mark McGwire with those huge arms around the Roger Maris family. 
Then, perhaps as inspiring as anything else, there was the fact that when he rounded the bases and was trading high fives, really before he got into the serious commendations of the rest of his teammates, Mark picked up Matt, the future. He understood that, yes, the past is important, and the magic of the moment is to be cherished, but there is also always the future that is ahead of us. He picks up young Matt, and he elevates young Matt to a position above his father. What a tremendous picture that is. If we as Americans would have an understanding of our youngsters that we need to place them ahead of ourselves, place their interests above our interests, invest in the future, if we would, indeed, hold up our youngsters and elevate them to a place of understanding and the opportunities for greatness, what a tremendous lesson that would be. 
So I really have a degree of excitement that is difficult to contain about the tremendous lesson that we can all take out of the joy and exuberance of celebrating the achievements of one whose acts really just stun us and marvel us. 
There is just one last point. 
There were lots of people--I have been among them--who have said, `Well, Babe Ruth's record and Roger Maris' record'--Babe Ruth, if you wanted to count one game at one game level, and Roger Maris at another--`would never be broken.' I am kind of glad that Mark McGwire straightened me out on the breakability of those records, because I believe that maybe as much as anything else, Mark McGwire tells us that the best is yet to come, that every record in the book is one we should look to break, that America is not a place whose primary and monumental achievements are all behind us, but America is a place where the best is yet to come. 
Last night, Mark McGwire set a new record of 62 home runs. He might set another record the next time he bats. I am confident that he will set another record before the end of this season over and over and over again. 
I think part of the American spirit is such that we should all think about America as a place where the best is yet to come. When we learn to pay the price, maybe when we have the balance and perspective that Mark demonstrated, understanding the magic of the moment, respecting history, and having a full dedication to the fabulous future, maybe that is when we will begin to understand that the best is yet to come and we can be part of it. 
To Mark McGwire, to the fans of St. Louis, to Sammy Sosa, who happened to be there when it happened and who, with such class, saluted Mark, I say thanks for an inspiring game, which turns out to be a lesson teacher far bigger than just a game. I am delighted to commend them and thank them for the greatness that they remind us should be a part of all that America is and stands for. 
I yield the floor. 
Mr. BOND addressed the Chair.

Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I rise today to encourage my colleagues to join me in congratulating Alison Spencer Banks and Parker James Banks on the anniversary of their first birthday. It was one year ago today that their parents, Sarah and John, were blessed with the gift of life, times two. Alison and Parker will see a much different world in their lifetime, than either myself or my colleagues have witnessed in theirs. Alison and Parker will have to meet the demands of an `information' based culture and economy. 
As people of freedom reach for opportunity and achieve greatness, our nation prospers. A government that lives beyond its means and reaches beyond its limits violates our basic liberties, and the nation suffers. 
All of us assembled here in the United States Senate on this Fourth Day of September must keep in mind that the decisions we make today will shape the world that Alison, Parker, and their peers will inherit tomorrow. As elected leaders, we must teach them the values of our great democracy.

Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I wanted to take a few minutes to advise my colleagues that H.R. 2281, a bill to implement the World Intellectual Property Organization copyright treaties, has been adopted by the House, but in a substantially different form than the Senate bill to implement these treaties. The House version of the bill includes some improvements agreed to by representatives of the affected industries, but it also includes some extraneous provisions, which in some cases were negotiated without the full participation of important affected individuals. A number of my colleagues have expressed to my office their continuing interest in this legislation, and so I thought it would be helpful to provide an update on the legislative developments in the House, and to share with you some of my concerns about the many extraneous provisions added to the bill. 
On July 22, the Committee on Commerce filed its report on H.R. 2281, the Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998. In drafting the bill, the Committee used as the base text the bill approved by the Senate, and then made some substantive and clarifying changes. I understand that the Commerce Committee version of the legislation represents an agreed upon compromise by the content community and the fair use community. Moreover, I understand that these groups have agreed to support the agreement throughout the remaining process. Some aspects of this agreement concern important issues that I worked to have addressed in the Senate version of the bill. Let me describe a few of the most important aspects of the agreement. 
First, with respect to `fair use,' the Committee adopted an alternative to section 1201(a)(1) that would authorize the Secretary of Commerce to waive selectively the prohibition against the act of circumvention to prevent a diminution in the availability to individual users of a particular category of copyrighted materials. As adopted by the Senate, this section would have established a flat prohibition on the circumvention of technological protection measures to gain access to works for any purpose, and thus a system that some have described as the beginning of a `pay-per-use' society. Under the compromise embodied in the Commerce Committee's version of the bill, the Secretary of Commerce would have authority to address the concerns of libraries, educational institutions, and others potentially threatened with a denial of access to categories of works in circumstances that otherwise would be lawful today. 
Second, the Committee made an important contribution by eliminating the potential for misinterpretation of the `no mandate' provision of the bill. I had been very concerned that S. 2037 could be interpreted as a mandate on product manufacturers to design products so as to respond affirmatively to or to accommodate technological protection measures that copyright owners might use to deny access to or prevent the copying of their works. To address this potential problem, I offered an amendment providing that nothing in the bill required that the design of, or design and selection of parts and components for, a computing product, a consumer electronics, or a telecommunications product must provide for a response to any particular technological protection measures. The amendment 
reflected my belief that product manufacturers should remain free to design and produce the best available products, without the threat of incurring liability for their design decisions. Technology and engineers--not lawyers--should dictate product design. This provision reflected the working assumption that this bill is aimed fundamentally at so-called `black boxes' and not at legitimate products that have substantial non-infringing uses. The Commerce Committee has tightened this language even further making it crystal clear that nothing in this legislation should be interpreted to limit manufacturers of legitimate products with substantial non-infringing uses--such as VCRs and personal computers--in making fundamental design decisions or revisions. 
Third, as an important related matter, the Committee on Commerce reaffirmed my view that technological protection measures that cause `playability' problems may not be deemed to be `effective' under this legislation. As I pointed out in my floor speech just prior to final passage of S. 2037, `playability' problems may arise because technological protection measures may cause noticeable and recurring adverse effects on the normal operation of products. Adjustments may need to be made either in the factory or after sale to correct these playability problems. It was my view that the legislation did not make such adjustments illegal, and I was pleased to note that the Commerce Committee made this point explicit in its Committee Report. The Commerce Committee's report also included helpful language circumscribing the potential breadth of the bill by narrowly defining the types of technological protection measures that control access to, or the copying of, a work. 
In addition, the Committee of Commerce adopted specific provisions making it clear that the bill is not intended to prohibit legitimate encryption research. As my colleagues know, Senator Burns, Leahy and I have lead the effort in the Senate to ensure that U.S. business can develop, and export world-class encryption products. By explicitly fashioning an affirmative defense, the Committee has made an important contribution to our overall efforts to ensure that U.S. industry remains at the forefront in developing secure encryption methods. 
Finally, the Committee built on my efforts to ensure that this legislation would not harm the efforts of consumers to protect their personal privacy by adopting two important amendments. The first amendment would create incentives for website operators to disclose whenever they use technological protection measures that have the capability to gather personal data, and to give consumers a means of disabling them. The second amendment strengthened section 1202 of this legislation by making explicit that the term `copyright management information' does not include `any personally identifying information about a user of a work or a copy, phonorecord, performance, or display of a work.' In my view, these amendments help preserve the critical balance that we must maintain between the interests of copyright owners and the privacy interests of information users. 
In sum, the House version of the bill by and large reflects the substantial improvements proposed by the House Committee on Commerce. In his floor statement, Congressman Bliley of Virginia, made clear the importance the Committee attaches to the 
`fair use' and `no mandate' provisions included in the bill. He and others reaffirmed as well the Committee's report language with respect to the definition of technological measures and the inapplicability of the legislation to manufacturers, retailers, product servicers, and ordinary consumers when faced with playability problems caused by either protection measures or copyright management information systems. None of the Members of the Judiciary Committee present offered contrary views about these important provisions, which represent a delicate compromise agreement of the interested parties. I thus would hope we can assume that these matters have been definitively settled. 
Since the passage of the House language several issues have begun to arise that have either been caused by the drafting in the House, or as is more often the case, through the unintended consequences of outlawing technology. Perhaps the most troubling of these issues is making security system testing illegal and criminally punishable. Currently, the federal government agencies, companies, state governments, anyone with a computer system can hire professional consultants to survey and test their IT security systems for vulnerabilities. 
Two of the best known organizations that engage in this sort of consulting are Price Waterhouse Coopers and Ernst & Young, clearly two well-known and responsible corporate citizens. With the language currently in the WIPO legislation these critical services will no longer be legal. The impact will be destructive to existing businesses and to any future promise of electronic commerce. Moreover, without this type of beneficial testing, our country's critical infrastructure will be at risk from domestic and international hackers and cyber-terrorists. This effect must surely be unintended, as even those who support the current language would be at grave risk if our communications, security, and Internet systems were left without adequate protection. 
On August 4, the House adopted H.R. 2281 by voice vote. For reasons not explained on the floor, the bill contains a series of extraneous measures that have little or nothing to do with the underlying WIPO copyright treaties. I would call to the attention of my colleagues in particular sections 414, 416, and 417, as well as titles V and VI, of the bill. Unfortunately, the floor debate in the House offered little insight into the anticipated effect or scope of these provisions. They appear to have been added by the House Committee on the Judiciary, but none of the Members of the Committee described in any way the substance of these measures on the floor. 
Section 414 makes what ostensibly is only a clarifying change to section 107 of the Copyright Act. No one from the House Committee on the Judiciary, however, said a word on the floor about why this change to the `fair use' provision is necessary. 
Section 415 inhibits the continued development and the further introduction of new digital subscription music services. Again, I am left to wonder why this provision is necessary, or even whether it has been carefully considered by anyone here in the Senate. Apparently, the 1995 Act regarding digital performance rights in sound recordings was reopened to resolve ambiguous issues. What has resulted seems to be a two tiered approach to subscription service. One tier consisting of existing providers that may 
compete effectively and a second tier of providers without an up and running system who will be hobbled by many new restrictions and at a greater cost. Not surprisingly, this second group was not represented in the negotiations. 
The net result of this will be a significant advantage for incumbent providers that reflects a legislative advantage, not a competitive advantage. For those of us who believe that the market, not the government, should pick winners, this is a disturbing development. Even worse, there is a small group of companies who paid the government for spectrum based on the assumption that they could provide subscription service unencumbered, but because they have not yet provided service will now have to operate under these new, anti-competitive rules. The result is that the spectrum they purchased will have a vastly diminished value. This is precisely the type of regulatory taking that discourages and demoralizes the kind of investment and innovation the country needs to take full advantage of the promise of new technologies. 
Section 416 concerns the assumption of contractual obligations related to transfer of rights in motion pictures. No one from the House Committee on the Judiciary said a word on the floor about why this provision is necessary to WIPO implementing legislation. 
Section 417 makes what ostensibly is only a clarifying change to the first sale doctrine. No one from the House Committee on the Judiciary, however, said a word on the floor about why this change to the first sale doctrine is necessary, or what relation the provision has to a recent Supreme Court decision. Before the Senate is asked to act on any of these extraneous matters, we need to be convinced that the measures belong in this bill. 
Title V apparently sets forth the views of the House Committee on the Judiciary on how best to provide legal protection against misappropriation of collections of information such as databases. I understand that the Administration has indicated that it has serious reservations about this approach, including a concern that it may be unconstitutional. This is a matter the Senate Judiciary Committee plans to address in scheduled hearings. Until those hearings take place, I see no reason to endanger the WIPO bill with a potentially controversial issue that the full Senate Judiciary Committee has not had an opportunity to examine. 
Title VI would provide protection for certain boat hull designs. As in the case of the other extraneous provisions added in the House, no one from the House Committee on the Judiciary said a word on the floor about why this change to current law is necessary. At worst, this provision represents fundamental shift in the tradition and breadth of copyright law. At best, it is a dubious idea that was attached without discussion or consideration. The Senate should not include this extraneous matter in the WIPO bill without deliberation. 
I would hope all parties to the debate would recognize that much has been done to calibrate the WIPO copyright treaties implementing legislation. Each of us, working alone, would undoubtedly have produced a different bill. In fact, last fall I introduced a bill that I believe did a far better job of implementing the treaties and did not need dozens of carve-outs to deal with the problems created by the approach recommended by the Administration. In any event, we are now late in the session. Much important work has been done in the Senate, and I want to thank the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Judiciary Committee for working with me this spring to address my concerns with this bill. I think the House Committee on Commerce has made additional important contributions. This bill is not a perfect bill, but it is an important bill. Before taking any final action, we should eliminate the extraneous provisions in this bill, while preserving the true heart of the legislation: the WIPO legislation. However, once that analysis has been completed, I would hope we could move this legislation forward.

Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, the oath of office taken by the President of the United States is majestic and simple; as a matter of fact, it is eloquent. The President simply swears that he will faithfully execute the office, the highest office of the land, and that he will preserve, protect and defend the United States Constitution. 
In its enumeration of his duties, the Constitution of the United States directs that the President `take care that the Laws be faithfully executed.' So the President is directed by the Constitution to `take care that the Laws be faithfully executed.' The core values of American self-government are concentrated in the Presidency. 
Do we expect the President of the United States to be a patriot? Of course. Not only do we expect that from the structure of our government, we have grown to expect it because that has been established as a precedent by President after President after President. 
Do we expect the President to love freedom? To serve the people rather than to serve himself? To act with respect for the rule of law? To uphold the idea in America that there are no kings, that the highest rank in this culture is the rank of citizen? To put the institution of the Presidency above his own personal interests? I think it is fair to say that all of us would respond to those inquiries with a resounding `Yes.' We do expect that. We have high expectations. 
Do we expect the President to be truthful? Yes. To keep his solemn oath of office? Yes. Certainly. These are qualities--the love of country, the commitment to public service, the obedience and supremacy of the law--that we expect in the behavior of the President. He or she is to be a national model for honesty, integrity, and respect for the law. 
It has been shocking to me that defenders of President Clinton have begun to suggest, however, that such is not the case, that our aspirations are without foundation, that somehow we are dreaming an impossible dream to think that the President would be a model. Indeed, we are told he is not even responsible for telling us the truth. Some of his defenders have begun to suggest that lying under oath can be acceptable conduct in a President or that the President is generally above the law and that the President would not need to honor, for instance, a lawful subpoena to a grand jury--the idea that somehow the President's power is so substantial that the President would not have to respond in the event that he were called. 
Jack Quinn, former White House counsel and a friend of many in this Chamber, argues in the pages of the Wall Street Journal that the President simply is not the subject of law in the same way as other citizens in an article entitled `Clinton Can Avoid the Starr Chamber.' He argues that the President does not have to comply with a grand jury subpoena. 
As new evidence comes to light, all the President's men work to keep America in the dark. And I believe that is wrong. I believe the concept of self-government carries with it an implicit need of citizens to know what is happening in government, what the circumstances are, what the conditions are. And certainly if a person is called upon by a part of our Government to provide truthful testimony, the failure to do so is a very serious offense. 
I believe that perjury is unacceptable conduct and that it is an impeachable offense. How can it be otherwise? It is not possible to--and I am quoting the Constitution--`take care that the Laws be faithfully executed' while deliberately slighting the law against perjury. It is that simple. 
I, for one, am fascinated by the prevailing conventional wisdom that Presidential perjury would be harmless error, while suborning perjury or obstructing justice would be much worse and an impeachable offense. 
The suggestion is shocking--that somehow it is OK for the President to lie but it would not be OK for him to tell someone else to lie, that the act itself would be OK and permissible, but telling someone else to do it would be an infraction. That is an utterly false dichotomy. 
Since when is it worse to try to get someone else to lie than to tell a lie yourself? Is it worse to try to convince someone else to steal than to steal yourself? Is it worse to convince someone else to cheat on their taxes than to cheat on your own taxes? 
Being under oath and lying under oath or convincing someone else to tell a lie under oath is criminal in either case and irreconcilable with the President's constitutional oath to take care that the laws of the land be respected, honored, and enforced. 
Terrible events appear to be engulfing the Clinton Presidency. The investigation of the President raises fundamental questions about the standards we should expect from a Chief Executive of the United States. If the House of Representatives begins an impeachment inquiry, the momentous machinery of the Constitution will raise the issue of Presidential conduct and misconduct to their highest levels. 
Because the prospect of Presidential impeachment seldom troubles this blessed Nation--and we can be grateful for that--there are fundamental questions about the President's standing under the law that have never been answered definitively. 
If we had impeachment processes going on every month, month by month, year by year, in virtually every Presidency, we would have a great body of law that told us exactly how things are to be done in this situation. That is how the rules of behavior in the legal system are developed, through precedent and experience. But we really do not have major impeachment experience. 
As a matter of fact, there has been one President who has undergone that kind of inquiry in the Senate, and that was well over 100 years ago. Moreover, in more recent times, when this body has considered impeachments for a variety of other, lesser officials, we have not conducted full-scale impeachment proceedings. So there are lots of issues that surround the potential of illegal activity by a President that have not been answered; some probably have not even been asked. 
It is time to clarify these issues, I believe, before the House addresses the momentous decision of whether to open a formal inquiry. 
I think the questions need to be answered, and I believe that we can begin this important discussion about the President's obligations to comply with the normal criminal process. 
I think we can begin to develop an understanding of how this should be conducted by holding hearings over the recess in the Constitution Subcommittee of the Senate Judiciary Committee. I believe we can invite scholars in to answer questions about whether the President is subject to prosecution; whether, indeed, the President is responsible for appearing before a grand jury in response to a subpoena; what level of conduct the President must compare to; what standard can he be measured by; in the absence of measuring up, are there things that can, should, or ought to be done? 
I might point out that very shortly we will be called to reevaluate the independent counsel statute which provides a basis for individuals being investigated when the normal investigatory process would be replete with conflicts of interest. 
I noted with interest that the assistant majority leader was on the floor here in the Senate Chamber earlier today talking about the fact that the Attorney General has been implored by the Director of the FBI to appoint an independent counsel to look into, investigate, and prosecute possible violations of the criminal laws regarding political contributions. Not only has she been asked to do that by the Director of the FBI, she has been asked to do that by the person she appointed in the Justice Department to look into the matter. His recommendation to her is, according to the reports is, that she ought to appoint an independent counsel, yet she has refused. I noted that the assistant majority leader indicated that her refusal and her continued refusal would become the basis for her resignation, in his view. 
I think all of these serious questions about the accountability of high-ranking executive branch officials beg resolution and they demand discussion. It is important that we resolve them and begin to have a full awareness of these potentials as we move toward the responsibility of reauthorizing or otherwise adjusting or dealing with the concept of the independent counsel's office in the independent counsel statute. 
Perhaps there is a single open question that is more demanding than any other of the open questions, and is certainly more relevant now, it appears, more than at any other time in history: whether a sitting President is subject to the regular compulsory criminal process. 
I think, as I indicated, former White House counsel Quinn's article in the Wall Street Journal says no. When we mean regular criminal process, we have to say up to and including prosecution. So the question becomes, Can a sitting President be prosecuted if he violates the law, or is the sitting President above the law? Or is the only remedy to remove him from office through the impeachment process, and then would he be liable for prosecution or is he liable for prosecution if the Congress decides to sit on its hands? 
You can imagine a situation in which a President was favored by a group of individuals in the Congress who simply didn't want to get involved or were allies of the President politically who said, `No, there are a sufficient number of us to stop an impeachment procedure, so we won't allow it to happen.' If the President were to persist in criminal behavior, it seems to me, there is a question in that setting about whether there is any remedy. Would a President be subject to prosecution if the House turned its back on obvious--obvious--criminal infractions, simply saying, `We don't want any part of an impeachment proceeding?' 
There is a pretty high level of political discussion now that says, even in the President's opposition party, that says the Republicans might not want this President to leave office to give his Vice President a jump-start on the next election. That is something that I don't buy. I don't believe in that. I believe that if there has been a serious infraction that merits impeachment, the inquiry must take place. Even if it is on the last day and the last 20 seconds of the Presidential term--Americans ought to do what is right. But there is a lot of discussion in the culture now that even an opposition party might not want to remove a particular official. So if there isn't any other remedy, does that mean that a person is free to violate the law? I think these are important questions. 
The question, then, is whether a sitting President is subject to the regular compulsory criminal process--up to and including prosecution--or whether impeachment is the only avenue available for addressing Presidential wrongdoing? 
It is a serious question. It is a question that has been commented on by a number of individuals hypothetically in the past. In commenting on the options available to address Presidential crimes, many people seem to proceed on the assumption that the impeachment process is the exclusive avenue for addressing Presidential misconduct. Judge Bork reached this conclusion many years ago when the Justice Department considered the options for prosecuting Vice President Agnew. But Judge Bork's view is hardly the unanimous view of legal scholars. 
For example, Professor Gary McDowell has argued that the independent counsel does have the capacity to indict a sitting President. In the Wall Street Journal of March 9, 1998, Professor McDowell, who is a director of the Institute of the United States Studies at the University of London, says yes, in a rather well-written piece, yes, you can indict the President. Jack Quinn says, `Clinton can avoid the Starr Chamber,' basically saying you can't. 
Perhaps the most well-known constitutional scholar in America with whom I sometimes agree and with whom I often disagree is Professor Larry Tribe. Now, Lawrence Tribe, in his `American Constitutional Law' text, admits that the question must be regarded as an open one, saying that, with respect to whether or not you can proceed against a President in a criminal proceeding, `the question must be regarded as an open one, but the burden should be on those who insist that a President is immune from criminal trial prior to impeachment and removal from office.' 
Interesting. That is one of the most noted constitutional legal scholars in the United States saying that while he thinks the question is an open one, that those who want to say that there is immunity here have the real burden of making the case. 
This is a constitutional question of the highest order. The answer provides insights into whether the President is subject to the criminal laws applicable to the citizenry of America. The answer also informs whether a popular President--or a President whose party has a secure congressional majority or a President whose value to other individuals in office would make them reluctant to involve themselves in impeachment proceedings--could ever be held accountable for violations of the law. 
Perhaps early in a term a President is alleged to have done something, does the statute of limitations run, and if it runs before the term is over and the Congress decides to turn its head, does that mean there is absolutely no requirement that the President adhere to the law, respond to the law, be involved and uphold the law in the same way as other citizens are? 
I think these questions are very serious questions, and they are questions that demand resolution. I think an inquiry is important to begin the process of resolving these questions. 
There are also important subsidiary questions about whether the President is subject to a criminal process that should be examined. On August 17, the Nation will witness the spectacle of a sitting President providing grand jury testimony. 
He is going to do it pursuant to a negotiated agreement. The President will appear, but he is going to be available for questions for a single day and will have the benefit of legal counsel. By doing so, by agreeing, he has deferred a legal resolution of these issues. I am, frankly, happy that the President has decided, at least in this measure, to make himself available. This negotiated agreement for the President to appear for a single day has deferred a confrontation over the ultimate constitutional question of whether a sitting President must comply with a grand jury subpoena. But this question may not go away. 
In the event that a single day proves insufficient, for example, to resolve all the questions that Judge Starr has for the President, this unresolved question could resurface. 
The importance of this question also goes beyond the context of this particular dispute over alleged Presidential perjury, or a series of other alleged Presidential acts relating to perjury and obstruction of justice. I have here an opinion piece by one of President Clinton's former White House counsels, Jack Quinn--to which I have referred already--in which Mr. Quinn argues that the President is not obligated to comply with the ordinary criminal process and is free to ignore a grand jury subpoena--to simply say: I don't participate in enforcing the law. If I have information about a crime that might have been committed, or evidence about it, I don't have to do that, I am the President. 
That is a sweeping proposition, and I think it is one that the Congress should examine, particularly as we move toward the possible reauthorization of the Independent Counsel Act. I plan to bring in a number of constitutional scholars to address these critical issues and these yet unanswered questions. 
Frankly, I do not mean to prejudge these issues. However, they are too important to leave unexamined. The answers to these questions may well inform the progress of Judge Starr's investigation and shape the difficult question of what the House should do if a report from Judge Starr does not arrive until the eve of adjournment. 
The events of the past 6 months have raised many novel questions about the scope of the powers and privileges of the President. These are important questions and they are not easy to resolve. And in our system of separated powers, the answers to these questions also determine the scope and the power of Congress, and they will also determine, in some measure, the scope and the power of protection offered to the people. The answers will determine whether the people deserve to be protected by virtue of prosecuting those who offend the law even if Congress chooses not to be involved in proceedings which it had the opportunity to pursue, like impeachment. Congress cannot be a mere bystander in these debates. Congress has an important responsibility to use its investigatory functions to shed light on these important and unresolved questions. It is time for Congress to stop looking at the polls and to start looking at the Constitution. 
I hope these hearings will provide important insights into the extent to which the President must comply with criminal process. I believe every other American has the responsibility to comply, and it is a serious question to determine whether or not the President has the responsibility of being a citizen, as well as being the President. So I look forward to sharing this discussion with other members of the Constitution Subcommittee and to chairing these hearings to help clarify these issues at a time when we need this clarity, either in reformulating our view on the independent counsel statute, or as it relates to events that are unfolding at the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue. I believe that a discussion of these issues will advance our capacity to understand the appropriate balance that is necessary for the maintenance of freedom and the responsibilities that come with the privileges that we enjoy as free people. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to thank Senator Coats, the Chairman of the Labor Committee's Subcommittee on Children and Families, for the excellent work he has done in drafting legislation to reauthorize the Community Services Block Grant, which recently passed in the Senate. The CSBG program is intended to fight poverty and alleviate its effects on people and their communities. Through these block grants, federal money is given to the states and local communities to create programs that help low-income people secure employment, get an adequate education, make better use of their available income, obtain and maintain adequate housing, and ultimately achieve self-sufficiency. 
These block grants free states and local communities of federal red tape and give them the flexibility they desire to initiate programs that meet the needs of people who need help. As a former governor, I learned that state and local governments are far more effective in serving local communities than Washington's bureaucracy. 
Further, Community Services Block Grants provide opportunities for the government to partner with the non-governmental sector to provide a variety of services to the poor. I am grateful that Senator Coats has led a bipartisan effort to include within this reauthorization bill language that can expand the opportunities for charitable and faith-based organizations to serve their communities with CSBG funds. The provisions included will help faith-based organizations to maintain their religious character and integrity when providing social services with government funds. 
For years, America's charities and churches have been transforming shattered lives by addressing the deeper needs of people--by instilling hope and values which help change behavior and attitudes. As a matter of sound public policy, we in Congress need to find ways to allow these successful organizations to unleash the cultural remedy that our society so desperately needs. Senator Coats' legislation reauthorizing the Community Services Block Grant will help to further this goal. 
The language in this bill regarding charitable and faith-based providers is similar to my Charitable Choice provision contained in the welfare reform law which we passed two years ago, but it does contain some differences. For non-governmental organizations wishing to participate in both the Community Service Block Grant and the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families programs, the differences between the two provisions may cause some confusion and lead to additional administrative burdens. 
This situation demonstrates the need to pass legislation that applies the same Charitable Choice language to all federally funded social service programs in which the government is authorized to use nongovernmental organizations to provide services to beneficiaries. Under my Charitable Choice Expansion Act, which I introduced in May of this year, uniform protections and guidelines would apply to faith-based entities using federal dollars to provide housing, substance abuse prevention and treatment, juvenile services, seniors services, abstinence education, and child welfare services, as well as services under the Community Development Block Grant, the Social Services Block Grant, and of course, the Community Services Block Grant. One uniform Charitable Choice provision will certainly make it easier for both the government and faith-based organizations to work together more efficiently to help our nation's needy. 
Again, I thank Senator Coats and all the members of the Labor Committee, as well as their staff, for their hard work on this legislation, and I commend them for their decision to include provisions that invite the greater participation of charitable and faith-based providers in the Community Services Block Grant program. I hope that we in the Senate will continue working together to pursue legislative proposals that encourage successful non-governmental organizations to expand their life-transforming programs to serve our nation's poor and needy.

Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to reaffirm the vital role parents play in the lives of their children. My legislation, the Putting Parents First Act, will guarantee that parents have the opportunity to be involved in their children's most important decisions--whether or not to have an abortion and whether or not to receive federally-subsidized contraception. 
The American people have long understood the unique role the family plays in our most cherished values. As usual, President Reagan said it best. Within the American family, Reagan said, `the seeds of personal character are planted, the roots of public value first nourished. Through love and instruction, discipline, guidance and example, we learn from our mothers and fathers the values that will shape our private lives and public citizenship.' 
The Putting Parents First Act contains two distinct provisions to protect the role of parents in the important life decisions of their minor children. The first part ensures that parents are given every opportunity to be involved in a child's decision whether or not to have an abortion. Specifically, the Act prohibits any individual from performing an abortion upon a woman under the age of 18 unless that individual has secured the informed written consent of the minor and a parent or guardian. In accordance with Supreme Court decisions concerning state-passed parental consent laws, the Putting Parents First Act allows a minor to forego the parental involvement requirement where a court has issued a waiver certifying that the process of obtaining the consent of a parent or guardian is not in the best interests of the minor or that the minor is emancipated. 
For too long, the issue of abortion has polarized the American people. To some extent, this is the inevitable result of vastly distinct views of what an abortion is. Many, including myself, view abortion as the unconscionable taking of innocent human life. Others, including a majority of Supreme Court Justices, view abortion as a constitutionally-protected alternative for pregnant women. 
There are, however, a few areas of common ground where people on both sides of the abortion issue can agree. One such area of agreement is that, whenever possible, parents should be involved in helping their young daughters to make the critically important decision of whether or not to have an abortion. A recent CNN/USA Today survey conducted by the Gallup Organization found that 74 percent of Americans support parental consent before an abortion is performed on a girl under age 18. Even those who do not view an abortion as a taking of human life recognize it as a momentous and 
life-changing decision that a minor should not make alone. The fact that nearly 40 states have passed laws requiring doctors to notify or seek the consent of a minor's parents before performing an abortion also demonstrates the consensus in favor of parental involvement. 
The instruction and guidance of which President Reagan spoke are needed most when children are forced to make important life decisions. It is hard to imagine a decision more fundamental in our culture than whether or not to beget a child. Parental involvement in this crucial decision is necessary to ensure that the sanctity of human life is given appropriate consideration. There are few more issues deserving of our attention than promoting parental involvement. 
Only half of the 39 states with parental involvement laws on the books currently enforce them. Some states have enacted laws that have been struck down in state or federal courts while in other states the executive department has chosen not to enforce the legislature's will. As a result, just over 20 states have parental laws in effect today. In these states, parents do not have the right to be involved in their minor children's most fundamental decisions, decisions that can have severe physical and emotional health consequences for young women. 
Moreover, in those states where laws requiring consent are on the books and being enforced, those laws are frequently circumvented by pregnant minors who cross state lines to avoid the laws' requirements. Sadly, nowhere is this problem more apparent than in my home state of Missouri. I was proud to have successfully defended Missouri's parental consent law before the Supreme Court in Planned Parenthood versus Ashcroft. Unfortunately, the law has not been as effective as I had hoped. A study last year in the American Journal of Public Health found that the odds of a minor traveling out of state for an abortion increased by over 50 percent after Missouri's parental consent law went into effect. 
The limited degree of enforcement and the ease with which state laws can be evaded demand a national solution. The importance of protecting life demands a national solution. It is time for Congress to act. Requiring a parent's consent before a minor can receive an abortion is one way states have chosen to protect not only the role of parents and the health and safety of young women, but also, the lives of the unborn. Congress shares with the states the authority--and duty--to protect life under the Constitution. Thus, enactment of a federal parental consent law will allow Congress to protect the guiding role of parents as it protects human life. 
The Putting Parents First Act is based on state statutes that already have been determined to be constitutional by the U.S. Supreme Court. The legislation establishes a minimum level of parental involvement that must be honored nationwide. It does not preempt state parental involvement laws that provide additional protections to the parents of pregnant minors. 
The second part of the Putting Parents First Act extends the idea of parental involvement to the arena of federally-subsidized contraception. Currently, the federal government funds many different programs through the Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Education that can provide prescription contraceptive drugs and devices, as well as abortion referrals, to minors without parental consent. 
The case of the little girl from Crystal Lake, IL is just one example, but it makes clear everything that is wrong with current law in this area. In that case, the young girl was just 14 years old when her 37-year-old teacher brought her to the county health department for birth control injections. He wanted to continue having sex with her, but had grown tired of using condoms. A county health official injected the young girl with the controversial birth control drug Depo-Provera without notifying the girl's parents. The teacher knew that federal Title X rules prohibited clinics from notifying parents when issuing birth control drugs to minors. He continued to molest her for 18 months until the girl finally broke down and told her parents. The teacher was arrested and sentenced to ten years in prison. The young girl spent five days a week in therapy and is still recovering from effects of anorexia nervosa. 
Although the teacher's crime was unspeakable, it was the federal government's policy that allowed him to shield his crime for so long. This is an outrage. The policy of the Government of the United States should be to help parents to help their children. Providing contraceptives and abortion referrals to children without involving parents undermines, not strengthens the role of parents. Worse yet, it jeopardizes the health of children. 
The current law for federally-funded contraceptives puts bureaucrats in front of parents when it comes to a child's decision-making process. That is intolerable. We must put parents first when it comes to such critical decisions. The legislation I am introducing today restores common sense to government policy by requiring programs that receive federal funds to obtain a parent's consent before dispensing contraceptives or referring abortion services to the parent's minor child. 
In my view, Mr. President, sound and sensible public policy requires that parents be involved in critical, life-shaping decisions involving their children. A young person whose life is in crisis may be highly anxious, and may want to take a fateful step without their parents' knowledge. But it is at these times of crisis that children need their parents, not government bureaucrats or uninvolved strangers. This legislation will strengthen the family and protect human life by ensuring that parents have the primary role in helping their children when they are making decisions that will shape the rest of their lives.

Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill that addresses a critical problem that demands immediate attention from the Congress. 
For many years now I have been involved with a variety of issues that affect the technology sector. As I have said before, no other sector of the economy is as vibrant and forward looking. The ingenuity, drive and vision of this industry should be a model for all of us, including those of us in the Senate. Moreover, the importance of this industry should only grow in the coming years. However, as I look to the future with the hope of seeing the next century stamped `Made in America' I see one large impediment--the Year 2000 bug. 
The 105th Congress must consider this problem and assist the country in trying to avoid a potentially disastrous crisis. We cannot wait for disaster to strike. We must act now to enable companies to avert the crisis. No individual will be left untouched if the country fails to address this problem and experiences widespread ramifications. No company will escape huge costs if they cannot successfully fix their own problems and have some assurances that their business partners and suppliers have fixed their problems. A great deal of effort has been undertaken to bring attention to this problem, including several efforts here in the U.S. Senate. However, it is now time to move beyond simply highlighting the problem. We need to roll up our sleeves and get to work on a solution. 
I begin today to lay out my plan for assisting individuals and businesses to walk safely through the minefield called the Y2K problem. The first part of this overall plan is the Year 2000 Enhanced Cooperation Solution. This legislation provides a very narrow exemption to the antitrust laws if and when a company is engaged in cooperative conduct to alleviate the impact of a year 2000 date failure in hardware or software. The exemption has a clear sunset and expressly ensures that the law continues to prohibit anti-competitive conduct such as boycotts or agreements to allocate markets or fix prices. 
This simple, straightforward proposal is critical to allowing for true cooperation in an effort to rectify the problem. No company can solve the Y2K problem alone. Even if one company devises a workable solution to their own problems they still face potential disaster from components provided by outside suppliers. What is more, when companies find workable solutions we certainly want to provide them with every incentive to disseminate those solutions as widely as possible. Cooperation is essential. But without a clear legislative directive, potential antitrust liability will stand in the way of cooperation. We must provide our industries with the appropriate incentives and tools to fix this problem without the threat of antitrust lawsuits based on the very cooperation we ought to be encouraging. 
I do want to be very clear on one point--as important as it is that this legislation be enacted and enacted soon, it is merely the first piece of a difficult puzzle. The 
Administration has presented the Congress with their view of how information sharing on the Y2K problem should be furthered. Based on my initial review, that proposal appears to be headed in the right direction but falls far short of the target destination. Most importantly, the proposed approach which purports to promote information sharing does not accomplish its objective as it leaves the problem of potential antitrust liability. In other words, it does not accomplish the task that it set out to complete. 
I will seek the introduction of the second piece of the solution, the Year 2000 Enhanced Information Solution, which while working within the guidelines of the Administration's language will add the teeth, make clear that good faith disclosure of information will be protected, and provide for protection of individual consumers. Together with the antitrust legislation I introduce today, this should provide sufficient protection to promote the kind of cooperation that will be essential to addressing this looming problem. 
The final piece of the package will be the Year 2000 Litigation Solution. Real harm from inadequate efforts to address this problem must be compensated. However, we cannot allow the prospect of frivolous litigation to block efforts to avoid such harm. We also must ensure that frivolous litigation over the Y2K problem does not consume the lion's share of the next millennium. While it is not possible for Congress to guarantee that private individuals and companies will be able to solve the Y2K problem, Congress can eliminate legal obstacles that stand in the way of private solutions. Information regarding existing software and known problems must be shared as completely and openly as possible. The current fear of litigation and liability that imposes a distinct chilling effect on information sharing must be alleviated. 
Resources to address the Y2K problem, particularly time, are finite. They must be focused as fully as possible on remediation, rather than on unproductive litigation. Moreover, the availability of adequate development and programming talent may hinge upon a working environment that protects good faith remediation efforts from the threat of liability for their work. Congress must prevent a fiasco where only lawyers win. 
I look forward to working with those that are interested as this process moves forward. I believe that this Congress cannot wait to address this problem. This issue is about time, and we have precious little left in this Congress and before the Y2K problem is upon us. I hope we can work together to free up talented individuals to address this serious problem.

Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, families are the cornerstone of America. Individuals from strong families contribute to the society. In an era when nearly half of all couples married today will see their union dissolve into divorce, I believe it is both instructive and important to honor those who have taken the commitment of `till death us do part' seriously, demonstrating successfully the timeless principles of love, honor, and fidelity. These characteristics make our country strong. 
For these important reasons, I rise today to honor Lonnie and Regina Wright of Goshen, Arkansas, who on August 4, 1998, will celebrate their 50th wedding anniversary. My wife, Janet, and I look forward to the day we can celebrate a similar milestone. The Wrights' commitment to the principles and values of their marriage deserves to be saluted and recognized.

Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I rise to support this amendment, the Brownback-Ashcroft amendment, to eliminate the marriage penalty in the Tax Code. I do so with a sense of enthusiasm. 
As I have had the opportunity to engage citizens in my home State of Missouri, or whether I am in some other location, I have found, and I do find on a regular basis, that people understand that the most important component of this culture is not its Government in Washington, DC. It is not even the governments that we find in the State capitals of the United States. The best and most important component of governing America is to be found in families. As a matter of fact, I had the privilege of saying on this floor several weeks ago that if moms and dads in America can do their job, governing America will be easy. But if moms and dads in America can't do their job, governing America will be impossible. 
I think this is an understanding that we share and is shared from Boston to Brooklyn to Bozeman. It doesn't matter what town you are in, people understand that the future, the success, the survival of this Republic in the next century is probably more related to whether or not we have successful families than any other single component of what happens in this society. Sure, it is important what we do in Congress. Sure, it is important what happens on Wall Street. But what happens on Main Street and on Elm Street and in the subdivisions of America where families exist, where families work to transmit values from one generation to the next, in an institution which has long been revered and always will be revered, an institution which shapes the character of our culture--that is what is truly important. 
As I rise to support this amendment that would eliminate the attack on the family that is leveled by our Tax Code, I do so with a sense that this elimination is long overdue. If we really want to be successful in the future--and I think that is the business of government, helping create an environment in which individuals can succeed and in which institutions can succeed-- 
there are lots of reasons to think we are here. But I think we simply want to build a setting in which we have the right conditions for people to flourish, for people to grow, for people to reach the maximum of the potential that God has placed within them. If we are going to do that, we need to do things that encourage structures like the family, instead of attack structures like the family. 
The marriage penalty attack is really not just on the family, but it attacks the core institution of the family. A marriage is what a family is built around. It is built on the durable, lasting, legally sanctioned, and enforced commitment of individuals to be together and to help each other as long as they live. There aren't very many things that work that way in our culture. There are a few things they claim to have lifetime guarantees on, and the like. But I don't think there are any institutions that are quite as lasting and helpful, which really strengthen our culture as effectively as families do. 
You can get products that say they are guaranteed for life. I was amused by the fellow who said he was running a parachute company. Somebody asked, `Are they any good?' He said, `We guarantee them for life.' I don't know if we would be particularly impressed with that. But the family is focused on and built on marriage, which is designed to be a lasting, durable relationship, sanctioned by law. I think we should do what we can to foster it, since it is most likely to be the thing that provides the basis for our success. This isn't something new, as a matter of fact, in our culture. 
America hasn't been great because we had great government or because we had great business; we have had greatness in America because of the hearts of the people. Alexis de Tocqueville, about 160 years ago, came here from France to try to assess what is it about this country that makes it dynamic, that makes this country something that is catching the eye of the entire world. He wrote back--and I have to paraphrase--that he didn't find the greatness of America in the Halls of Congress, but he found it in the homes of the people. He didn't find it in politics; he found it in pulpits. He was really saying that the greatness of America is something that is resident in the values and character of America. He focused on the fact that that happens down beneath the big, overarching concerns of Government, found in the institution that is singularly identified as the most important institution in our culture--the family. 
So it is no wonder that people raise their eyebrows when they finally learn what is happening to the family as a result of the Tax Code. I support this effort to eliminate the penalty that the Tax Code imposes on people when they get married. I commend the Senator from Kansas for his outstanding recounting and relating the individual details of the couple from Montana and another couple from Indiana, and different people around the country, who have written to say, for goodness' sake, stop penalizing us and making it impossible for us to really make the kind of marriage that we want to have, making Government attack marriage through the Tax Code. 
Frankly, American policy should reflect the principles of the American people. It is time, instead of our policy attacking the principles, to reinforce the principles. One principle is that we don't want to say to people: Don't get married. We don't want to say that we will make it more expensive to get married, we will fine you or penalize you. We want to say: Look, we think marriage is a good thing, and we understand that the values that are transmitted in marriages, the character that is formed there, is the basis for societal success, not only in this but the next century. We want to encourage it. 
So it is time for us to get out our eraser, if you will, and to return America to a tax policy that does not discriminate against marriage. I say `return' America, because we haven't always had a discriminatory policy against marriage. But the marriage penalty began to creep into our tax law a couple of decades ago. Its onerous, negative impact on this most important institution is really a scar on the body politic, and it is a wound that we can ill afford to allow to deepen. We must close this wound and restore this culture to the kind of health that has made America great. 
Last April, a group of like-minded Senators and I, including the good Senator from Kansas, Senator Brownback, and others, stated our intention to oppose the Senate's budget resolution, unless meaningful tax cuts were added. We have noted that the United States of America is now charging people to live here more than we have ever charged people to live here before--the highest tax rates in history. Our Government is charging more. We are taking more of people's money for Government, leaving less of people's money for themselves and their families than ever before in the history of the country. 
For some, I guess, who like Government and prefer not to make their own decisions about how they live and want to have a bureaucrat buy for them what is to be purchased in the less than efficient system known as `Government,' that might be OK. But to me, I am shocked. Why in the world should we be paying the highest taxes in history when we are not at war? As a matter of fact, the highest taxes have not even gone to support defense. I think a number of us are a little bit alarmed about the condition of the Nation's defense. We have slashed the defense budget. We have curtailed it immeasurably to the point where I am not sure we are ready to prepare ourselves. We have skyrocketed other bureaucratic spending in Government. While we have slashed the spending of the defense establishment, we have also slashed the capacity of families to spend their own money. So we are rocking along at the highest tax rates in history, and it is peacetime. 
So last April, a group of us said we were not going to vote for a budget from this Senate, unless we put meaningful potentials for tax relief in that budget. We were promised that eliminating the marriage penalty would be the Senate's top priority for 1998. The leadership of the Senate promised us we would not only have an opportunity to try to reduce taxes substantially and significantly--not the $30 billion gesture over 5 years--incidentally, $30 billion over 5 years would buy about one cup of coffee per month per person, if you left a little tip. That is really not tax relief. 
So here we are; today is July 29 and there are only 31 legislative days left in the session. Yet, we are not any closer to giving the American people tax cuts than we were 3 months ago. I have led the mini revolt against the budget in order to get real potentials for tax relief on the table. I believe it is time for us to say we need real tax relief, and the marriage penalty would be the brightest and best opportunity to provide tax relief that not only reduces taxes, but it would begin to align the policy of the United States with the principles of the American people. Of course, that embracing principle that everybody understands is the need for strong families. 
Now, to add insult to injury--I don't know whether it is an insult or not--but the Congressional Budget Office came out with new numbers on the projected Government surplus. Here the Senate had agreed that we would do $30 billion, maybe, in tax cuts. The Congressional Budget Office just announced in the last 10 days that the projected surplus is over $520 billion. Wait a second--$30 billion to let the people have, which they earned, and we were going to take the other $490 billion and spend it, in spite of the fact that we were already taxing people at the highest rates in history. I wonder about that. 
So we have come forward today. I thank Senator Brownback and Senator Hutchison for sponsoring this kind of legislation. I am honored to be a person who is helping organize this approach to say we need substantial and significant tax relief. We are not asking that we take the entire $520 billion. We are not even asking that we take a majority. But we are asking that at least the onerous affront to the values of the American people, this attack on marriages, be taken from our Tax Code. 
It would cost about $151.3 billion, I think, to do this over 5 years. So, if you subtract that from the $520 billion, you could figure out that you still have about $360 billion over the next 5 years. That is an amazing sum. 
We are not even asking for 1 out of 3 dollars, or what would be equivalent to 1 out of 3 dollars, of the surplus to say leave it in the pockets of people who work hard to earn it. Don't sweep that money away to be spent by the bureaucracy. And, for heaven's sake, let's not send a signal to people, don't get married in this culture, don't begin to form the basis for this most important institution of America. We need to say, indeed, we want marriages; we want intact families; we want the lasting, durable--yes, legally recognized--formal commitments of marriage upon which to build our family. 
We stand here at the end of July on the heels of a month-long recess coming up in August. And there is a real possibility that Congress will not pass a budget reconciliation and will not deliver on the tax cut that was promised to the American people. We ought to shout at the top of our lungs, `No, no.' We do not want to miss this opportunity, with this substantial capacity in our system, to begin to grant relief to the people, especially to have a cease-fire on American marriages. It is time for us to declare peace instead of declaring war on the principles of the American people when it comes to tax policy. We need a tax policy that represents the people's principles. Let's declare peace in terms of our policy on marriage. 
Mr. President, our society has affirmed the importance of marriage and family for a long time. Most Americans would agree that persistent, durable marriages and strong families are absolutely necessary if we are to succeed as a nation in the 21st century. Yet, for 30 years--nearly 30 years--in the last three decades politicians have idly watched as the Federal Income Tax Code has systematically penalized millions of people for having been married. In fact, this last year, 42 million married taxpayers collectively paid $29 billion--that is with a `b,' not with an `m'--$29 billion more in taxes than they would have paid had they been single. 
I find it important for me to once in a while review what $1 billion means. 
We all know that $1 million is a lot of money. One billion dollars is 1,000 million dollars. So we have 29,000 billion dollars in tax penalty because people are married. When you boil that down to what it means to the average marriage penalty for a family what this tax anomaly, this tax assault, is, it turns out that is about $1,400 per family. I have to say that is about $1,400 of after-tax income. If you relieve them of that, that is actually spendable money. In order to have a spendable result of about $1,400 of more money for a family to spend, I think you have to allow in terms of a salary of about $2,000. So this would give those families about a $2,000 increase in their wages, or about $1,400 in spendable income. 
Or, another way, that is well over $100 a month that families could either add to their payments for better housing, they could add to their budget for better nutrition, they could add to their clothing budget so that their children could be better clothed and that they could be better clothed. This is $1,400 they could use to promote things that are beneficial to the community. 
Yet here we have this marriage penalty that sweeps that $1,400 right off the kitchen table at budget time merely because these individuals are married. 
I believe this marriage penalty is a grossly unfair assault on the bedrock of our culture and civilization. As a matter of fairness, principle, and public policy, Congress should put an end to the Tax Code discrimination against marriage. The marriage penalty exists today because Congress legislated ill-advised changes to the Tax Code in the late 1960s. Fortunately, eliminating the marriage penalty simply requires Congress to amend the code. 
I want to just mention that the marriage penalty tax has a pretty substantial negative impact on women. It hurts marriages when their income is equivalent to their husband's income. When their income is equivalent, it hurts them most of all. We enact policies to help women in the workplace, yet we have a Tax Code which penalizes those women once they earn income that is comparable to that of their spouse. There is significant evidence that such tax consequences have a direct impact on women's labor participation choices. People make judgments based on these taxes. 
We have already heard from our good friend, the Senator from Kansas. As a matter of fact, he stated that single people are living together in a way that many of them feel bad--disappointed their families, set bad examples for the communities--and they didn't want to do this. 
The amendment which Senator Brownback, Senator Grams, and Senator Inhofe, Senator Smith of New Hampshire, and Senator Hutchison have proposed would eliminate the marriage penalty. And, of course, I am proposing it with them by allowing husbands and wives to split incomes as equivalent and filing as if both were single. 
Over the next 5 years, the Federal Government is expected to collect $9.6 trillion in revenues. Eliminating the marriage penalty will reduce that total by 1.6 percent, and that is less than a third of the projected surplus. That is, the surplus is expected to be $520 billion. That is money in excess of what we expect to spend. If we continue to make plans to spend it, we ought to make plans to give it back at least to curtail the marriage penalty. 
There is no excuse for withholding tax relief from American families, especially tax relief that is necessary to allow them to continue to be American families. We have no reason to continue to punish Americans with a Tax Code that is designed to make it tough for them to be family. For years Washington has told taxpayers, `You send it, we spend it.' We ought to change that. It is time for a new message to be sent to America. It should be, `You earned it, we returned it.' 
I rise today to say that I find it unconscionable that the policy of the United States would be an assault on the principles of the American people, especially a sacred principle of American families that are built on the core institution of marriage, and that this Government, frankly, should hang its head in shame to think that it has agreed to spend the money of individuals and that it would not provide relief from this war on the principles of America called the `marriage penalty.' 
In my judgment, we have but one alternative, especially in the face of the kind of projected surplus which we have before us. That opportunity is to say that we are going to declare peace when it comes to the American family, and we are going to tell people that, `We will not penalize you any longer because you have chosen to be married; as a matter of fact, we are going to provide a way for you to enjoy the same kind of treatment under the Tax Code that you would have if you were to have remained single.' 
The end of the 105th Congress is coming quickly upon us. I call upon my colleagues to join me for the elimination of the marriage penalty once and for all.

You wonder in how many marriages the stress would be relieved enough that some of that financial friction that eventually sometimes flares into the flame which consumes the marriage, and burns down the house, could just be avoided.

I wonder if the Senator from Kansas is aware of the fact that among people who are concerned about the culture, they have not only been concerned about families that are dissolved, and the divorce problem that we have, but the absence of family formation, the fact that there are lower rates of marriage than people had anticipated, than we have had in the past. I wonder, if given that situation, which individuals who have studied our culture are concerned about, I wonder if the Senator from Kansas might comment on whether or not the fact that we have a penalty on a number of people taxwise if they enter a marriage, if that might affect this challenge to our culture where we have had lower rates of individuals getting married?

Mr. ASHCROFT. It occurs to me what you are saying, because families have begun to replace welfare in a number of settings, they have done a better job and people are becoming independent; that the number of people on welfare is going down, and when the number of people on welfare goes down, the cost to government goes down. 
It seems to me that as these costs go down, when families begin to do their jobs and do them well, we ought to share some of the reduced costs of government with families by reducing the cost of families so that we can actually--and I wonder, if you will agree that since families are helping us reduce the cost of government by reducing the cost of welfare, if you agree that it might be appropriate for us, given the fact that families are helping us in this respect, to say to families, `and thank you very much, and we would like to reduce your costs now that you are helping us reduce ours.'

Mr. ASHCROFT. I rise to speak further in support of the elimination of the marriage penalty. Some people have asked, `Well, isn't there also a marriage bonus, or isn't there a situation in which people might do better because they are married than if they're not married?' And there are areas of the Tax Code where some individuals do slightly better, but they are supported by very sound logic. I would like to talk for a few moments about them, those instances. 
I indicate that in no way do I think that the existence of this so-called `marriage bonus' in some places in the Tax Code--that that bonus really is any reason why we should impose a penalty in some other area of the Tax Code. As a matter of fact, there are sound reasons for us to support the concept of the marriage bonus where it exists. 
Currently, the standard deduction for a single person is $4,150, while the standard deduction for a married couple filing jointly is only $6,900. I did not major in mathematics, but I did one time have the privilege of serving as the State auditor. I can add $4,150 twice; that would be $8,300. And when you put the $8,300 that you would get for two single people together, and you look at the $6,900 deduction that you get for a married couple filing jointly, you clearly understand there is a $1,400 deduction that simply does not exist. 
The marriage penalty elimination amendment that Senator Brownback and I, and others, including the majority leader, have offered today will increase the standard deduction for a married couple to equal twice what it is for singles--that would be the $8,300 figure. 
Now the Government rationale for the difference in deduction for singles and married couples is to reduce the so-called marriage bonus that occurs when only one spouse works. So the idea is, why should a spouse get a full deduction if the spouse isn't actually in the workforce? I think that sort of partakes of a myth that we ought to disabuse ourselves of and that I think most people understand. The suggestion that if someone works outside the home they are working, but if someone isn't working outside the home they are not working--I don't think that is really the case. 
I think what we really indicate is not so much a bonus if we give a deduction for the person who is nonworking outside the home but stays home, it is a recognition of the substantial contribution that the nonemployed spouse makes to the family. 
We have had a pretty substantial experience with marriage in my household. There are three decades plus that my wife and I have been married. There have been times when both of us have been employed, times when only my wife was employed, times when only I was employed. I think in every one of those instances to ignore the sort of contribution that the nonemployed spouse makes to the work product, even of the employed spouse and of the household, would be a tremendous injustice. 
I think what we really have, instead of the so-called marriage bonus, is just a recognition of the fact that the nonemployed, in-a-formal-sense, spouse is contributing to the income that comes to that household by virtue of the capacity that is expanded to the other spouse who is employed and by virtue of the expanded well-being of the family. American families need help from the ever-increasing tax load which we are imposing on them. Men who stay at home or women who stay at home to care for the children should not be penalized by the Tax Code. 
I have been somewhat distressed in recent years that we have begun to extend this myth and to provide incentives for people not to stay at home, to have a prejudice against people who would stay at home. Our Government policy should work in favor of children, not against them. Sometimes when we have a massive tax prejudice in favor of both parents leaving the house, that is not in the best interests of children. I think most of the data we have seen in recent years is that children really thrive when they have the attention of parents, and, obviously, if you have one of the parents who can stay at home, it really helps children significantly. 
Our current Tax Code rewards the dependent child tax credit for families who put their children in child care, for example, and, therefore, provides an incentive for people to institutionalize their children rather than to care for them in the home. A mother who stays at home with her child makes the sacrifice in the total combined paycheck for the family and for her career, perhaps, or the father who does the same, should that family be penalized? I think the answer is clearly no. As a matter of fact, that person may be doing our culture a great favor by providing attention from a loving, compassionate parent in a way that no institution would be able to provide attention or training for that child. 
The Tax Code should acknowledge that contributions made by spouses who stay at home, be they male or female--and we have done it both ways in my household from time to time; there have been times when my wife was the earner and I was either doing something at home or running for office or the like--and either way, we should acknowledge that the contributions by the so-called nonemployed spouse are not ignored, and no marriage bonus could ever begin to compensate those individuals for their contributions to the family. 
Now, if Members on the other side of the aisle want to eliminate the small `bonus' in the Tax Code, I think that would be ill advised. I predict it would be soundly defeated, as it should be. It is antifamily, it is antimarriage, and given the fact that most of these are women in this setting, it is antiwomen to suggest a full-time homemaker provides no value that should be recognized in the Tax Code. I believe their contribution should continue to be recognized and applauded. The marriage bonus is a way to recognize some of the non-economic contributions of stay-at-home spouses. 
What we are really here for, I don't think there is a serious legal attempt to take away those recognitions, but there is a very serious assault on the values of American families. When we are taxing the average family that endures the marriage penalty, we are taxing them $1,400 a year more in taxes than we would if they were single. It seems to me that assault on the values of the American public is a tragic, tragic invasion of the strongest institution which we need desperately for the success and survival of our country. We should recognize that we need to eliminate that penalty on marriage. 
It is with that in mind that I am pleased so many Senators have agreed to cosponsor this measure. I hope we will vote to make sure that this becomes a part of the philosophy and policy of American Government. A government which is at war with the values of its people cannot long endure. No value is more cherished in America than the value of durable families. We simply have to eliminate the assault on marriage, the assault on our families, that is included in a Tax Code which undermines and curtails the value of families in our culture. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

 Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I rise today to encourage my colleagues to join me in congratulating Ms. Millie Beem of Springfield, Missouri, who will celebrate her 80th birthday on August 2, 1998. Millie is truly a remarkable individual. She has witnessed many of the events that have shaped our Nation into the greatest the world has ever known. The longevity of Millie's life has meant much more, however, to the many relatives and friends whose lives she has touched over the last eighty years. 
Millie's celebration of eighty years of life is a testament to me and all Missourians. Her achievements are significant and deserve to be recognized. I would like to join Millie's many friends and relatives in wishing her health and happiness in the future.

Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I commend the Senator from Kansas for his outstanding work on this issue. I believe that it is simply wrong for America to launch through the tax system an assault on one of the major principles of our culture--enduring, lasting marriages. But I concur with his judgment that this would subject this bill to what is known as a blue slip in the House and could disrupt the business that we ought to be conducting. I commend him for withdrawing the amendment. I thank him for the excellent work that he has done. 
I think this vote is a clear signal that this body understands this assault on the values of America, known as the marriage penalty, does not belong in the policy of this country. 
I thank the Senator from Kansas. I thank those who supported this particular effort and hope that we will have an opportunity to rally as public servants to eliminate this scar on the body politic whereby we wound the primary institution of stability in our culture, the family, by penalizing marriages. It is time for us to stop that. I believe we can and will, and this vote demonstrates it. 
I thank the Senator from Kansas. I thank the Chair.

Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Kansas. I thank the Senator from North Dakota. This is a matter that deserves our attention. It is an affront to the very institution that is most critical to the future of America. Some might say since this is not going to be included in a part of this bill because of the problems of originating such a measure in the Senate, that perhaps this was an endeavor which lacked merit. 
I really think it is important for us to keep the pressure on in this arena. It is important for a very simple reason, and that is that there are proposals to spend, spend, spend constantly. They are insistent. They always have the support of the bureaucracy. They would fund a bigger and bigger Government, more bloated and more bloated. It is essential that we elevate into the consciousness of this body and to the consciousness of the American public that there are very important places in which we ought to provide relief to American families, particularly as it relates to the marriage penalty, which is an attack by our Government on a central value of our culture, that value of marriage. 
You had but to look at this year and to see what it has contained. We started the year in January with some suggestion we were going to have additional revenues. The President came out virtually every day in January while we were preparing to come into session with what I call the `program du jour.' It was like going to the diner and having the special. Every day there was a new program to expand spending, to enlarge the consumption of Government, and implicitly, to contract the ability of people to spend the money that they earned as families. 
For those people who believe the success of America in the next generation is going to be based on Government, then that is, I think, a good strategy. But for those of us who believe the real success of America is not going to be based on Government programs, but is going to be based on whether or not we have solid families, then I think a strategy should exist to bring attention to the fact that we are penalizing, at the rate of $29 billion a year, people simply for being married. Some people think, `We need to be spending this money in Government.' 
Frankly, we ought to ask ourselves, do we think we are going to do more to foster the No. 1 institution in American culture, the family, by taking money from them and spending it in the bureaucracy, 
or letting those families spend the money on their own families in order to do what they need to do and to provide for a strong America. 
This isn't a question about whether moneys are going to be spent or not. This is a question about whether people are going to spend money on their families or the bureaucracy is going to spend money on Government. Which do we believe builds a stronger America? 
Frankly, the number of spending proposals that we are the recipient of continues to skyrocket. I have to say that the rules of this organization, the rules of the Senate, the rules of the Congress favor spending. It is hard to get something through to give money back to the people, and it should not be. But for so long, we have been so prejudiced toward taking money, and it has finally gotten to a point that is unacceptable. We are at the highest overall tax rate in Government in American history right now. It is time for us to say no more, especially as it relates to an assault on the American family. 
It is true this measure has been withdrawn because it is awkward and not in accordance with the rules as relates to this measure, but it is time for us to begin to elevate this and to say, `Wait, we have to stop this insistent consumption by the Government that keeps us from being able to spend our own resources as families.' 
I thank the Senator from Kansas for an outstanding job. I was pleased to march shoulder to shoulder with him in this effort. I, frankly, welcome people from both sides of the aisle who feel keenly about this. We do need relief for American families, I don't think there is any question about it. I am delighted that some are expressing that and will continue to do so. 
I have been delighted at every turn of the debate when individuals have understood that the future of America is far more likely to be guaranteed and ensured by strong families than it is by big Government. It is time for us to reflect that in our tax policy. 
I thank the Senator from Kansas, and I look forward to working with him toward the realization of this goal of declaring peace on America's families. For too long, we have made war with our tax policy on America's families. I yield the floor. 
Several Senators addressed the Chair.

Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, families are the cornerstone of America. Individuals from strong families contribute to the society. In an era when nearly half of all couples married today will see their union dissolve into divorce, I believe it is both instructive and important to honor those who have taken the commitment of `till death us do part' seriously, demonstrating successfully the timeless principles of love, honor, and fidelity. These characteristics make our country strong. 
For these important reasons, I rise today to honor Glen and Vera Emberson, who on July 9, 1998, celebrated their 60th wedding anniversary. Many things have changed in the 60 years this couple has been married, but the values principles, and commitment this marriage demonstrates are timeless. As Mr. and Mrs. Emberson celebrate their 60th year together with family and friends, it will be apparent that the lasting legacy of this marriage will be the time, energy, and resources invested in their children, community, and church, including their service as devoted missionaries. My wife, Janet, and I look forward to the day we can celebrate a similar milestone. 
The Emberson's exemplify the highest commitment to the relentless dedication and sacrifice. Their commitment to the principles and values of their marriage deserves to be saluted and recognized.

Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, we are here this morning--myself and several other Senators--because the American people should experience a tax cut before Congress gets its funding for the year. 
We are here this morning to oppose cloture on the legislative branch appropriations bill. On Friday, Senator Brownback of Kansas, and I attempted to enter into an agreement to offer the marriage penalty elimination amendment to the legislative appropriations measure. 
Marriage penalty elimination means that we simply want to stop penalizing people, tax-wise, because they are married. A cloture motion was filed because the Democrats would not allow us to offer that amendment to this bill. Therefore, a vote against cloture is a vote for eliminating the marriage penalty tax. If we are not going to be able to offer this amendment to the bill, we will be back on other pieces of legislation, because this issue of providing equity to people who are married, and returning the hard-earned money of American taxpayers is too important to ignore. 
In 1948, President Harry Truman called the Republicans in Washington a `do-nothing Congress.' Now the President and Senate Democrats are resurrecting Truman's phrase. I don't worry about being called a `do-nothing Congress.' We have done plenty of things. But if we tried to do nothing about taxes, that label just might stick. 
Last April, a group of like-minded Senators and I stated our intentions to oppose the Senate budget resolution unless meaningful tax cuts were included. We were promised that eliminating the marriage penalty would be the Senate's top tax priority for 1998. Mr. President, today, the 21st day of July, there are less than 40 legislative days left in this session of the Congress; yet, we are no closer to giving the American people the tax cuts than we were 3 months ago. 
We stand here in mid- to late-July with the real possibility that Congress will not pass a budget reconciliation and will not deliver on the tax cut promise that was made to the American people. I think we ought to put this into context. This isn't a situation where cutting taxes would be a strain or be difficult. To add insult to injury, last week the Congressional Budget Office indicated that there would be $520 billion of surplus over the next 5 years. Now, the $520 billion of surplus over the next 5 years would be $63 billion of surplus in this year alone. 
We have not asked for the Moon. We have asked for a modest opportunity to cut and eliminate the marriage penalty. It would not take $520 billion. It would not take $420 billion. It would not take $320 billion. It would not take $220 billion. It would take about $1 out of every $5 that is to be provided in surplus, according to the Congressional Budget Office. So we 
are just asking that the American people have the opportunity to have, in return, $1 out of every $5 of surplus. This isn't asking that we have massive, Draconian cuts, or that we displace some Government program--although there are plenty of Government programs I would be happy to seek to displace. We are merely saying that, over the course of the next 5 years, some fraction--a minority fraction, as a matter of fact, not the major portion of it--of this rather substantial surplus be devoted to providing equity on the part of our taxation program, which is an insult to the values of America. I don't know of anyplace in the country you could go, or any group of individuals you could talk to that would not tell you that the families of America are simply fundamental, that if we have strong families in the next century, we are very likely to have a strong country. If we don't have strong families, it is going to be very difficult for our country to survive. 
I believe that when moms and dads, as families, do their job, governing America is easy. If moms and dads can't do their jobs, if we pull the rug out from under families and make it tough for them, governing America could well be impossible. The truth of the matter is that families mean more to America than Government means to America, because the fundamental restraints of a culture, the values and precepts, are taught in families. 
Government can try to do all those things. We have tried to replace families with Government before. The tremendous failure of the social experiment called the `Great Society' of the 1960s and 1970s told us that checks and Government programs weren't substitutes for moms and dads. They didn't work. What we need to do is make it possible for the culture to survive and to thrive, for the culture to prevail and to stop penalizing the most important institution in the culture--the family. Durable marriages and strong families are absolutely necessary if we are to succeed in the 21st century. 
Starting in the sixties is when the marriage penalty became prevalent. For about 30 years, we have systematically penalized millions of people. The truth of the matter is that there are 21 million couples--about 42 million taxpayers--who collectively have paid $29 billion. It is so easy to forget how much money a billion dollars is. A billion dollars is a thousand millions. Now, these 42 million taxpayers have collectively paid `29-thousand-million-dollars' more than they would have paid had they been single. That is an average marriage penalty of about $1,400 per family. Think of that. We go into a family and, simply because the mom and dad happen to be married instead of single, we take $1,400 off their table; we take $1,400 out of that family's budget. These are not pretax dollars, these are aftertax dollars. It would go right to the bottom line. 
Think of what a family could do with an extra $130 or $125 a month. Think of what it means to the family, the capacity of that family to fend for itself and to be able to survive as a family. We are attacking that family. The policy of America is attacking the principles of the American people. And it's easy. We can do it. CBO has told us that we are going to have five times as much money, or four times as much--a lot more money--well, $520 billion extra. We said we have to have a minimum $101 billion to begin this relief. That is five times as much as we have asked for. Yet, we are so focused on providing for the Congress, so focused on providing for the legislative branch, and we are ignoring the people of America. The families of America are more important than the legislative branch of Government. 
As much as I think our country needs the House and Senate, why we should provide all the funding the House and Senate need and not provide any of the relief that we have promised to the American family, why we should continue to attack the American family, is beyond me. Discriminating against Americans who wish to engage in marriage is--well, it is just against everything we stand for. 
The penalizing of income at the median- and lower-income levels is greatest for married households with dependent children. The obligation to file a combined income means that the one spouse working to earn the second half of the income is working largely to feed Government coffers. Often the couple would pay a lower percentage of their income to the Government if one of its spouses was not employed outside the home. The marriage penalty is a grossly unfair assault on the bedrock of our civilization--married couples. 
Does the Tax Code really influence people's moral decisions to prevent couples from getting married? Unfortunately, there are individuals who simply have gotten divorced, set aside their marriages, in order to avoid the penalty that we impose for being married. Some couples even divorce and remarry to avoid paying the penalty. 
The Senator from Kansas brought up an example last week of two economists who divorce and remarry every year to avoid paying the higher taxes. The facts point to tragic instances of where couples simply cannot afford to get married because the Government is going to charge them $1,400 for the privilege of being married. Sharon Mallory and Darryl Pierce of Connorsville, IN, were ready to get married when they learned from their accountant that it would cost them $3,700 more a year. The amount results from the forfeiting of a tax refund check of $900 and an additional $2,700 to be owed to the IRS as a married couple. A growing number of married couples are in a similar position according to a recent study by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.

<TEXT>
Mr. ASHCROFT. Our Tax Code has and still operates in some instances to allow combining, by having a joint return, combined return, to have a lower tax for married people, and that really results from the conscious decision we make to recognize the value to our culture of a stay-at-home spouse. It focuses attention on the children and says we ought to give some benefit taxwise for doing that. And you do that by allowing the spouse who works to attribute some income to the stay-at-home spouse. 
I don't think there are very many of us who are married who, when one or the other has had to stay at home, doesn't realize that the one who focuses on the homeplace and undertakes that responsibility is really responsible for income and is responsible for the benefit of the family. 
I believe that the ability to split the income so that you get to the lowest tax bracket is something that should be provided to everybody in marriage. I wouldn't call it a bonus as if it were giving something out. It is a recognition of the value of the spouse who stays at home and the contribution that spouse makes, not only to the marriage and to the family but the contribution they make to the country. 
Most of the data we are seeing now about children--and I am sure my friend from Kansas agrees with this data and has witnessed the articles and all the expounding--indicate that when one of the spouses can stay at home and spend a lot of time with the children, it is a big investment in the children and it results in children having lower incidences of bad health and lower incidences of school failure, dropout, lower incidences of juvenile delinquency and all. So that kind of attention from the family really is a social benefit to the entire culture, because if there are fewer dropouts, it means that your education system works better; if there is better health, it means the cost of the benefits of the health providers are lower; and if there is lower juvenile delinquency, it certainly means we benefit.

Mr. ASHCROFT. I am aware of that. I thank the Senator from Kansas for the question. I am desperately aware of it. This is the time when the stress on families is the hardest. If you look at the things that break up families, if you go to data that tells us whether or not a family is going to make it past the threshold and be able to persist as a strong family with the kind of durability that has the capacity to really help our culture with the lasting relationships of support that families bring, one of the biggest items is financial problems. 
So here we have tender families at the very beginning, when they are struggling, they have kids, they are torn between responsibilities at the homeplace and the workplace, and what do we do? Instead of easing that financial burden, we zero in. It is almost like these families are staggering under the load they are bearing, because children are expensive, we know that--it costs a lot of money to clothe them, feed them, provide for them --and as they are struggling under that load, we come in and take another $1,400 a year off their table, out of their budgets, out of their capacity to provide for their children. 
It is an anomaly. It certainly wasn't something that I think the Congress ever intended. I have absolutely every faith the Congress of the United States did not intend to hurt families with the Tax Code. But it has kind of grown this way, and here is where we are. The question is not what we intended. The question is what we are going to do about this. Are we going to, at a time of $520 billion of surplus, decide we would rather feed the bureaucracy than relieve the families of America of this burden? That is plain and simple. Are we going to have new programs and more Government or are we going to have stronger families with less tax burden?

Mr. ASHCROFT. I have to answer the question of the Senator from Kansas in the affirmative. I understand that. I am aware of it, and I really think that we have a chance to say to the American people: Look, we want to give you a wedding present. We would like to say to you that we are no longer going to make it tough on you if you do the most important thing to sustain this culture in the time to come. 
I am a little distressed that this body does not want to let us confront that issue--I mean, there are Members of the body who do not--and that cloture would keep us from being able to make a priority the well-being of America's families, so we do not take care of ourselves in the legislative appropriations bill and ignore the families of America with the elimination of the marriage penalty tax. I hope Members of this body will vote against cloture. Let us vote so we have the possibility of addressing the needs of American families. 
I, for one, commend the Senator from Kansas for his outstanding effort in this respect. At some point we simply have to stop business as usual, continuing to tax these families, taking an average of $1,400 a year off their tables, out of their budgets. When they sit down to figure out, `What can we spend this year,' $1,400 is more than a vacation. Lots of families can take a little time off. But it may be school books, it may be school clothing, it may have to do with whether they can--well, I am sure there are many things that individuals look at, for $1,400 a year. 
It is time for us simply to say: Before we continue to balloon Government, before we consume this $520 billion surplus, before we rush to governmentalize that, we should say at least some portion of this, a modest portion, far less than half, far less than a third, could sustain total relief for America's families by eliminating the marriage penalty--and it ought to be done. It should provide individuals the opportunity to say, `We will be married, we will have durable families,' and it should stop taking from families who are staggering under the tax load, it should stop those families from being further injured when the Government comes and says, `We simply think we are more important than you are,' especially as it relates to the surplus money that is supposed to be here--as a result of the hard work of the American people. I started to say this money is coming as a result of the Congressional Budget Office's estimation. What arrogance that would be. We do not bring money to Washington. Money comes to Washington because people work hard, because they are entrepreneurs, because they get up early and stay up late--take care of their kids. 
I thank the Senator from Kansas. I know there are others here wishing to speak. I just say eliminating the marriage penalty is important to the future of the United States of America. We should vote against cloture because we need to have the opportunity to provide this relief to America's families. 
Mr. GRAMS addressed the Chair.

Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I rise today to commend Bruce Absheer for his lifetime service to the Federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (ATF) in St. Louis, Missouri. On July 4, 1998, Mr. Absheer retired as ATF Inspector from the St. Louis Office of the Bureau, ending 31 years of dedicated service as a federal employee. 
Mr. Absheer began his career with the Federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms on May 1, 1967. During his long tenure as an Inspector, Bruce conducted on-site alcohol, tobacco, firearms, and explosives inspections of these regulated industries. The inspections included examinations, analysis, and reports on operations to evaluate compliance with the applicable laws and regulations. 
Through his work, Mr. Absheer represented ATF with integrity, loyalty, and professionalism. His commitment to excellence earned him the ATF Employee of the Year for the Midwest region in 1987, setting new standards. 
As our nation looks to individuals to become more active in the workforce, I commend Bruce Absheer for his outstanding performance and service and thank him for his dedication to America. We wish him the very best as he moves on to face new challenges, opportunities, and rewards.

Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I rise today to express my profound concern for the International Criminal Court that was overwhelmingly approved in Rome late on Friday. I was pleased that the United States voted against final passage of this global criminal court. The Administration should be commended for rejecting this international folly, which would have been dead on arrival in the Senate. 
Unfortunately, however, the danger from this Court has not passed. The Administration is already coming under pressure from proponents of the court to reconsider its opposition. Even more disturbing is the possibility that the Court would assert jurisdiction over American soldiers, despite the American refusal to join the court. The Administration should `just say no' to any efforts to get the United States to reconsider or to signal any informal compliance with the Court. 
As both a Member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and as Chairman of the Subcommittee on the Constitution, Federalism and Property Rights, I find the International Criminal Court profoundly troubling. If there is one critical component of sovereignty it is the authority to define crimes and punishments. This Court strikes at the heart of sovereignty by taking this fundamental power away from individual countries and giving it to international bureaucrats. 
There are other aspects of this Court that are equally troubling. As examples, the authorization of international independent prosecutors, the expense of such a permanent court, and the lack of any clear limits on the Court's jurisdiction are all alarming. But no aspect of this Court is more troubling than the fact that it has been framed without any apparent respect for--indeed, in direct contravention of--the United States Constitution. 
As Chairman of the Constitution Subcommittee, I have a number of particular concerns about the Court. First and foremost, I remain concerned by the possibility that Americans could be dragged before this Court and denied the protections of the Bill of Rights. 
Even more fundamentally, I am concerned that the Administration participated in these negotiations without making any effort to insist that the proposed International Criminal Court incorporate and honor the Bill of Rights. Even if one concedes that we need an International Criminal Court--which I emphatically do not--we should certainly insist on respect for the Bill of Rights as the price of American admission. 
America's ideals and values are ascendant in the post-Cold War world. America's position as world leader is, in no small part, a product of a Constitution that is the envy of the world. The Administration should be justly proud of that Constitution and should have insisted that those principles form the cornerstone for any International Criminal Court. That unfortunately was not the official position of this Administration. 
In the United States, there is a right to a jury of your peers. In the United States, there is a privilege against self-incrimination. In the United States, we have eliminated the prospect of criminal liability for ill-defined common law crimes. In the United States, the Constitution limits the authority of prosecutors. None of these protections will be guaranteed for defendants brought before this international star chamber. 
The proposed Court negotiated in Rome neither reflects nor guarantees the protections of the Bill of Rights. The Administration was right to reject the Court and must remain steadfast in its refusal to join a court that stands as a rejection of American constitutional values. We must never trade away American sovereignty and the Bill of Rights so that international bureaucrats can sit in judgment of the United States military and our criminal justice system. 
In today's New York Times, there is an opinion piece in which Anthony Lewis chastises the United States for missing a historic opportunity by failing to vote in favor of the International Criminal Court. The author states that the vote to form the International Criminal Court `will be seen as a turn in the road of history.' That is perhaps the only point in the piece with which I agree. The approval of this Court was indeed `a turn in the road of history.' By ceding the authority to define and punish crimes, many nations took an irrevocable step to the loss of national sovereignty and the reality of global government. I, for one, am heartened to see that the United States took the right turn on the road of history, and I will work hard to ensure that there is no backtracking.

Would the Senator from Kansas agree that when the Senator from Kentucky talks about a bonus, he is talking about a situation where one of the two marriage partners is not employed outside the home; and really what the tax law does is allow, in some respect, part of the income to be assigned to that partner, some of the cost be assigned to that partner, and for that reason there is a theoretical bonus? But would the Senator agree it is important to understand that in marriage that there are a lot of respects in which it is appropriate that the `nonemployed spouse' be understood as having contributed substantially to the proceeds of the family that result from the employed spouse's earnings?

Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the amendment offered by my colleague, the senior Senator from Missouri. I am proud to be an original cosponsor of this amendment because it addresses the most pressing illegal drug problem facing our state and, perhaps, our country. 
As my colleague explained, our amendment provides for a lifetime ban for individuals who manufacture or produce methamphetamine on public housing premises. Specifically, the amendment requires public housing agencies to prohibit occupancy in any public housing unit by any person convicted of manufacturing methamphetamine in violation of federal or state law. Current tenants convicted of meth manufacturing will be evicted immediately and permanently. 
The need for this amendment could not be clearer. According to the Drug Czar's office, methamphetamine is by far the most prevalent synthetic controlled substance manufactured in the United States. This fact is not news to my constituents in Missouri. Last year alone, authorities seized 396 meth labs in Missouri, more than double the number of labs seized in California. 
Congress has taken some significant steps to address the growing meth problem. I was proud to have sponsored the Comprehensive Methamphetamine Control Act of 1996 and to have helped secure funding for the creation of a high-intensity drug trafficking area in the Midwest. We have tried to target meth production by giving it higher priority in the demand for limited federal resources. 
Unfortunately, the meth problem has become a crisis. Just this past weekend, the National Institute of Justice released a study showing that methamphetamine use among adult arrestees and detainees has risen to alarming levels. The problem is not confined to adults, however. Among 12th graders, the use of ice, which is a slang term for a very pure, smokeable form of meth, has risen 60 percent since 1992. 
The amendment we are offering today sends a clear signal to meth producers: We will not tolerate your behavior and we certainly will not subsidize it. If you want to turn your taxpayer-subsidized residence into a meth lab, the only public housing you will be eligible for in the future is the penitentiary. 
Our amendment attacks the problem of meth production and manufacture in federal housing projects in order to protect the safety and welfare of those law-abiding individuals who need subsidized housing. The sponsor of this amendment, my colleague from Missouri, deserves a great deal of credit for his lead role in cracking down on drug users and dealers in public housing. In 1996, he was instrumental in getting Congress to pass a provision requiring the eviction of any tenant from publicly or federally assisted housing if that tenant is determined to be involved in a drug-related criminal activity. As a result of his efforts, tenants involved in drugs are prohibited from receiving federal housing assistance for three years or until the evicted tenant successfully meets certain rehabilitation requirements. 
These provisions were designed to ensure the safety and security of families living in public housing. In addition, the reforms sought to instill responsibility in families participating in the federally assisted housing programs and to emphasize that federal housing assistance is a privilege, not a right. The amendment we are offering today extends and strengthens these provisions to address the deadly consequences of meth production. 
Meth labs have been called toxic time bombs, containing highly flammable materials and deadly chemicals. As DEA Special Agent Michael Cashman has observed, `The investigation of clandestine methamphetamine laboratories is one of the few instances where the evidence and crime scene can hurt or even kill the investigator.' 
Clandestine lab explosions are responsible for killing and injuring not only meth producers and law enforcement investigators, but innocent bystanders as well. Just last year, a four-year-old child was killed in Arizona when the meth lab his parents had erected in their apartment caught on fire. As horrifying as this case is, it is not an isolated incident. Within the last couple of years, other innocent young children of meth-producing addicts as well as heroic law enforcement agents have been victimized by the highly dangerous enterprise of meth manufacturing. 
As the epidemic of meth production has grown, so has its presence in public housing. When I asked local prosecutors if they knew of recent manufacturing activities in Missouri, it seemed everyone had a story or two to tell. 
In Dekalb County, two men recently pled guilty to attempted manufacturing of meth in a public housing unit. Sadly, when police made the arrest, they found not only gas cans, paint thinner, butane fuel, and other meth paraphernalia, but an infant girl. 
In Platte County, a man living in section 8 housing was recently convicted of meth production, possession, and endangering the welfare of a child. 
And, in Grundy County, two recipients of federal housing assistance were found guilty recently of attempting to manufacture meth in their apartment. 
Mr. President, these examples were obtained with just a few phone calls. I do not doubt that many of my colleagues have heard about similar crimes from police and prosecutors in their states. 
We need to get serious again about fighting the use of meth and all illegal drugs in this country. I say `again' because for the past five and one-half years, the Clinton-Gore Administration has failed to provide leadership on this critical threat to our nation. Since President Clinton took office, use of marijuana by 8th graders has increased 176 percent. Cocaine and heroin use among 10th graders have more than doubled. And, as I mentioned before, use of meth ice has risen 60 percent on this Administration's watch. 
Even if it is accepted, this amendment will not single-handedly reverse these frightening trends. It is, however, a step in the right direction. It sends the signal this Congress needs to send; namely, that the dangerous manufacture of illegal drugs in public housing is unacceptable. 
I want to thank my colleague again for his leadership on this issue. He understands the destruction meth has caused in our state and around the country, and his amendment is an appropriate response. I am glad to join him in this effort.

Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, for several years we have debated, argued and discussed the real economic impact of continuing to follow the Administration's wrong-headed policy on encryption. In addition to the Administration, several members of Congress on both sides of the aisle have refused to consider many of the facts of encryption technology and the importance of the technology sector to our robust economy.

Mr. ASHCROFT. I have heard that some object to even allowing for encryption and digital signature legislation to reside in different pieces of legislation, even if both were brought to the floor. They express their concern that without the inclusion of digital signatures that public networks cannot be adequately secure. This argument gives me great pause, mainly because it demonstrates a fundamental misconception of a digital signature. A digital signature does not secure the network but rather secures the signature. Applying the same logic to the analog world would dictate that contracts could not be written until we could adequately solve for the potential of forgeries. Obviously, we have not taken this approach yet individuals enter into millions of contracts every year.

Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of S. Con. Res. 107. This resolution is intended to repair the damage done by President Clinton's ill-considered comments on Taiwan during the recent U.S.-China summit. The Senate needs to make a clear statement in support of Taiwan. A failure to do so would be a greater disservice to the people of Taiwan and the credibility of the United States in East Asia. 
Mr. President, let us be clear, the President's statements undercut Taiwan in a way that past U.S. policy explicitly avoided. The Administration has tried to portray the President's regurgitation of Beijing's `three noes' as merely a restatement of U.S. policy. If this was merely a restatement of U.S. policy, however, why did the President have to make the comments at all? 
Far from being a restatement of U.S. policy, Bill Clinton's remarks were the first by a U.S. president formally opposing Taiwanese independence. In addition, the President's stated opposition to Taiwan's membership in international organizations directly undercuts Taiwan's efforts to share abroad its vision for a democratic, unified China. It is Taiwan's vision of China's future--a future of democratic pluralism and civil liberty--that the Administration should be supporting, not legitimizing the Chinese Communist Party with CNN summitry. 
As hard as the Administration might try to sanitize the President's comments, his statements already are being used by Beijing to pressure Taiwan on reunification. This morning's Washington Post reports that Beijing is telling Taiwan to `face reality' after the President's statement and agree to talks on reunification. One of Beijing's top negotiators with Taiwan said that the President's remarks strengthened China's hand and `* * * provided favorable conditions for the development of cross-strait relations.' 
This Administration seems to have forgotten that China has conducted missile exercises off of Taiwan's major ports in two of the last four years. `Favorable conditions' for China mean one thing: more latitude from the United States to intimidate Taiwan. The Chinese military continues to acquire weapons systems to facilitate an invasion of the island, yet the Administration tries to distance itself from American obligations in the Taiwan Relations Act to help Taiwan `maintain a sufficient self-defense capability.' Incredibly, the Administration parroted the `three noes' policy for Beijing without even obtaining assurances from China that it will not use force to reunify with Taiwan. 
Adopting Beijing's formulation on Taiwan was an ill-advised move by the President that has the potential of doing great harm to the 21 million Taiwanese who have built a vibrant democracy and free market. The Administration's position on Taiwan is not reassuring our democratic allies in East Asia. 
It is time for this Administration to choose which side it will support in the continuing struggle for civil liberty and democratic reform in East Asia. Blind engagement with Beijing's oppressive regime is not the way to ensure that democracy is preserved on Taiwan or advanced in China. It is time for the United States to stand again for freedom in East Asia and around the world.

 Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, the real issue in the debate on NATO expansion is the very character of the alliance in the future. NATO has been successful in the past because its mission has been focused. Now, the Senate is being asked to give its stamp of approval to a mission-expanded NATO. Passing this resolution of ratification without the Ashcroft amendment will be ratifying a NATO to serve as a `force for peace from the Middle East to Central Africa,' to use the words of Secretary Albright. There have been misconceptions about my amendment in the Senate and in the press. Allow me to address some of those. 
First, let me emphasize that this amendment is based on the language of the North Atlantic Treaty itself. For the Administration, which is opposing this amendment, I have one question: what do you have in mind for NATO that is not contained within the treaty itself? All my amendment does is restate the language of the treaty, specifically article 4. My amendment will not restrict NATO's ability to respond to collective defense threats from outside NATO territory. My amendment will not restrict NATO from responding to the new threats of post-Cold War world like weapons of mass destruction and international terrorism. 
The very purpose of NATO has been to prepare for collective defense threats emanating from outside the North Atlantic area. Any threat from outside the treaty area which posed the threat of an attack on NATO territory would be covered by the treaty and allowable under this amendment. 
This Administration, however, has something much different than collective defense in mind. NATO is in danger of changing, but the transformation is from Administration officials pushing for a global NATO. The United States Constitution has provisions for altering treaties, and it is called obtaining the Senate's advice and consent. If we want a global NATO, the treaty should be resubmitted for the Senate's consideration. 
For those of us who are concerned that NATO will get into far-flung operations, former officials Bill Perry and Warren Christopher write that the unanimous consent required among NATO members will guard against reckless deployments (New York Times, Oct. 21, 1997). For Mr. Perry and Mr. Christopher, the advice and consent of the U.S. Senate is replaced by the NATO bureaucracy. Thank you, but I like the United States Constitution just fine. 
Secretary Acheson had it right in 1949--the treaty would be altered by constitutional processes. Acheson stated: `. . . the impossibility of foretelling what the international situation will be in the distant future makes rigidity for too long a term undesirable. It is believed that indefinite duration, with the possibility that any party may withdraw from the treaty after 20 years and that the treaty as a whole might be reviewed at any time after it has been in effect for 10 years, provides the best solution' (Letter transmitting the treaty to the President, April 7, 1949). 
Acheson recognized that the world would change. His answer for how NATO would respond--countries can withdraw from the treaty or the treaty could be reviewed. Notice Acheson did not mention a review of NATO's Strategic Concept, on which the Senate has no vote, but a review of the treaty, with any modifications subject to Senate advice and consent. 
If this treaty was so elastic as to be stretched to cover any conceivable military operation, why would Acheson even talk about reviewing the treaty? Acheson did have a view of an alliance established for a specific purpose, with a limited scope. 
In the letter transmitting the treaty to President Truman, Secretary Acheson acknowledged the parameters of the treaty and stated flatly that the North Atlantic Council will have `. . . no powers other than to consider matters within the purview of the treaty . . .' (Letter to President Truman transmitting the NATO treaty, April 7, 1949). If Acheson viewed the treaty as limitless in scope, why did he testify about the careful limits of the various articles? Why did he explicitly state that NATO could not consider matters outside the purview of the treaty? 
The Foreign Relations Committee, in its report on the treaty, took pains to show NATO was not an `old fashioned military alliance.' The report states: `. . . in both intent and language, it is purely defensive in nature. It comes into operation only against a nation which, by its own action, has proved itself an international criminal by. . .attacking a party to the treaty . . . If it can be called an alliance, it is an alliance only against war itself' (SFRC Report, June 6, 1949). 
The Ashcroft amendment is designed to advance U.S. interests by keeping NATO focused on this historical mission of collective defense. Without the Ashcroft amendment, the Senate is setting NATO--the most successful military alliance in history--on the course of becoming a mini-UN with a standing army. My amendment will preserve the historical strength and effectiveness of NATO by keeping the alliance focused on the mission of the treaty itself. The Ashcroft amendment will only preclude the global policing operations outside the scope of the treaty. 
Drift in NATO is already underway. Frederick Bonnart writes of the Madrid summit in July 1997 where expansion was endorsed: ` . . . behind the euphoria, a hollowness has appeared that had not been evident before. The leaders seem unclear about the purpose of the organization, and therefore about the political and military shape it is to take. Worst of all, strains have shown up in the alliance that indicate weaknesses in its most vital asset: its cohesion' (Intl. Herald Tribune, July 25, 1997). 
Cohesion means something in a military alliance. If you want to turn NATO into the bureaucratic free-for-all of the UN, then oppose the Ashcroft amendment. If you want to keep NATO on a successful course, vote for this amendment. 
The Administration and some of my colleagues are arguing that NATO has no parameters, that's its mission can evolve, and that the Senate has no role to play in this evolution. Some of the Senators who are criticizing this amendment were championing the Senate's constitutional prerogatives during the `reinterpretation' debate over the ABM treaty in the 1980's. 
This Administration is setting NATO on a crash course to policing the brushfires of Europe and beyond. The lives of American soldiers are at stake if NATO is transformed into a mini-UN with a standing army. The first Somalia experience you have with NATO, and the alliance's credibility will be undermined. 
The historical setting for the establishment of NATO, the Senate record surrounding ratification, and the treaty language itself make it clear that collective defense was the clear mission of the alliance. 
Treaties are not formed in a vacuum. Two world wars were not enough for the United States to abandon a 149-year tradition of no peacetime military alliances. It took Soviet aggression in Bulgaria, Hungary, and Poland; a civil war in Greece which threatened to install a communist government; the coup in Czechoslovakia in February, 1948; the threat of communist victory in Italian elections in April, 1948; a tightening blockade of Berlin, and threatening moves by the Soviet Union to subjugate Norway to a non-aggression pact to bring the United States to the point of making a peacetime alliance with Europe. 
When analyzing the Treaty itself, you see a document that commits the U.S. to carefully defined military contingencies. NATO is given the flexibility to consult on an array of issues, it is charged with coordinating mutually constructive economic policies, it is allowed to invite new members to join when doing so would advance the security of the North Atlantic area. But when it comes to the use of military force, careful limits are placed on NATO's scope. 
Careful parameters are seen clearly in article 5, the heart of the Treaty: `The parties agree that an armed attack against one or more of them in Europe or North America shall be considered an attack against them all; and consequently they agree that, if such an armed attack occurs, each of them, in exercise of the right of individual or collective self-defense recognized by Article 51 of the Charter of the United Nations, will assist the Party or Parties so attacked by taking forthwith, individually and in concert with the other Parties, such action as it deems necessary, including the use of armed force, to restore and maintain the security of the North Atlantic area.' 
This article establishes the principal of collective defense. The use of armed force in this article and in other parts of the treaty is discussed only within this framework of collective defense: (1) The preamble of the treaty states that NATO allies `are resolved to unite their efforts for collective defense and for the preservation of peace and security;' (2) Article 3 states that `In order to more effectively achieve the objectives of this Treaty, the Parties, separately and jointly, by means of continuous and effective self-help and mutual aid, will maintain and develop their individual and collective capacity to resist armed attack;' (3) Article 9 establishes a council for the alliance, now called the North Atlantic Council, which is charged with establishing `immediately a defence committee which shall recommend measures for the implementation of Articles 3 and 5,' the two articles which outline the collective defense mission. 
Article 5 excluded NATO's involvement in civil wars in general. The Committee Report states `. . . purely internal disorders or revolutions would not be considered `armed attacks' within the meaning of article 5.' Article 5 applied only when a NATO member had an internal civil war aided by an outside power or when a civil war outside NATO threatened an attack on a member. 
NATO's geographical scope was defined carefully in article 6. Article 6 goes on to define `armed attack' and the territorial parameters in which the armed attack must occur for Article 5 to be invoked to include the territory of any NATO member, the islands under the jurisdiction of any of the Parties in the North Atlantic area north of the Tropic of Cancer, the forces, vessels, or aircraft of any of the Parties, when in or over these territories or any other area in Europe in which occupation forces of any of the Parties were stationed on the date when the Treaty entered into force or the Mediterranean Sea or the North Atlantic area north of the Tropic of Cancer. 
As is clear in articles 5 and 6, when the deployment of U.S. troops was possible, the U.S. drafters of the Treaty took extra precaution to define parameters. 
Article 4, the article the Administration would use to create a global NATO, reinforces the alliance's collective defense mission. Article 4 states `The parties will consult together whenever, in the opinion of any of them, the territorial integrity, political independence or security of any of the Parties is threatened.' 
This language is not the basis for a global NATO engaged in flashpoints from the Middle East to Central Africa. Article 4 reinforces NATO's collective defense mission. Words like `security' and `political independence' were taken seriously in 1949. The world had lived through two world wars and the Cold War was beginning. Security was not given the casual, domino-theory definition of today. Take, for example, comments by Deputy Secretary of State, Strobe Talbott: `If there were to be instability and conflict of any kind, whatever the origin of it, in Central or Eastern Europe, it would be a threat to the Continent as a whole' (Voice of America Interview, April 10, 1997). 
As Lawrence Kaplan, perhaps the dean of NATO historians, writes:  
The alliance's preoccupation with expansion seemingly prevents an exploration of the problems `out of area' issues raise. The Rome Summit [1991 NATO summit at which the Strategic Concept was adopted] did mention Article 4, which calls for consultation whenever any member believes that its territorial integrity, political independence or security is threatened. But this article is too vague, compared with Article 5 to serve as a guide for the future. (Lawrence Kaplan. NATO & Out of Area Issue. March 13, 1998). 
The Senate Foreign Relations Committee Report on the NATO Treaty in 1949 reinforces the careful limits of the Treaty language itself. The first paragraph of the Report, entitled `Main Purpose of the Treaty,' states: 
The basic objective of the treaty is to [make] clear the determination of the members of the North Atlantic community to safeguard their common heritage of freedom by exercising collectively their inherent right of self-defense in the event of an armed attack upon any of them . . .' (U.S. Congress. SFRC. North Atlantic Treaty Report, June 6, 1949. Pg. 1) 
With regard to article 3, the Report states, 
Questions have also been raised as to whether the United States, under article 3, would be obligated to assist the other parties to develop the capacity of their overseas territories to resist armed attack. The objective of the treaty is to maintain the peace and security of the North Atlantic area. During the negotiations there were no suggestions that this article should be interpreted as applying to any other area. The United States is under no obligation to assist the other parties . . . in resisting armed attack outside the area defined in article 6 (U.S. Congress. SFRC. North Atlantic Treaty Report, June 6, 1949. Pg. 11) 
With regard to article 4, in testimony on NATO in 1949, Senator Vandenberg stated that he wanted to make it clear in the Committee Report on the treaty that article 4 `was as limited as the balance of the pact' (Testimony before the SFRC, May 4, 1949). 
It is no surprise, then, that the SFRC Report carefully ties the use of article 4 to the collective defense mission of the alliance. The Report states that 
A situation arising anywhere might be cause for consultation, provided that it constituted a threat to one or more of the parties and might involve obligations under the treaty. The committee underlines the fact that consultation could be requested only when the element of threat is present and expresses the opinion that this limitation should be strictly interpreted. 
The Report goes on to state that  
Article 4 carries no obligation other than that of consultation. (U.S. Congress. SFRC. North Atlantic Treaty Report, June 6, 1949. Pg. 12) 
In discussing the obligation to consult, the Committee Report states that consultation takes place when a threat `might involve obligations under the treaty.' 
It is important what those obligations were. Referring to the Committee report: 
1. To maintain and develop, separately and jointly and by means of continuous and effective self-help and mutual aid, the individual and collective capacity of the parties to 
resist armed attack (art. 3); 
2. To consult whenever, in the opinion of any of the parties, the territorial integrity, political independence, or security of any of them is threatened (art. 4); 
3. To consider an armed attack upon any of the parties in the North Atlantic area an attack against them all (art. 5); and 
4. In the event of such an attack, to take forthwith, individually and in concert with the other parties, such action as the United States deems necessary, including the use of armed force, to restore and maintain the security of the North Atlantic area (art. 5). 
The obligation to consult is linked to other obligations in the treaty, all of which pertain to some aspect of collective defense. As Secretary Acheson said, article 4 was broader in scope than article 5 and gave NATO flexibility to respond to out-of-area threats related to collective defense. Almost without fail, article 4 was discussed within the context of responding to aggression less than armed attack--political aggression by a hostile power. 
Secretary Acheson himself linked article 4 to NATO's collective defense mission, stating that any action taken after consultation should be `in the spirit of the treaty' (Letter transmitting the treaty to the President, April 7, 1949). 
Floor statements by key Senators in 1949 make the limits of article 4 clear. Comments by both Senators Connally and Vandenberg, the Chairman and ranking member of the Foreign Relations Committee in 1949, reveal an understanding of article 4 in the light of NATO's collective defense mission. 
Senator Connally stated in his opening remarks on July 5, 1949 that 
I think that article 4 goes a long way to emphasize that the period of dividing and conquering has come to an end. The consultation provided for in that article addresses itself to the threatening of the territorial integrity, the political independence, or the security of any of the parties. Consultation is not an unnecessary luxury; it is a logical requirement to gain the objectives of the treaty. For one thing, article 4 . . . rightly faces up to the brutal fact that peaceful peoples have become more and more conscious of a sinister kind of danger--indirect aggression. Let us not forget that no bombs were dropped by the Soviet Union on Bulgaria, Hungary, or Czechoslovakia. (Congressional Record, July 5, 1949, Pg. 8814) 
Senator Vandenberg stated in his opening remarks the following day that: 
The question arises whether articles IV and V of the pact cover armed aggression against colonial or dependent or otherwise related areas of the signatories outside the area of the North Atlantic community as geographically defined in article VI. My own understanding is clear and unequivocal. The answer is `No.' There can be no other logical answer. The doubts seem to have arisen because article IV, relating solely to consultations, is unlimited in the circumference of these consultations. But there is not a word of obligation in it except to talk things over.' (Congressional Record, July 6, 1949, Pg. 8896) 
Senator Vandenberg again: 
The obligations are spelled out in articles III and V. It is significant, in this connection, that when article IX establishes a council to implement the treaty, it directs the council's attention specifically to articles III and V. It omits article IV in this connection. This is as it should be. It is by significant design. Our pledge of action under the United Nations Charter is general . . . But out pledge of action under the North Atlantic Pact is limited and specific. It applies only to armed aggression in the area clearly defined in article VI which is the North Atlantic community, set up by metes and bounds. (Congressional Record, July 6, 1949, Pg. 8896) 
Moving to article 5, the Committee Report identifies Article 5 as the `heart of the treaty,' and goes on to define what constitutes an armed attack. The Report states that `article 5 would come into operation only when a nation had committed an international crime by launching an armed attack against a party to the treaty.' (U.S. Congress. SFRC. North Atlantic Treaty Report, June 6, 1949. Pg. 13) 
The Committee Report's discussion of article 6 further reinforced the territorial basis of the Treaty, stating that `Article 6 specifies the area within which an armed attack would bring the provisions of article 5 into operation. Thus, the obligations under article 5 are strictly limited to the area described.' (U.S. Congress. SFRC. North Atlantic Treaty Report, June 6, 1949. Pg. 15) 
The Foreign Relations Committee obtained a commitment from the President in 1949 that the Senate would be able to give its advice and consent for new NATO members. New members are important, but new missions are just as critical. The mission of NATO is changing radically, and the Senate has not engaged in the debate. 
After the collapse of the Soviet Union, NATO planners scrambled to find new missions for the alliance: countering the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, advancing the political `interests' of NATO members, NATO as a police force and crisis manager. 
The catch-phrase that defined this effort was that NATO must go `out-of-area or out of business.' After the Cold War, NATO began evolving into an organization to pursue new missions. 
The Strategic Concept of 1991 pushed the traditional functions of NATO--to provide for collective defense and serve as a strategic balance in Europe--to the bottom of the list of the alliance s fundamental security tasks. 
The security task that rose to the top was for NATO to be `one of the indispensable foundations for a stable security environment in Europe . . . in which no country would be able to intimidate or coerce any European nation or to impose hegemony through the threat or use of force.' (1991 Strategic Concept in NATO Handbook, p. 239) 
This is an amazing expansion of mission. No longer is collective defense the singular mission of the alliance, but NATO has the impossible task of stopping intimidation and coercion throughout NATO and non-NATO Europe alike. 
In NATO's Strategic Concepts of the past, collective defense was paramount. 
The State Department has provided my office with the three NATO Strategic Concepts that preceded the 1991 version: the Strategic Concepts of 1950 (with a revised version in 1952), 1957, and 1967. 
The contrast between the first three Strategic Concepts and the 1991 version is striking. The mission of collective defense permeates the first three Strategic Concepts. Collective defense is carefully defined as the North Atlantic area described in article 6 of the Treaty. When potential out of area security developments are discussed, they are mentioned in the context of NATO members having the capacity to maintain their commitments to NATO while individually addressing the out of area threats that may affect their interests. 
NATO's Strategic Concept of 1957 explicitly states that `NATO defense planning is limited to the defense of the Treaty area. . .' and that `NATO military authorities have no responsibilities or authority except with respect to incidents which are covered by Articles 5 and 6 of the North Atlantic Treaty' (1957 Strategic Concept of NATO, p. 12). 
Throughout NATO's Strategic Concepts, the means of collective defense changed, from `massive retaliation' in the 1950's to `forward defense and flexible response' in the 1960's, but the mission itself remained the same. 
NATO has an uncertain course for the future, however. The New Strategic Concept of 1991 presented the first significant shift in NATO away from its traditional military mission. The Strategic Concept says that the `. . . clear preparedness to act collectively in the common defense remains central to the Alliance's security objectives.' The reliability of this assertion is belied by NATO s activity since 1991, however. 
Stan Sloan, one of the senior NATO analysts at CRS, states that since the formation of the New Strategic Concept in 1991, `. . . most of NATO's military activities have been focused on `non-Article 5' requirements, most significantly in Bosnia.' (Stanley Sloan. NATO's Evolving Role & Missions. CRS rpt.97-708F. Mar. 4, 1998, Pg. 4) No longer is collective defense the singular mission of the alliance, but NATO is committing to the impossible task of stopping intimidation and coercion throughout NATO and non-NATO Europe alike. 
Nelson Drew writes of this development:  
While the word `peacekeeping' did not appear in either the new Strategic Concept or the Rome Declaration, it was difficult to envision a means by which NATO or the NACC [North Atlantic Cooperation Council] could make good on their commitment to stability and peace throughout the trans-Atlantic community without consideration of an Alliance role in peacekeeping activities.' (Nelson Drew. NATO Confronts `Test Case from Hell.' INSS: McNair Paper 35) 
NATO was not created to douse regional brushfires in Europe, Asia, and the Middle East. When the deployment of NATO forces was considered, it was for collective defense. NATO's institutional development has followed the alliance's expanded mandate: NATO's goals as a police force and crisis manager have resulted in new institutional capacities. NATO has agreed to make its resources available, on a case by case basis, for brushfire operations under the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, the United Nations, and the European Union (NATO Handbook, p. 332-34). 
In the Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council, the Partnership for Peace, and the Combined Joint Task Force Concept, NATO has taken many positive steps to promote cooperation with other countries, but also has signaled that international policing actions will be an important part of NATO's activity in the future. 
This institutional transformation signals little strategic thinking. NATO signals its intention to be an international police force and crisis manager by its internal transformation. The Administration refuses to establish parameters for how far NATO expansion will proceed. Where are the limits on NATO's mission and membership? Alliance cohesion is at risk. 
The Administration views the Partnership for Peace as the `path to [NATO] membership for countries wanting to join' (U.S. Security Strategy for Europe and NATO, DOD, June, 1995). NATO makes brushfire troubleshooting an important part of the PFP and the Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council (EAPC). The Administration launches the Combined Joint Task Force (CJTF) concept to make it easier for NATO to engage in crisis management. 
The question must be asked as to how far NATO will expand its mission and membership. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright was quoted in the Washington Post as saying that NATO should become a `force for peace from the Middle East to Central Africa' (Washington Post, Feb. 22, 1998). President Clinton, in his recent trip to Africa, spoke of the need for some type of `multi-national force' for responding to African crises (White House Bulletin, March 27, 1998). Is this really the kind of mission the Administration wants NATO to have? 
Other countries take NATO signals seriously. For example, allow me to quote from the latest issue of Defense News: `Kosovo Fray Forces NATO s Hand.' `The violent uprising in the Yugoslav province of Kosovo may force NATO to extend its military influence across the Balkan region. . .' (Defense News, March 22, 1998). A U.S. official quoted in the article said `Macedonia is a Partnership for Peace country potentially in trouble from external sources. It needs help. It is not out of the realm of possibility . . . that a NATO-led mission in cooperation with PFP countries could take over when the UN deployment withdraws on August 31.' 
On March 11, Albania called the first emergency consultation within the framework of the PFP. NATO diplomats responded with a plan for `a robust Partnership for Peace program for rapid implementation in Albania.' (Defense News, March 22, 1998). This PFP program reportedly will include military training and steps to secure Albania s northern border. 
If we want to send American soldiers into these cauldrons of ethnic unrest, then let's have that debate. Nothing in this amendment would preclude the U.S. from deploying its forces anywhere. This amendment has to do with preserving the integrity of NATO. Just don't use the banner of a successful military alliance to entangle U.S. troops in Europe's brushfires. 
Comments by both former and present senior Administration officials indicate a radical shift in the scope of NATO. Former Secretary of Defense William Perry and former Secretary of State Warren Christopher stated in a New York Times editorial: `Shifting the alliance s emphasis from defense of members territory to defense of common interests is the strategic imperative' (New York Times, Oct. 21, 1997). 
Secretary of State Albright has confirmed NATO's shift to defense of interests. I questioned her on two separate occasions before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Secretary Albright confirmed that advancing out-of-area interests would be the modus operandi for NATO, but gave no realistic limits. In other forums, Secretary Albright has been quoted as saying that NATO should evolve into `a force for peace from the Middle East to Central Africa' (WP, William Drozdiak. Feb. 22, 1998). Strobe Talbott, one of the senior officials at the State Department, stated that geopolitical and military considerations can be put aside and `other nonmilitary goals shape the new NATO" (Jesse Helms, Wall Street Journal, March 23, 1998). Talbott reportedly looks favorably on Russia joining NATO. 
Inconsistency in the Administration's policies is creating more confusion in the alliance, however, and hurting U.S. leadership in NATO. Take, for example, Administration policy to combat the spread of weapons of mass destruction. The U.S. almost goes to war against Iraq in February over the threat of WMD. The U.S. maintains a sizeable force in the Persian Gulf to deter Iraqi aggression. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright states that fighting WMD should become the new `unifying threat" that binds NATO allies together (Washington Post, Feb. 22, 1998). 
The Administration's actions speak louder than words, however. In spite of the rhetoric and the object lesson of Saddam Hussein, the Clinton Administration has entered into nuclear cooperation with China, the world's worst proliferator of weapons of mass destruction 
technology (CIA report, June 1997). The President refused to halt nuclear cooperation even as China was caught trying to send Iran hundreds of tons of anhydrous hydrogen fluoride. 
This material is used to enrich uranium to weapons grade and was being sent to Iran's Isfahan Nuclear Research Center--the principal Iranian site to manufacture the explosive core of an atomic device (Washington Post, March 13, 1998). Clinton allows sensitive missile technology to be exported to China, undermining a Justice Department investigation of similar possible transfers by Loral Space and Hughes Electronics (New York Times, April 4, 1998). 
The missile technology possibly transferred by Loral and Hughes could be used on Chinese nuclear ICBM's (Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles) to reach the United States. Just so happens that Bernard Schwartz, CEO of Loral, is the DNC's largest personal contributor. 
With policies like that, U.S. has no credibility in tasking NATO with new mission to fight the proliferation of WMD. 
European comments on NATO's future mission are just as troubling. President Chirac, at the NATO/Russia Founding Act, stated: `NATO, initially conceived to face a clear-cut and massive threat, is now a lighter, more flexible organization adapted to its new crisis management and peacekeeping missions.' 
In a telling statement about the current evolution of the alliance, NATO Secretary General Javier Solana stated `NATO was born when Europe was divided, and now it has become a leading instrument in the reconstruction of the continent. This is an incredibly dynamic process. If this pace continues, it is hard to predict what NATO will be like just three years from now.' (Washington Post, July 6, 1997) 
Crisis management and brushfire engagements are the kinds of missions and the kinds of problems NATO was never intended to address. As Mark Esper writes in the Washington Times: `NATO was designed for collective defense of its member states, not for suppressing civil wars in peacekeeping missions that jeopardize the alliance's core purpose.' (Washington Times, Feb. 15, 1998) 
From the defense of territory to the defense of `common interests' is a quantum leap. Charging NATO to defend nebulously defined interests would have been unacceptable to the Senate in 1949 and it should be unacceptable for the Senate today. 
Resting on fifty years of NATO's success is not the way to ensure that U.S. interests are preserved and NATO remains a viable alliance in the future. `Just trust us' is essentially what the Administration is saying, as they transform NATO into a mini-United Nations with a standing army for ill-defined brushfire operations. 
Beware the Administration strong on NATO expansion but weak on defense. The U.S. is making a collective defense commitment to new NATO members while slashing defense. Those countries comprise 301,000 square miles of new territory and 2,612 miles of new NATO frontier to which the collective defense commitment is extended. 
Here are some of the statistics for U.S. defense cuts (in real 1999 dollars) between 1990 and 1998: 
Military Personnel funding: fell by 28% (from $102 bn in 1990 to $71.7 bn in 1998); 
Procurement: fell by 53% (from $98 bn in 1990 to $45.5 bn in 1998); Total National Defense Spending: fell by 27% over last eight years (from $375 bn in 1990 to $273 bn in 1998); 
Army divisions reduced from 26 in 1991 to 18 in 1998; 
Active Air Force tactical wings reduced from 35 in 1991 to 20 in 1998. 
The Clinton Administration is finding more things to do with a downsized force. Outside normal training and alliance commitments, the Army conducted 10 `operational events' between 1960-91 and 26 since 1991. The Marine Corps conducted 15 `contingency operations' between 1982-89 and 62 since the fall of the Berlin Wall. According to the Army Chief of Staff Dennis Reimer, the Army reduced manpower by 36% while increasing the number of deployed operations by 300% (CRS). 
Officers from deployable Army units now spend 180-190 days away from home annually. Shortly after announcing that U.S. troops would stay in Bosnia indefinitely, Clinton increased funding by 20% to expand U.S. influence overseas--not funding for military personnel, though, but money for the Peace Corps (National Review, Feb. 9, 1998). President Reagan's deputy undersecretary of defense, Dov Zakheim states: `. . .like Gulliver's enfeeblement by the Lilliputians, [the U.S.] will be tied down in so many parts of the world for so long that it will be hard-pressed to respond to major threats against which only overwhelming force would prove effective' (Defense News, April 12, 1998). 
Over-extension is hurting readiness. Misguided deployments harm readiness, inhibit weapons modernization, and undermine morale. The Army just completed its worst recruiting year since 1979. Just one third of the Army's women and just over half of the men believe that to fight and win in combat is the Army's principal mission (National Review, Feb. 9, 1998). 
The `two major regional conflict' strategy of this Administration is becoming increasingly unrealistic. The U.S. would be hard pressed to even replicate the Desert Storm operation. 
Hillen writes in the National Review: `In 1998, almost all the active Army's heavy-tank and armored-cavalry units outside of Korea and Bosnia would have to go to the Persian Gulf in order to equal the fighting power of America's VII Corps in 1991. And VII Corps was only one of three American corps engaged in Desert Storm' (National Review, Feb. 9, 1998). 
Inconsistent foreign policy is the root of the problem. Effective and credible diplomacy addresses potential crises before the deployment of U.S. troops is needed. This Administration's foreign policy inconsistency is almost reflexively compensated by the deployment of American armed forces. The National Defense Panel created by Congress in 1996 said of the Administration: `. . .the current approach to addressing national security engages the Department of Defense and services too often and too quickly in situations that should have been resolved by nonmilitary means' (Defense News, April 12, 1998). 
The Saddam Hussein's of the world that threaten the U.S. need to be dealt with, but the complacent policy of this Administration over the last six years has left U.S. troops dangling in the Persian Gulf. Our troops serving in Southwest Asia and Bosnia deserve better leadership from this Administration. 
The Administration's `assertive multilateralism is a fig leaf for lack of leadership. This Administration has an instinct to strike for the capillaries, to use the phrase of Jonathan Clarke. Policy drift with no finality in addressing national security threats, coupled with the brush fire mentality of this Administration, is squandering U.S. national defense resources. 
The Administration wants to apply its foreign policy muddle to NATO, to hollow out the clear mission of the alliance just as the U.S. military is being stretched thin and to use NATO as another tool for a globalist agenda with little application to real U.S. national security interests. 
When U.S. armed forces are struggling, reliable cost estimates for NATO expansion become more important. There have been a wide range of cost estimates for NATO expansion. The Administration's initial estimate (Feb, 1997) was $27-35 billion, with a U.S. share $100-150 m per year for ten years. This initial Administration's estimate, not surprisingly, was revised downward last December: the U.S. now only has to pay $40 million per year over ten years. 
The estimate of Congressional Budget Office (March, 1996) was a bit different. Different scenarios ranging from minimal reinforcement of four new members ($60.6 bn total) to NATO stationing a limited number of forces forward in new member countries ($124.7 bn total) 
The wide range of cost estimates is more confusing than helpful, but one thing is clear: the cost estimates rise precipitously when NATO take steps to provide a limited defense to these new members. The Senate should not accept the lowball estimates. We should consider the ends of our actions in expanding NATO--the real costs of actually defending these countries. 
If U.S. resources are stretched too thin, will Europe take up the slack? Not some of our European NATO allies. NATO allies have agreed only to pay for the cheapest expansion estimate yet: the $1.5 billion price tag from the NATO cost study accepted by the North Atlantic Council in December, 1997. Beyond the paltry $1.5 bn estimate, French President Jacques Chirac has stated bluntly that `France does not intend to raise its contribution to NATO because of the cost of enlargement' (Washington Post, July 24, 1998). 
Not the new NATO members. These countries are still throwing off the vestiges of a command economy and don't want to commit the resources to a full scale modernization effort. 
Dale Herspring, an expert on the region, writes: `. . .the East Europeans have done little to prepare themselves to meet NATO's military standards. Hungary and the Czech Republic in particular are trying to join NATO `on the cheap'. . .In fact, the military situation of all three countries is disastrous. Planes are crashing, morale is plummeting, and equipment is outdated. Unless the parliaments of these countries get serious or the West. . .decides to foot the bill, the Czech Republic and Hungary will never meet NATO standards.'

Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to speak about a provision that has been included in the managers' amendment of the higher education legislation that we are considering. Specifically, I have some reservations about a provision, offered by Senator Craig of Idaho, which expresses a sense of Congress regarding the protection of student speech and association rights. 
I value highly the protections guaranteed to our nation's citizens under the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. Freedom of speech and association are cherished rights. They are foundational rights, in that the ability to speak freely and criticize the government are necessary to ensure that other constitutional rights are guaranteed and that the system of government erected in the Constitution functions well. 
However, it must be remembered that the First Amendment was targeted against government oppression and designed to protect against censorship by the government--not by private individuals or institutions. The Bill of Rights was adopted to address the concern that the new federal government would not accord sufficient respect for the rights of individual citizens. It protects the citizens from the government, not from other citizens. As Thomas Jefferson wrote in a December 20, 1787 letter to James Madison, `a bill of rights is what the people are entitled to against every government on earth.' The protections of the Bill of Rights were designed to check specific abuses that can flow from government power; they were neither designed nor intended to be a general code of conduct applicable to all citizens. Indeed, a wholesale application of the Bill of Rights to all private citizens would turn these key protections on their head--provisions designed to safeguard individual liberty would become the instrument for limiting individual liberty. 
The United States Supreme Court has long recognized the unique role of the Bill of Rights as a limitation on government action through the state action doctrine. With the exception of limited circumstances in which some heavily regulated quasi-private entities are deemed state actors for limited purposes, the Supreme Court has refused to treat private entities as state actors to which the Bill of Rights apply. Two cases, Flagg Brothers, Inc. v. Brooks from 1978, and Jackson v. Metropolitan Edison Co., from 1974, articulate the Court's position in this area. 
The notion that the Bill of Rights is directed exclusively at government action is implicit in the First Amendment itself. The First Amendment protects citizens not only from government regulation of speech, but also limits the government's ability to interfere with the right of individuals to join together to form private associations and organizations, including private educational institutions. A private college or university may choose to remain private in nature so that it can maintain control over its educational mission and policies. Wholesale application of the First Amendment protections to private institutions does not vindicate the First Amendment right to speech, but rather ends up restricting the First Amendment freedom of association. 
None of this is meant to suggest that the federal government should never impose conditions on private institutions that receive federal funds. Although there has been an excessive tendency toward applying such mandatory conditions, there are situations in which Congress can properly insist that organizations receiving federal funds maintain certain minimum standards or not use the funds for questionable purposes. Even in the specific context of federal funds directed to private institutions of higher learning, it may be appropriate for Congress to insist that beneficiaries afford some rights to their students. 
My concern is not that the Craig provision favors imposing some conditions on these institutions, but that it imports wholesale the limitations and restrictions developed over two centuries of cases interpreting the First Amendment. There is no reason to think that liberties designed to protect private individuals and entities from the government will strike the appropriate balance in the very different relationship between a student and a private college or university. Fortunately, the measure before the Senate today is not legislation that would impose the First Amendment directly on private educational institutions, but rather a sense of the Congress resolution that these constitutional limitations should apply to private institutions. I do not share that sense, and if the measure before the Senate were binding legislation, I would exercise my rights in an effort to change the legislation. However, in light of the non-binding nature of the Craig provision, I am content to note my views and concerns for the record.

Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I rise today along with my friend and colleague, Senator Moynihan, to address the faculty retirement incentive provisions contained in the House-passed version of the Reauthorization of the Higher Education Act. This provision amends the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (ADEA) to allow the use of age-based incentives for the voluntary retirement of faculty at colleges and universities. 
In the House, Congressman Fawell worked to include this provision in the Higher Education Act, and we thank him for his leadership on this issue. Here in the Senate, Senator Moynihan and I have introduced an similar provision in the last two Congresses. I am please that Congress and the President will have an opportunity this year to pass this important legislation. 
This legislation, called the Faculty Retirement Incentive Act, will clarify that institutions may establish plans that give faculty who wish to retire early financial assistance in doing so. Further it would help to ensure that academic institutions will be able to make necessary new hires, particularly in expanding disciplines and new fields. For those who are concerned about potential recrimination if a faculty member would choose not to retire early, the double protections of the ADEA and the tenure system provide effective safeguards against coercion. It is also important to note that current law expressly permits the type of age-based benefit for employees participating in defined-benefit plans. Most colleges and universities, however, maintain defined-contribution retirement plans for tenured faculty. 
In January, the bipartisan National Commission on the Cost of Higher Education included this legislation initiative in its recommendations to check the skyrocketing cost of a college education. The Commission recommended that `Congress enact a clarification to the Age Discrimination in Employment Act to ensure that institutions offering defined contribution retirement programs are able to offer early retirement incentives to tenured faculty members.' 
The Faculty Retirement Incentive Act has the active support of a number of organizations, including the American Association of University Professors, the American Council on Education, the American Association of Community Colleges, the American Association of State Colleges and Universities, the Association of American Universities, the Association of Catholic Colleges and Universities, the Association of Community College Trustees, the Association of Jesuit Colleges and Universities, the University Personnel Association, the Council of Independent Colleges, the National Association of Independent Colleges and Universities, the National Association of State Universities and Land Grant Colleges, and the National Association of Student Personnel Administrators. 
I feel it is important that Congress enact this important legislation and I know my colleague from New York shares this same belief.

Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, families are the cornerstone of America. The data are undeniable: Individuals from strong families contribute to the society. In an era when nearly half of all couples married today will see their union dissolve into divorce, I believe it is both instructive and important to honor those who have taken the commitment of `till death us do part" seriously, demonstrating successfully the timeless principles of love, honor, and fidelity. These characteristics make our country strong. 
For these important reasons, I rise today along with the senior Senator from Missouri, Senator Bond, to honor Kathy and John Phillips, Alma and Larry Swon, and Kathy and Mike Yount of Mexico, Missouri, who on July 3, 1998, will celebrate their 30th wedding anniversaries. Many things have changed in the 30 years these couples have been married, but the values, principles, and commitment these marriages demonstrate are timeless. 
My wife, Janet, and I had the privilege of celebrating our 30th wedding anniversary just one year ago. I can attest, like these fine couples, to the remarkable love and appreciation that has grown out of my own marriage. As these couples gather together in Mexico on July 3, surrounded by friends and family, it will be apparent that the lasting legacy of these marriages will be the time, energy, and resources invested in their children, church, and community. 
The Phillips, Swons, and Younts exemplify the highest commitment to relentless dedication and sacrifice. Their commitment to the principles and values of their marriages deserve to be saluted and recognized.

Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I rise today to express my disappointment that the conference report which accompanies H.R. 2646, the Education Savings and School Excellency Act, does not contain the provisions banning Federal funding for the President's federalized, individualized testing proposal. This provision, which I authored, has been removed in conference because of the clearly communicated concern that the President would veto the legislation based on this issue. 
The Senate and House have repeatedly given the administration a failing grade on respecting the role of parents, on local control of what is taught and how it is taught. The President has insisted on trying to promote federalized control of education. Federal testing would lead to a Federal curriculum. 
This administration has a lamentable record of harming the interests of American schoolchildren. 
For example, on school choice, the President wants to incarcerate America's most disadvantaged youngsters in dangerous, dysfunctional schools, rather than give them a choice of schools. 
On block grants, he wants to keep plowing taxpayer money into the bureaucracy, instead of investing more in our classrooms. 
Now, on school testing, he wants to cut the rug out from under the role of parents and communities--the most important factors in how well children do in schools. 
The more Members of this body have learned about the President's national testing proposal, the less they have liked it. Over the past year, the number of Senators opposing national testing has grown to a majority. 
When we first visited this issue last fall during debate on the Labor, HHS and educational appropriations bill, only 13 Senators voted against allowing the President's national testing proposal. 
Only one month later, 36 other Senators joined with me to threaten to filibuster the Labor, HHS, and Education appropriations bill unless there was a ban on FY 1998 federal funding for the President's national testing proposal. 
In April of this year, when I offered my testing ban as an amendment to the Coverdell A+ bill, the Senate passed the provision by a vote of 52-47. 
Over in the House, Congressman Bill Goodling, Chairman of the House Education and the Workforce Committee, has continued to provide leadership in the fight against national testing. His bill to prohibit funds for national testing passed by a vote of 242-174 in February of this year. 
So it is clear that both Chambers of this Congress agree that national testing should be rejected. And the President of the United States wants to promote national testing, and does so, I believe, in an effort that would begin to nationalize the school system. Local control of schools is fundamentally important and should be protected. It is reflected in the understanding of the House and the Senate. 
The Senate Majority Leader and the Speaker of the House have provided to Chairman Goodling and me a written commitment that they will ensure that the text of the Labor/HHS/Education appropriations bill for 1999, and any supplemental or any other such legislation, will not leave Congress without a testing provision that Chairman Goodling and I find to be satisfactory. That, of course, would be a provision allowing no funds to develop national tests. If the appropriations bill does not make it to the President's desk, they say, then every effort will be made to include this in a continuing resolution or any other must-pass legislation. 
I appreciate this assurance from our leadership in both the House and Senate, and my colleagues can be sure that I will do everything in my power to hold them to their commitment.

Mr. ASHCROFT. Why am I opposed to national testing? Mr. President, we must remember that any movement toward national control of education savages principles that we as Americans hold dear: parental authority and control, teachers who are free to teach core subject matter and school boards that are responsive to their communities, not held captive by distant bureaucrats. 
President Clinton's proposal for national testing of our children is an example of such an attempt at a federal power grab. The President wants to move power out of the hands of parents and school boards and into the hands of Washington bureaucrats. 
America resists that for a number of important reasons, and these are the reasons to oppose federalized national tests. 
Parental involvement is the most important factor in a child's educational success, and national tests would undermine the ability of parents to play a meaningful role in the educational decisions of their children. 
During my time as Governor of Missouri, and through my work with the Education Commission of the States, learned that the single most operative condition in student educational achievement is the involvement of parents. Study after study has proven the significance of parental involvement in their child's education. 
We should not disengage parents with a federalized national testing system. Experience has shown that local control is a key factor in educational success. 
Experience has shown that local control is a key factor in educational success. As a former Governor who made education a top policy priority, I learned first-hand that local control is needed to create educational programs that respond to the needs of local communities and that stimulate success. 
National tests will lead to a national curriculum. There is wide consensus among teachers, administrators, and education experts that `what gets tested is what gets taught.' 
So, if you determine a test, you determine the curriculum. 
A national curriculum is detrimental because it eliminates the participation of parents and local schools--the key elements of success. It would do so inevitably. As a result, they key elements of success--parents, schoolteachers, and local decision-making--would be missing in our educational systems throughout the country. 
Lynne Cheney, former Chairperson of the National Endowment for the Humanities, reminds us that previous attempts at federal standards have been disastrous. 
She points to the politically correct federal history standards which were unanimously rejected in the Senate. 
Cheney also points to the English/language arts standards, which were such an ill-considered muddle that even the Clinton Department of Education cut off funding for them after having invested more than $1 million. 
The final exam on the Clinton plan for federally controlled testing will come on the Labor/OHS/Education appropriations bill. This Congress--and more importantly, the American people--will be watching very carefully to see how the Administration performs on this issue that affects the future of our children. I will do everything in my power to protect the ability of parents, teachers, and local schools to be involved in the education of their children by participating in the development of school curriculum, standards, and testing. 
So I commend this bill to the President. This is an important bill. It would advance substantially the interests of our students. I thank the sponsors for their outstanding work. 
I look forward to sending to the President an appropriations bill which would curtail the potential of any money being wasted at the Federal level by imposing inappropriate federalized tests upon local school districts. These tests would curtail the ability of local officials to make the kinds of decisions that are necessary for us to have the kind of school quality that we need in order to survive in the next century. 
With that in mind, I thank the sponsor of this legislation and commend him for the outstanding work he has done by stepping forward for America's schoolchildren, and I look forward to the opportunity of working together again to make sure that as we protect the options of parents and local officials to educate their children, we best serve this great land and future generations. 
I thank the Chair.

Mr. ASHCROFT. So the Senator's amendment is not to deny a visa to someone who had an abortion or someone who has participated in an abortion clinic that wasn't a coerced abortion. You are just focused on this situation where people were intimidated, coerced, sometimes jailed, sometimes fined, sometimes actually had their homes demolished to force them to destroy an unborn child. Your amendment focuses on persons who are involved in that kind of coercive behavior to force individuals--who want to preserve the life of the child--to destroy the child. Those individuals are the ones that would be denied a visa to enter the United States by this amendment.

Does the Senator think there is a relationship between this disregard for life that is expressed in coerced abortion policy and the willingness to target peace-loving people in the United States with city-buster nuclear weapons on long-range ICBMs?

I am distressed that the minority leader has indicated that votes on these issues would be inappropriate. It seems like they are an embarrassment, potentially, to the President. I think the policy which we have pursued is an embarrassment to the United States of America, and I think we need to change our policy to make clear that we reject the kind of activity which has been spoken of by the Senator from Arkansas. 
With that particular thought in mind, and understanding the merit of this particular division, which would deny visas to those who have been actively involved and for whom credible evidence has been developed in the coerced abortion area, I move to table the first division of Senator Hutchinson's amendment.

Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I want to take a few moments to address the situation regarding the policy of the United States and the way in which we relate to the nation of China. The President of the United States is making a trip to the People's Republic of China, and there has been significant debate about this trip, which provides us an opportunity to ask ourselves what kind of policy should we have toward the world's most populous nation. 
There have been a number of us who have questioned whether or not the President should go to Tiananmen Square, for example, to celebrate, in some way, his arrival with those who pulled the triggers at the square to crush dissent in 1989. There are a wide variety of pluses and minuses about the Presidential trip. I want to try to put this trip and our policy toward China into a broader perspective in terms of the way foreign policy perhaps ought to be conducted. 
First of all, the President has suggested that we either have to do it his way--to support the Presidential visit, welcomed by leaders at the site of a tremendous violation of human rights--or else we have no engagement with China at all. I think this is a false choice. It is not necessary, in order to have a relationship with countries, that we automatically have to have a summit. As a matter of fact, we engage in relationships with very important countries--countries far more influential in some respects than China--and we don't have summits with them on a regular basis. This is the second summit in less than a year with the nation of China. 
So the first thing I would like to say is that it is not necessarily essential, in order to pursue a productive policy for a long-term constructive relationship with China, that you have a summit. As a matter of fact, it might be counterproductive. It might impair the development of the kind of healthy, long-term relationship we need if we send the President unduly, or prematurely, to negotiate with or otherwise concede to individuals whose conduct doesn't merit the President's dignifying presence--whose participation in world events is not of a quality that should be legitimized by a visit from the President of the United States. 
There has been a false dichotomy presented to the American people, and it has been the choice between either supporting the President's trip to China or being labeled isolationists. That is simply an inappropriate framework to force upon the American people. Most Americans understand that our objectives ought not to be involvement or isolation per se, but that the United States--the greatest Nation of the world--would relate constructively with the People's Republic of China on the basis of sound policy that leads to a constructive and mature relationship. 
I believe that we have to have a policy toward China. While I question what the policies the President is pursuing, my reservations in no way suggest that I don't seek good relations with China. As a matter of fact, I think the road to good relations would be paved with better policy and fewer summits. 
Allow me to explain. Whether we are talking about the relationships between individuals, or businesses, or institutions, or countries, there are principles that undergird and provide the foundation for good relations. Integrity is one. Relationships have to be based on integrity. People have to be able to trust one another. They have to know that when one says something, it can be trusted. Another component of a good relationship is responsibility. Individuals have to act responsibly. They can't threaten or otherwise endanger the other party if there are going to be sound relationships. Third, there has to be accountability. If we want long-term relationships, if we want a productive relationship, if we want something that can be relied upon and built upon, we have to have the foundation of integrity, responsibility, and accountability. 
I suggest that our relationship with China is no different, an must include these kinds of building blocks. We have to have a relationship of integrity, responsibility, and accountability with China. If we don't have it, the future of U.S.-China relations is not bright. 
I have some real problems with the way the Chinese have dealt with us. It is a way that does not reflect integrity. It does not reflect responsibility. It does not reflect accountability. 
Take, for example, integrity. China last year, after almost 20 years of assuring the world that it doesn't proliferate weapons of mass destruction, was labeled by our own CIA as the world's worst proliferater of weapons of mass destruction. In spite of that, the President said, `We will invite them over for a summit.' And the Chinese were invited to the United States in October. As a matter of fact, there were nonproliferation assurances at that summit similar to the assurances that have been made over the past two decades. China pledged that it did not proliferate weapons of mass destruction. We don't involve ourselves in that. 
Frankly, just a few short months later, our intelligence resources intercepted negotiations between China and Iran for China to provide anhydrous hydrogen fluoride, a material used to upgrade industrial-strength uranium to weapons-grade uranium. The material was destined for Isfahan, one of Iran's principal sites for manufacturing the explosive core of an atomic device. 
It is pretty clear that the absence of integrity in the conduct of the Chinese is dramatic. It is an absence of integrity prior to the last summit, and it is an absence of integrity that followed on the heels of that summit. They will tell you one thing, and they do something else. That is not the basis of integrity that provides the foundation for a sound relationship. 
Responsibility is the second key ingredient. I think most Americans were shocked--I was shocked; I was stunned--when it was revealed by our own intelligence sources that the nation of China had as many as 13 intercontinental ballistic missiles targeted on American cities, armed with massive nuclear warheads, termed `city busters.' Every city in the United States of America north of southern Florida is within range of these missiles, and they are targeted on the United States of America. 
I don't think that is the foundation for summitry. I don't think that is the foundation for a good relationship. We never appeased the Soviet Union while it was targeting nuclear warheads on American cities. Ronald Reagan had a sense of principle. He had a sense of determination that you don't stand as a target, while at the same time offering privileges to your adversary. That is not the kind of policy America has pursued in the past. A policy which sells out America's long-term security interests might facilitate a particular sale, it might obtain a particular favor, but it is not in the long-term best interests of the United States to stand as a target offering concessions to a country pointing nuclear weapons at our cities. 
I think it is, of all things, terribly irresponsible of the Chinese to have 13 American cities targeted with their `city buster' nuclear weapons on intercontinental ballistic missiles capable of reaching virtually every city in the United States. 
The third important element is accountability. Where do the Chinese stand on accountability? The trade barriers that China has toward the United States are incredible. In recent years, China's tariff levels have been about six times as high on our goods as our tariffs are on Chinese products. Not only that, China imposes nontariff barriers that make it impossible for our companies to penetrate the Chinese market. China treats American companies differently, so that U.S. firms don't have the protection of law in Chinese courts commensurate with the protection the United States extends to foreign investors in our market. 
The absence of integrity, the absence of responsibility, the absence of accountability--the absence of these cornerstones of what ought to be U.S. policy means that the house of cards being constructed in summitry with China is in danger of collapse. I 
think if we are really interested in China policy over the long term, we ought to build the U.S.-China relationship on a foundation that demands integrity, responsibility, and accountability. 
When the President's presence implicitly accepts atrocities in China, and when the Administration continues to pursue a bankrupt policy of engaging the Chinese at any cost, the interests of the American people are not served and the United States is not served at its highest and best. It is no wonder that individuals on both sides of the aisle have protested this trip. It is no wonder that this is not a partisan issue. Sure, there may be more Republicans who are willing to stand and talk about this now. But in our news conferences together, we have brought these concerns to the President, saying, you are making a mistake with the kind of things that you are intending with this summit. 
The President will likely try to come home with some transaction, or some deal, to say that it was an achievement of the summit. But let us not forget that the real purpose of summits ought to be the development of sound structural relations, the kind of underpinning and foundation that will result in the potential for long-term, beneficial, constructive relationships between countries. As long as we ignore the absence of integrity, we ignore the absence of responsibility, we ignore the absence of accountability, it seems to me that we are not building the kind of relationship based on mutual respect. 
I would say this: As a minimum, this summit must end with the President returning to the United States with an assurance that United States cities are not targeted by Chinese ICBMs--with some kind of verification to ensure China's detargeting of American cities is genuine. 
The Chinese know that they have not acted with the requisite integrity. They know that they have not acted with the requisite responsibility. I think they understand that they have not acted with the kind of appropriate accountability that would provide the basis for the right foundation for a sound U.S.-China relationship. China, in some ways, may not expect to get the kind of relationship that mature nations dealing with one another on the basis of these values would have. 
Maybe that is why the Chinese have attempted to influence elections in America with donations to buy the kind of respect they have not earned with good will. 
Of all the things I would expect us to demand at the upcoming summit, one is that illegal contributions from subsidiaries of the Chinese Army not come to contaminate the political process in the United States of America. 
I want to say with clarity that an important challenge for the United States is to develop sound long-term relationships with important nations around the world. We cannot develop those relationships, however, without the fundamentals of integrity, responsibility, and accountability. 
We have in China today a regime whose brutal repression at home betrays its intentions abroad. America should be sounding liberty's bell, not toasting the tyrants who sent tanks to Tiananmen Square and pulled the triggers there. 
I believe we need to find a way to make sure that integrity, responsibility, and accountability are the fundamental components upon which our China policy rests. To legitimize Chinese conduct absent those values, those principles, is likely to result in a long-term U.S.-China relationship with more risk than reward, with more difficulty than cooperation. 
Mr. President, I thank you for this opportunity. I thank you for the time you have spent in the Chair. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Taxpayer's Defense Act. Quite simply, this bill prohibits any agency from establishing a tax on the American people. 
Mr. President, as we all know, the United States was founded on one simple and fundamental principle--no taxation without representation. 
In `The Second Treatise of Government', John Locke said, `if anyone shall claim a power to lay and levy taxes on the people . . . without . . . consent of the people, he thereby . . . subverts the end of government.' According to Locke, consent required agreement by a majority of the people, `either by themselves or their representatives chosen by them.' The Declaration of Independence listed, among the despotic acts of King George, his `imposing taxes on us without our consent.' 
The Boston Tea Party remains the symbol of Americans' opposition to taxation without representation. The Constitutional authority--given only to Congress--to establish federal taxes is clear. Its reasoning also is clear. It is the Congress that represents the people. Only Congress considers and weighs every issue that rises to national importance. While federal agencies consider their own priorities to be paramount, only Congress can determine which goals merit a tax on the American people. 
The modern era of restricted federal budgets, however, threatens to erode the essential principle of `no taxation without representation.' In many subtle and often hidden ways, federal agencies are receiving from Congress the power to tax. 
They tax by adding unnecessary charges to legitimate government user fees. They tax through federal mandates. These taxes pass the cost of government on to the American people--without their knowledge. 
The worst example of administrative taxation is the Federal Communications Commission's Universal Service tax. `Universal service' is the idea that everyone should have access to affordable telecommunications services. It originated at the beginning of the century when the first national telecommunications service was still being created. This idea was expanded in the Telecommunications Act of 1996, which allowed the FCC to extend universal service funds to provide `discount telecommunications services' to schools, libraries, and rural health care facilities. 
Most importantly, the Act gave the FCC the power to decide the level of `contributions'--taxes--that telecommunications companies would have to pay to support universal service. The FCC now determines how much must be collected in taxes that subsidize a variety of `universal service' spending programs. Long distance providers pass the costs on to consumers in the form of higher telephone bills. In the first half of 1998, the tax was $625 million, and the 
Clinton Administration's budget projects it will rise to $10 billion per year. This administrative tax is already out of control. 
This is possible because Congress delegated its authority to tax. The FCC is able to collect taxpayer dollars at levels it sets--without approval from Congress or the people. The FCC can defy Congress and the people because it has the power to levy taxes. 
Mr. President, some people thought the tax and spend liberals had left Washington. Not so. Washington interest groups who want to feed at this new federal trough already are geared up to accuse the Republic Congress of cutting funding for education and health care if any attempt is made to rein in the FCC. They will frame the issue as a matter of federal entitlements for sympathetic causes and groups. 
The most sympathetic group is the American taxpayer, whose money is being taken, laundered through the Washington bureaucracy, and returned for purposes set by unelected Washington bureaucrats. This is why the FCC must be required to get the approval of Congress before setting future tax rates. 
Should tax dollars be used for federal universal service programs and what amounts or should Americans spend what they earn on their own, real, local priorities? Requiring Congress to review any administrative taxes would answer this question. 
My bill would create a new section to the Congressional Review Act for mandatory review of certain agency rules. Any rule that establishes or raises a tax would have to be submitted to and receive the approval of Congress before taking effect. In essence, the Act would disable agencies from setting taxes, but would allow them to formulate proposals under existing rulemaking procedures. 
Once submitted to Congress, a taxing regulation would be introduced in both the House and Senate by the Majority Leader. The rule would then be subject to expedited procedures, allowing a prompt decision on whether or not to approve a rule. The rule would have to be approved by both Houses and signed by the President. 
Congress must not allow a federal agency--unelected and unaccountable federal bureaucrats--to determine the amount of taxes hardworking Americans must pay. The Taxpayers' Defense Act will require Congress to stand up and face the American people when it decides to tax. The cry of `no taxation without representation' has gone up in the land before, and today we are hearing it again. It is time that we respond.

Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, today will be a defining day in Washington, DC. It will be a defining day in the Congress of the United States. More specifically, it will be a defining day in the U.S. Senate. 
This is a day on which we will make very important decisions, decisions that will reflect whether or not we believe that government--invasive, bigger, stronger, more consumptive government--is something to be fostered and encouraged, or we are going to say that we believe the people have the ability to make good decisions on their own and that we will not promote a government which will take more and more from the people, leaving them with less and less, not only in terms of resources but leaving them with less and less freedom. 
We are going to be talking about the so-called tobacco bill today, which unfortunately is more of a smokescreen for a tax increase and big government than it is anything else. 
The Democrats have rightly suggested, have appropriately stated, that the fate of this bill really rests in the hands of Republicans. And I believe that those of us who are on the Republican side of this Senate will make decisions, and we will either decide to pass this massive tax increase, to pass and institute this set of bureaucracies, the scale of which has not been seen in a long time in a bill in Washington, DC--we will either decide to pass an invasive sort of intermeddling by the Federal Government in a wide variety of the affairs of individuals, or we will decide that we believe that the appropriate action is not to tax the American people with another $868 billion in tax, is not to create 17 new boards, commissions, and agencies to try to micromanage everything from convenience stores and gas stations up to grocery stores and larger institutions that sell merchandise. 
But the Democrats are right in suggesting that the decision will be made on the Republican side of the aisle. We will make a decision about whether or not to go forward with the tobacco bill, the smokescreen for the world's biggest tax increase this year. I don't know of any proposed tax increase this year that can match this proposed tax increase. And the direction we take will be a test of the way in which we lead, and it will be a test of the Republican leadership of the Senate. 
Republican leadership has a responsibility to lead to Republican ideals and call us to our highest and best as people, and to give us the opportunity to be responsible as individuals and to shrink the size of government, not to expand it, to leave resources in the hands of the people, not sweep them into the coffers of government. 
Our leadership has called upon Don Nickles to manage this bill because the leader of the Republicans and the leader of the Senate has recused himself in large measure from this consideration. I thank Senator Nickles for his outstanding efforts in this respect. I want to commend him for his opposition to this kind of invasion into the lives and pocketbooks of Americans and invasion into the liberties of Americans. 
I want to commend him for his understanding that this is a bill about big government and big taxes, not a bill about teen smoking. I think he has understood from the very beginning that lots of things that might be done to curtail teen smoking aren't even mentioned. There is not even a whiff or a hint; there is not even the smoke that would follow the evidence of that kind of item in the bill. This is not a bill that makes the possession of tobacco by teens illegal, or provides incentives to do the same, or makes illegal the possession of tobacco by people in the District of Columbia. 
If we are really serious about curtailing teen smoking, we might just say to the teens, `You can't have it if it is that evil and that inappropriate.' We have done that with alcohol. We have provided lots of ways in which we provide incentives from the Federal Government for States and others to make sure that young people do not have access to alcohol. That is not a part of this bill. 
Don Nickles has understood this bill, I believe, as a massive tax increase, a big-government explosion, which I think is appropriate in terms of the identification. I want to commend him for his leadership here. 
There is a choice to be made in this bill, and the choice is simple: Is the Senate going to return to tax and spend? Is it going to identify itself with the history of the Congress when it was under Democratic control and authority that the way we handle America is to tax more and spend more and tax more and spend more? Are we going to extend the line of taxation and spending beyond where it already is? 
It is important to note where we have come. We have not just arrived at a place where we are taxing and spending. We have arrived at a place where we are now taxing and spending more than we have ever taxed and spent in the history of the United States of America. Governments take more of the income of Americans at this time in history than ever before. We have to ask ourselves as we look behind the smokescreen of this so-called tobacco bill to see what the real components are. And we find $868 billion--$868 billion--in new taxes. That is not million dollars, that is billion dollars. This is massive, three-quarters of a trillion dollars plus in new taxes. We have to ask ourselves, do we want to extend tax and spend, or do we want to decide that we don't believe that government, with its invasive micromanaging of the lives of individuals and its invasive confiscation of the resources of the individuals--we have to decide, do we really want that to be the way in which we operate? 
This is a defining moment for the Republican-controlled Senate. How will we respond to this question which is squarely before us today? Are we going to be tax-and-spend respecting government, or are we going to say to the American people we protect the people more than we respect government? 
We are not going to allow government to come and sweep out of the resources and freedom of American citizens the kind of resources that are provided for in this bill. 
I think we need to look forward to an era of lower taxes. I think we need to look forward to an era of smaller government. I think we need to look forward to an era of personal responsibility and freedom rather than government intervention and government spending and government taxes. I think we need to look forward to a time when States and communities make decisions and not when we have dictates and mandates and impositions from Washington, DC. 
This is a defining moment. This is a defining moment for us all. If the choice is whether or not we will discontinue consideration, set aside, defeat this massive tax bill, I believe that is exactly what we should do. 
Most Americans have an understanding of what is happening here. They may not have had an understanding when we first started this debate, and you will remember, I think, as I do, when this debate was begun, it was suggested that this entire thing would be just sped through the Senate; that we were going to bring it up the first of the week, and it was going to be over with by the time we left for the Memorial Day recess. 
I looked at the bill, and I was shocked. I said, Wait a second; $868 billion in new taxes, 52 new powers for HHS in Title I alone, Health and Human Services, one Department, 52 new powers, authorities, and responsibilities; 178 new Federal Government powers, far-reaching powers, some with the ability to define and regulate literally whether you could sell cigarettes on the top of the counter, whether they could be in sight, whether they had to be out of sight. And, of course, with small operations like gas stations, when you have a one-room operation, you are just standing out there in the cold, literally in a little glass box. It is hard to have everything out of sight--all those kinds of things. It really stung me that to try and make that consideration in the span of a week was totally inappropriate, and I came to the floor only to find out that there was a plan to table my motion regarding taxes after less than an hour of real consideration, and it was supposed to be disposed of; we were going to sort of dispose of the financial considerations of an $868 billion tax on the American people in an hour. Then we were going to table it and move on to just slam this into a position to say that it was going to be the fate of the American people to accept it. 
That is when I really said to myself, I have to do something to slow this down so that the American people have a chance to see what this is. 
Real leadership is more than just reading the initial poll. The spin doctors of this whole tobacco settlement came in to say how this was really going to punish the tobacco companies. Then you got to reading the fine print, and you found out that there is part of this law which forbids the tobacco companies to make the payments themselves. They must, under the law, pass these charges on to the low-income families that use tobacco. And I say low-income families. I mean it is incredible; this $868 billion tax will fall primarily, massively, heavily on individuals who are very low income. According to the best authorities, 59.4 percent of this $868 billion tax will fall on people who make less than $30,000 a year. 
You say, Well, what is a little more tax to those people? A little more tax. If the family is a two-pack-a day family, it is going to result in something close to $1,500 a year by the time you figure out all the taxes. 
Now, the specific tax that is contained in the bill is $1.10 a pack, but the bipartisan Joint Committee on Tax put it this way: The price will go up from $1.98 to $3.83. Now, if it was just $1.98 plus $1.10, that would take it to $3.08. So what we are talking about is a far bigger increase in the price than just the taxes. And by the time it works its way through the system, the Joint Committee on Tax basically says that individuals will be paying $4.84 a pack as opposed to $1.98 a pack. So we are talking 
about what is just almost a $3 increase per pack. Now, two packs a day is 700 packs a year, roughly, for the family--700 times 3. By the end of this program, we are talking about over a $2,000 tax per year on a two-pack-a-day family. That is substantial. 
Now, who does this fall on? People making less than $30,000 a year. What does this do to their children? What does this do to them? These people are addicted. The whole idea is predicated on addiction. You get this kind of price increase, and you get this kind of revenue only if people are not sensitive to the price, only if they can't quit, only if they maintain their habit. You can't project $868 billion in revenue if you think people are going to quit. So here you have these low-income individuals maybe having as much as $3 per pack by the year 2007, according to the Joint Committee on Tax, $3 per pack extra to pay. That is $1,500 to $2,000 more taken out of the budget of that family, and these are people, 60 percent of them, who earn less than $30,000 a year. 
And the most repugnant of the figures that they provide is that 44 1/2 percent of the people paying this tax will earn less than $10,000 a year. This is a tax to fall upon those who are least capable of paying. 
When Ronald Reagan was President, he was known to attract to the Republican side of the equation individuals called Reagan Democrats, hard-working people who wanted to help their families, individuals who worked in trades or worked as laborers, who just worked hard. They worked and they earned less than $30,000 a year, but they had values. They wanted to take care of their families. They wanted to be able to provide for them. And here is the question: Today is a defining moment for the Republican Party. Is the Republican Party going to say to those kinds of individuals, if you made a choice to smoke at some time in your life and now you are addicted, we are going to tax you so that it is going to be virtually impossible for you to have the kind of standard of living you previously had, and we are going to do this because you have been victimized by the tobacco companies. We are not punishing the tobacco companies. We are going to make them pass the tax on to you. We are going make sure the statute provides a penalty that you have to be the person who pays the tax. 
It is a defining moment for the Republican Party, in my view. I do not want the Republican Party to be defined as more taxes and more spending and more government and less responsibility for individuals and less freedom. It seems to me that there is the potential for us to be defined that way. We are not talking about this $868 billion tax increase in a vacuum. We have a Republican Senate with this bill in its hands as to whether or not we are going to tax people by an additional amount, and we are talking about this in the context of a surplus. 
It is stunning to me to think that instead of debating how we can return resources to the American people, we find that we are focusing on a bill on how to take another $868 billion from the American people. And it does define the Republican Party. It defines the Republican Senate. I think this is a day which will define us very clearly. 
Are we in favor, when faced with a $39 billion surplus, of taxing people with $868 billion more in taxes, to fall heavily on those who are least capable of paying for it, or are we in favor of saying no more new taxes; that we do not believe in a big tax-and-spend philosophy; that we are against invasive micromanaging, an intermeddling Federal involvement in everything; that we are in favor of personal freedom, personal responsibility, State and local government potentials, and we reject the idea that in the face of a $39 billion surplus we have to go and add to the tax bill of the American people another $868 billion over the course of this legislation. 
I think we need to debate how to give people a tax break. We should not be debating how we are going to tax people hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of billions, three-quarters of a trillion dollars more than we have already taxed them. 
People talk about the addictive quality of nicotine. I think tax and spend in the Congress is more addicting than nicotine. I think the clear question the American people are going to ask this Senate, they are going to ask the Republicans in the Senate: Did you break the habit? Did you break the tax-and-spend addiction of Government? Did you come to respect people or to protect the bureaucracy? 
Did you come to say that we are going to let people continue to have freedom, we are going to ask them to be responsible, we are going to let them have their resources and spend their resources on their families? Or did you come to say the Government is so capable, in Washington, that it is going to sweep these resources out of the pockets of Americans? 
We simply cannot have the largest proposed increase in Government since the Clinton national health care plan--17 new boards, agencies, commissions. Here are some of the things that are going to happen: Mr. President, $350 million a year is going to be taken from these Americans, hard-working, low-income Americans--$350 million. That averages $7 million per State; large States, small States. It is going to be swept out of their pockets and gone for what? 
Mr. President, $350 million a year goes to foreign governments overseas so they can conduct studies on what it costs to smoke overseas. I cannot believe the Republican Party wants to be identified with that kind of expropriation. We take the money out of the pockets of Republicans and Democrats--Americans, low-income workers, and we send it overseas so they can conduct studies about smoking. 
This bill contains a special provision that relates to smoking in the Native American population. If you figure reasonable rates of smoking for them, it is $18,000 per Native American that we are going to spend in this program. It does not make sense, to be taking money from low-income Americans in order to do that. 
These are just examples of the way this is a lavish bill, of spend and spend and more government and more government. It is only possible if you tax and tax $868 billion for 178 new Federal Government powers. 
It is time for Congress to do what we know to be right, what we know to be true, what we know to be noble; that is, to respect the American people, not protect the Government bureaucracy. The majority leader has called this bill too complicated and too expensive. I call upon the majority leader to lead the American people to the right conclusion by leading the Republican Senate to the right identification with the people against big government rather than with the bureaucracy and against the people. We should pull this bill off the Senate floor. It is a massive tax-and-spend bill. Perhaps more addictive than nicotine is the urge of Government to tax and spend and regulate. It is time for us to break the habit. 
I call upon our leadership to lead, to lead us to do that which is right for the American people. Mr. President, $868 billion in new taxes are not going to help American families. They are going to distress a number of families to the extent that they lose their independence and their capacity to provide for themselves. If we end up making wards of the State and Federal Government of more low-income families in America, we will have done this Nation a massive disservice. It is time for us to set aside the smokescreen, to identify this bill as tax and spend, and for us to reject it thoroughly. 
I call upon our leadership to lead us in that respect. 
Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, this bill may be about tobacco and about smoking, but I think it is more about a smokescreen. Constantly, it is suggested that this is a bill which penalizes tobacco, but the tax falls upon the American people. There is a specific provision in this bill that requires that the $868 billion assessment goes to the consumer. Sixty percent of those people earn less than $30,000 a year and 44 percent earn less than $10,000 a year. 
This is not a hit on the tobacco companies for that money. There is a requirement in the bill that the money be collected from these hard-working, low-income Americans. This is a massive tax on low-income Americans, and it is used to proliferate the bureaucracy of this Government--17 new boards, commissions, and agencies, and hundreds of new functions and responsibilities. 
It is time for us to say no. When it comes to a habit that needs to be broken, the tax-and-spend habit of the U.S. Congress must be broken. Here it is time for Congress to break the habit. That $868 billion in new taxes that will be focused upon hard-working Americans to fund Government programs, including a $350 million annual disbursement to foreign countries to conduct studies of smoking, is not what the American people expect. 
This is tax and spend. This is Government bureaucracy. It is time for us to stop and give the American people tax relief instead of the kind of burden that this bill imposes. 
I reserve the remainder of the time.

Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I have been involved in the debate regarding encryption technology and privacy for more than three years now. In the course of that time I have not seen any real attempt by the White House to resolve this problem. In fact, over the course of that time the Administration has moved further from negotiation by taking increasingly extreme positions on this critical national issue.

Mr. ASHCROFT. Our technology companies need to be able to compete effectively. Without reasonable export laws our technology sector will be seriously harmed. More encryption companies will leave 
the country so they are free to sell their products around the globe as well as within the United States. Make no mistake, the market will not be denied. Today, robust encryption products from Canada, Japan, Germany and elsewhere are being sold on the world market. You have heard of the companies that are manufacturing and selling encryption. They are Nortel, Nippon and Seimens. These are not upstart companies. They are substantial players on the international scene, and they offer encryption products that are technically and financially competitive with those produced in the U.S.

Mr. ASHCROFT. That is absolutely correct. The Administration's encryption policy is, in effect, a tax on American consumers. We owe it to these customers and the innovators in the software industry to reform this encryption policy now. From the birth of the United States, this country has been a world leader in innovation, creativity, entrepreneurship, vision and opportunity. Today all of these American attributes are on display in our technology sector. Whether in telecommunications, or computer hardware or software, the United States has maintained a leadership position because of the opportunities afforded to people with the vision, determination and responsibility to reach for their highest and best. We must work diligently to ensure that ample opportunities are maintained in this country for our technology sector to continue to thrive and innovate. If companies are stifled and cannot compete, then the people, the ideas, the jobs, and the economic growth will simply go elsewhere.

Mr. ASHCROFT. If this issue is not resolved, and resolved soon, we will lose this industry, we will lose our leadership position in technology, and our national security will suffer. We have a choice to make as policy makers--do we allow our companies to compete internationally or do we force them, by our antiquated and ill-conceived government policy, to move overseas. We cannot simply ignore the reality that robust encryption exists in the international marketplace now. Instead, we must allow our companies to compete, and do so now. We cannot allow extraneous issues to stand in the way of remedying the deficiencies with our current approach to encryption. We must recognize that keeping the encryption industry on American shores is the best way to ensure national security. We would not think of allowing all our defense industries to move abroad. By the same token, we should not force the encryption industry abroad through outdated policies. Simply put, strong encryption means a strong economy and a strong country. This concern is just one of the many reasons we need to pass effective encryption legislation this year and just one of the reasons that Senator Leahy and I recently drafted the E-PRIVACY bill, S. 2067.

 Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, the economist Milton Friedman once wrote: `Underlying most arguments against a free market is a lack of belief in freedom itself.' Demonstrating its belief in freedom the 104th Congress passed the pro-competition Telecommunications Act of 1996. The Hudson Institute has recently released a study of the cable industry since the new law has taken effect. The study has found what those of us that believe in a free market have always known: consumers reap the benefits of open competition. I submit it for the Record a copy of the executive summary for review. It is a pleasure to deliver further affirmation of the free market system.

Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, it is with great pleasure that I rise today to recognize the Leadership Training Institute (LTI), a summer camp being held in Bolivar, Missouri this week. LTI is challenging America's youth to reach for personal excellence and to lead their generation to an ever higher standard of morality and achievement than the generation before them. The United States has seen success because individuals have the opportunity to set standards that define their highest and best. 
Leaders have the opportunity to be both `intensive' and `extensive.' Intensive leadership is influencing towards excellence those that are closest to you--your family and friends. Extensive leadership is reaching beyond to your community, culture, and even the world. My hope for today's youth--and those participating in this week's leadership training--is that they will take the opportunity to be leaders close to home and beyond. 
Programs that guide youth in setting the highest standards for their lives are essential to the continuity of morality in our culture and the setting of our sights on the noble. God has given principles which turn our eyes from the temporal, the physical, and the menial to the eternal, the spiritual, and the noble. 
The Leadership Training Institute is headquartered in Arkansas and its staff and participants come from many communities across America, including from my home state of Missouri. LTI is committed to training youth in the virtues which leaders such as Thomas Jefferson considered to constitute the moral fabric of our society: `With a firm reliance on the protection of the Divine Providence; we mutually pledge to each other, our lives, our fortunes, and our sacred honor.' 
LTI educates youth in the lessons of our Nation's founders --their experiences, wisdom, and legacies. Youth learn that good leaders are people of faith as well as people of science. This training in American heritage and ingenuity prepares today's youth to set an excellent example in their homes, schools, communities, and government. 
I am proud to see the staff and supporters of the Leadership Training Institute challenging America's youth to lead by personal standards of excellence. Hopefully, the participants of the program this week in Bolivar, Missouri, will set goals to become the leaders that remind us of all that is good in our country by advancing those values in their own lives.

Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, on many occasions, I have come to the Senate floor to talk about the importance of parental control and involvement in a child's education. Study after study has confirmed that parental involvement is the single most important element in educational achievement. 
One way to allow parents more control over and involvement in their children's education is to give them more choices of where to send their children to school. Choice empowers parents. It puts them in the driver's seat instead of the nickel seats. I believe we want parents in those front seats. 
Education is an important tool that our children need in order to survive and be successful in our society. It is sad to realize that for too many children in too many families, a safe, structured and challenging education is out of reach. The public schools in many of our major cities simply cannot or do not provide adequate education, while a private or parochial education is too costly for most families of modest means. 
On the other hand, it is encouraging when individuals in our society step forward to provide the means for better educational opportunities for our nation's underprivileged children. When those in the private sector, through their charitable giving, open the door for kids to receive a high quality education, those individuals are to be commended. 
I am pleased to say that last week, two very generous and compassionate Americans gave new hope to thousands of families across the country who want the same thing all of us want--the best possible education for their children. 
Ted Forstmann and John Walton are businessmen, entrepreneurs and philanthropists. On June 9, they launched the Children's Scholarship Fund, which will provide scholarships to bright and deserving children from low-income families across the nation to help their parents send them to any private or parochial school they're academically qualified to attend--from kindergarten right through high school. Thanks to these individuals, new educational opportunities will now be available to thousands of youngsters that were not available before. 
These two civic-minded Americans have given the fund quite a start, with an initial contribution of $100 million dollars. Over the summer, they will select cities to become partners with the fund, lining up donors in each city to match their initial generosity. That will allow this new and exciting program to distribute more than $200 million in scholarships in more than a dozen cities, with each scholarship being an opportunity for a child to prepare for a better and brighter future. 
This national program is modeled after--and really inspired by--an effort Mr. Forstmann and Mr. Walton launched here in the city of Washington, D.C. earlier this year. Together they donated $6 million to the Washington Scholarship Fund, which recently awarded scholarships to more than 1,000 students from the troubled District of Columbia public schools. Washington is one of about thirty privately-funded scholarship programs in the country. The fact that there are so many of these programs speaks volumes, I think, about the state of the public schools in many of our cities. 
I mention the Washington program because I think it's a good example of what the national effort is all about. First, the Washington Scholarship Fund is locally-based and locally-run. Mr. Forstmann is right when he insists that each program must have strong involvement from local officials, community leaders, local businesses and anyone else who wants to help kids obtain the best education. I have always believed that local neighborhoods and communities are in the best position to create solutions to meet the specific needs of individuals in their communities. 
The Children's Scholarship Fund is already in contact with more than 300 mayors from all around the country. This is the first step in selecting partners who know what's needed in their community and who will support this program financially and with their hard work. 
But perhaps more important than the scholarships themselves is what they represent. it's important--and maybe even a bit sad--to note that more than seventy-five hundred families here in the Nation's Capitol applied for those 1,000 scholarships. It took a lottery to give them out. Mr. Forstmann has said he never dreamed the demand would be so overwhelming. 
Who are these families? They're families whose children are trapped in public school systems that offer them no choices. If students only have one choice of where to attend school, they are locked into that school and don't have the capacity to say I am going to do better, I will go elsewhere. 
On the other hand, when students have more choices of where to attend school, they will have the ability to receive a higher quality, more rigorous education. The Children's Scholarship Fund provides children and their families with more educational choice. 
I believe that providing more educational choices for families can even help our nation's public schools, because they will understand they are no longer the exclusive provider of education in their community. They will have to start becoming the creative supplier of what it is that students need. When you have diversity and pluralism in a school system by providing more choices for students, this creates energy, creativity, and quality when institutions know that they have to do their best for to compete for students. 
I commend Mr. Forstmann and Mr. Walton for providing the opportunity for our nation's children to have greater choices of where to receive their education, giving them the chance to learn as much as their minds and hard work will allow. 
Education is an investment in future citizens, future leaders, the future work force of America. Ted Forstmann and John Walton have made a profound investment in the nation's future, one that is worthy of our admiration and gratitude.

Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I rise today to join Senator Hatch in introducing the Judicial Improvement Act of 1998. Many of the provisions of this bill stem from a series of hearings I held in the Subcommittee on the Constitution, Federalism and Property Rights last summer addressing the problem of judicial activism. The hearings focused on the problem of judicial activism and its impact. The Subcommittee heard testimony from a variety of individuals, from constitutional scholars to victims of activist judicial orders. The final hearing of the series focused on potential solutions to the problem of activism. 
That final hearing canvassed potential solutions ranging from proposed constitutional amendments, to increased public education efforts about the problem of judicial activism, to proposed statutory solutions. The hearings convinced me that, at a minimum, we needed to provide some procedural mechanisms to make it more difficult for any single judge to issue an activist order and to make it easier for litigants to force the reconsideration of activist orders. 
Since the close of the hearings, I have been working with others on the Judiciary Committee to fashion legislation that would accomplish these goals. Last fall, I circulated draft language concerning the three legislative proposals that remain my top priorities in this area--requiring a three-judge panel before a federal court can strike down a state initiative or an act of Congress as unconstitutional, expanding provisions of the Prison Litigation Reform Act to cover other local and state institutions, and codifying a flat prohibition on federal court orders directly increasing taxes. With the help of Chairman Hatch, Senator Abraham and others on the Committee, we have added many additional provisions and drafted a comprehensive bill aimed at improving the federal judiciary. Although I would not have included every provision in the bill had I introduced my own bill, the bill reflects the collective work of the Committee and would substantially improve the workings of the federal judiciary. 
Let me take a few moments to discuss the provisions that are critical to addressing the problem of judicial activism. First and foremost, the bill addresses the problem of having a single federal judge strike down a state referendum as unconstitutional. Nothing highlights the undemocratic power of a federal judge more strikingly than when a single unelected federal judge invalidates a law passed by the general public through the initiative process. Even the Ninth Circuit, the epicenter of judicial activism in America, has acknowledged the strain that a single judge's nullification of an initiative places on our political system. As the court recently noted in an opinion reversing such a single-judge nullification: `A system which permits one judge to block with the stroke of a pen what 4,736,180 state residents voted to enact as law tests the integrity of our constitutional democracy.' The Coalition for Economic Equality v. Wilson, 122 F.3d 692, 699 (9th Cir.), (cert. denied, 118 S. Ct. 397 (1997). 
The three-judge panel ameliorates this problem by requiring that a three-judge panel be convened, and a majority of the panel agree, before a state initiative can be enjoined. The provision then addresses the problem of the popular will being preliminarily enjoined for long periods of time before a final appealable decision is issued by providing for an expedited review of the injunction. 
The three-judge panel provision recognizes that there may be situations in which state initiatives run afoul of the Constitution and courts may need to declare them unconstitutional. But the bill also recognized that when a federal court takes such an action, it can cause considerable frustration and friction. The bill attempts to minimize such friction by ensuring that a federal court complies with a number of safeguards before taking such a drastic action. 
A second key provision in the bill extends some of the protections included in the Prison Litigation Reform Act to other state and local government institutions. During the hearings, I heard over and over about the frustration of state and local officials who are saddled with consent decrees entered into decades ago that allow unelected federal judges--rather than elected local officials--to run local institutions. The bill addresses this problem by requiring the periodic reconsideration of such consent decrees or structural injunctions to ensure that they remain necessary to remedy a constitutional violation. Once again, the bill recognizes that our federal Constitution and federal system of government may require federal courts to issue injunctions covering state and local institutions, but also acknowledges that such sweeping injunctions create friction with local officials. The best way to limit such friction is to provide a mechanism to ensure that the injunctions remain necessary to remedy a constitutional violation. This bill does that. 
Another key provision of particular importance to my constituents back in Missouri is the flat prohibition on federal court orders directly raising or imposing taxes. The people of Kansas City have suffered through the activism of federal District Judge Russell Clark, including his order directly ordering local authorities to increase taxes. This provision directly attacks such judicial tyranny. Importantly, however, the bill leave the federal court's power to order remedies that may lead a local or state government to raise taxes. But the ultimate decision of whether to raise taxes, raise revenue through other means or cut spending remains that the local authorities. 
A final point should be made about all three of these provisions: they apply only to federal courts. The procedures and remedial authority of state courts remain unaffected. During the Subcommittee hearings a number of people offered suggestions to make the federal courts more directly responsive to the people. In attempting to improve the federal courts, we cannot lose sight of the fact that under our federal system we have both federal courts and state courts of general jurisdiction which are fully capable of hearing federal claims. State courts, moreover, are much more responsible to the people--in the majority of States they are subject to direct elections or retention elections. 
This bill recognizes the comparative advantages of these two court systems and tries to limit the availability of those remedies that are the most intrusive in the courts that are least responsible to the people. If people are really convinced that courts must levy taxes and run state and local institutions in perpetuity (and I, for one, am not convinced such measures are every necessary), then at least the courts that do so should be relatively responsive state courts, rather than unelected, life-tenured federal judges. 
Before I close, let me mention a few other provisions of the bill that are of particular importance to me. First, the bill contains a provision that makes it clear that the same standards for judging the admissibility of confessions that Congress created for federal criminal trials should also apply when federal courts engage in collateral review of state and federal convictions. This provision reinforces that the touchstone for admissibility should be the voluntariness of the confession and that a technical violation should not free a convicted prisoner on collateral review. 
Second, the bill includes a provision similar to one in legislation introduced by Senator Specter, which I have co-sponsored, which prevents a federal court from barring local authorities for ordering a retrial of a convicted authority. The traditional remedy in a habeas proceeding is release from custody. Taking the further step of barring retrial goes beyond the traditional office of the writ and is an affront to state courts and prosecutors. 
Finally, the bill appropriately limits the practice of releasing prisoners early as a judicial remedy. Perhaps, the most poignant testimony in the Subcommittee hearings concerned family whose son, Danny Boyle, was killed by an arrested felon, who but for a prison release order would have been behind bars. Danny was a promising young police officer whose life and career were cut short--a victim of judicial activism. I am committed to working to ensure that another family does not have to come before a future Subcommittee hearing with similar testimony about a son or daughter. 
I want to thank Chairman Hatch and Senator Abraham for working with me to get these provisions included in the bill. I look forward to working with them to ensure that this bill moves forward and that we take these modest steps to improve the federal judiciary.

 Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I am proud to have this opportunity to recognize a company that truly reflects the spirit, goals and achievements of a true `American success story' as hailed by President Ronald Reagan in 1987. Today, Harley-Davidson Motor Company is an even more outstanding example of American ingenuity and performance. They have seen record earnings 31 of the last 32 quarters--a prime example of their strength as a business. They have seen 32 consecutive quarters of record sales--clearly demonstrating the loyalty of their consumer base. 
Harley-Davidson produces its entire line of the very popular Sportster motorcycle in Kansas City, Missouri. They opened the doors of this facility months ahead of schedule, and are already employing hundreds of Missourians. This is evidence of the positive path of growth and expansion of Harley-Davidson. The U.S. market share for Harley continues to grow; today it is 56 percent. Harley also has a great future in the international marketplace and the company is seeing increasing demand for its products in Europe, Japan, Australia, and other countries. 
Harley has long been a leader in design and safety standards. As early as 1921, Harley-Davidson bikes incorporated advancements that are still in use today. Twenty years later, during World War II, Harley devoted its entire output of motorcycles to the war effort earned the coveted Army-Navy `E' award for excellence in wartime production. 
In many ways, Harley-Davidson has freed generations of American rider to enjoy this country by motorcycle. As Harley-Davidson approaches its hallmark 95th anniversary as a producer of quality American goods, I want to be among the first of the long list of well wishers to say, `Happy Anniversary, Harley! You're still `king of the road!'

Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I am pleased to have this opportunity to speak briefly against restraining the debate by invoking cloture here. There are too many outstanding issues to invoke cloture and to amend or stop the debate and amendment process. I rise today to oppose invoking cloture on the tobacco bill. A vote to invoke cloture, a vote to cut off debate on this massive legislation, is a vote in favor of a massive tax increase. It is a vote against tax relief, a vote against fighting illegal drug use in this country. I doubt whether those who are not keenly familiar with the procedures of the Senate would understand that when you invoke cloture, you limit amendments, and if you invoke cloture at this time--if we were to vote to invoke cloture today, we would basically be saying that we could not include in this bill any antidrug measures, we could not include in this bill any tax relief. 
I think it is clear that the American people are beginning to learn what this bill is about. The American people are beginning to understand what $868 billion in new taxes really means. They are beginning to understand that there are boards and commissions and new iterations of the Federal Government, of the National Government, dictating activity in this bill, and it is time for us to continue the debate. The American people are beginning to learn that there is foreign aid in this bill, that there is $350 million a year in foreign aid just to provide for studies in foreign countries of the impact of smoking in those countries. 
This legislation is almost 500 pages long. It is quite possibly an attempt at the largest expansion of government since the ill-fated Health Security Act, President Clinton's attempt to take over one-seventh of the U.S. economy in the health care measure. And, while we have spent several weeks on this bill, we have not begun to scratch the surface of this 480-page bill. 
As I believe others who will be coming to the floor will show, you will find a bill like this is very complex. As I mentioned, the kinds of foreign aid measures, the kinds of things virtually unrelated to any benefit people in this United States could expect to receive from this bill are tucked into the nooks and crannies of this bill. It is no wonder people do not want further amendments. It is no wonder they want to curtail debate. But I think it is time we continue to have debate. We have spent several weeks on this bill. We have not begun to scratch the surface. There are issues that we have discussed but haven't voted on and issues that have yet to have a full and fair debate. On Friday, over 100 amendments were filed to this bill. More than 30 Members of this body have filed amendments to this bill. We should not curtail the discussion of this bill by invoking cloture. 
Many important issues will not be addressed if cloture is invoked. If cloture is invoked, many of those amendments--the antidrug amendment and the tax cut amendments--would be ruled nongermane and would not be allowed to be considered. Some say this is legislation that is dead or dying and cloture is needed to salvage this legislation. That is the mindset of people who are afraid that the details of the legislation will be exposed to the American people and, as a result, the American people will no longer support the measure. That is the mindset of people who are afraid the American people will learn that this bill in fact 
contains a massive tax increase, $868 billion, and it is focused, 60 percent of it, on people who earn less than $30,000 a year. 
The American people have a right to know what is in this bill, and we have only begun educating the American people about the bill and debating the important issues. We have had only 5 votes on amendments to this legislation, 3 motions to table that were agreed to and 2 that were not--a bill of almost 500 pages and only 5 votes so far. We have not even begun to discuss the controversial provisions regarding tobacco farmers. We have just begun to talk more about the serious problem of illegal drug use by teenagers and the fact that most parents are far more concerned about that than they are about smoking. 
We have yet to vote on any amendment to provide relief from the discriminatory marriage penalty. I know there are several Senators who have amendments to address this tax penalty, including the minority leader, who has expressed that. Of course, I have a measure in this respect, as does the Senator from Texas and the Senator from New Mexico. But this cloture motion would put an end to these discussions. I ask my friends who filed this motion, what are they afraid of? Why won't they allow full and fair debate on this bill? What are they afraid of, that the American people will find out that is included in this legislation? 
I believe if we are going to raise the kind of taxes that are included in this bill, we need to have a complete and open debate. Unfortunately, some from the beginning have tried to hide the tax increase. The Commerce Committee--I was a member of the committee, but I was the only one to vote against this bill--simply refused to call this a tax; instead, they called it a penalty on the tobacco companies, but put in the bill a requirement that the tobacco companies would pass it on to the American people. Thankfully, what we call something will not change its real character. If it is a tax, it is a tax, whether we call it that or not. The Finance Committee at least had the integrity to say it was a tax and that this is a massive tax increase on the American people. 
The fact that the bill requires this to be paid by the American people, by consumers, not the tobacco companies, is something the American people deserve to know. This is a bill that is designed, at least in the minds of many people, to somehow punish the tobacco companies. But there is a mandate in the legislation that requires that the tax be passed through to the consumer. Tobacco companies will be fined if they don't pass the price increase on to the addicted consumers, and of course this tax does fall most heavily on those who are least able to pay it, those earning less than $30,000 a year. 
Using data provided by the Centers for Disease Control, this tobacco legislation will be an annual $382 million tax increase on individuals in my home State--a $382 million tax increase on Missourians. That is more than $3 million per county in my State. Roughly $227 million of that amount would be paid by individuals in households of less than $30,000. 
It is clear we should not invoke cloture. Invoking cloture would curtail the availability of amendments relating to drug use. It would curtail the availability of amendments relating to tax relief. In the face of a tax measure which potentially would add $860-plus billion to the tax responsibilities of the people of this country, I believe we should maintain our ability to talk about tax relief in the same legislation. 
With that in mind, I oppose the invoking of cloture here. I think it is bad judgment. It curtails discussion unnecessarily and unduly. It would provide for the masking of the real character of this legislation from the American people when the American people have every right to know and learn about the full nature of this measure. 
I thank the Chair for this opportunity to speak, and I yield the floor.

Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, in America today, a great debate--a great division--exists over the issue of abortion. For some, abortion is about the so-called `right to choose.' For others, it is ultimately about control. For me, it is about something completely different. It is about life. 
Abortion is, at its core, about the destruction of an innocent human life; a life that is unique in the history of the world--formed and shaped in the image of God; a life that has never been and will never be again. 
`Abortion,' said the late Mother Teresa, `is the great destroyer.' And so it is. More than thirty-five million lives have been lost in the terrible years since Roe versus Wade became the law of the land. It is a tragedy unmatched in modern times. For mother, for father, for child, abortion is never a real resolution. It is but a temporary answer that inflicts a permanent pain. It is a wound that does not heal; a wound, alas, that cannot heal. 
Senator Smith and I come to the floor this morning to stand against abortion and to stand for life. For we believe that the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution protect every person's `life.' The protection designed by James Madison and adopted by the People is universal in scope. Its protection is unequivocal. It admits of no exception. `No Person shall . . . be deprived of life.' 
As this is the Constitution's `plain meaning,' I believe our proposed Human Life Act is a legitimate exercise of Congressional power under Section Five of the Fourteenth Amendment. However, while I support a statutory approach, I would, as I said before Senator East's Judiciary Subcommittee in 1981, go farther. For I also believe it necessary to amend the United States Constitution to restore its original meaning. 
Mr. President, the Supreme Court's efforts to create an abortion jurisprudence from whole cloth demonstrate the difficulty of deviating from the view that life begins at conception. Every judicial effort to establish a time when constitutional protections magically kick in has been undermined by medical reality. 
Earlier this year, I held a Constitution Subcommittee hearing to mark a profoundly sad occasion--the 25th anniversary of Roe versus Wade. At that hearing, we heard testimony about the relentless progress of medical technology in pushing forward the date of viability. 
More recently, we have learned how judges in striking down bans on partial birth abortions have undermined birth as a clear line for when the constitutional protection for life begins--effectively legalizing infanticide. 
Clearly, the Supreme Court, unguided by any constitutional text, has written themselves into a position that is legally, medically and morally incoherent. The experience of the past twenty-five years confirms the desperate need for the legislation and the proposed amendment we introduce today. 
In thinking about this morning, I was reminded of my first run for Congress. I supported a Human Life Amendment in 1972--fully a year before Roe versus Wade was handed down. In 1981, as Missouri Attorney General, I argued before the United States Supreme Court on behalf of the unborn in Planned Parenthood versus Ashcroft. As Governor, I signed the pro-life law which became the basis for the Webster decision. And so, like Senator Smith and Senator Helms, I am not a newcomer to this debate. 
But I stand before the Senate this morning not to discuss my past, but to talk about our future--about the kind of America we want to have in the next century. 
Abortion makes a statement not only about the life of the unborn child, it makes a statement about the life it leaves behind. Sadly, it sends a message that life is expendable: life that is too young, too old, ailing, or tenuous. It says, `You are worthless.' It says, `You are not important.' 
To all who might hear my voice, I say, `That is not the kind of statement America wants to make.' It is not the message American wants to send. It is not the kind of America we want to be. Recall Deuteronomy, `I have set before thee this day, life and death, blessing and cursing; therefore, choose life that both thou and thy seed may live.' That both thou and thy seed may live, Mr. President. For an America that can be again--America the beautiful.

Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I am pleased to have an opportunity to participate in this debate regarding the so-called tobacco settlement. My understanding of this bill does not comport with the understanding that has been recently voiced on this floor by the Senator from Massachusetts. It appears to me this bill, which is a very comprehensive bill, the dimensions of which are so substantial that they deserve clear inspection--we are talking about a major piece of legislation, a tobacco bill which includes this kind of specificity. We are talking about a bill that has 17 new boards and commissions. We are talking about a bill that would add taxes of about $885 billion at the maximum over the course and life of the bill to the budgets of Americans. These aren't costs that go to the tobacco company. These will be additional costs to the people. 
I question whether or not this kind of bill deserves the full examination and the full discussion of this Senate; that is a serious question. I have a suspicion that some individuals want to curtail debate on this bill because the bill is finally being seen. There is a dawning. The light of day is beginning to shine on this bill. The American people are seeing that 98 percent of the people are being taxed, while only 2 percent of the teens smoke. 
The 98 percent of the people that are being taxed are having their costs go up astronomically. Not only are they having their costs go up astronomically, they are having their costs go up on an assumption that if you raise the cost of cigarettes by 10 percent, you get a 7-percent decrease in the amount of utilization by young people. That is an assumption that the studies do not bear out. As a matter of fact, the most recent studies indicate that an increased cost of cigarettes will not curtail young people from smoking. It is simply not the case. At best, the studies are inconclusive. At worse, they show that there is little correlation between a price increase and reduction in youth smoking. 
Let me give you some statistics about this. The Cornell study was a study that followed 13,000 children for 4 years. This was not something that was cooked up and done in response to the tobacco industry, or someone like that. It was done at Cornell University, and it was a National Cancer Institute-funded study, so that the funding for this study is credible funding. Here is what the study found: 
. . . little evidence that taxes reduce smoking onset between 8th and 12th grade. 
So in that critical exposure period between 8th and 12th grade in school, there is very little evidence that increased taxes would reduce the kind of growth in the numbers of individuals smoking. The economists that conducted this study presented their results on the relationship between higher tobacco taxes and youth smoking to the American Economics Association at their annual meeting in January of 1998. This is a current study. This studied young people and the way they respond in the modern culture. It concluded that higher taxes have little effect on whether young people start to smoke. Little effect. 
Here is what the study concluded: 
Taxes are not as salient to youth smoking decisions as are individual characteristics and family background. 
In other words, whether children begin smoking doesn't relate to taxes near as much as it does to family background and characteristics of the children. 
This study, which followed 13,000 young people for 4 years, says: 
We find little evidence that taxes reduce smoking onset between 8th and 12th grades. 
They estimated that a $1.50 tax increase would decrease the smoking onset by only about 2 percentage points, from 21.6 percent of the 12th graders to 19.6 percent of the 12th graders. 
When you suggest that the change in the smoking habits would be that small--they had to conclude as follows, and I will quote from the report of Cornell University, a report funded by the National Cancer Institute, which put it this way: 
Our data allow us to directly examine the impact of changes in tax rates on youth smoking behavior . . . 
In other words, they said they had enough data to draw conclusions. 
. . . and our preliminary results indicate this impact is small or nonexistent. 
So this massive tax increase--$868 billion to a new estimate of $885 billion--on the American people, over the course of the life of this settlement, is supposed to produce some kind of a reduced incidence of youth smoking. Yet, the very best data from the latest studies, sponsored not by the tobacco people, but by the National Cancer Institute--a 4-year study--indicates that the taxes would have a small or nonexistent affect. 
That reveals what this bill is all about. It is about big Government. It is about big taxes. It is about new agencies. It is about an invasion of the taxpayers' pockets. It is striking to note that there is $350 million a year in this bill. And with the 50 States, that is $7 million per State. That is $7 million per State, on an average, that goes overseas to fund studies in foreign countries about how costly cigarette smoking is in those cultures. 
For the life of me, I can't figure out why we want to have 
Government bureaucracy, funded by a tax on the lower income people of the United States of America, to make it possible for Third World countries and others overseas to have studies on how costly smoking is in their culture. A number of individuals would prefer that they have it not be so costly here. The truth of the matter is that 59.4 percent of all the individuals who will be paying this tax, according to the best estimates we have, will be individuals whose income is less than $30,000 a year. 
So we have a massive tax bill, three-quarters of a trillion dollars, focused on the lowest income people in America, on the presumption that it will curtail smoking among young people. But the best academic research we have indicates that young people are not sensitive to price. As a matter of fact, the study conducted by Cornell University, funded by the National Cancer Institute, indicated that there is little or nonexistent impact by that kind of tax in terms of curtailing smoking by young people. This is a study done by the folks at Cornell University, which is a well-respected institution. We would expect that the National Cancer Institute would fund a study that is fairly done. It studied a lot of children, and 4 years is a long period of time. We would not expect this study to have been done in a slipshod manner. It does come to the conclusion that indicates this isn't a very productive way to try to curtail youth smoking. The economists stated the study raises doubt about the claim that tax or price increases can substantially reduce youth smoking. 
Well, obviously, there are very serious doubts. But there is no doubt about what this bill is about. It is about an $885 billion increase in the taxes to be focused on low-income individuals in the United States. 
Let me just cite another study. Economists at the University of Maryland and the University of Chicago conducted a similar study that analyzed data concerning more than 250,000 high school seniors for the period from 1977 to 1992. Now, this is a longitudinal study; you get from 1977 to 1992, so it is a 15-year-long study. This is the largest sample ever used for a study on the subject. So you have a quarter of a million students studied over a 15-year period. 
Here is what they found. They found the relationship between price and youth consumption is `substantially smaller' than suggested by previous studies. 
In addition, not only do we have the Cornell study on this idea that you can reduce smoking by 7 percent with a 10-percent price increase, which says that it is nonexistent or would have little impact at all, but this other study was done by the University of Maryland and the University of Chicago over a 15-year period on a quarter of a million students. It says there is a substantially smaller than previously suggested link between taxes and smoking. 
Many of us could just look at the circumstances that we see around us and have an idea that price isn't the primary objective or consciousness on the part of young people. When we look at young people wearing $140 tennis shoes because they have a certain logo on them, I think we can get the idea that there is something in addition to price here; there is status and statement, which are very important to young people. Price becomes irrelevant in the context of status and statement. 
Let's get out of the area of studies and look at what happened when price increases have been put into effect. In 1989, California raised its cigarette excise tax by 25 cents per pack, but there is no evidence that cigarette smoking declined. Now, this was an 11 percent increase of the tax. That is a major increase. If we were to see that kind of increase, we would expect there to be a decline. No evidence of a decline. As of 1994, researchers were `unable to identify a decline in prevalence [among 16- to-18-year-olds] associated with the imposition of the excise tax.' 
In Canada--and this is the most commonly cited arena cited by those who want to have this massive settlement imposed on the American people at the cost of more than three-quarters of a trillion dollars to the people. In Canada, our neighbor to the north, the federal government increased cigarette taxes in several stages in the late 1980s and early 1990s--from $10.75 per thousand cigarettes to $24.34 in 1986 per thousand cigarettes, then to $38.77 in 1989 per thousand cigarettes, and then to $62.90 in 1991 per thousand cigarettes. 
So you go from $10 per thousand, or about a penny a cigarette, to 6 or 7 cents per cigarette, over the period of time. So you had an increase, at first, of a penny per cigarette, and then an increase of 6 cents per cigarette. Although it has been stated on the floor by proponents of this legislation that smoking decreased during that period, they failed to talk about the years 1991 to 1994. 
Here is what happened. When the tax rates were the highest in that nation's history, and when the tax rates were the highest in that nation's history during that period, smoking rates among 15- to 19-year-olds rose from 21 to 27 percent. That is a 25-percent increase--more than a 25-percent increase in the number of teens smoking at the time when the cost of cigarettes was at the highest in history. Frankly, when the cost of cigarettes in Canada was at the highest in history, I think it is pretty clear from the testimony of others on this floor that the black market was operating the most aggressively at that time. So we are probably seriously underestimating the fact that the growth was about 25 percent in the number of teens who were smoking. 
If the argument that rising prices will reduce teen smoking, it stands to reason that youth smoking should increase as prices fall. If you are going to say that higher prices cause teens to stop smoking, then lower prices would probably cause teens to start smoking. However, a year and a half after significantly reducing tobacco taxes in Canada, according to the `Survey on Smoking in Canada,' teen smoking `remained stable.' 
What we really have from our experience of observing Canada is that teens aren't very much affected by price. That confirms what the study indicated at the University of Maryland and Chicago. It confirms what the Cornell study indicated. It confirms what happened in California. What happens, as a matter of fact, is that teens are not affected very much by price. The fact that is ignored by those who argue teen smoking declined in Canada due to the significant tax increases is that youth smoking declined in the United States by 30 percent during the same period--from 1977 to 1990--without a price increase. 
There are times when teen rates of smoking haven't gone up in either culture. If they were parallel in both cultures as a result of other factors, and taxes went up in one and not in another, it makes it pretty clear that the tax increase in one was irrelevant to whether or not teens smoked. Here we have a situation where we are imposing a tax on 98 percent of the cigarette consumers who are adults on the presumption that it will change the smoking habits of the 2 percent who are teenagers when the studies and the real world information simply do not bear out this as a justification for this kind of massive tax increase. 
In the United Kingdom, between 1988 and 1996, the per pack price of cigarettes was increased by 26 percent. Although cigarette volumes fell by 17 percent, the percentage of weekly smokers aged 11 to 16 went from 8 percent in 1988 to 13 percent in 1996. So it turns out in the United Kingdom the number of youngsters who were smoking went up, even when the number of people smoking overall went down. It went up from 8 percent to 13 percent in spite of the fact there was a 26-percent increase in the price of tobacco. 
The University of Chicago, and Maryland, Cornell University, a study funded by the National Cancer Institute, the experience in California, the experience in Canada, the experience in Great Britain--these are experiences which indicate to us that this is more a bill about taxes than about increasing the size of government. It is about sending the hard-earned dollars of individuals in the United States overseas to fund these studies in other countries, to provide a basis for a variety of interests in the United States being well funded; but this is not a bill which addresses the issue of teen smoking in a responsible way. 
The Centers for Disease Control has compiled data on brand preferences which support the conclusion that young people are not particularly price sensitive. The `price value' or discount segment of the cigarette market comprised 39 percent of the overall cigarette market in 1993. Yet, according to the CDC, less than 14 percent of adolescent smokers purchase generic or other `value-priced' brands. On the average, the people were price sensitive, but when you got to teenagers they weren't. 
This point was echoed by the government's lawyer defending the FDA tobacco rule, who told the U.S. district court, `[P]rice, 
apparently has very little meaning to children and smoking, and, therefore, they don't smoke generic cigarettes. They go for those three big advertised brands.' 
All of a sudden, we come to this place where we are going to pile on the taxes, pile them on low-income individuals. Those making less than $30,000 a year will pay nearly 60 percent of this $885 billion tax burden. And we are doing it in the face of the information of these university studies that are current, that are recent; in the face of the data from California, and data in Great Britain; and in the face of the Federal Government's lawyer arguing in the U.S. district court in the FDA tobacco case where he said, `price apparently has very little meaning to children and smoking.' They aren't affected by price. 
We have a situation where we have had cloture filed on this bill. There are those who do not want the kind of debate about price and about taxes, about the fact that the price isn't really as significant as they would like to portray on teen smoking. And if we slow this bill down enough for people to look at it carefully, they might figure out that this bill isn't what is needed at all. Certainly, most people do not think we need another three-quarters of a trillion dollars in taxes focused on the hard-working, lower-income individuals in America. 
This is a bill about taxes. It is a bill about money. If you look carefully at this bill, it has everything from foreign aid in it to more of the child care proposals of President Clinton. It is time, if we are going to have taxes increased, that we do something constructive with the tax increase, and we give it back to the people in terms of respecting an institution which America has long understood to be at the core of the potential for a bright future for this country. We are talking about the institution of marriage. 
I commend Senator Gramm who brought to the floor a proposal which would eliminate the marriage penalty on individuals who are low-income individuals, to say to them that we don't think you should have to pay higher taxes merely because you are going to be married; you are going to make the durable, lasting commitments of marriage that are likely to be the basis for strong families that are the foundation and the future of America, we don't think you should pay for that in terms of higher taxes. 
Both Senator Gramm and Senator Domenici have indicated they would eliminate the marriage penalty for individuals making less than $50,000 a year with some of the resources generated by this measure. Obviously, there are those who are expecting to spend those resources on more government programs and are terrified by the fact that we might think about giving the money back to the people. You have to understand this is at a time when the U.S. Government is in surplus. It is expected--even conservative estimates--that there will be a $39 billion surplus this year, nearly $60 billion in surplus next year, and we shouldn't be here debating how to spend more of the taxpayers' money. We should be here debating how to give money back. And Senators Gramm and Domenici, the Senator from Texas and the Senator from New Mexico, have come forward with a plan to reduce taxes to the extent that you end the marriage penalty and to say to people, we are not going to penalize you for having the durable, lasting commitments of marriage that become the foundation. 
Frankly, I am very enchanted by the idea of eliminating the marriage penalty, and this will not end the debate on the marriage penalty. I will continue to offer amendments until it is eliminated, whether this passes or not. The marriage penalty is a pernicious attack on the values and principles of America. It is time that we aligned the policy of America with the principles of the people of America. 
I commend the Senator from New Mexico and the Senator from Texas for their outstanding work, but I think this cloture motion was filed because people are beginning to understand. The idea is that, well, we filed cloture on some other matters; maybe we should file cloture on this. I think that has been suggested. I don't think that is the case. I think the people are beginning to understand this is a massive tax increase. And because it is, I think that cloture is inappropriate at this time. We have a responsibility to debate what we will do with $885 billion in revenue. I think it should be given back to the people who have paid it. 
With that in mind, I urge Senators to oppose in every respect the motion for cloture, to vote against it. This is a measure which deserves the light of day. It deserves the dawning of day. The American people really ought to have a chance to look carefully at it, understand it, and to see it clearly. They ought to see it in the context of what it seeks to do--tax individuals, primarily low-income individuals, at very substantial rates--and the result will be substantially more Government. The studies indicate that the impact on teen smoking as a result of that tax is very likely to be minimal, if existent at all. 
It is with that in mind that I think we ought to take very seriously the proposals to abolish, to take the tax out of this bill. And if we don't do that, we ought to do what we can to give back the money which is collected from the hard-working people of America. The idea that we should somehow proliferate Government in response to this situation is an idea which, when exposed to the full light of understanding, will be rejected by the American people. Certainly Washington appears to be the only city in the world where a bad decision, the decision to smoke, made by free people, becomes the basis for taxing those free people, taxing them in ways that will make it very difficult for them to provide for their families. 
My own view is that that is inappropriate. We should reconsider the position that is being offered here, and I believe the kind of tax relief that has been offered by the Senator from Texas and the Senator from New Mexico is the kind of relief that ought to be considered in the event there are any taxes in this measure. 
With that in mind, I will do what I can to make sure that we have the opportunity to consider a variety of proposals which would extinguish and end the marriage penalty in our law, if there are resources being collected from the American people under the guise of a tobacco settlement. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I appreciate the fact that people want to make this a bill about cessation of teen smoking. I want teens not to smoke. It puzzles me, though, that they look past the studies: Cornell University, with 13,000 students showing that price doesn't make much difference at all to them. They look past the University of Chicago and University of Maryland saying that price is way overrated. They look past the experience of Canada when price was going up dramatically, smoking was going up among young people. They look past the United Kingdom where smoking went up among teens when price was going up, and they talk about teen smoking, and yet they don't make the possession of cigarettes by teenagers illegal or inappropriate in the bill. 
This Congress has authority over the District of Columbia. If we really were serious about saying it is wrong for youngsters to have cigarettes or to have tobacco or thought it inappropriate, we could make it illegal for them, but this bill doesn't do that. 
What does this bill do? This bill raises taxes. It creates new government programs. It funds the priorities of the Clinton administration. It is an $885 billion tax increase, and who pays the tax? The tax gets paid by low-income individuals. Mr. President, 59.4 percent of the individuals who will be paying this tax will be individuals who earn less than $30,000 a year. 
Some have said, `Well, we should be voting on amendments.' I agree we should. There was a unanimous consent order proposed today which provided for votes. I agreed to it. I didn't stop it. The majority leader proposed it. He proposed to have votes to lay these issues in a context where they could be dealt with, where they could be voted on, where they could be disposed of, and those on the other side of the aisle rejected it. 
We can't have it both ways. We can't say that this is a bill which is going to stop people from smoking and we are going to collect $885 billion when they do smoke. If they stop smoking, the money won't be there. What we all know is they are going to keep smoking; that is why the money will be there. 
We can't say this will help the children of poor families when we are going to make the poor families pay $1,200, $1,600 a year in taxes and take that off the table of those families and out of their budgets. We can't say we are going to stop teens from smoking when we don't even care enough to make it illegal for teens, where we have jurisdiction, to possess cigarettes. 
This is a tax bill. It is a massive tax bill. It is a massive government bill. It promotes government agencies not only in the United States but overseas. There is $350 million each year in this bill to send overseas, so that countries overseas can conduct studies about what it costs to smoke in other countries, not the United States of America. 
I think this is the kind of priority that no wonder people don't want this bill slowed down enough for the American public to see: Taxing people who make less than $30,000 a year in the United States to fund studies overseas so that they can conduct studies about what it costs to have cigarette smoking in other countries. I don't believe that is what Americans are interested in. That is not going to help young people in the United States. 
The Senator from Arizona says the States deserve reimbursement. He said this is hard on the States, and then he sort of bragged about how hard this is on tobacco companies. I am not worried about the States or the tobacco companies as much as I am about the people of the United States. They are the ones who deserve reimbursement, if anybody deserves reimbursement. 
And here we have an elevated taking by the Federal Government, another three-quarters of a trillion dollars over the life of this bill--taking from these people instead of giving to them. We come to do this at a time when the Federal Government is looking at a revenue surplus. 
It just seems to me that we ought to be debating how to give back the money to the people rather than taking these resources from the people. I do not object to amendments. I do not object to a UC which would allow further amendments. Very seldom do we have bills here where we get it right the first time. I think it is good to have debate on these issues. I think it is good that the studies be brought forward. It is good that the people have an opportunity to see exactly what the community has been able to decide when it has observed the facts, the reality of situations not only here but in other settings. 
It is with that in mind, I believe it is important to move forward with the amendments, like that of the Senator from Texas and the Senator from New Mexico which would abolish the marriage penalty, to say to those families, `We want you to be able to have the kind of right to deploy your own resources rather than have Government spend the money. And we don't think we should penalize you because you have involved yourself in the durable, lasting commitments that form the basis of the family,' the most important institution in our culture. 
So it is with that in mind that I have risen to criticize this bill and to unmask it. This bill is substantial. It has more pages than the average person probably reads, more pages than the average Senator reads. And reading this bill is important. It is in here that you find out about the Federal programs that are tucked away, the mandated spending for the States. It is in here that you find out about the kind of special limitations that were to be provided to the cigarette companies in terms of their liability. If you care so much about the children, why limit the amount of money in damages that tobacco companies would have to pay in? Why provide them with a special sanctuary? 
It is this bill that deserves our consideration. It is in here that you find the massive tax increases and the spending on new and other programs. I believe we ought to add to this that if we are going to have taxes, we will give the taxes back by way of saying, as the Senator from Texas and the Senator from New Mexico have said in their proposal, the marriage penalty ought to be abolished for individuals making $50,000 or less. I would abolish it for all individuals. And, frankly, I am going to continue offering amendments about the way to spend the money, not to spend it through Government but to send this money back to the American people. They earned it. They should have the opportunity to spend it. The idea, `You send it; we spend it,' being the slogan of this place is a bad idea. It should be, `You earned it; we returned it.' 
It is not wasted on me that the cloture motion was filed when the debate on the marriage penalty got going. A lot of people don't want to unmask the policy of this country that we penalize people for being married. A lot of people don't want to debate the issue of whether we should have all these new programs or whether we should give people the money back that they earned and we took from them merely because they were married. 
I do not blame people for not wanting to reveal if they are against wanting to give the American people their money back, that if the American people learn we are taking their money simply because they are married, that we have the opportunity to give it back but we would rather give it back to programs here in Washington or even overseas. That is an embarrassment. It is no wonder individuals want cloture filed and feel we should shut down debate. 
I do not want to shut down debate, but we should move forward with tax relief for the American people, and we should be very reluctant about imposing $885 billion of new taxes in the name of programs for which it is accordingly suggested that somehow 
young people will not begin smoking. 
The idea young people start smoking at 3,000 a day--it may be true. If we can believe the studies at the University of Chicago, the University of Maryland, Cornell University, if we can believe the experience of California, Canada, the United Kingdom, the kinds of things they have talked about in these taxes here that are involved in this bill will not make a difference. 
The truth of the matter is, the academic studies of thousands, tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands, indicate that to talk about taxes making a big difference in youth smoking is overstated. And these are not studies by interest groups; these are studies by the National Cancer Institute; these are studies by the University of Maryland, the University of Chicago, Cornell University. 
So it is time for us to understand this debate is about taxes. It is a debate about Government--big taxes, big Government; massive taxes, massive Government. 
We are not even making illegal the possession of cigarettes for children in the District of Columbia. If we thought that was really important, we could add that to this bill. No; that has not been done. We just simply make it possible for Government to grow. No wonder people are uncomfortable, especially when there is a proposal that says we could allow families to grow by returning the money to families and stop penalizing them just for having the durable commitment, the lasting bond that comes when people are married and are now penalized for that in our Tax Code. This would be an opportunity, according to the plan of the Senators from New Mexico and Texas, to alleviate that. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the tobacco bill. And I wish to address the massive tax increase that is in this bill--tax increases that are targeted against the lowest income individuals in America: hard-working citizens who earn primarily less than $30,000 a year. It is a massive tax increase that is going to be used to expand the Federal Government, just when the American people continue to make it clear that they are tired of Government imposing its decisions on our daily lives. 
Just last week there was an announcement of a $39 billion surplus in 1998 and a $54 billion surplus in 1999. Congress should be debating how to return this money to the taxpayers. We should not be debating how to siphon more out of the pockets of working Americans. 
It is also possible to discuss the inevitable black market that would result from the policies in this bill, even though my colleagues and the administration continue to ignore this threat to American neighborhoods of creating a black market with the high taxes in this bill. I will also discuss the effect of a price increase on teenage smoking rates. 
Mr. President, along with my colleagues, I am truly concerned about teen smoking. However, I do not believe that teen smoking is the focus of this legislation. Under the guise of reducing teen smoking, proponents of this bill are willing to increase taxes on hard-working Americans by well over $800 billion. That is well over three-quarters of a trillion dollars. 
Under the guise of reducing teen smoking, proponents of this bill support a massive increase in the size of the Federal Government--17 new boards and commissions, which is a modest estimate. And then in response to the identification of those boards and commissions, some in support of this bill have decided to say they would take out those boards and commissions and just leave authority for agencies to create within themselves the capacity to do what the boards and commissions were designed to do. 
Instead of having boards and commissions that are accountable and identifiable, you have stealth boards and commissions that are hidden in the agencies. I don't think making them indistinguishable is a way to say that government isn't growing. 
Proponents of this bill claim it is necessary to curb teen smoking. What this bill is necessary for is to feed the tax-and-spend habit of individuals in Washington. 
Although Congress has the authority, we do not even make it illegal for minors to possess or use tobacco in the District of Columbia in this bill. We only have rules regarding the point of sale. Even then, we only make retailers responsible for the transaction. There is no disincentive for teenagers to try and purchase cigarettes in this bill. Two percent of retail cigarette sales are made to minors. Adults purchase 98 percent of all cigarettes sold in retail stores. Under this bill, we are creating a massive tax increase on 98 percent of smokers in order to try and discourage 2 percent of all the retail sales. There is sound evidence that the 2 percent will not be discouraged. In Washington, taxes and spending are the only things more addictive than nicotine. 
Preliminary reports estimated this legislation would increase taxes $868 billion. We now know that this legislation would raise taxes $885 billion and create new government programs with funding locked in for 25 years. It creates a huge government regulatory scheme the likes of which we have not seen since the Clinton proposal to perpetrate a national health care system from the Federal Government. 
This bill is a tax bill, pure and simple. It is a tax bill on Americans who are already overburdened with taxes. Americans today are working longer and harder than ever before to pay their taxes. Tax Freedom Day this year was less than a month ago, on May the 10th. It was a record year. Americans worked longer into the year this year to pay their taxes than ever before. The hard work of the American people, let me say again, the hard work of the American people allowed the President just last week to announce a $39 billion projected surplus in 1998 and a $54 billion surplus projected for 1999. Yet here we are a week later continuing to talk not about how to return the surplus to the people, but how to siphon more out of their pockets. As currently drafted, the proposed tobacco bill is nothing more than an excuse for Washington to raise taxes and spend more money. 
In the 15 years prior to 1995, Congress passed 13 major tax increases. In fact, last year's Taxpayer Relief Act was the first meaningful tax cut since 1981. As currently drafted, the tobacco bill erases that relief. We must stop that from happening. We must not undo the modest gains we gave to the American people just last year. We certainly cannot relieve them by imposing another $885 billion in taxes on them. To paraphrase President Reagan, the whole controversy comes down to this: Are you entitled to the fruits of your own labor or does government have some presumptive right to tax and tax and tax? Who will pay the $800-plus billion in taxes contained in this proposed legislation? 
The tobacco legislation is a massive tax increase that would be levied against those least capable of paying. About 60 percent of the tax increase would fall on families earning $30,000 a year or less. That is a shocking figure. What it basically says is these families with less than $30,000, struggling to put clothing on the backs of their children, food on the table, to pay the rent, to have the money for transportation, to keep the car repaired, occasionally scraping together enough for a modest day off or a vacation, would suddenly be subject to a massive new tax, 60 percent of which would fall on them. Some households would see their taxes increase by more than $1,000. Moreover, this new tax would be levied on money that has already been subject to the income tax. If you are buying cigarettes and you have an additional $1.10 to pay, it is a tax on money you have already paid tax on. Households earning less than $50,000 would pay seven 
times as much in new tobacco taxes than households earning $75,000 or more. 
According to the Congressional Research Service, tobacco taxes are perhaps the most regressive taxes currently levied. In the United States of America where, we already have the highest taxes in history, we are now projecting a massive tax increase on individuals least capable of paying. While those earning less than $10,000 make up only 10 percent of the population, 32 percent of those people smoke. The current tobacco tax represents 5 percent of the smokers' income in this category. Those making between $10,000 and $20,000 a year make up 18 percent of the population. However, 30 percent smoke. The current tobacco tax makes up 2 percent of a smokers income in this category. Therefore, this bill amounts to a tax increase on 31 percent of Americans who earn under $20,000 a year. Households earning less than $10,000 a year would feel the bite of this tax increase most of all. These households, it is estimated, would see their Federal taxes rise 35.1 percent. 
In most areas of the country, someone earning $10,000 a year is well below the poverty line. We spend much of our time in this body trying to find solutions for those in this income bracket--we have tax credits, welfare programs, educational grants, job-training programs. They cost billions of dollars a year. We try to lift people out of their poverty, out of that income bracket. However, today, Members of this body are enthusiastically saddling them with a huge tax burden of over $800 billion focused on those least capable of paying. Washington politicians and bureaucrats are saying they know better how to spend the resources of the American people. 
Let me share the impact this tax increase will have on the constituents of the people in Missouri. Using data provided by the Centers for Disease Control, it is clear the tobacco legislation would be an annual $382 million tax on people in Missouri. Of that amount, $227 million would be paid by households earning $30,000 or less. This is a conservative estimate. This assumes that each smoker in Missouri smokes only one pack a day. For someone who smokes two packs daily, the $1.10 per pack tax increase contained in the tobacco legislation would amount to a tax increase of $803 annually. 
Let's look at how this will impact other States. Arizona, 22.9 percent of the adults smoke; $227.3 million tax increase on Arizona, $164.7 million on those with incomes of $30,000 or less. In Texas, 23.7 percent of adults smoke; $1.2 billion tax increase on Texas, $1.2 billion tax increase on the people of Texas, with three quarters of a billion being levied against those who earn $30,000 or less. 
This bill contains massive tax increases that are going to be used to expand the Federal Government just when the American people continue to make it clear that they need relief. Some people ask, where is all this money coming from when we talk about our surpluses? I can tell you where the money comes from--it comes from the hard work, the sacrifice, the ingenuity, the efforts of Americans. It is not our money. It is their money. It is not Washington's. We should be discussing how to leave the money where it belongs. Instead, we are discussing how to take more money. 
I have an amendment that I plan on introducing later in this debate that will accomplish the goal of leaving money in the pockets of the taxpayers. It will give much-needed tax relief to Americans in a way which will provide the greatest relief to those who will be hardest hit under the bill. I believe, as many do in this body, that if this bill is allowed to increase taxes, that revenue should be used to relieve married couples of what might possibly be the most indefensible and immoral tax of our Tax Code. 
This is a perfect example of Washington's values being imposed on America instead of America's values being imposed on Washington. Americans value marriage; Washington taxes marriage. 
The marriage penalty tax creates a situation in which 21 million couples pay $29 billion more than they would have paid had they been single. The marriage penalty, on the average, is about $1,400 per family. This is grossly unfair and is an assault on the values of the American people. Consider a typical couple in which each person earns an annual income of $35,000. Under current law, if the couple were to wed in 1998, they would pay $10,595 in Federal income taxes, assuming they were childless and they take the standard deduction. If, instead, they chose to remain single, their combined tax bill would amount to $9,117. In other words, they would pay $1,478, a 16-percent penalty for being married. 
As you might expect, people often modify their behavior to avoid paying taxes. In fact, it is one of the assumptions of the tobacco legislation that people would modify their behavior--quit smoking--if we raise taxes on cigarettes. Does the Tax Code really influence moral decisions and prevent couples from getting married? Tragically, yes. Some couples simply cannot afford to bear the extra burden of the marriage penalty. Just ask Sharon Mallory and Darryl Pierce of Connersville, IN. They were planning to get married when they learned that their annual tax liability would balloon $3,700 as a result. The marriage penalty led them to rethink their decision to get married. 
A marriage penalty exists today because Congress legislated ill-advised changes to the Tax Code in the 1960s. This is an example of Washington's values being imposed on America instead of America's values being imposed on Washington. 
Over the next 5 years, the Federal Government is expected to collect $9.3 trillion in taxes from hard-working Americans. Completely eliminating the marriage penalty would reduce that total by only $150 billion, or only 1.6 percent. 
Now that taxpayers have provided the Federal Government with a surplus that may be as much as $60 billion this year alone, Congress has no excuse for withholding tax relief from American families. 
The power to tax is the power to destroy. The average dual-income household spends a far larger share of its income on taxes than it does on food, shelter, clothing, and transportation combined. 
With taxes at these levels, no wonder families are finding it necessary to send both spouses into the workplace. One of the ways in which the marriage penalty manifests itself is that the standard deduction for a married couple is less than that for two singles. That means if you are married and you file a joint return, the standard deduction is not double what it was when you were single. Again, let me repeat this staggering fact. Last year, 21 million married couples collectively paid a $29 billion tax. They paid $29 billion more than they would have paid had they been single. 
I will offer an amendment that will substantially reduce the marriage penalty. It will do so by making the standard deduction for married couples twice what the standard deduction is for single people. 
Members of this body have been arguing that there is no tax in this bill, only an increase in tobacco prices to deter smoking. In fact, the Finance Committee, in its mark, at least tried to level with the American people by reporting out a bill that called it a tax. Webster's Dictionary defines a tax as a `compulsory payment, usually a percentage, levied on income, property values, sales prices, etc., for the support of government.' 
In this bill we have a compulsory payment. The bill then requires that the cost of these payments be passed on in the form of price increases to consumers. It even penalizes companies if they fail to do so. These payments are then used to fund massive programs for Federal and State governments. 
Well, if it walks like a duck, talks like a duck, and sounds like a duck, it is a duck. So if it `walks' like a tax and acts 
like a tax, it is probably a tax. This is a tax and in law provides that those payments--taxes--are to be passed through to consumers--under a penalty if it is not done. 
It has been said that industry is the group that is convincing people that this is a tax bill. But we all know that industry can't make it a tax bill, and Senators can't say it is not a tax bill if it is a tax bill. It is a tax bill. It requires consumers to spend additional sums of money and to send them to Washington so that government programs can be extended. 
Those who support this bill would like for the American people to believe that this is tough on tobacco. The American people are beginning to find out that tobacco companies won't bear the costs of these payments. Consumers will. This bill requires that consumers will be those who are required to put up the money--the $800 billion-plus that comes in the mandatory payments, the taxes that are occasioned by this bill. 
What will be the impact on tobacco companies? In September of 1997, the Federal Trade Commission issued a report entitled `Competition and the Financial Impact of the Proposed Tobacco Industry Settlement.' The report was done at the request of the Congressional Task Force on Tobacco and Health. This report analyzed the economic impact of the proposed settlement on cigarette prices, industry profits, and Government revenues. 
This tobacco legislation was built upon the proposed settlement, but it is not exactly the same. But this report was based upon the annual payment, look-back provisions, and tax deductibility of the payments made by the tobacco companies. 
There are several important conclusions in this report: 
First: `The major cigarette manufacturers may profit from the proposed settlement by increasing the price of cigarettes substantially above the amount of the . . . payments that are to be paid to the public sector.' 
It could be profitable for the tobacco companies. This bill that is so hard on the tobacco companies may result in increased profits for the very tobacco companies we are supposed to be hurting. 
Second, the report concludes: `Even assuming that prices increase by no more than the annual payments, the major cigarette firms may profit substantially . . . through limitations on liability and reductions in advertising and litigation costs.' 
Well, that is a very serious suggestion. And that comes from the Federal Trade Commission of the United States. 
Again, the actual elements of this bill that are supposed to show that Congress is `tough on tobacco' may, according to the Federal Trade Commission, actually enable tobacco companies to profit substantially by reducing litigation costs and by reducing the costs of advertising. 
The report then mentions the affect of price increases on smokers. It says:  
The overall demand by adults for cigarettes is inelastic, or relatively insensitive to changes in price. Most adult consumers will continue to smoke notwithstanding a significant increase in price. 
As a result, an industry-wide price increase would be profitable for the companies, even though some smokers would react to the higher prices by smoking less or quitting altogether. 
Now, the evidence is not clear that raising prices reduces teen smoking rates. Mr. President, this bill is being considered on the Senate floor. It is being considered and being sold to the American people as the only way to reduce youth smoking. They are being told that we can justify an $800 billion tax increase that is necessary to get rid of the disease of addiction. However, after looking at the evidence, there is no reason to believe that such a tax increase is the answer to eliminating teen smoking. 
Mr. President, I inquire as to the time remaining in my opportunity to speak?

Mr. ASHCROFT. I thank the Chair. 
Food and Drug Administration regulations, which were designed to curtail teen smoking and which were suggested by a Cabinet Secretary who helped promote these regulations, did not contain price increases. The most striking evidence that significant price increases are not necessary to reduce smoking is a very recent attempt by this administration to address the youth smoking issue. In 1996, regulations promulgated by the FDA were touted as being historic. It was estimated to reduce youth smoking by 50 percent over 7 years, and they didn't include price increases. 
The important aspect of these regulations is that they contain no price increase on smokers in the general population. As you know, this legislation is raising the prices on 100 percent of the smokers to try to discourage the utilization of cigarettes by 2 percent of those who purchase. There was no discussion in the regulations of a huge price increase--a massive tax increase. And about this regulation, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, Donna Shalala, stated: 
This is the most important public health initiative in a generation. It ranks with everything from polio to penicillin. I mean, this is huge in terms of its impact. Our goal is very straightforward: to reduce the amount of teenage smoking in the United States by half over the next 7 years. 
It is a laudable objective, and apparently it is believed to be attainable by the Secretary of Health and Human Services without a massive tax increase or price increase. 
David Kessler, one of the strongest proponents of this bill, was the Director of the Food and Drug Administration when these regulations were promulgated. He stated: 
Don't let the simplicity of these proposals fool you. If all elements of the anti-smoking package come into play together, change could be felt within a single generation, and we could see nicotine addiction go the way of smallpox and polio. without a price increase. 
These statements were made about regulations that contained absolutely no price increase--no massive tax on the working people of America; no massive taking by the government of over three-quarters of a trillion dollars; no extension of 17 new boards, commissions, and agencies for the government. 
Also, remember that these regulations were supposed to reduce youth smoking by 50 percent over 7 years, while it has been claimed, that this bill--containing massive tax increases--will reduce teen smoking by 60 percent over 10 years. 
Dr. Kessler was widely cited as a supporter of the amendment offered on this floor last week that would have increased the tax on cigarettes by $1.50 rather than the $1.10 already contained in the bill as necessary to reduce teen smoking, which is substantial. 
Yet, when those regulations were enacted he never complained that this regulation would not have been effective in reducing teen smoking because it did not contain such a massive tax increase. 
About these regulations, President Clinton stated: 
That's why a year ago I worked with the FDA, and . . . a nationwide effort to protect our children from the dangers of tobacco by reducing access to tobacco products, by preventing companies from advertising to our children. The purpose of the FDA rule was to reduce youth smoking by 50 percent within 7 years. 
There was no complaint by the President that these regulations were insufficient because they did not contain a price increase. 
What has changed in just 2 short years? 
Policymakers in Washington have found a cash cow to pay for their pet programs 
that the President said he wanted, but which he would find incapable of moving through the ordinary budget process. 
The evidence as to whether price increases reduce youth smoking is tentative--at best. 
The second issue I want to address concerning the need to increase taxes on the American people by $868 billion is whether price increases actually reduce teen smoking. 
My colleagues have been arguing that the studies show conclusively that price increases reduce youth smoking. 
However, that simply is not the case. 
At best, the studies are inconclusive. At worst, they show little correlation between price increase and a reduction in youth smoking. 
The debate on this floor has assumed that for every 10 percent increase in price reduces youth smoking by 7 percent. 
Frankly, I think the average citizen knows that young people who are willing to pay $150 a pair for sneakers are probably not very price sensitive when it comes to other factors that relate to status and the like and making a statement, which smoking frequently is for young people. 
The debate on this floor has assumed--a dangerous assumption, reckless, and irresponsible intellectually--that for every 10-percent increase in price you get a 7-percent reduction in youth smoking. 
Studies conducted by economists at Cornell University and the University of Maryland, and funded by the National Cancer Institute, question the connection between youth smoking, prices, and tax rates.

 Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, it is fitting on this day, the ninth anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre, to submit this resolution calling for the President to delay his trip to China. With allegations swirling about China's efforts to influence U.S. elections, and with the hard evidence we do have of China's continuing proliferation of weapons of mass destruction technologies, rewarding China with a summit visit is sending the wrong signal at the wrong time. 
There is perhaps nothing more indicting than a vote in the United States Congress that the actions of a Commander-in-Chief were not in the national interest. And yet, that is precisely what the House of Representatives did on May 20, 1998. By a vote of 417 to 4, the House voted that the President's decision in February 1998 to allow the export of satellite technology to China was `not in the national interest.' The Justice Department reportedly protested the waiver, expressing concern that it would undermine an ongoing criminal investigation of a possible satellite technology transfer that occurred in 1996. 
What is just as troubling is the possible link between the export of U.S. satellite technology and political donations from China's People's Liberation Army (PLA). Liu Chao-ying, an officer in the PLA, gave Johnny Chung--one of the central figures in the Administration's fundraising scandal--$300,000 to funnel into democratic coffers in the 1995-96 election cycle. Ms. Liu just happens to be a senior manager and vice president in the China Aerospace conglomerate, Beijing's state-owned company that oversees China's missile development and space launch programs. 
The White House says it did not know the source of Mr. Chung's funding. I question how diligently Administration officials and democratic fundraisers wanted to know. Warnings from the National Security Council as to the intentions of Mr. Chung, described by one official as a `hustler,' went unheeded. Senator Thompson's fundraising investigation describe in careful detail how the Democratic National Committee dismantled its vetting process for contributions. Mr. Chung himself visited the White House 49 times. This was not a superficial relationship. This man was a regular guest of the Administration. 
The recent scandals surrounding satellite technology transfers and Chinese efforts to influence U.S. elections are only the latest, troubling signs that this Administration's China policy is an abysmal failure. As Harry Wu said at this morning's press conference to commemorate the Tiananmen Square massacre, appeasement does not bring peace. 
Appeasement is precisely what this Administration's China policy has become. China announces it will not conduct an inquiry into the Tiananmen Square massacre, yet President Clinton begins his summit at this site, where possibly thousands of Chinese were killed. In Hong Kong, President Clinton will not meet individually with Martin Lee, the leader of pro-democracy forces in the former colony whose Democratic Party won over 60% of the popular vote in the May 24 elections. China is identified by the CIA as the world's worst proliferator of weapons of mass destruction technology, proliferation activity that has contributed directly to the spiraling arms race between India and Pakistan. Yet the Administration rewards China with a nuclear cooperation agreement that will send America's best reactor technology to China. China repeatedly breaks commitments to open its market to U.S. businesses, yet the President renews MFN year after year. 
This Administration apparently will overlook any offense to our nation's principles and security to continue the bankrupt policy of engaging communist China. China points nuclear missiles at the U.S., and PLA officers describe the United States as China's `international archenemy.' Yet the Administration allows advanced satellite and missile technology to be sent to China which a Pentagon memo says harmed U.S. national security. 
China's actions, and this Administration's response to those actions, has set the U.S.-China relationship on a gravely dangerous course. It is time for a fundamental reevaluation of U.S. China policy. This resolution will provide a good start. This resolution outlines the areas of concern in our policy toward China, from human rights to national security to trade matters. In contrast to how U.S.-China relations have been administered for the last six years, a sound relationship between our two countries must be based on integrity, responsibility, and mutual respect. 
China's behavior across the board has not given any basis for this Administration to pursue a `strategic partnership' with Beijing. Appeasement will not bring peace. This Administration obviously did not learn the lessons of the Cold War. China is an aggressive power that seeks regional hegemony. Extending MFN trade status in exchange for a $50 billion trade deficit, sending China our best nuclear reactor technology in exchange for Chinese weapons proliferation, and beginning the summit at Tiananmen Square when China continues to imprison its people is not the kind of policy that will bring mutual respect and peace in East Asia. 
I call on the President to delay his trip to China until questions surrounding satellite technology transfer have been answered and U.S. China policy has been formulated more effectively to protect American interests. Senator Hutchinson is joining me as a cosponsor of this resolution, and I appreciate his tremendous work in this area. This resolution is designed to send a signal to the Chinese government and the victims of its repression that there are limits to the tolerance of China's appalling human rights record, continuing trade obstructionism, and destabilizing proliferation.

Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I rise today to commend a student program, the Sino-American Youth Conference, sponsored this summer by Pacific Link International Exchange Students (PLIES). PLIES is a Christian ministry with the worthy goal of providing a cultural experience in the United States to students from the People's Republic of China. 
Student from China have long studied in the United States, and the exchange of young people between our two countries has done much to increase our mutual understanding and to advance liberty in China. PLIES hopes that its hosting of the Sino-American Youth Conference in Washington, D.C. this summer will continue that positive tradition of exchange by allowing Chinese students to witness first hand the workings of democracy in our nation's capital. 
Young people from China and the United States will be shaping the future of both of their respective countries. The exchange of ideas and the building of friendships facilitated through the PLIES program will benefit China and the United States in the years ahead. 
The staff of PLIES are to be congratulated for their work in China and their commitment to furthering dialogue between our two countries. I extend my welcome to the students from China participating in the PLIES program. May your time in the United States be fulfilling and beneficial.

Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, Operation Graduation is a six-state campaign devoted to the safety of high school seniors on graduation night. The campaign is designed to fund alcohol-free/drug-free graduation parties that are safe, memorable, and fun. 
In an effort to encourage high schools to hold alcohol-free/drug-free graduation parties, local cable systems in the Midwest are donating money to corresponding area high schools. This project also provides high schools with information kits containing an Operation Graduation How-to-Guide, pamphlets, and brochures on the dangers of drunk driving, and other resources for promoting Operation Graduation. 
Together, local cable system employees in Missouri are fighting to stop needless deaths on our roads and highways that result from reckless behavior on graduation night. 
I would like to commend all the people working to make the weekend of May 29, 1998, `Operation Graduation Weekend.'

Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Ms. Rosella Schnakenberg, a woman who has served her friends and fellow Missourians for more than 50 years. Although this service has transcended occupational boundaries, the most prominent way Ms. Schnakenberg, a lifelong resident of the Cole Camp community, has benefitted her fellow citizens has been to hold a pivotal role at the First Community Bank in Ionia, Missouri. 
During her time as an employee of First Community Bank, Ms. Schnakenberg has helped customers open accounts, fill out and process loan applications, save for the future, balance checkbooks, and cash pay checks. In addition to this long list of responsibilities, what is remarkable about this versatile employee is that she performs her duties with enthusiasm and concern. That attitude has helped propel Ms. Schnakenberg from a teller who earned $75 a month to a Vice President and Facility Manager, overseeing day-to-day operations of the bank. During her lengthy tenure, she has observed the bank change and grow from an establishment that applied for deposits by hand and lacked indoor plumbing to an institution that functions and flourishes in the modern world. 
First Community Bank has not only prospered economically, under Ms. Schnakenberg's leadership, it has also benefitted from her research and recording of the bank's colorful history. That history includes a Depression-era incident when one of the bank managers had cashiers band a high-value bill on both sides of the $1 bill stacks. 
Mrs. Schnakenberg has also touched the lives of the people around her through the unselfish distribution of her time, such as serving in community activities, visiting friends in nursing homes, and playing the organ at St. John's Lutheran Church services. 
To honor Ms. Schnakenberg, First Community Bank hosted a reception in her honor on Sunday, March 22, 1998, in Ionia, Missouri. It is an honor for me to recognize such a fine Missourian and to serve her in the U.S. Senate.

Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the tobacco bill. While I will begin my remarks discussing my pending amendment to strike all of the consumer taxes out of the bill, I also wish to address the large expansion of Government in the pending legislation. I will discuss the inevitable black market that will result from the policies in this bill. I will also address the failure of this administration to focus its priorities and resources on teen drug use. 
Mr. President, along with my colleagues, I am truly concerned about teen smoking. However, I do not believe that is the focus of this legislation. Teen smoking is not the central thrust of what is happening here. 
This is a massive, massive tax increase on low-income Americans. Instead of helping children, it is very likely to end up hurting children and hurting families. I think it is important that we carefully review the content of this legislation with that in mind. Thirty-nine percent of high school students in Missouri reported smoking during the past 30 days. This is a terrible statistic to have to cite. However, communities in the State are looking for ways to reduce smoking in my State and it is working. It is working without destroying the capacity of low-income families to provide for their children. It is working without destroying the capacity of low-income families to be independent. It is working without an $800, or $900, or $1,000, or $1,600 tax increase on those low-income families. Three packs a day for a family at $1.50 a pack takes you to about $1,600 a year. 
If we can find a way to reduce the impact of teen smoking without taking $1,600 a year out of the budgets of these poor families, that will be $1,600 a year that could be spent for education, $1,600 a year these families will be able to retain and spend for better health care, or it will be $1,600 a year these families can spend for food and clothing. 
For example, I come from a town called Springfield, MO. It is my hometown. My family moved there when I was a very young lad. In stepping up its enforcement of local ordinances prohibiting the sale of tobacco products to teens, they are enacting constitutional limitations on advertising. Parents, teachers, and community leaders are working together to fight the problem. They think they can do it, if they work together. I believe they can do it. They can do it without ruining finances and the opportunity that low-income families ought to have to provide for themselves. The tobacco industry knows they can do it. As one tobacco executive stated, they can't win fighting teen smoking rules on the State and local level. The tobacco industry knows there are going to be rules there, and they can be there, and there can be effective rules. 
If this tobacco bill contained the solutions to the problems that are being enacted in communities today, I don't think I could be here to argue nearly as effectively that this bill is not focused on teen smoking. 
A lot of communities are making possession of tobacco products illegal for teens. This bill doesn't do that. This bill says it is all right for teens to have tobacco. This bill basically says it is all right for teens to smoke. This bill just says it is wrong to sell it to them and it is wrong to advertise it. But it doesn't really do anything about the possession of tobacco. 
Although Congress has the authority, we do not make it illegal for minors to possess or use tobacco even where we control the local situation. We make the laws. We are the city government in some respects for the District of Columbia. It would be possible for us to say, at least where we have authority on military bases, or the District of Columbia, that we could have laws against teen smoking and against the possession of tobacco. But we don't have that in this bill. We only have rules regarding the point of sale. Whether one store or another can sell it, and whether or not they can be on top of the counter or under the counter, or whether or not the brand name can be visible, or things like that, even then we only make the retailers responsible for the transaction. There is no disincentive for teenagers to try to possess and acquire and smoke cigarettes. There is not any in this bill. This is designed as if teenagers are totally expected to be irresponsible. First of all, the decision is, they can't make good decisions; and, second, we don't ask them to make any good decisions. We don't even ask them to refrain from smoking in this bill. 
We create a massive tax increase on 98 percent of smokers to try to discourage 2 percent of all retail sales. What do I mean by that? Two percent of all retail sales in smoking go to teenagers; 98 percent go to adults. So we are raising the taxes on 98 percent in order to try to create a disincentive for the 2 percent. 
Unfortunately, I don't think we have done a very good job, because we don't even seek to make illegal the possession on the part of the 2 percent. If, in fact, we don't want teenagers smoking, why do we fail to say something about their possession of tobacco? Why do we fail to say anything about their smoking? It seems to me that we are missing the boat in a significant way if we don't say something about the smoking. 
For a long time now, we have had a responsibility imposed on the tobacco companies, and appropriately so, to label cigarettes and to tell people the truth about cigarettes on the package. As a matter of fact, you can't even have a billboard about cigarettes without saying on the billboard something that is true about cigarettes. There ought to be said something through this legislation. We need truth in labeling on this legislation. There is a big truth-in-labeling problem here. 
This is an $868 billion--that is not million, that is billion--tax increase. It creates Government programs; after-government programs funding, sort of, directed for the next 25 years to take decisionmaking away from future Congresses of the United States, designed to lock things in; creates a huge 
Government regulatory scheme the likes of which we have not seen since the Clinton proposal to nationalize the health care system. 
Here you have a situation. You say you are against teen smoking. You don't even bother to outlaw possession of teen tobacco for teens even in places like the District of Columbia where you have the authority to do so. You do not do what lots of towns are doing around the United States of America in an effective program. You raise $868 billion worth of taxes, mostly on poor people, on people who can ill afford to pay it. You raise taxes on 98 percent of the smokers, who are the adults, in an effort to try to curtail smoking on 2 percent of the smokers, the young people. 
We create this huge Government regulatory scheme which will have the Federal Government virtually in every store, supermarket, or convenience store telling them how to run their business. This designs a system that will undoubtedly create a black market in tobacco sales, a black market that will make Prohibition look like a very peaceful time in our country's history. Cigarette smuggling will become very, very lucrative. Some people think that smuggling doesn't exist in the United States now. There is a big problem in cigarette smuggling currently, but it is just the tip of the iceberg, which will become apparent if we continue on this plan to impose $1.50 a pack in terms of the cigarette tax on the working poor of America. 
I happen to be a father of three children. I was delighted to hear the good news of the Senator from New Jersey. I happen to have some good news in my own family. These are the pictures of my grandson who was born just 8 weeks ago. I didn't really plan this to be a part of any presentation. But the Senator from New Jersey should have pictures shortly.

Mr. ASHCROFT. I thank the Senator. 
But I don't want my children to smoke. I hope that they have never smoked. I don't know that they have ever smoked. I hope my grandson never smokes. However, what I want more for them is that we have a Government that serves the needs of the American people rather than a Government that serves its own needs. I suspect that this bill, unfortunately, is a bill which tends to address the needs of Government, the perceived needs of the bureaucracy, as much as it tends to do anything that is beneficial, and certainly the kinds of impacts on American families in terms of increased taxes on these hard-working individuals of low income would more than outweigh the benefit. 
I have sought to amend this with a simple amendment. My amendment would strip this legislation of the provisions which impose $755 billion in new taxes on the American people. More precisely, my amendment strikes the upfront payment in the bill and the consequential outcome of that which would result in that kind of commitment by the American people of $755 billion. 
Those who support this bill would like for the American people to believe that it is a tough tobacco bill. But what the American people are beginning to find out is that this bill, while it is tough, is going to be tough on the American people. 
Mr. President, it is my understanding that there are Members who need an opportunity to speak. I would be happy to yield the floor on the condition that I would be given the floor at the conclusion of this time to speak.

Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, what the American people are beginning to find out is that tobacco companies won't bear the cost of this payment. 
I regret my inability to cooperate with other Members of the Senate, but an objection has been heard. I will continue with my remarks, but I hope to be able to accommodate my colleagues. 
Mr. President, what the American people are beginning to find out is that tobacco companies won't bear the cost of the payments, that consumers will. This bill requires that the consumers pay the price. A lot of people are distressed. A lot of people have come to the conclusion that big tobacco is not worthy of being favored. Frankly, there are a lot of things in this bill that big tobacco favors. 
As a matter of fact, they helped write this bill. It has gotten a little bit beyond their desire in terms of a number of the requirements, but many of the components of this bill are there because big tobacco put them there, things that would limit the liability of tobacco companies and the like. But this bill, in terms of its taxes, is big money. This bill requires that the taxes be passed on to consumers in the form of higher prices. 
There has been some discussion about whether these are really taxes or not, because they are not called taxes in the bill. That is another aspect about the truth in labeling that ought to exist here. We have required it of tobacco companies. We ought to require it of the Congress. These are charges which are authorized. They are authorized in the bill. They are basically required in the bill. But they are required to be collected as part of the price of cigarettes, and then the money is to be given to the Government. And the Government is to spend the money. But we refuse to call them taxes. 
Now, whenever the price of something is increased with the requirement that the money be given to the Government and that the Congress then decide how the money is spent, that looks an awful lot like a tax. That is the definition of a tax. Our failure to call it a tax in the bill doesn't mean that it is not a tax. It just means that it is a tax that we will not admit is a tax. 
They say if it walks like a duck and squawks like a duck, if it quacks like a duck and acts like a duck, it is probably a duck. Well, this is a higher price that is charged for these cigarettes. It is collected from the people. It gets transmitted to the Government and the Government spends it on Government programs. Now, I think that walks like a duck and squawks like a duck. I think it acts like a duck and quacks like a duck. I think it is a duck or it is a tax, if you want to use that word. 
And here is the provision from the bill itself. I guess it is section 404--I need to be corrected on that--instead of section 405. Frankly, we haven't had this bill in its final form long enough to examine it. This is another one of these bills that comes to the floor of the Senate before the Congressional Budget Office has had a chance to score it, before anybody has a chance to read it. We throw it on the desk and we say we are starting to debate it. Little wonder we have some of these numbers wrong. 
Section 404 says, `Payments to be passed through to consumers.' So all the big, heavy penalties in this bill, they are not to be borne by the tobacco companies. These are to be borne by consumers. Consumers are going to pay for this. And, obviously, that is something. So that the bill doesn't just allow tobacco companies to recoup their costs, it requires that they not impair their profits, that they not otherwise find ways to keep the consumers from paying this very massive tax, a regressive tax that hits the poor people of America the most. It requires that these taxes be paid by consumers. The only way this bill is going to have a major dent in the way tobacco is consumed is that the Federal Government gets paid big, big bucks. 
As I indicated earlier, many local communities--State, city and county governments--are providing ways to reduce teen smoking. They want to do it by outlawing the possession of tobacco by young people so that smoking by young people would be considered illegal. This bill doesn't do that. This bill taxes the 98 percent of the adult smokers at an incredibly high rate, along with the 2 percent of teen smokers, and really impairs the ability of families to make ends meet. It actually penalizes the companies if they do not pass these costs on. So no company, no tobacco company is to pay any of this $755 billion that I am seeking to delete in this amendment. It is illegal, according to the bill, to have the tobacco companies pay any of this money. This money is to be paid by consumers. 
Also, my amendment strikes the annual payments required by this legislation. Again, this bill actually requires the tobacco industry to pass along this cost to consumers. Remember, these are not the real penalties on tobacco companies. These are taxes 
levied on the users of tobacco products. Under this amendment, tobacco companies would still pay hefty penalties if teenage smoking targets are not met. 
So my amendment does not save the tobacco companies from paying penalties if the teenage smoking targets are not met. The incentives for the tobacco companies to avoid teenage smoking are left in this bill, and there is a serious penalty in the bill that would require that the payments be made by tobacco companies if we do not reduce teen smoking. That is left alone. What I take out of the bill is the $755 billion in taxes on consumers. 
A lot of people wonder why, if the tobacco companies are the bad folks, as the subject of this bill, that instead of taxing the tobacco companies, we are taxing consumers. Well, they ought to wonder about that. Basically, what we do is we leave the requirement that teen smoking be reduced, we leave the penalties if you do not reduce teen smoking on the tobacco companies. But we stop the tax that will take $800, $1,000, $1,600 from three-pack-a-day families, $1,600 a year out of their budgets, out of their take-home budgets. 
So our approach is not to say that the tobacco companies should not be responsible for reducing teen smoking. Tobacco companies were responsible for promoting it. This amendment does not say they are not responsible for reducing it. This amendment says the tobacco companies will be responsible for reducing it, and if these tobacco companies do not get it reduced, they, as a matter of fact, are going to be in serious trouble. They are going to have to pay very significant penalties. But I do not believe we should say that the American people are the ones who should be penalized for the conduct of the tobacco companies. 
Frankly, that is what this bill does. There is a lot of evidence in this case, in this situation about tobacco companies and about their conscious desire to focus their advertising on teen smokers and potential teen smokers, and there is a big presumption that if people didn't start when they were teens, they wouldn't start later. It might be that those people would start later on. You know, you can't automatically assume that if someone starts when he is 14, if you don't let him start when he is 14, that he would not start later when he was 18, 19 or 20. Everybody starts driving a car at the age of 16. That doesn't mean, if you move the age up to 20, that nobody would start driving a car later on. 
There is a presumption in all this data that somehow if they didn't start when they were younger, they wouldn't start later. These same people who start young while it is legal now may start older when it is legal later if we were to do something like this. I don't think that presumption follows. 
But Americans already are burdened with taxes that are inordinately high. Americans today are working longer and harder than ever before to pay their taxes. How many families are there with both parents in the workplace, working day, working night, trying to make ends meet, trying to have food and clothing for their children? And they are already paying incredibly high taxes. We are now paying the highest taxes overall in the history of this country. And surprisingly enough--I suppose that it is not all that great a surprise--we have got taxes to the point where the Federal budget is in surplus. The Congressional Budget Office indicates that the surplus will be between $43 billion and $63 billion. I think that when we have a surplus, we ought to be debating how we reduce taxes on people, how we make it easier for them and their families, how we somehow make it possible for them to meet the needs of their families instead--not how to siphon more money out of the pockets of working Americans.

Mr. ASHCROFT. If the Senator is making the point that these people will not be buying cigarettes and therefore would not be paying this tax, that is contrary to what this bill assumes. This bill assumes this income. And in order to assume this income, you have to presuppose that people will not stop buying cigarettes. 
You cannot get $868 billion over the next 25 years if people stop buying cigarettes. The first presumption of this bill--there are several presumptions--is that people are addicted. That is one of the evils we are supposed to be addressing. But after we presume they are addicted, we take advantage of the addiction by imposing a tax on the addicted. And then we spend the money we receive from the tax. If they are going to quit smoking because the price goes up, then we are not going to get the money. You can't have both the `quit' and the `money.' If people quit smoking, they won't pay the tax, and we have $868 billion in this bill that we are presuming people are going to go ahead and pay. That is the money I am talking about, the $868 billion that is coming out of the budgets of families. 
What is stunning to me is that 59.4 percent of this tax increase, 59.4 percent of it comes from people who make less than $30,000 a year. 60 percent of the $800 billion--about $500 billion--is coming out of the pockets of people who make less than $30,000 a year. We take that out of their pockets. We can't spend it here if they don't send it here. So this whole bill is predicated on them sending it here. And when they send it here and we spend it, that means they can't spend it. 
What do we spend it on? We spend it on 17 new boards and commissions, or--I guess there is an amendment now which says these are no longer to be identified as boards and commissions. So we have gone from the lack of accountability of boards and commissions, to the anonymity of stealth commissions and boards that will be tucked away in agencies. All the spending will still take place, but it will be done without as many labels. 
We are talking about a massive tax increase of $868 billion. That is what is going to happen. That is what is projected. You don't get the money from the people at the same time they keep the money. This money can only be in one place.

Mr. ASHCROFT. If cigarettes sold illegally become commonplace, it might well be that people will have greater access to an array of contraband items--`Here, you can either buy cigarettes from me, or you can buy marijuana from me, or you can buy drugs from me.' I am aware of that potential. I answer the question of the Senator from Texas by saying I am not only aware of it, but I am deeply concerned about it because drugs are a serious threat. They, in many respects, are far more serious than the threat of cigarettes.

Mr. ASHCROFT. I am aware of that. I think the American people have a pretty clear understanding of what the most serious long-term threats are, and they rank those appropriately.

those.

Mr. ASHCROFT. There is some data on that. Some analysts have predicted that the price per pack would be much more than the $1.10 increase by the time you work it through the system. They have estimated that the increase will be $2.78 a pack. 
</TEXT>

<DOC>
<DOCNO>105-ashcroft-mo-27-19980520</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
Mr. ASHCROFT. I think the price these analysts have indicated is $4.68. You first tack on the $1.10 tax. Then you add all the other costs in this bill that will most likely be passed on to consumers. Then the look-back penalties capped at $3 billion a year have to be added. The liability of $8 billion a year capped has to be added. In the analysis, it was assumed only 20 percent of this will have to be paid out every year. However, due to changes in the bill, and no doubt on behalf of the trial lawyers, I think 100 percent of the $8 billion will be paid out every year. 
It is clear to me that you have a very serious price increase. And the suggestion that it is $1.10 or $1.50 is very, very conservative. The truth of the matter is it is likely to be 2 to 3 times that much.

These were imported to the United States for smuggling back into Canada, and it represents that while the prices were high in Canada, there was a real aggravated problem with a black market in Canada. As long as you sell cigarettes illegally, I think selling them to underage individuals is an easy next step.

The Congressional Budget Office's responsibility is to provide us with the information on the basis of which we can make good decisions, and not seriously flawed information. I think that there is responsibility and an opportunity to improve our potential for good decisionmaking. That is why they would have to challenge those studies which, obviously, would be misleading if not understood in the light of the Congressional Budget Office qualification.

Mr. ASHCROFT. I think it is pretty clear they have boosted, or seek to boost the kind of financial impact to a very serious--hundreds of billions of dollars--extent. 
My objection is that this is all passed on to low-income people, consumers. Obviously there are other impacts as well. Obviously it affects the ability of companies to participate in this kind of settlement.

Mr. ASHCROFT. Yes. I believe a one-pack-a-day habit in participating in smoking would cost an additional $547--if you had three packs a day, it takes you to about $1,600. Money that is taken from the family. It does not matter how much the family makes. It could be very low income. Most smokers tend to be in the low-income areas. So it is a very, very aggressive tax on low-income America.

Mr. ASHCROFT. My view is we should target to do things we can actually do to reduce teen smoking, and we have to do it in a way that is not an oppressive tax burden on hard-working families, especially low-income families in America. 
The proposal to raise this tax to $1.50, the proposal to have it at $1.10 is an unacceptable incursion into the ability of families to provide for themselves. That is why I oppose this $1.10 pass-through tax on American consumers, particularly low-income individuals.

Mr. ASHCROFT. I earlier agreed and, as a matter of fact, urged you to have Members from your side go ahead of me. I don't mind them having a chance to speak. When we sought unanimous consent for that, it was objected to by the manager of the bill. I had intended, in every respect, to provide for ample debate. 
My view is that this is a very important topic. I learned last night in an announcement by those managing this bill that there would be an effort made to table this amendment without giving a full opportunity for discussion and that there was a time set without even so much as seeking an agreement from Senators as to how much time could be spent. 
In my judgment, if you are going to have an $868 billion tax increase on the American people in pursuit of an objective, which is allegedly the reduction of teen smoking, but has lots of other consequences and is unlikely to achieve the objective, we ought to at least be able to debate it. So I am very willing to consider full debate. I want to have that on this issue. But the managers of this bill have basically signaled to me that they intend to truncate debate, that they don't want this discussed. 
So it was my judgment that I needed to come to the floor and bring the evidence with me and then speak about this bill. I intend to speak about it and say what I think needs to be said. I am very pleased to have questions raised. But when questions are raised, obviously, that comes out of the time for me to make my remarks. That would extend the time. I think my position is clear. Early on, I tried to make it possible for those in the Chamber to go ahead of me and make remarks, and that was rejected. So if my only choice is to make my own remarks, then I will make my own remarks. But I sought to make it possible for others to speak.

<TEXT>
Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I am deeply troubled about the fact that we are, in this process, taxing American families and taxing those American families who have very limited income. Fifty-nine point four percent of the $755 billion that my amendment would take out of this bill, which are taxes on consumers--59.4 percent of that is to be paid by families with incomes of less than $30,000. If you move it up to the $60,000 level, you are talking abut almost two-thirds of the people, hard-working families from our culture, who struggle to put clothing on the backs of their children and the right kind of food on the table. 
There is a suggestion by some that they can just stop smoking automatically. If they are going to stop smoking, why are we counting on the money? We are counting on receiving almost $1 trillion over the next 25 years from these folks, and it is predicated on the idea that they can't stop smoking. If it were a switch that we could flip on and off, perhaps we would go find the switch and do it. But that is not what we are talking about. We are talking about taxing individuals who don't have any elasticity of demand. 
There has been a lot of talk about the elasticity of demand, economics--that if you elevate the price, the demand will go down. If people are addicted, they can't stop, so they have to pay. That is these folks here--59.4 percent of the individuals paying this tax will be individuals making under $30,000 a year. 
Americans are working longer and harder than ever to pay their taxes. The number of moms and dads, two parents in the family, both working; or in single-parent families, obviously, the only parent is working--we are taking more and more of their resources. We take now more of the income of the American people than ever before in taxes. We are at peace, we are in prosperity, but still, Government is costing more than ever before. We have charged so much for Government, we are finding we have a $43 billion surplus. CBO says it might be up to a $63 billion surplus. 
What are we going to do? Instead of giving people their money back, instead of saying, `You send it, we spend it,' we should be saying, `You earned it, we returned it.' No, we are not doing that. Where are we going with this? We are inviting another $868 billion of burden on those who can least afford to pay it. It is just incredible. We should be debating how to return the money to taxpayers, not how to siphon more out of their pockets. As currently drafted, the proposed tobacco bill is nothing more than an excuse for Washington to raise taxes and spend more money. 
I might add that earlier I sent to the desk a modification of the amendment making technical changes. That does not require anything. I want to indicate to the Senate that I had done so, and it doesn't require action. 
This proposed increase in Government and taxes is the biggest proposed increase since President Clinton's proposed increase on health care. My own sense is that it took a while for the people of the country to realize what the Federal takeover in health care was going to do to this country, when the American people figured out what it was going to cost. And when the American people understand that this isn't a penalty on the tobacco companies, this $755 billion that I want to knock out of this bill isn't something that the tobacco companies will pay, this is something consumers will pay. 
The law specifically forbids a tobacco company from passing this on to consumers. There is a mandatory rule that this can't come out of the profits of tobacco companies. This can't come out of their retained earnings. This can't come out of their capitalization. This has to be imposed on the backs of these workers, these folks who are making under $30,000 a year, these additional folks making under $60,000 a year. 
Here we could have an additional 17 boards and commissions. There is the statute: `Payments to be Passed Through to Consumers'--not payments to be endured or suffered by the tobacco companies. But these are payments to be undertaken by poor families. Three packs a day, $1,600 a year--that is what they are asking for, $1,600 a year off of the tables, out of the houses, out of the budget for the children in these families. 
That is what this is a law about. This is a law that would take an enormous amount of resources from the families of America. They are already paying taxes that are virtually out of sight. They are already paying taxes for more than food, clothing, shelter, and transportation combined in this country, and we are going to add to the poorest of the poor this incredible burden. Seventeen boards, commissions, and agencies--they say they have been removed from the legislation. The bureaucracies envisaged by the bill will still be there; it is just that they are no longer sort of visible. We have gone from unaccountability to anonymity. That will not cure things. This huge tax increase would be levied against those who are least capable of paying. 
According to the Congressional Research Service, tobacco taxes are perhaps the most regressive tax that is levied in America. It is a tax that hits poor people the hardest. And we are discussing what we want to do with that $868 billion of additional burden on the poor. About 60 percent of this tax increase would fall on families earning $30,000 a year or less. Those earning less than $10,000 a year make up only 10 percent of the population, but 32 percent of those people smoke. So the current tobacco tax represents 5 percent of the smokers' income in this category. 
This would take from the people who are struggling to make ends meet, making $10,000 a year, 5 percent of their income. That is really a pack-a-day habit we are talking about. We are not talking about a two-packs-a-day habit. If they have two packs a day, it is far more than 5 percent of $10,000. Those making between $10,000 and $20,000 a year are only 18 percent of the population; however, 30 percent of them smoke. The current tobacco tax would take a real chunk--2 percent of the smokers' income--in that category. This bill amounts to a tax increase on 31 percent of Americans who earn under $20,000 a year. 
So among those who are the poorest of our hard-working Americans, who are low-income, they are the people who really get hit with this. And 31 percent of all people making less than $20,000 a year are the individuals who are going to be sustaining this tax burden. Households earning less than $10,000 a year will feel the bite of this tax increase most of all. 
The Joint Committee on Taxation estimates that these households, those earning less that $10,000 a year overall, would see their Federal taxes rise by 44.6 percent--44.6 percent. Those making between $10,000 a year and $20,000 a year make up 18 percent of the population; 30 percent of them smoke. In most areas of the country, somebody earning $10,000 a year is well below the poverty line. But here we come. We are so interested in additional revenue, at a time when we have surplus, that we are willing to sock it to those who are low-income individuals. 
We spend much of our time in this body trying to find solutions for those in this income bracket. We have tax credits; we have welfare programs; we have educational grants; we have job training programs. They cost us billions of dollars a year. We try to lift people in those low-income brackets out of their problems and difficulties. However, today, Members of this body are enthusiastically saddling them with a huge, huge tax burden. In fact, some are even trying to make it worse. 
It is pretty clear that some people have come and said that people will stop smoking. I will get to that next. Here it is. The kind of tax increase, if you are making under $10,000 a year, is 44 percent. We are not really tax increasing anybody since most smokers are concentrated in this part of the graph. Low-income people are going to pay the lion's share. They are going to have very significant increases in their tax load. 
Now, some Members were critical about the statement that this is a huge tax increase on low-income people. It was stated that I was assuming that they would be irresponsible and not take care of their families' needs. I am not saying here that anybody is irresponsible. I do think that the Government has frequently been irresponsible. It is irresponsible to take this much of the income from people who are trying to clothe their families and feed their 
families. 
The revenue assumptions in this bill are based on the fact that most people will continue to smoke. You can't have it both ways. You can't say that people are going to suddenly stop smoking; you can't say that and still say you are going to spend the money and collect the money. This is basically a tax, a tax that relates to the increase in the price of cigarettes, a tax that passes money from low-income, hard-working Americans to big Government in America so the Government can do a wide variety of things. 
Frankly, I think some of the things that this proposes to do are literally laughable. Some of the programs that are in this bill are designed to curtail smoking overseas. So we are going to tax low-income Americans, folks who are struggling at $10,000, $15,000, or $20,000 a year to make ends meet; we are going to take money from them and go overseas and run antismoking campaigns. Now, in my judgment, that is a very, very serious disconnect with what we are supposed to do. We are supposed to make it possible for Americans to live decently and independently and provide for their children, to have a framework in which Government at least lets them enjoy the fruits of the things they labor to produce; and if we don't do that, it seems to me that we obviously have failed. 
I don't believe we should be taking money from hard-working, low-income Americans and putting it into a foreign aid system that tries to tell people on the other side of the world how they should act and what they should do. If I believed that everybody would quit smoking, the impact of this bill obviously would not be so significant because it would not be a tax. But it is clear that there will be a tax, and there is a predicated set of receipts that is going to run between three-quarters of a trillion dollars and a trillion dollars. Everyone in this Chamber, the administration, and health officials are making the assumption that people will continue to smoke. 
As currently drafted, this legislation will cause somebody who smokes two packs daily to pay the Government an additional $803 a year. A lot of families could take a vacation on $803. A lot of families could buy additional clothing. A lot of families could afford courses at a junior college to change their skill levels and upgrade their jobs. A lot of families could care for a relative or otherwise do something that we need to get done rather than send this money to Washington, DC. That is $803 for somebody who smokes two packs a day. For a family smoking three packs a day, it is even more. 
My amendment would prevent that from happening. My amendment simply says we are not going to punish the American people for that which the tobacco companies have done; we are not going to hurt the hard-working Americans of low-income as a means of objecting to the abuses of big tobacco. 
Moreover, as currently drafted, this legislation allows the tobacco companies to deduct the mandatory payments that are ultimately to be paid by consumers as regular business expenses. Over 5 years, that kind of writeoff would be worth about $36 billion in the tobacco industry. So if we are giving a tax break to the tobacco industry that is going to be worth $36 billion to them over 5 years, and part of that comes as a result of the fact that we are taxing individual consumers, I think that is really unfair. 
Let's take a second to understand this. In this legislation that is supposed to be so tough on the tobacco industry--and, frankly, the tobacco industry participated in formulating almost all of the basic components of this legislation--the companies act as a tax collector by sending the U.S. Treasury $102 billion over the next 5 years. Then they get a tax deduction, and they cost U.S. taxpayers--all taxpayers, whether they are smokers or not--$36 billion in lost revenues because of the tax deduction. 
What you get here is a subsidy through the back door. They send in $102 billion they collect from people and then they get $36 billion of it back as a tax break for the company. I think that is a particularly anomalous result. That is a result which we certainly do not really want to have. They collect money from poor, hard-working Americans, turn it in, and when they turn it in they get a tax deduction of $36 billion. 
Before we consider passing a massive tax increase, it should behoove us to review the government's record thus far in respect to taxes, spending, and government employment. Where have we been recently in terms of tax increases, in terms of spending? In Washington, taxes and spending are the only things more addictive than nicotine. Policymakers in Washington think they know better how to spend the money of families than American families do. 
In the 15 years prior to 1995, Congress passed 13 major tax increases. Last year's Taxpayer Relief Act was the first meaningful tax cut since 1981. The tobacco tax increase would more than erase that relief. We need more tax relief, not less. If we have the increase that is proposed here, it will totally erase the relief we gave last year. The tobacco industry tax, then, proposed in this bill is not a tax on the industry. It is a tax on the consumers. It would more than erase the relief we gave them last year. 
The tax relief date has now set a record of May 10. People work longer this year for the Government than ever before. Federal, State, and local taxes claim 37.6 percent of the income of a median two-income family in 1997, more than the couple spent on food, and shelter, on clothing, and transportation combined. 
During Bill Clinton's first 5 years in office the Federal Government collected 19 cents in taxes for every dollar increase in the gross domestic product. According to the Joint Economic Committee, the Federal Government is now taking a higher share of economic growth than under any President in recent history. The Joint Economic Committee continues, The average rate during the entire era before Clinton from Presidents Eisenhower to Bush was 19 percent. Obviously, the Federal Government has yet to reject the idea that it can just tax and spend and tax and spend.

Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I thank the Chair. 
Members of this body have been arguing over the past few days that there is no tax in this bill. In fact, the Finance Committee, in its mark, at least tried to level with the American people by reporting out a bill that calls it a tax. For a long time this was sailing under a sail which was mislabeled. Webster's Dictionary defines a tax as a compulsory payment, usually a percentage levied on income, property, values, sales prices, et cetera, for the support of government. Let's lay this argument to rest now and forever. This is a tax. It is a compulsory payment made at the point of sale for the benefit of government. In this bill we have compulsory payments by the industry. 
The bill then requires the cost of these payments to be passed on as price increases to consumers, and even penalizes companies if they fail to collect this tax. Payments are used to fund massive programs for Federal and State governments. It has been said that industry is the group that is convincing people this is a tax bill. Frankly, industry couldn't make this a tax bill if it weren't a tax bill. Frankly, this body cannot keep it from being a tax bill if the language of the bill is really taxing. What we know is that the Senate can't keep it from being a tax if it is really a tax by calling it something else, and industry couldn't make it a tax by calling it a tax. The truth of the matter is it is an elevated price required to be collected, the proceeds of which go to support government. 
The supporters of this bill claim this legislation is needed to curb teen smoking. `Do it for the children' is all we hear. But this bill is about big government, not about protecting the health of young people. It is about more bureaucracy. It is about more Federal programs. It is about higher taxes, new bureaucracy. 
The bill reported out of committee contained 19 new boards, commissions, and agencies--17 new boards, commissions and agencies--a blatant expansion of government claim under immediate and harsh criticism. What happened? We have a claim that the bureaucracy has been eliminated. But is it really? I don't think that it is really eliminated. I think the names have been changed. But the same tangled mess as this chart represents still exists in this bill. 
This is the structure of the National Tobacco Policy and Youth Smoking Reduction Act that was reported by the Senate Commerce Committee on the 1st of May 1998, just a couple weeks ago. This is a complicated set of extremes. I might add that these are funding extremes. Money is flowing like a flood. The bureaucracy is still in this bill. It is just more anonymous, less visible, less accountable. The names may have been changed, but it is still the same animal. 
Let's look at the whole chart. Here we have the International Tobacco Control Trust Fund. Interesting. The International Tobacco Control Trust Fund, foreign aid grants to support tobacco control. The international program is still here. I will talk more about it in a minute. 
The Tobacco Asbestos Trust Fund, $21 billion allows payments to be made for asbestos claims when Congress enacts qualifying legislation. Payments will be made out of the tobacco trust fund for the 22-percent set-aside for public health expenditures. 
Compliance bonuses for States: Here it is. It is still in there. 
Research activities for CDC, Institute for Medicine, and NIH are still in there. 
State licensing program grants are still in there. 
The National Tobacco Free Education Program is still on the chart. 
The Indian tribe enforcement bureaucracy is still there. 
The Indian tribe public health grants are still in there. 
Counteradvertising programs are still in there. 
The prevention of tobacco smuggling measure is still in there. 
Veterans programs are still in there. 
The National Tobacco Document Depository is still here. 
Smoking cessation programs are here. 
Child care development block grants are still there. 
We are going to be taxing those lowest income families to provide additional child care for others. 
Tobacco community revitalization, this is the tobacco farmer; very serious questions about this particular portion of the bill. 
The Senator from Texas talked about the so-called Tobacco Community Revitalization Program. He brought out, as a matter of fact, on the floor yesterday the fact that he priced tobacco allotments per acre. It could be purchased for about $3,500 or $3,600. Then he indicated that the payment envisaged here was a multiple of about five times that high. 
The international programs, which I mentioned, are kind of interesting. The committee bill contained the American Center on Global Health and Tobacco, which was authorized to receive $150 million a year so that we could sort of be influential overseas with our policy on tobacco. 
We want to tax the lowest income families in America. We want to tax hard-working people, increase their taxes. My amendment would delete $755 billion in taxes on these individuals contained in this bill. 
This bill is designed to fund things like the American Center on Global Health and Tobacco. 
The center is not to be found in the managers' amendment. In its place, the Secretary of Health and Human Services is authorized to establish an international tobacco control awareness effort. So instead of having this agency sort of be out there created by the statute, we have just authorized the bureaucracy to create a new agency. The Secretary of Health and Human Services is authorized to establish an international tobacco control awareness effort. 
Now, here we have to remember--we are taxing American low-income families to do this--59.4 percent of all the taxes that go to establish this international program on tobacco awareness are going to come from families making less than $30,000 a year. What is this new effort required to do? One, support the development of appropriate governmental control activities in foreign countries--enhance foreign countries' capacities to collect, analyze, and disseminate data about the cost of tobacco use. 
We are going to fund foreign countries so that they can have studies on how much it costs to use tobacco. And we are going to do that by taxing low-income people. Sixty cents out of every dollar in this program is going to come from families with less than $30,000--low-income individuals, less than $30,000. How much money will this cost?

Mr. ASHCROFT. As a matter of fact, I have been speaking about that. I indicated that this was the chart and these functions remain. But very frequently, instead of the bureaucracy still being there and labeled and identified, you have a transfer from the bureaucracy to something that you just ask the Secretary to do. 
For instance, I have just been talking about the transition from the international tobacco control trust fund, and in its place the new bill has `the Secretary of Health and Human Services is authorized to establish.' So instead of actually establishing, you just authorize that a bureaucrat establishes it. You get it out of the bill, but you still have it in terms of consequence, and you still have all the money available to be spent for the same purposes. 
That is my understanding of what has happened here, and you are going to have $35 million each year for the first 5 years, and then such funds as may be necessary for these international activities. So I am aware of the fact that the bureaucracies were taken out of the bill ostensibly, but I am also aware of the fact that what you let go out the front door it looks to me like you bring back in the back door, because the Secretary of Health and Human Services is authorized to establish--it is not in the bill anymore, but the Secretary of Health and Human Services is authorized to establish an international control awareness effort, and that is basically for the same purposes.

already programs which are undertaken, but not even close to the extent that this bill mandates--thus expanding the already oversized Government bureaucracy. I also understand that what we have here is a pot of money that we think we can generate by taxing the lowest-income, hardest-working poor people in the country. And what we are going to do is to start spending more money for these overseas studies, and we are going to put 60 percent of that additional money that comes out of this additional $868 billion tax--$6 out of every $10 is going to come out of the pockets of Americans earning less than $30,000 a year. That is really troubling me.

That includes all the things that are in the bill. The $1.10 which is the mandated price increase, by the time it works its way through the system, would be about a $2.68 increase in the price of cigarettes.

If this bill were predicated on the idea that people would quit, we would not have the big numbers and the big money to pass around. We are assuming that these people who earn less than $30,000 a year are strapped in the habit of smoking, can't quit, and therefore we are going to be able to have $868 
billion of their money over the next 25 years.

Mr. ASHCROFT. Families have a tough decision where they cut back, but I imagine it would hurt virtually everything they do in some measure. I doubt if they would take it all out of one area. For instance, I don't think they would stop driving their car, and I don't think they would stop eating. They can't do that. But I think virtually every aspect of their existence. If you are talking $800, $1,200 a year, $100 a month, for instance, on three packs a day, if you take that $100 of a month out of the budget of low income families, we may drive some of them into dependency. And that is last thing government should do is make it hard for people to provide for their families. We should be finding ways to make it easier for people to provide for their families.

Mr. ASHCROFT. Obviously, they could be forced into all kinds of reliance on outside sources. With the stress that would happen to a family that lost $100 a month by virture of this kind of massive Federal tax on the family, who knows what happens even in the way the family is composed in a setting like that because financial stress is a big part of the challenge to families generally. This is an anti-family measure. 
This takes from families a very serious proportion of the resources they use to care for one another. And when we say that Government wants this money so badly it will take it from you, and we know you are going to pay it because you are addicted and can't stop, we have really allowed the greed of Government to overtake us. And to say to families, it doesn't matter about you, we are so interested in doing what we want to do--and it does shock me that we are going to spend this money overseas, keeping data about the costs of smoking overseas. I just can't imagine how many folks in Arkansas or my home State of Missouri, who are earning $30,000 or $10,000 or $15,000, would want to make these kinds of payments so they could keep track of the costs of smoking in foreign jurisdictions. That is mind-boggling.

We are helping foreign governments decide how costly it is for their citizens, I guess. I don't know if this is an idea to make sure--we want people overseas to make sure they realize how much it is costing them to smoke? 
I think we have a responsibility to people in this country, who know how much it is costing them to live, to let them keep some of the money they earn so they can help their families. But the $350 million a year that goes into this program is something that I seriously question whether we want to tax the lowest income people in America in order to achieve.

<DOCNO>105-ashcroft-mo-181-19980520</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
Mr. ASHCROFT. Obviously. You know, 60 percent of all these sums are going to come from people who earn less than $30,000 a year. So States that have a high population that earn in the category of less than $30,000 year are going to be paying far more of this than the other States which have high-income individuals and are not so populated by individuals who smoke. 
Now the real correlation is, if you smoke, you are going to pay this increase in taxes. It turns out that smoking is the custom, is the choice--I think it is a bad one; I have never thought smoking was a good choice--it is the choice of people who are low-income, and it is something they feel they choose to do. It just astounds me that only in Washington, DC, is a bad choice made by free people the basis for taxation. 
People are free. We haven't suggested they are not free to make this choice. We just want to make it hard. We are apparently 
willing to make it hard for those people, and we are willing to do that in order to fund overseas programs.

Mr. ASHCROFT. There are some interesting things that come as a result of this proposed tax increase. 
No. 1, it would mean that the Federal Government profited more than any other entity or institution from smoking in this culture. We would have more benefit from smoking than any of the companies would in profit. So the Federal Government would become the No. 1 beneficiary of tobacco use in the country. 
No. 2, if there is a serious black market problem with contraband cigarettes, then that changes a number of calculations. One of the things it will change is, if people go into the black market on cigarettes sales, they not only don't pay their Federal tax, which is this additional $1.50 that is being proposed here today per pack, but they will also not be paying the State tax. You can't imagine some contraband person saying, `We are going to go ahead and pay all the State taxes on these contraband cigarettes, but we are not going to pay the Federal tax.' 
So it might well be if the black market develops a sense of intensity and there is a substantial velocity in the black market, that money which had previously been paid to States by cigarette marketers, that money from those packs that are no longer being sold in the open market but are being sold in the black market, States could lose that revenue stream which they now have from the legitimate sale of cigarettes. 
It should be noted that there is already a black market problem in cigarettes because of different State levels and just because the tax is so high. This would probably--frankly, it might serve to make millionaires out of some people who are already dabbling in the black market for cigarettes.

Mr. ASHCROFT. This is a very good question. I thank the Senator for asking it. These are hardworking people, struggling. They get up early in the day, work late at night, sometimes rely on friends and relatives to help care for their children. Sometimes they can afford day care; sometimes they can't. But, basically, this is a bill which says we are going to take their money and we are going to spend it in this kind of bureaucracy. 
As I indicated, some of these bureaucracies are relabeled and they are not constituted independently anymore. Some of these are constituted only by virtue of the fact that they are authorized for a Secretary, a Cabinet Secretary, to appoint. But, by and large, in the grand scheme of things, this is a situation where the money goes; it does not come. And the money --there is no specific 
indemnity for individuals who are the people who are hit by this tax. I know of nothing in this bill that says, for people who have a very serious consequence as a result of this tax, we are going to mitigate it in some way. It is simply not there. 
Frankly, we have to be honest. The proponents want to impose this tax to make it very difficult for people to smoke. But for people who are addicted, it will be more difficult for them to stop. And that is why they can presume that we will be collecting these hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of billions of dollars.

Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Arkansas for the kinds of inquiries that he raised. They go right to the heart of the issue. This tax is focused on the lowest-income individuals in the United States, people who have the least capacity to pay. Frequently, people making in the $30,000 range will be young people. They haven't gotten their incomes up high. They are the people with children in their families, so they need to be able to provide for those children. They need to be able to make sure they are cared for. They need to try to start putting something away so those kids can someday go to college. Instead of allowing them to put something away, we are going to take something away. 
For a two-pack-a-day family, that is $803 we are going to take away. Pardon me, that is under the $1.10 figure; that is not under the $1.50 figure. For a three-pack-a-day family, that will take you over $100 a month we are going to take away so that the family can't put it away for when they have needs. Frequently, in many of these families, they are not in a position to put anything away. These are families literally making it from check to check, and we are intending to come in and make this kind of substantial demand on them. 
The bill requires States to have massive licensing schemes for retailers who sell tobacco products. So there will be significant new bureaucracies at the State level. These are just examples of bureaucracy in this bill. I want to mention that just once more. One of the strongest aspects of this bill is the States will be eligible to receive a total of $100 million a year in compliance grants if they reach a certain level where kids are unable to purchase tobacco products. 
Then it requires States to give out part of those funds to retailers with outstanding compliance records. Let me make it clear. It currently is illegal for a minor to purchase tobacco products in every State of the Union. However, Congress is now establishing a program of bureaucracy to reward retailers for following the law. I think it is pretty clear that this is the kind of double whammy that Government too frequently has. It is against the law in the States for retailers to sell cigarettes to youngsters, and now we are going to have a special incentive program paying large amounts of money, up to $100 million a year, if the retailers will only abide by the law.

Mr. ASHCROFT. I think the facts are these: That this massive tax on poor people in the United States would more than wipe out the entire tax cut passed last year, and that is at the assumption level of $1.10 a pack--not at the assumption level of $1.50 a pack, which is the Kennedy proposal. 
I want to make it clear that I am against the $1.10-a-pack increase, not because it is an increase on the tobacco companies, but precisely because it is not. This is not a tax or an injury to the tobacco companies; this is something that is required of the consumer. 
What I am saying is that we would collect so much money--even at $1.10 a pack--from people that it would totally erase last year's tax relief.

They are mandated that they be collected from, basically, the poorest people in the culture--60 percent, basically, under $30,000.

My encounter has been this: First of all, the bill is not raised, but when people find out that instead of punishing the tobacco companies, we are taxing tobacco users, so that an individual who earns less than $30,000 a year, if he is a two-pack-a-day smoker, he is going to pay an additional $803 in taxes, they don't understand that. They say, `Wait a second, if you are trying to punish evil tobacco companies, if that is your objective, punish the companies but don't punish hard-working Americans who are struggling to make ends meet.' 
My phones have begun to ring when people began to understand that this is not a circumstance where we are going to try to punish the tobacco companies to that extent. The real punishment comes because this law requires--this law forbids the tobacco company from taking any of this tax out of its earnings--it requires the company to `pass it on.' 
What is interesting, it is even more anomalous than that. The tobacco company collects this $109 billion in the next 5 years, or whatever it is, and turns it into the Government, and we give them a tax deduction for it so that they end up having a $36 billion subsidy that comes back for their having, basically, been involved in the collection of this sum of payment to the Government. 
My own view is that when people find out this bill really is a bill against hard-working Americans and it is a tax measure, that is when we are going to start hearing more about it. People thought this was antitobacco. There are some things in the bill that distress the tobacco companies, but, frankly, I am more distressed about what we do for them--shutting down their liability, cutting it off. I think it is wrong to say that there is a certain amount that they can be liable for and no more. 
You don't have any guarantees against lawsuits as a citizen. If you do things that are wrong, people can sue you. There is no limit to what can be collected against you if you do things that are wrong. This bill puts clear limits in for the tobacco companies, basically saying no matter what you do, you can only have this much money awarded against you in court. 
So no matter how many people are affected, whether it is cancer or emphysema, lung disease, heart disease, no matter how much it is that the courts might allocate against you, we are going to lock down the thing in this bill, we are going to provide a limitation. 
Some people don't understand. Originally, they thought this was anti-tobacco companies, and the companies are upset with them, but there are lots of things in here which are procompany and they are really anticonsumer.

Mr. ASHCROFT. I think it is clear that there has been inadequate examination. This bill hasn't had the kind of scoring that normally attends a bill. This bill was rushed and changed. The ink was not dry on the changes when the bill was submitted. 
Virtually no one had read the entire bill when it was offered. And we are now in this debate on the bill. And that is why I am willing to take the kind of time we are taking to discuss it. 
It was suggested yesterday that this massive tax increase would be concluded, that we would know what we were going to do on it because they were going to have a motion to table, and that motion to table would end this debate. 
I just do not think when you have this kind of massive Government--a 17-agency creation; $868 billion--that you rush through. I think it is clear we need to have the kind of thorough discussion, discussion that would allow us to debate the issues.

Mr. ASHCROFT. Senator Hutchinson just asked me a very important question. If we drive things into black market sales, then States which have been relying on reasonable tobacco taxes as a funding stream--if the tobacco sales go into the black market and underground, we actually make it very difficult for those States to continue with their programs because we will deprive them of the same stream. 
America has seen the kind of chaos that can come to law enforcement when we condition people to do things that are illegal because Government gets so invasive and heavyhanded. 
And if we condition people to be involved in illegal activities, where we have inordinate unjustifiable taxes that are imposed on consumers, and we prepare them and teach them to be involved in the black market, it is a lesson which we will regret having taught for a long, long time.

Mr. ASHCROFT. I thank the Senator from Oklahoma and really appreciate the questions which he propounds because they get to the heart of the matter. And I appreciate also the fact that you have relayed your experience with your town hall meetings. 
No other Senator in the U.S. Senate, I would venture to say, no other public official, deals with the public as intimately and aggressively as you do. You know, five town hall meetings a day, hopping from airport to airport; of course no other Senator that I know of has flown a light plane around the world on his own. I know that John Glenn has orbited the Earth. But you have stopped and talked to people most everywhere and certainly in Oklahoma. 
So I thank you for bringing that particular item to our attention.

Mr. ASHCROFT. I am sure that is the case. I thank the Senator from Oklahoma. 
I just want to say this question of the black market is a very serious question. 
If we aggravate the already tender situation which exists regarding the smuggling of cigarettes, we could literally create a very serious problem. And the problem not only relates to the loss of revenue to the Government, but it is also an issue that would and could be a problem which moves the black market in cigarettes from the sort of commercial area where black market cigarettes now are sold to stores and then the stores illegally sell cigarettes that have not had the right taxes paid on them. It could move it into the general population. 
If we start teaching young people that they can buy cigarettes cheaply on the black market, and they start to do things like that, it is, in my judgment, a very, very, very serious problem in terms of what we have taught and what we have conditioned in this culture. 
Furthermore, if we move the black market into sort of a retail situation--and I have some awareness of this because when I was Governor of my State, we had a significant cigarette tax, at least compared to neighboring States. There is some tobacco grown in Missouri, but very, very little. But we border on serious tobacco States, like Kentucky and Tennessee. And those States had very low tax rates. We had substantially higher tax rates. There were lots of cigarettes that came across the border of our States, but they really were not sold on the retail market. They were sold to folks who would sell them in stores with phony tax stamps and the like. 
But if we get to the point where we are going to have black market cigarettes sold in retail, and we condition young people to start saying that `I can break the law here,' there are two consequences. One, that is a very bad thing to get young people into. Two, those who are willing to break the law, to retail market substances which are illegal to sell to youngsters, probably will be selling other substances. So they may well be selling drugs, and they may say to the youngsters, `What do you want? I have cigarettes. I have marijuana. I have drugs.' And if you drive the price of cigarettes up substantially, it begins to make the price differential far less. So I have very serious reservations about what we might do in terms of a black market.

Mr. ASHCROFT. I would venture to say the State of Wyoming does not have a foreign aid program under the guise of the cigarette tax. So you will not have a program to develop an awareness overseas of the costs of smoking. 
One of the things that is in the international aspect of the bill we have here is that money will be taken, hundreds of millions of dollars every year will be sent to help foreign governments trying to decide what the cost of smoking is in their culture. 
I just don't think it is very likely that the Wyoming House of Representatives and Senate, which you presided over at one time, would be making that kind--the answer is, that is just a small part of what we are doing here. 
I admit the foreign aid is not a big part of this bill, but there are 17 new boards and commissions in the Federal Government, specific and categoric programs, and this isn't designed to provide income to the States. This is really a program that will provide income to the Federal Government. It will provide massive amounts of income to trial attorneys. It will provide serious income to tobacco farmers. If the one aspect of this bill goes through, it will give them about $18,000 an acre for their allotments. Of course, farmers don't even own the allotments. In a lot of cases, it is owned by someone else. Most of the lands could be bought for far less than $18,000 an acre. 
We are in a situation where this is a Federal measure which is going to support everything from foreign aid to trial lawyers and Federal programs. It is no wonder it won't do Wyoming good.

Mr. ASHCROFT. I thank the Senator from Wyoming for the question. This was the subject of a very serious set of questions that were propounded by the Senator from Utah earlier today. He literally went through the studies that have been presented by the administration and the studies that are being used to support the demand for a $1.50-a-pack increase, the demands being made by Senator Kennedy in his proposal. Those individuals are not satisfied with $1.10 a pack. They want to take it up to $1.50 a pack as a tax increase. 
Frankly, when you look at all the data, you can look at part of the graph and it looks like it reinforces what is being said about smoking going down when you increase the price. Price--CBO seriously questions price in terms of whether elasticity of demand depends on price. They raise a serious question about that, and they cite studies to challenge it. Of course, there isn't any elasticity in demand when a person is addicted. 
So for the poor people of America who have been smoking and are smoking, we are basically going to trap them, so that a poor person, even at the $1.10 level which is in the bill now--Senator Kennedy wants to move it to $1.50 per pack--at $1.10, that is two packs a day at $800 a year. Poor people cannot afford to take that out of the family budget. You sit around the kitchen table and say: What are we going to be able to do this year? Can we get the new refrigerator? We need this, that, or the other. 
If we walk in and say, the first thing we have to do is take $803 out of your budget, it restricts the capacities of families to operate. So not only are we threatening to do something that could hurt governments but we will undermine the capacities of families to support themselves. 
I think it is tragic when resources are consumed in smoking. I have never smoked cigarettes. I don't believe it is a good investment. But people are free to do that. I am not here to tell them what their life is and how they can operate. But for us to simply say we will hit the low-income people of America with $400 if they are one-pack-a-day, $800 in new taxes if they are two-packs-a-day people, or if we are talking about what the Kennedy proposal is, to give yourself basically a 40-percent increase on that, it is an amazing bite that we will ask to take out of the disposable income of people.

Mr. ASHCROFT. Well, I think there are ways to discourage smoking. I think the most effective discouragement is when parents work with their children, just like with drugs. I think that is the best way for parents to make sure their children don't smoke. Obviously, there are things that we can do in government to help. A number of States and local governments have literally made it illegal for youngsters to be in possession of tobacco, just like they have made it illegal for youngsters to be in possession of alcohol in certain settings. I think those are the options. 
One of the things I say in response to your question--because the Senator addresses the issue of 3,000 a day--is that the 3,000-a-day figure, in my judgment, underestimates the number of kids who try cigarettes a day. I have heard estimates as high as 6,000. 
What is interesting to me is that the drug czar, Gen. McCaffrey, indicates that 8,000 youngsters a day try illegal drugs. We are here with an administration that wants to impose a tax of $868 billion on basically low-income people in the United States to work on smoking, but there is a notable absence in this administration in terms of what it wants to do about drugs. The most eloquent thing this administration has been able to utter about drugs is, `I didn't inhale.' The second most eloquent thing was on MTV where the President said, `If I had to do it over again, I would inhale.' 
Now, when you have the President of the United States talking about inhaling drugs, I don't think that goes very far toward stopping people from smoking cigarettes. We have to be careful that we don't get our priorities out of whack so that we drive the price of cigarettes up or drive cigarettes into a black-market situation where they will be offered as part of a menu of illegal drugs, where students and young people in the culture might not only become acclimated and accustomed to dealing with black-market figures, which would be a very bad lesson to teach, but it would also, perhaps, introduce people to drug use as much as it does with cigarette use. 
I firmly believe that cigarette use is deleterious, bad for your health. Frankly, everybody knows that. King James, the guy who directed the translation of the Bible hundreds of years ago, admonished the people of England that this stuff is bad for you, that it is not good for you, it is bad for your health. We have known it, and there are a lot of things that are true about cigarette ads. I don't approve of them and I don't like them appealing to our children. But let's also understand that most young people who start with cigarettes know it is not good for their health.

Mr. ASHCROFT. The Senator from Wyoming asks a very, very important question. Frankly, it is a question to which I do not know the answer. We are still dealing with a bill that is in the process and, obviously, if you run the price up on one kind of smoking, you may be encouraging another kind of smoking--whether you are encouraging cigarettes bought on the black market, or whether you are encouraging a roll-your-own variety. I remember those slogans that used to be used, like `save your roll and roll your own.' But you wouldn't make a real savings in your roll if there was a disparity in the price here. My main concern has been that this is not a bill that has much promise to be effective. 
You know, the administration, as late as 1996, said they were going to cut tobacco smoking in youngsters by 50 percent in 6 years, and they weren't going to require any price increase. So they were going to be able to cut it in half. Now they don't expect to cut it in half, but they are going to get $868 billion over the next quarter century out of Americans' pockets. I think that is particularly onerous. 
You mentioned the relationship of cigarettes and the construction of them with one's own hands, and that obviously makes people think of the marijuana cigarettes that people roll on their own. Frankly, the drug problem is one that bothers me because I think we are inordinately, and perhaps inappropriately, focused, at least to a degree not warranted, on cigarettes rather than on drugs. 
As I indicated, General McCaffrey indicated that there are at least, according to his numbers--and the numbers have been tossed around--more kids are trying drugs than they are trying tobacco. I think we ought to be careful that we don't aggravate that problem.

Mr. ASHCROFT. Frankly, I haven't found it. I thank the Senator from Wyoming for asking the question. The impact on families here is pretty serious. But it is financial. 
Basically, it is to say that for a three-pack-a-day family there is a minimum of $100 a month that goes out of their expendable income, in addition to the taxes. That is not just the cost for smoking cigarettes. That is additional taxes, $100 a month for three packs a day; that is, if you take the committee's $1.10 range. 
My amendment would strip that $1.10 rate out because I don't think it is appropriate to punish people the way the tobacco companies have done. If you go with Senator Kennedy's proposal, it is a $1.50-a-pack rate. You get to the point of about $1,600 a year for three packs in the family at $1.50. I think that really makes it not only tough for the families to do something about smoking, it makes it really tough for the family to do things about all kinds of other things, like clothing the family, feeding the family, providing shelter and transportation, health care, and other things.

Mr. ASHCROFT. I am aware of the poll and I am aware of the concern. And I believe that is correct. I believe Americans are far more fearful that their children will be involved with illicit drugs than they are that their children might experiment with smoking.

Mr. ASHCROFT. Yes. I have pointed out that not only would elevated activities in black-market sales result in perhaps even lower prices for cigarettes, but it could, as a matter of fact, be a way in which individuals are introduced to drug use.

Mr. ASHCROFT. I think that has been a very clear experience. This precipitous increase in the rates of taxes on cigarettes has been a very sad experience by promoting black markets. Great Britain, or England, is said to have a black market of about 50 percent of all of its consumption. That is obviously something we don't want to teach or institute in this country. And other countries--Canada had a serious, very, very serious, bad experience with its precipitous rise in the increase of taxes on these kinds of products.

Mr. ASHCROFT. Obviously, if we were to take cigarette smuggling, which is now a commercial activity--the cigarettes are largely delivered to stores and are sold in the ordinary course of business. If we were to take that out of the commercial activity arena and put it into the retail activity, so that they would be sold on street corners by drug dealers or others who would sell contraband in a retail fashion, I think we threaten substantially the young people of this country with the introduction in an array of things that would be sold. Someone might offer: Now, you can 
either have cigarettes here or the marijuana here or these pills here, or like that. 
So, putting cigarettes into that setting may be a very evil sort of introduction of those individuals to the drug culture in a way that they would not otherwise be exposed.

Mr. ASHCROFT. I thank the Senator from Idaho for his valuable questions. I will now conclude. I have given my word to fellow colleagues in the Senate that I would try to be out by 2 o'clock, and I will. I thank the Senate for its accommodation. 
Frankly, I appreciate this institution because it does provide a way for individuals who really feel strongly about this measure to be able to talk about it. 
We have a bill. The Senator from Wyoming pointed out that it was not the one laid on the desk, because we have changes so rapidly. But here is the bill. There it is. This bill represents a $868 billion tax increase on the backs of America's poorest working families; 60 percent--59.4 percent. Let me not exaggerate. The estimate is 59.4 percent of the $868 billion--59.4 percent of the $868 billion from this measure is to be paid for by people earning less than $30,000 a year. 
I believe we should reject it. This is a massive tax increase. This is a massive expansion of Government. This is an affront to the effort of families to provide for themselves. And I believe it is something that will be counterproductive. It invites all kinds of pernicious activity, including the black market, including the potential for increased drug utilization, including the loss of revenue to States when the black market emerges and no longer do those selling cigarettes pay even State taxes. 
But at the very bottom of it all, this is a $868 billion tax to be shouldered by the hard-working families who earn less than $30,000 a year. That is inappropriate and to me it is unacceptable. I do not believe any of the lofty pie-in-the-sky--supposedly supported by studies--objectives really justify it. We should pursue those objectives in ways that are more likely to be successful and less likely to be destructive of the capacity of hard-working families to survive. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I rise today to offer an amendment. My amendment addresses this massive tax that is to be imposed on the people of this country, particularly on hard-working, poor people in America. My amendment strips this legislation of the provisions which will impose $755 billion in new taxes on the American people. 
More precisely, my amendment strikes the upfront payment of $10 billion. Tobacco companies won't bear the cost of this payment; consumers will. 
This bill, which purports to vilify the tobacco companies--and I am certainly not here to defend them. As a nonsmoker, and having watched a number of my friends die as a result of smoking, I am not here to defend the tobacco companies. But the bill specifically provides that tobacco companies will not bear the cost of these payments, consumers will. This bill requires and would make law the fact that tobacco companies can't bear this cost of $755 billion. This bill requires that consumers bear this cost. They will bear the cost in the form of higher prices, and there are actually penalties in this proposed law for the companies if they do not transfer to the consumers any of these costs. 
`Section 405. Payments to be passed through to consumers.' Here is the text of the law itself: 
Target price. Each participating tobacco product manufacturer shall use its best efforts to adjust the price at which it sells each unit of tobacco products in the domestic market or to an importer for resale in the domestic market by an amount sufficient to pass through to each purchaser on a per-unit basis an equal share of the annual payments to be made by such participating tobacco product manufacturer under this Act and the Master Settlement agreement for the year in which the sale occurs. 
The specific law of the statute requires that these so-called penalties are really not penalties on the tobacco companies at all--that these so-called penalties penalize the consumers. It is strange, indeed, to say to individuals, `The tobacco companies have been misbehaving. For years, they have been targeting you unduly, they have been providing you with a product which is deleterious to your health, and what we are going to do to them is nothing, basically, except to protect their markets, make sure their market shares are locked in, and give them protection from civil prosecution. But because you have been the recipient of the disease and the difficulty you have from smoking, we are going to pass through the payments to you.' 
This is adding insult to injury in the most classic of all ways. Remember, these are not penalties on tobacco companies, they are taxes levied on the users of tobacco products. 
Tobacco companies will still pay hefty penalties if teenage smoking targets are not met, but consumers will be safe from hundreds of billions of dollars in new taxes if my amendment is adopted. 
The so-called look-back provisions of this proposed law say that tobacco companies are going to have stiff penalties to pay if teenage smoking doesn't decline, and those stiff penalties are left in place by the amendment which I am offering. 
It is only the consumer, who is being asked to pay substantially higher prices by way of what really amounts to a tax, who will be saved the $755 billion which will otherwise be occasioned on those consumers in the event my amendment is not adopted. 
Americans today are working longer and harder than ever to pay their taxes. The Federal budget is in surplus. Congress should be debating how to return money to the taxpayer, not how to siphon more out of the pockets of working Americans. 
This is nothing more, nor less, than a massive tax increase on the American people--$755 billion, which the law requires to be passed through to consumers. Not that they receive $755 billion; the law requires that consumers end up paying $755 billion more as a means of punishing the tobacco companies--three-quarters of a trillion dollars in penalties to consumers whom we are trying to protect. 
As currently drafted, the proposed tobacco bill is nothing more than an excuse for Washington to raise taxes and spend money. It seems strange that, in this town, virtually anything will be an adequate excuse for raising taxes. Bad decisions by free people become excuses for massive tax increases in this country. 
This is the largest proposed increase in Government since President Clinton proposed his health care scheme. Oddly enough, his health care scheme was greeted initially with a relatively high level of support. But as the public learned more about the health care scheme, they understood that it was more scheme than health care, and, frankly, as the public learns more about this so-called tobacco settlement, they will realize that it is far more tax and Government than it is anything else--17 boards, commissions, and agencies. 
This huge tax increase will be levied against those who will be least capable of paying. According to the Congressional Research Service, right now we know that tobacco taxes are perhaps the most regressive tax levied in America. Tobacco taxes are perhaps the most regressive taxes levied in America. About 60 percent--60 percent, 59.4 percent I think is the number; yes--59.4 percent of the new $755 billion tax will land on people who make less than $30,000 a year. 
These are young families. They are working families. To take a three-pack-a-day figure from those families, some $1,600 a year, is to take their capacity to provide for their families and require it to be spent in Government on something else, something that the bureaucrats in Washington will consume, something that will not go to benefit their families. 
Sixty percent of the tax will fall on families earning $30,000 a year or less. Households earning $10,000 will feel the bite of this tax increase most of all. 
Listen to this: The Joint Committee on Taxation estimates that these households will see their Federal taxes rise by 44.6 percent. As currently drafted, this legislation will cause someone who smokes two packs daily to pay the Government an annual additional fee of $803--an additional $803. Smoking is already an expensive habit, and the collection of this money is predicated upon the fact that people will not quit, not that people will quit. You can't get these kinds of numbers, $755 billion, from people who quit. You are going to get this amount of money because you know people won't quit and can't quit, and the reason by those who come forward with this tax is, it is necessary, they say, because this is addictive. 
They say people can't quit. That is what is wrong with tobacco. And yet they say that people will choose to pay this because they choose to continue to smoke. Whether they choose to or not, someone who earns $10,000 a year, already spending a couple hundred, maybe $1,000 of that $10,000 on cigarettes, now has to pay the Government of the United States an additional $803 annually. Frankly, my amendment would prevent that from happening. 
As currently drafted, this legislation allows tobacco companies to deduct the mandatory payments ultimately paid by consumers as a regular business expense. So what we have here is really an implied subsidy of the tobacco industry, tobacco companies being able to pass through costs to the consumer which the tobacco company then gets to deduct. 
Again, we find ourselves, here in this setting, subsidizing tobacco companies, megatobacco companies, the cash cows of American industry, we are subsidizing these companies by placing on ordinary human beings, working families--we are subsidizing them by placing this $755 billion tax on working families. Over 5 years, that write-off would be worth about $36 billion to the tobacco industry. I cannot imagine anything more inappropriate than to take money from the hard-working families of America and then to use that money which we have taken from the hard-working families of America to provide a $36 billion subsidy through special write-off provisions for the tobacco industry. 
By eliminating the annual payments, my amendment would prevent the tobacco companies from claiming the deduction. I think we should stop the subsidy for tobacco, in particular for tobacco companies, especially providing a subsidy for them by allowing them to deduct payments that are not really going to be made by them--payments that are going to be passed through to consumers, hard-working families with children to feed and clothe, families with payments to make, families of individuals who might want to quit smoking but cannot. This bill is predicated upon the fact that these families will continue. 
This massive Government bureaucracy that is planned and the massive amounts of spending that are projected are all based on this willingness expressed in this bill to tax ordinary working families--ordinary working families--massive amounts. And 59.4 percent of the money will be paid by families under $30,000; 3.7 percent by families making $115,000 or more. This is the most regressive graph of taxation that I have seen since I have had the opportunity to serve in the U.S. Senate. 
Before we consider passing a massive tax increase like this, it would behoove us to review the Government's record thus far with respect to taxes, spending, and Government employment. In Washington, DC, taxes and spending are more addictive than nicotine. 
In the 15 years prior to 1995, Congress passed 13 major tax increases. Let me refer to the chart which has just been set up here. The Crude Oil Windfall Profit Act of 1980; the Omnibus Reconciliation Act of 1980; the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982; the Social Security Amendments of 1983; the Deficit Reduction Act of 1984; the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985; the Omnibus Reconciliation Act of 1986; the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1987; the Technical and Miscellaneous Revenue Act of 1988; the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1989; the Omnibus 
Reconciliation Act of 1990; the Energy Policy Act of 1992; the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993--15 years, 13 major tax increases.

Mr. ASHCROFT. I think it is pretty clear that the amount of money being taken from the American family is going up and up. This year, for example, the average American family had to work until the 10th day of May--we just passed it--for Government. That was the time it took for people to satisfy the obligation to Government. That time has been extending into the year very rapidly through this entire time period. 
It is true that very frequently the Congress gives a little bit here and takes a lot here, so that there are in this time setting different changes in the taxes. But if you want to look over the period of time--and I think it would be a fair thing to do; and I will be happy to do that; and I will bring information about that to the floor--that over time--over time--the Congress of the United States has taken a bigger and bigger and bigger bite of the income of workers in the United States. And, as a matter of fact, this would be another huge bite it would take out of the workers, especially of low-income families.

Mr. ASHCROFT. I thank the Senator from Massachusetts. 
These items, which I have listed here, are times when the taxes were raised on American families and American industry. I think over time most of us understand that we are paying more in taxes now than ever before. As a matter of fact, right now Americans work harder and longer in peace and prosperity than we have worked at any time in history to pay our taxes. 
So whether or not there were a few things in this list where someone was given a tax break while someone else had a tax increase, that may have been the case, but the truth of the matter is, we have been taking two steps backwards at least for every step forward. Government has been taking a bigger and bigger and bigger share. And now Americans work further and further into the year every year in order just to satisfy the appetite of Government rather than to provide for themselves. 
Last year's Taxpayer Relief Act was the first meaningful tax cut since--well, since about 1981. And the tobacco tax increase would more than erase every bit of what we did last year in terms of taking more from the American people. It seems to me that what we need to do is not go back on what we did last year; we need to extend what we did last year. We do not need to increase taxes. Taxes are at an all-time high. 
Tax freedom day, as I mentioned, was May 10 this year. Federal, State, and local taxes claimed 37.6 percent of the income of a median two-income family in 1997. Now, these taxes were more than the couple spent on food, shelter, clothing, and transportation--more than they spent on their cars, their 
houses, their food, and their clothing. 
It seems to me that we ought to be wondering about how we could reduce taxes. During Bill Clinton's first 5 years in office, the Federal Government collected 29 cents in taxes for every dollar increase in the gross domestic product. According to the Joint Economic Committee, `The federal government is now taking a higher share of economic growth than under any president in recent history.' 
The Joint Economic Committee continues: `The average rate during the entire era before President Clinton--from Presidents Eisenhower to Bush--was 19%.' We are now taking 29 cents of each dollar increase in domestic product. 
Obviously, the Federal Government has yet to reject the sentiment expressed by King Henry IV nearly 600 years ago. He put it this way: `You have gold. I want gold. Where is it?' 
Well, I think we have a bill here that says, `You have gold. We want gold. And we don't care how poor you are. We don't care how you're struggling to make ends meet.' As a matter of fact, we will make a very repressive tax, but we want to spend. Tax-and-spend as tax-and-spend--it does not matter which party sponsors it, who does it. Tax-and-spend is the invasion of Government in the province of the lives of individuals, and we have every reason to want to reject it. 
To collect this bounty, the Federal Government has developed a complex system. A recent report by the Heritage Foundation reveals just how complex. 
Mr. President, 136,000 employees at IRS and elsewhere in the Government who are responsible for the tax laws; $13.7 billion is the amount of tax money spent by the IRS and other agencies to enforce and oversee the code; 17,000 is the number of pages of IRS laws and regulations, 12,000 not including Tax Court decisions and IRS letter rulings--12,000. 
And 5.5 million is the number of words in the income tax laws and regulations; 820, the number of pages added to the Tax Code by the 1997 Budget Act; 250 is the number of pages needed to explain just one paragraph in the Internal Revenue Code; 271 is the number of new regulations issued by the IRS in 1997; 261 is the number of pages of regulations needed to clarify the Tax Code's `arms-length standard' for international intercompany transactions, and on and on and on. 
Incidentally, 293,760 is the number of trees it takes each year to supply the 8 billion pages of paper used to file income taxes in the United States. 
Many years ago, Senator Everett Dirksen quipped, `a billion dollars here, a billion dollars there, and pretty soon you're talking about real money.' 
Unfortunately, because of Washington's profligate ways, what was once real money has become little more than a rounding error. The budget resolution passed by the Senate last month recommended the Federal Government spend $9.15 trillion over the next 5 years. That is a 17.3-percent increase from the previous 5 years. 
According to a recent Cato report, the Government's fiscal record is nothing to brag about. Over the past 10 years, the Federal domestic expenditures have soared by 79 percent. After adjusting for inflation, this is an enormous 34-percent increase. Over that same period, family income adjusted for inflation has grown by 9 percent. There is the contrast. There is the problem: a 34-percent increase in Government, Federal domestic expenditures; a 9-percent increase in the income of the average family. 
So today I provide an opportunity for this body, the Senate of the United States, I provide an opportunity for the Senate to say to the American people, `Enough is enough.' Even if you make a bad decision as a free person to smoke, we are not going to decide that we are going to take from you the capacity to spend money and resources on your own family. We are not going to say that the tobacco companies are bad operators and bad companies, and as a result of their problems and their poor conduct, we are going to punish you, the individuals who smoke. 
We are not going to provide that 59.4 percent of all the $755 billion to be collected by individuals trapped in the habit of smoking is to be provided by individuals who make less than $30,000. We are not going to continue to inflict that kind of harm on individuals who are low income and compound the problem. Now Government will come in and sweep from them their capacity to provide for their own families. 
That is not something that we are interested in doing. We are interested instead of saying we don't really agree with this bill, in saying that everything has to be passed on to the consumer, that as a way of punishing tobacco companies we will take money from consumers. We are going to try to make it very difficult. If a guy smokes a couple of packs a day, we are going to make sure that he spends 800 bucks more a year just for the Government, not to be able to address the needs of his family, not to provide for his family, not to provide for himself. But we are going to just say because tobacco companies have done things that are improper, we are going to punish hard-working American citizens. 
My own view is that is a misplaced effort. If we really want to try to make sure that we curtail teen smoking, there are a lot of things we could do. I don't even think this bill makes it illegal for teens to possess tobacco. I don't think it even makes it illegal to possess tobacco in the District of Columbia. This bill doesn't even curtail, in my understanding, doesn't curtail smoking in the Capitol. We criticize Joe Camel, a cartoon character. We criticize a cartoon character for being a role model for young people who want to emulate and smoke. But we don't curtail, I don't believe--and I would be glad to be corrected--I don't think we stop smoking in the U.S. Capitol. In the District of Columbia, we don't make it illegal for teens to possess tobacco. Now, it is virtually uniform around the country that it is illegal to sell tobacco to teens, but there are things we can and ought to do to curtail tobacco use among teens. 
And I leave with this amendment, I leave in the bill the penalties on tobacco companies for failure to meet the targets. I simply, with this amendment, take the penalties against consumers out of the bill. I simply do not provide for the punishment of poor American families, working families. I do not provide for their punishment for what the tobacco companies have done. I think it is inappropriate. 
So I send an amendment to the desk and ask for its immediate consideration.

Mr. ASHCROFT. Thank you, Mr. President. 
I want to begin by thanking Senator Abraham of Michigan for his attention to this very important issue. It seems to me that this is a fundamental issue that relates to the success and survival of this culture in the next century. 
The long-term impact of a Government-imposed shortage of high-tech workers is clear. If workers cannot come to these jobs, then the jobs will have to go to the workers. 
We have an option here, an option of whether or not we bring workers to these jobs and have the industry in the United States or these companies decide to take these jobs to wherever the workers are otherwise. 
Let us not fool ourselves. There are several countries that have the resources to begin a strong technology sector. I believe it would behoove us to make sure that the technology sector continues to exist in the United States of America. 
Some of my colleagues seem to view this bill too narrowly. They view it as an immigration issue and an immigration issue alone. My colleagues are not to be blamed for wanting to make certain that Government policies respect the needs and interests of American workers. This legislation, however, does not threaten American workers in any way. No one is being replaced. 
We are not dealing with a situation in which legal immigrants are coming to the United States to compete with low-income, native-born workers or, worse yet, coming to live off the Federal dole. That is not the situation here. 
The shortage of workers in this industry is well documented. Filling these jobs with skilled workers, whether born here or overseas, is in America's best interests. We have a chance to either import the workers or export the jobs. It seems to me that clearly we would want to bring in these critical workers who can sustain this industry and help us sustain it as an American industry. 
Indeed, it would be a grave mistake, in my judgment, to send even any portion of this dynamic and critical sector abroad in search of workers. It would send the wrong signal. It would be the wrong strategy. The economic and national security benefits of keeping this industry in the United States are substantial. They should not be overlooked. This industry will continue to flourish. But if the U.S. Government needlessly restricts one of the key inputs--that is, the necessary labor for growing--it will flourish somewhere else. We don't need for this industry to flourish on someone else's shores. We want this industry to flourish on our own. 
I understand some of our colleagues will seek to amend the legislation. These amendments have noble sounding purposes and titles, but they are wolves in sheep's clothing. Excluding those that the subcommittee chairman has agreed to accept, these amendments are designed to kill the bill and should be defeated for that reason. Isn't it ironic that some Members are unwilling to help an industry do exactly what we want every industry in this country to do, and that is to become the best in the world. Some people want to keep our industry from attaining that standard. 
We make the same mistake over and over again in Congress. We already are forcing the encryption industry to relocate to foreign shores through antiquated export restrictions, and now Members entertain amendments that will make difficult the United States success in the entire technology sector by restricting the import of needed skilled workers. 
Perhaps the most disturbing amendments are those that would let loose a swarm of Federal bureaucrats into the high-tech industry to investigate hiring practices. Is this the role that we want Government to play in any industry--to create another set of regulatory hurdles that stifle growth and productivity? The energy of this recovery, the energy of our economy, has been provided by the high-tech industry, and it has been able to do so absent Government interference and control. I believe it would be an inappropriate decision, it would be a tremendous insult, and, frankly, an injury to this industry if we were to move Government in massively, as some of these amendments will propose. 
As I have said before, we can allow workers to come to these jobs in America, or we can force those who want these jobs done to take the production facilities and the jobs that go with them someplace else. It seems that would be insanity. It does not take a highly trained computer expert to figure out what we want. We want to keep the jobs here. If we have the jobs here, and we can get the people, then keep the jobs here rather than export the jobs to where the workers may happen to be. 
The technology sector of our country has had tremendous success by almost any measure--in productivity, in capital, in growth and in sales. 
However, this thriving sector is running into a problem that even the best engineers cannot design around--a lack of individuals with the necessary skills to power the growth of American `high-tech' industries. The common approach of Silicon Valley of `Just Fix It' doesn't work in this instance--the engineers cannot overcome design flaws or test for efficiencies because the problem is imposed not by outdated technology but by the outdated laws of the federal government. The high tech sector has come to the federal government to ask for assistance in an area that is in the control of the federal government--the granting of visas to highly skilled technical workers. 
I rise today to applaud an industry that is so dynamic that it has depleted the tremendous human resources available in this country so swiftly. We, as a nation, should take great pride in our technology sector, and even greater pride that this robust sector of our economy continues to thrive. 
One frightening trend that has begun to emerge in this Congress is the consideration of laws that would directly involve the federal government in the operations of the technology sector. Any number of bills introduced with the best of intentions would have ignored budding and dynamic technology and instead imposed a quick legislative fix that would have remained in the code for years. This push for instant gratification and instant solutions will lead to disastrous results in the dynamic area of high technology. Instead, Members of Congress must start making the tough decisions on how to allow our technology sector to continue to be an engine of growth for our economy, continue to provide greater efficiencies for business, guarantee lifestyle enhancements to all people, and continue to position the United States as the world's technology leader. We need to focus less on imposing new government obstacles to tomorrow's technologies and more on removing government as an 
obstacle to growth in this dynamic sector. 
This brings me to Senator Abraham's legislation, the American Competitiveness Act. I am proud to be a cosponsor of this important legislation because it removes a government-imposed limit on the growth of the technology sector. We should all support the Abraham legislation as a means to facilitate the continued growth and success of an industry that is so important to our nation. 
In closing, Mr. President, I must call attention to another troubling aspect of this debate, the glaring omission of leadership from the Clinton Administration. I am frustrated by this Administration's continuing talk of support for the industry of Silicon Valley. As I cast about in search of that support I find precious little. So I just ask--where is the Administration support for this important legislation? Where is the support for a well thought-out encryption policy, for the elimination of arbitrarily imposed taxation of the Internet--which currently remains international in scope but subject to tax by any municipality, or for leadership in confronting what may be the most dangerous threat to our economy, The Year 2000 bug? Mr. President, where was the Administration just two weeks ago when we were fighting to take a truly damaging provision on digital signatures out of the IRS bill? 
I urge the Administration live up to its words and help us create jobs and growth in the technology sector. It is time for the Administration to stop talking the talk and begin walking the walk. 
I urge my colleagues to support this legislation. I commend the subcommittee chairman, Senator Abraham, for his outstanding work in this respect. It is not merely an immigration bill; this is a bill that relates to the success of the high-tech industry, an industry in which America continues to be the No. 1 power. 
What is the situation regarding time?

Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, families are the cornerstone of America. The data are undeniable: Individuals from strong families contribute to the society. In an era when nearly half of all couples married today will see their union dissolve into divorce, I believe it is both instructive and important to honor those who have taken the commitment of `till death us do part' seriously, demonstrating successfully the timeless principles of love, honor, and fidelity. These characteristics make our country strong. 
For these important reasons, I rise today to honor Margaret and Tom Floyd of Charleston, Illinois, who on June 12, 1998, will celebrate their 50th wedding anniversary. My wife, Janet, and I look forward to the day we can celebrate a similar milestone. The Floyds' commitment to the principles and values of their marriage deserves to be saluted and recognized.

Mr. ASHCROFT. I rise in opposition to the massive tax increases that are contained in the so-called tobacco settlement. I want the Senate to know that I will fight to kill any tobacco bill that contains a tax increase of the magnitude being considered, $868 billion. 
The proposed tobacco bill is nothing more than an excuse for Washington to raise taxes and spend more money on Federal programs. It a shame that bad decisions made by free people in Washington, DC, become the basis for a monumental task. The decision to smoke isn't a good decision, but it is something that people are free to do. And we are using it as the basis for an incredible and substantial tax. 
Let me just say that this tobacco settlement is the largest proposed increase in Government and bureaucracy since the proposed health care scheme, which both this Senate and the American people had the good judgment to reject. 
It would be a travesty for Congress to use tobacco as a smokescreen for imposing this massive tax increase on the people of America and to cover an expansion of the `nanny' state. 
This massive tax increase would be levied against those who are least capable of paying for it. According to the Congressional Research Service, `Tobacco taxes * * * are perhaps the most regressive tax levied.' 
Here we have a tax that falls most heavily on poor people. About 60 percent of this tax would fall on families earning $30,000 or less. Let me go to this chart. People earning under $30,000 would pay 59.4 percent of this tax; people paying $115,000 or more, 3.7 percent of this tax. This is nothing more or less than a massive tax increase, the incidence of which falls most heavily on poor families earning $30,000 or less. I think many times these are young families--mom and dad, maybe a couple of kids--stretching to make ends meet on $30,000 or less, and the lion's share, the overwhelming lion's share, is coming out of the pockets of individuals making less than $30,000 a year. 
According to the Congressional Research Service, households earning less than $10,000 would feel the bite of the tax most of all. Smokers making less than $10,000 would pay in excess of 5 percent of their income in additional taxes. This is a massive tax increase on the poor. If Washington gets its way, cigarette excise taxes will rise by $1.50 a pack. For someone who smokes two packs a day and whose spouse perhaps smokes one pack as well, this amounts to a tax increase of $1,642.50 annually. And that tax increase for three packs a day on the family would be the same, whether the family was very poor or the family was very wealthy. To find out the magnitude of this tax, if you take $1,642 a year out of the income of poor Americans, you are really impairing significantly their ability to provide for their families. 
It is immoral for this Government to tell poor families, you cannot provide for yourselves; we are going to take the money from you and force you to come to the Government to ask us to provide for you. Moreover, the new taxes paid by someone smoking two packs daily would exceed the per capita tax relief contained in the Senate budget resolution by a factor of 50. 
The Senate budget resolution proposed tax relief for America. For the average smoker, smoking two packs a day, they would have a tax burden added to them 50 times as great as the tax relief that we proposed in the budget. I think that is unconscionable. It is obvious that the most addictive thing in Washington is not nicotine, the most addictive thing is taxing and spending. 
In the 15 years prior to 1995, Congress has passed 13 major tax increases. A list of those tax increases includes the Crude Oil Windfall Profit Tax of 1980, the Omnibus Reconciliation Act of 1980, Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982, Social Security Amendments of 1983. Last year's Taxpayer Relief Act was the first meaningful tax cut since 1981. 
The tobacco tax increase will more than erase--more than erase--all of the benefit to the American people of the tax cut passed last year. The tobacco tax increase also exceeds by a factor of 3 the relief projected in the budget resolution passed by the Senate last month, even as it applies to the entire population, not just to smokers. 
The Congressional Budget Office expects the budget surplus will swell to between $43 billion and $63 billion this year. Why is that? Taxpayers are working longer, they are working harder, they are paying more taxes. You don't have the swelling of revenue to the Federal Government because people aren't paying taxes; you have it precisely because they are paying taxes. Taxes are going up. And we should be debating how to return money to the taxpayers, 
not how to siphon more out of their pockets--especially out of hard-working Americans at lower-income levels. The proposed tobacco bill is nothing more than an excuse for Washington to raise taxes and spend more money on new Federal programs. I will fight to kill any tobacco tax bill that contains a tax increase of the magnitude being considered. It is an affront to the dignity of Americans and it is immoral to take this kind of money away from poor families, which will force them into dependence on government in some circumstances, rather than allow them to have the money they earn to spend on their families. 
To paraphrase President Reagan, the whole controversy comes down to this: Are you entitled to the fruits of your own labor, or does Government have some presumptive right to tax and tax and tax? 
I urge my colleagues to oppose this legislation. 
Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I rise today to have the opportunity of commenting on a matter which is a matter of great discussion in Washington and around the country. It is the so-called tobacco settlement. I say `so-called' because I think this is more about taxes than it is about tobacco. It is more about big government than it is about teen smoking. This is a measure of the magnitude of which obscures most of the things we have considered for a long time, at least those things considered in my time in the U.S. Senate. 
Now, Washington may be entering a new era of surplus politics, but its inhabitants have yet to reject the sentiment that was expressed by King Henry IV nearly 600 years ago. He put it this way: You have gold and I want gold. Where is it? Well, that may be something that really describes America right now because this measure which is flying under the flag of the tobacco settlement is really a massive tax increase on the people of this great country. 
This tax increase would total about $860-some billion--that is the original bill before it went to the Finance Committee. I don't know whether the increase from $1.10 to $1.50 a pack added in the Finance Committee is even reflected in those figures. We are talking about an $800 billion increase in taxes and it will be focused on people who make less than $30,000 a year. These are hard-working families, generally families with small children, at the beginning of their earning potential in life. To focus $860 billion in new taxes on those individuals is a very serious question. 
As a matter of fact, that kind of serious question of $860 billion in new taxes and then about 17 new boards, agencies, commissions, et cetera, in government to spend the money is so obvious a question that I objected to moving to this bill very expeditiously, very rapidly. It looked to me like there was going to be a rush to try and get into this bill, and we would somehow be asked to have consideration of this bill which was not thorough and did not have the kind of complete debate and dialog which I think the Senate of the United States ought to have, and which I think we were created to have. 
The founders of this great country said that the Senate of the United States was like the saucer; the cup was the House, and it was supposed to be a place where there were hot passions and emotions, but you spill things over into the saucer. It is a place where things cool. You should have the time to look at things carefully in the U.S. Senate. You should have the capacity to thoroughly discuss things. There should be open discussion. We have had a policy and a heritage in this great body of making sure that all the anticipatable consequences and results and affects of a particular proposed policy could be understood and debated and discussed here. 
If I have the assurance that that is the strategy which we will pursue, that it will be a Senate strategy of complete discussion, that we will not unduly or inappropriately limit the kinds of amendments which are offered, that we are going to have an open discussion, that we are not going to rush in and impose cloture to stampede the Senate to a conclusion in what is a pretty highly charged and emotional area, then I have no objection to proceeding. I wouldn't object to proceeding to this bill unless I thought it was going to be something that was a must-do project and 
that the definition of `discussion' would be someone's time objective rather than a quality objective. The ultimate objective that we should have when we are discussing things in the U.S. Senate should be the quality of our output, not whether or not we want to get home for a vacation or take a break. 
My own view is that I really do not want to stand in the way of this particular measure being considered, but I don't want anything to stand in the way of this measure being considered thoroughly, and that there be a full opportunity to provide debate, and that there be the potential for amendment which is thorough, which would provide the opportunity for alternatives so if we want to reach our real objective of somehow curtailing the adverse impacts of cigarettes on the young people of America, we wouldn't be locked in to some narrow set of agreements or agencies or taxes, but that we would think carefully about how it is done. 
I simply want to say and make clear my position that while I did oppose a unanimous consent to move to this bill, I am not locked into a position of saying we should not consider tobacco. If I believed that we have an opportunity to consider the so-called tobacco settlement fully and thoroughly and fairly in the great tradition of the Senate, then I am more than willing to proceed to consideration of this matter. 
As a matter of fact, I would like to begin the discussion of the matter today talking about some of the things that I think are most difficult about this bill, and perhaps I think ought best be characterized as unwise. The Federal budget surplus is likely to exceed $45 billion this year, and you wonder why Congress would be considering massive new taxes if we are finally in a place of surplus. You would think we should be debating how to give money back to the American people instead of taking more money from the American people. 
When our decision is to take money from the American people, our decision is basically that they can't spend it as wisely on their families as we can spend it on their families. After all, the families of America are what we are spending our resources on one way or the other. If we believe we are so much smarter than they are for meeting the needs of their family, we should take the money from them and spend it. But if we have a good awareness that American families know what they need and how to spend their money better than we can spend it on them, we ought to let American families have their resources to spend on themselves. 
There are some things that have to be done collectively. We know about those things--certain law enforcement functions, national defense, certain government programs--but the never-ending explosion of taking the resources from families, suggesting that we have better things to do with that money than families do, is a presumption in which I will not imagine and I certainly will not persist. 
I intend to fight to kill any tobacco bill that contains a tax increase of the magnitude being considered. 
When you are talking about over $800 billion for smokers, for example, the tax that will be imposed against them and on them as a result of this bill will be 50 times greater--50 times greater--than the tax relief we gave them last year. I am not a person who has chosen to smoke, and I am not a person who is associated with the tobacco industry. I don't know of a single smoker in my family. It hasn't been in my family. It wasn't in my father's family. We were taught that tobacco was evil from day one. Speaking of old-time English kings, King James warned citizens of England hundreds of years ago that tobacco was bad for their health. I think people have known it. I don't think it is sneaking up on anybody. I think most Americans know that tobacco is not good for you. If you are close to someone who is smoking and you start choking, I think you understand that this stuff is not good for you. We know the pollutants contained in the byproducts of combustion, smoke, are bad even if you are just walking down a city street and get too many diesel fumes from a bus. So it is not a matter of not knowing. 
The question is, Are we going to have a tobacco bill that taxes the American people at an incredibly high level--$860 billion-plus in new taxes--and that says to a fellow who chooses to smoke, in spite of what he knows, that, well, the kind of tax that you are going to pay is 50 times greater than any relief we have given you previously? This is a massive tax increase that will be inflicted on those who are least able to pay. Some estimates suggest that this tobacco bill would increase taxes by over $860 billion. This development of 17 new responsibilities in Government--for boards, commissions, or agencies, or, I suppose--and I hear there is a proposal now to take the formal boards, commissions, agencies out and allow them to be created not in the statute but by department heads on their own later on, so we would sort of fly the commissions, boards, and agencies below the radar screen of the American people. 
The truth is, if you are going to spend $860 billion, you are going to have bureaucrats do it. Over 5 years, the hike would increase taxes $109 billion, more than erasing the entire effect of the measure of the tax relief we provided last year. Of course, I will mention that 60 percent of those who would be paying these taxes earn less than $30,000 a year. That really means these are, in many cases, young couples, couples with children. They are going to be bearing the burden of this tax increase. The Finance Committee came up with the idea that these taxes be increased by $1.50 a pack for cigarettes. Now, if you have a young family with a mother who smokes one pack a day and the father smokes two, that is $4.50 a day that the Government would be taking from that family. Over the course of a month, I think that is $140 a month, and 12 times 14, if my math serves me correctly, would be close to $1,600 a year. Now, that is serious. That is very serious. In my judgment, we have to think carefully about that kind of tax increase. 
Mr. President, maybe you will do the math for me. I was doing that math in my head, so it may not be $1,600; it may be more than $1,600. I think it would be. 
But the point is, this is a massive tax increase on people. What about the children in those families? The whole presumption of this idea that we can collect the $868 billion is that people are so addicted, they can't stop, so we will tax them. In spite of the fact that taxes are going up, there is going to be persistent use. On one hand, they say these taxes are going to keep people from smoking. On the other hand, they put a lot of money in the budget saying people won't be able to stop smoking and therefore we will get the money. It seems to me there is a little tension between these two arguments. It is a massive tax increase. It seems to me the only thing more addictive than nicotine is taxing and spending in the Congress. 
People are going to say this is about teenage smoking, but this bill doesn't even make teenage smoking illegal in Washington, DC. This doesn't make teenage smoking illegal or unlawful in the 
Capitol or in the Senate office buildings. We are talking about what kind of messages we want to send to our teenagers. This Congress, the U.S. Senate, has never cared enough about the role modeling it does to forbid smoking in the in the U.S. Capitol or in the Senate office buildings. We are up here saying we are going to try and stop teenagers from smoking, and we stand around--I don't--and we don't stop smoking, we don't curtail smoking. We provide incentives. We make sure there are plenty of ashtrays. If you want to use the stairs in our buildings, that is where they put the ashtrays. If you need to draw a deep breath after four or five flights of stairs, you can be sure that because of our policy we will have a role model there smoking for you. 
If we are really serious about teen smoking, there are other things to do other than raising taxes by $868 billion. If Washington gets its way, excise taxes will increase by $1.50 a pack. Now, my view is that this is not the kind of tax increase I was sent here to be involved in--an $868 billion increase on the taxes of the working people in this country. This is not what Republicans were sent here to do. 
Lots of Republicans are fond of talking about Ronald Reagan. Well, people who make less than $30,000 a year frequently--some of them are Republicans, but some are what we call Reagan Democrats. Ronald Reagan was understood by those people to care for them, and he was understood by those people to be sensitive to their plight. They were called Reagan Democrats because of it. This is a tax increase that is aimed right at Reagan Democrats. It will take the money and resources right out of their pockets, send it to Washington, keep them from being able to spend it on their own families. 
Taxes are at an all-time high. Never before in the history of this country have taxes been so high. Just last week, on May 10, was tax freedom day this year. That means the average citizen had to work until May 10 in order to pay their taxes. The rest of the year, he or she can work for his or her family. What a deal. And we are going to add $868 billion to that burden? Pretty soon, we will be working more for the Government than for our families. If we think Government ought to be a bigger influence in this culture than families, I think we are sadly mistaken. Whether we succeed or fail in the next century is dependent on good, strong families. If moms and dads and families do their job, governing America will be easy. But if moms and dads and families can't do their job, governing America will be impossible. We cannot make it impossible for families to do the job that families ought to do in this country. 
Total taxes as a share of total income have reached an all-time high in the United States of America. When I was born, in 1942, taxes as a share of the total income amounted to 21.1 percent. That was during the war--the big war, WW-II. Yet, that was 21.1 percent as a total share of income. We are approaching twice that much now. We are over 35 percent as a total share of income. It is time for us to come to the conclusion that if families are important in this country, leaving them with some of the money they earn is important, and an $860 billion-plus tax increase would be inappropriate. 
Today, the median two-income family can expect to pay 37.5 percent of its income in Federal, State, and local taxes--37.5 percent. Three-eighths--3 out of every 8 days are devoted to paying the Government. It is getting worse. Taxpayers are working longer, harder than ever before to pay their taxes. It is time for us to think carefully about providing relief, rather than a massive increase in taxes. 
The proposed tobacco bill is nothing more than an excuse for Washington to raise taxes and spend more money on new Federal programs. I will fight to kill any tobacco tax bill that contains a tax increase of the magnitude being considered. I didn't come here, and I don't think we were sent here, to have a massive raid on the families of America and their ability to provide for the needs of their families. What we are talking about is a cut in pay for Americans. We cut their pay by taking it when they earn it. I just do not think a pay cut for American families is what is needed at this moment. I think this country knows that if there is a cut anywhere, it should be a cut in Government, not a cut in families. I think we have to understand that is what we are talking about. So I urge my colleagues to oppose this legislation, which is a massive tax increase. 
It is a tax burden focused on those making less than $30,000 a year. The vast majority of the taxpayers who will pay the $860-plus billion will be people making less than $30,000 a year. I think of the kids of those moms and dads, who are both working and blue-collar folks, that they want to be able to do well by and do well for. We plan to tax them with the most, the lion's share of the burden of an $868 billion tax increase. 
I reiterate again my position. I rose to object to moving to this bill when I thought we might be moving to it in haste; and that our consideration of the bill might be limited and compressed and inappropriately telescoped. It might be drawn together in such a way that we wouldn't have a thorough opportunity to debate this. It could be that I am wrong. With proper assurance that we would have the kind of full range of Senate debate, with the complete opportunity for amendment and that we will not be clotured so as to preclude the kind of debate that is necessary and appropriate in this respect, I don't mind moving forward to this issue. As a matter of fact, I wouldn't object to moving forward to the issue. We must, however, consider this issue based on its merits and not based on a schedule or convenience. This is too important an issue and too substantial a set of stakes for us to ignore the kind of full debate that the Senate rightfully should provide. 
It is with that in mind that I rise to oppose this measure and to indicate my position on considering the measure. I hope when we have the opportunity to debate this measure fully, we will be able to see that a tax increase of that magnitude is not in the best interest of the American people. It is not in the best interest of the future of America. It is not a measure that really augurs well for the children of America. It is really a big government extension of the heavy hand of government in the pocketbooks of American families. 
Thank you, Mr. President, for this opportunity. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. ASHCROFT. Thank you, Mr. President. 
I am grateful for the kind remarks of the Senator from Utah and am pleased to have the opportunity to work with him and the Senator from Vermont. 
I rise today to speak in favor of one of the most important pieces of technology legislation in the 105th Congress. At its heart, this legislation is about updating the copyright laws for the digital age and preparing a sizable portion of our economy for the next century. 
The affected parties include the online service providers, computer hardware and software manufacturers; every educator in America is affected by this legislation; every student; all the libraries; all the consumer electronics manufacturers and consumers of electronics; the motion picture companies, and everyone who uses the Internet. This measure will have as broad an impact on the American public as virtually any measure we will address. 
The full Senate's consideration of this bill culminates an effort of updating our copyright law that I began last September when I introduced S. 1146, the Digital Copyright Clarification and Technology Education Act. S. 1146 was a comprehensive bill designed to jump-start a process that had ground to a halt and appeared to be going nowhere. 
The bill addresses three basic problems. First, the liability of online service providers for copyright violations; second, the need to update the provisions of the copyright law that affect educators and libraries for the digital age; and third--and not least, of course--the need to implement the World Intellectual Property Organization, or WIPO, treaties. 
The United States of America, as the generator of so much content and material--the innovator, the creator of so much of what is copywritten--stands to gain most by making sure that our copyrights are respected worldwide. 
I am gratified that today the full Senate will vote on this bill that addresses all three of these concerns, especially the concerns regarding the need to implement the World Intellectual Property Organization treaties which will provide that the United States effort to protect copyrights--the intellectual property of those who are the creators in this country and develop things in this country--those treaties will protect those copyrights. 
The original administration language that was introduced by Senators Hatch and Leahy focused exclusively on the WIPO treaties. However, through hard work, numerous amendments and the assistance of Senators Hatch and Leahy and their staffs--and this was really a cooperative effort--we were able to fashion a comprehensive approach to updating the copyright laws for the digital age. 
Many important changes were made to the bill, including amendments reinforcing on-line privacy rights, ensuring that the bill would not be read to mandate design decisions and addressing the need to update the copyright laws to permit distance education using digital technology. 
When I was a professor--I won't want to admit how long ago--I used to teach a television course. The very same procedures I used in analog technology for television transmission might well have been illegal if the TV signal had been transmitted digitally. It is important that we give the capacity for distance education in the digital age the same potential that we had for distance education in the analog age. 
I will focus on three important changes, one reflecting each of the three basic problems addressed by the original bill. 
First, there is the issue of the liability of on-line service providers. The notion that service providers should not bear the responsibility for copyright infringements when they are solely transmitting the material is one key to the future growth of the Internet. Now, what we are really talking about is if someone illegally transmits material on the Internet, the Internet companies that provide the opportunity for people to transmit the material shouldn't be held responsible any more than the phone company should be held responsible if you were to say something illegal over the phone, or that Xerox should be held responsible if you violate a copyright by illegally copying material on the Xerox machine. 
This is very important because of the way the Internet operates in terms of assembling and reassembling digital messages that they not be considered to be an illegal publisher; they, therefore, needed the protections that are provided in this bill so that we can have and continue to use the infrastructure of the Internet and allow it to operate effectively. 
Proper resolution of this issue is critical to unlock the potential for the Internet. For that reason, I included a title addressing on-line service provider liability in my legislation. Make no mistake about it, clarification of on-line service provider liability was one of my fundamental concerns in the debate, and after months of negotiations the affected parties were able to agree to legislative language that protects on-line service providers, or what we call the OSPs, from liability when they simply transmit--they are not involved, they don't have any interest in the message, but they are just transmitters. If there is a violation, it is not their fault that something was transmitted in contravention of the copyright law. 
Although I applauded the efforts of the affected industries to resolve the OSP liability issue, there was one issue which the industry agreement did not address--the protections that need to be given to users of the Internet. The agreement that the OSPs entered into would have protected the interests of the copyright owners, but it provided little or no protection for an Internet user who was wrongfully accused of violating copyright laws. 
I think of a little girl, perhaps, who puts on her Internet site the picture of a duck she draws. We shouldn't allow Disney to say, `We own Donald Duck. That looks too much like Donald,' and be able to bully a little girl from having a duck on her web site. We needed protection for the small user, not just for the big content promoters. 
Even though several Judiciary Committee members claimed no amendments were needed, I made sure that the industry compromise respected the rights of typical Internet users, ordinary people, by offering an amendment that provided a protection included in the original bill I had offered. It is an idea which is referred to as 
the `notice and put-back' provision. If material is wrongfully taken down from the Internet user's home page, my amendment ensures that the end user will be given notice of the action taken and gives them a right to initiate a process that allows them to put their material back on line without the need to hire a lawyer or go to court. This was a critical improvement over the industry's prior compromise agreement. 
A second concern of mine throughout this process has been the need to update protections for educators and libraries already included in the copyright law to reflect the digital technology. I have already mentioned that. Having been an individual who had the privilege of teaching a college course on television I knew just how important it would be for libraries and educational institutions to be able to use digital transmissions of documents and signals in the same way that they were authorized to do so with analog signals under our copyright law as it has existed. 
I did offer an amendment in committee, and it was unanimously incorporated into the bill, which will allow libraries to use digital technology for archiving and for interlibrary loans, for example. This will help libraries serve the American public. 
A final issue of profound importance, ensuring that the bill did not inadvertently make it a violation of the Federal law to be a good parent. The original bill or draft of this bill took such a broad approach to outlawing any devices that could be used to gain access to a copyrighted work that it may have made it illegal to manufacture and use devices that were designed to protect children from obscenities and pornography. An amendment I offered in committee makes it clear that a parent may protect his children from pornography without running afoul of this law. I think moms and dads will want to be able to protect their children and shouldn't have to risk running afoul of the law to do so. My own belief is that when moms and dads do their jobs, governing America will be easy. If moms and dads don't do their jobs, governing this country could be impossible. We need to make it possible for parents in every instance to do their job. 
The amendment recognizes that devices designed to allow such parental monitoring must be allowed. We should never allow any legislation to move forward that intentionally or unintentionally makes good parenting illegal. When the choice is between protecting our children from obscene material and perhaps allowing one machine to be diverted for unlawful use, Congress and the court should choose the protection of the children every time and then prosecute anyone who makes unlawful use of such machine. 
There are a number of individuals who deserve our specific thanks here, and I want to take the time to make sure that deserving individuals and organizations are thanked. I want to take a moment to thank a few particular staff members who labored into the night over and over again and through weekends to put together this legislation. I commend my colleagues Senators Hatch and Leahy. I want to say that a number of my concerns were accommodated because these members of the Leahy and Hatch staff were so hard-working. Ed Damich and Troy Dow with Senator Hatch were critical to moving forward on all issues, particularly by coordinating the OSP discussions. 
Beryl Howell and Marla Grossman of Senator Leahy's staff were similarly important to the process, particularly in regard to the education provisions and on drafting language for several key areas. I thank the staff. They worked very closely with two of the best staff members that I think work in any arena on Capitol Hill, and that is Bartlett Cleland of my staff and Paul Clement. They worked extremely hard with industry and with other Members of the Senate to craft a piece of legislation which I believe is going to be a tremendous asset in allowing the potential of the Internet to be realized. 
Finally, I want to thank all of the individuals representing various industry and education interests who were critical not only in educating me on the myriad of technical issues addressed in this legislation, but were helping in every way to reach agreement when the time came. In the end, this is perhaps not a perfect bill. I would have favored a different approach to some issues. But this is a bill that has become a comprehensive effort to bring the copyright law into the digital age. It is an important piece of legislation which we can work together to make work for America. 
Accordingly, I am happy to support this bill. I look forward to its final passage, with appreciation to the outstanding leadership of Senator Hatch and Senator Leahy in the committee. Working with them has been one of the most gratifying experiences of a process of reaching a conclusion on legislation which I think will advance our opportunity significantly to access the advantages of electronic and digital communication for the entirety of America. 
Mr. President, I want to go over some of these notions again and expand the ideas a bit further. 
I rise today to speak in favor of one of the most important pieces of technology legislation in the 105th congress. At its heart, this legislation is about updating the copyright laws for the digital age and preparing a sizable portion of our economy for the next century. The affected parties include the on-line service providers, computer hardware and software manufacturers, educators students, libraries, consumer electronics manufacturers and consumers, motion picture companies, and everyone who uses the Internet. The full Senate's consideration of this bill culminates an effort at updating our copyright law that I began last September when I introduced S. 1146, the Digital Copyright Clarification and Technology Education Act. S. 1146 was a comprehensive bill designed to jump start a process that had ground to a halt and appeared to be going nowhere. The bill addressed three basic problems: (1) the liability of on-line service providers for copyright violations, (2) the need to update the provisions of the copyright law that affect educators and libraries for the digital age, and (3) the need to implement the World Intellectual Property Organization, or WIPO, treaties. I am gratified that today the full Senate will vote on a bill that addresses all three of these concerns. 
The original Administration language that was introduced by Senators Hatch and Leahy focused exclusively on the WIPO Treaties. However, through hard work, numerous amendments, and the assistance of Senators Hatch and Leahy and their staffs, we were able to fashion a comprehensive approach to updating the copyright laws for the digital age. 
The bill before the Senate today now addresses all three of the basic problems identified in my bill. First, the notion that service providers should not bear the responsibility for copyright infringements when they are providing a means of communication is a key notion for the future growth and development of digital communications and most importantly the Internet. Resolution of this issue is critical for the future development of the Internet. For that reason, I included a title regarding on-line service provider liability in my legislation. After months of negotiations, the affected parties were able to agree to legislative language that protects on-line service providers, or OSPs, from liability when they simply transmit information along the Internet. 
The principles expressed in this legislation will provide a clear path for OSPs to operate without concern for legal ramifications or copyright infringement that may occur in the regular course of the operation of the Internet, or that occur without the OSPs knowledge. Without these issues being clearly delineated we would have faced a future of uncertainty regarding the growth of Internet and potentially whether it could have operated at all. Make no mistake that the clarification of on-line service provider liability was one of my fundamental concerns in this debate. While this was not the only crucial change in the legislation it is a change that I found essential for this legislation to even be considered, which is why Title I of my original legislation was devoted to clearly defining liability. 
Although I was supportive of the affected industries' efforts to resolve the OSP liability issues, there was one issue which the industry agreement did not address--what protections would be given the typical users of the Internet. The agreement protected the interests of OSPs, and it protected the interests of copyright owners, but it provided little or no protection for an Internet user wrongfully accused of violating the copyright laws. 
The original draft would have left these wrongly injured, innocent users with limited recourse. They would have to hire an attorney and go to court to have the court require the OSP and copyright holder to allow the web page to go back up--in other words the end user would have to go to court to prove their innocence. I found this situation to be totally unacceptable. Even though several Judiciary Committee members claimed that no amendments were needed I made sure that the industry compromise protected the rights of the typical Internet user by offering an amendment that provided protection included my original bill--an idea referred to as notice and put back. If material is wrongly taken down from an Internet user's home page because the original notice mistakenly did not take into account that the Internet user was only making a fair use of the copyrighted work, my amendment ensures that the end-user will be given notice of the action taken, and gives them a right to initiate a process that allows them to put their material back on-line, without the need to hire a lawyer and go to court. This was a critical improvement over the industry's compromise agreement. 
Another modification to the OSP liability material was to guarantee that companies, such as Yahoo!, could continue to operate as they have previous to the passage of this legislation. I admire companies that can succeed in the highly competitive technology sector, and Yahoo! has done just that. In no way should Congress discourage true entrepreneurship, particularly when the better `mouse trap' in this case has propelled a company to the top of its market. The safe harbor should not dissipate merely because a service provider viewed a particular online location during the course of categorization for a directory. If the rule were otherwise, true consumer oriented products would be eliminated or discouraged in the marketplace. 
Finally, I also insisted on language in the Committee role that recognized that the OSP liability provisions must be applied to educators and libraries with sensitivity to the special nature of those institutions and the unique relationships that exist in those settings. The report also makes it clear that the notice and put-back provision I mentioned above provides all the process that is due, so that state institutions need not worry about having to choose between qualifying for the safe harbors provided in the bill and the requirements imposed by the Due Process Clause. 
The second title of my original legislation was dedicated to similar concerns of universities, libraries, schools, educators and students, and ensured that these groups 
would not be left out when the content providers rushed to secure their position in the digital age. This legislation now includes some of the same provisions. I worked closely with Senator Leahy, educators, libraries and publishers to guarantee that libraries will be able to update their archives and provide materials to the public in a way that keeps pace with technology. 
Additionally, this legislation begins the process to allow distance education in the digital world. We should not tolerate laws that discriminate against technology, instead we should seek to guarantee that what people can do in the analog that they can continue those actions in the digital world. A study will be undertaken to help Congress to sort out the many technological and legal challenges of updating the copyright law regarding distance education. At the beginning of the next Congress I fully expect to introduce legislation specifically on distance education and I understand that both Senators Hatch and Leahy have agreed to support legislation based on the study conducted by the Copyright Office. In addition, I look forward to working with both the education community and the content community to pass, not block, this important legislation. Distance education is of fundamental importance to Missouri, as it is to most rural states, and of great importance to the many parents who home school their children. 
A third portion of the bill addresses the means by which the WIPO treaties will be implemented in the United States, also referred to as section 1201. This issue is of fundamental importance for a vital part of our nations economy. Piracy is a large and growing problem for many content providers, but particularly to our software industry. Billions of dollars in pirated material is lost every year and in impact is felt directly to our national bottom line. 
While the overall structure of the legislation in this part is not the way I would have approached the issue I believe that I have been given enough assurance both in legislative language and in legislative history that I can support the bill. I still find troubling any approach that makes technology the focus of illegality rather than the bad conduct of a bad actor, but with the accommodations that have been given I think that the bill is workable. 
One issue of profound importance to me was ensuring that parents continue to have the legal ability to be good parents. The original draft of this bill took such a broad approach to outlawing devices, that it may have inadvertently made it illegal to manufacture and use devices designed to protect children from on-line pornography. The bill, as amended recognizes that certain devices--such as devices that allow parents to protect their children from on-line pornography--must be allowed. An amendment I offered in Committee makes clear that a parent may protect their children from pornography without running afoul of this law. We should never be in the position with any legislation that intentionally or unintentionally makes good parenting illegal. When the choice is between protecting our children from obscene material and perhaps allowing one machine to be diverted for unlawful use, Congress and the courts should choose the protection of children every time. 
Additionally, the protection of privacy remains a concern. While the legislation makes some effort to make clear that a person acting to protect their individual privacy should not be liable for or guilty of circumvention some further clarification is needed. One of my primary concerns has been the use of `cookies' and their detrimental impact for on-line privacy. I am not convinced that cookies could not be copyrighted and protected in such a way that getting rid of them or turning them off would not violate the new law. Recently my concern has been proven further by a piece of software developed by Blizzard Entertainment called StarCraft. This software rifles through the player's hard drives and sends the information found back to the company. Again, I was told by some that I should not be concerned, but I will tell you that I am concerned and everyone in this body and in the country should have similar concerns about this or any legislation that without careful thought could create a situation where an individual's privacy is jeopardized. I believe the savings clause I added to the bill will address this problem. However, if that does not prove sufficient, I will introduce legislation to deal with this problem directly and will look forward to working with all the parties that support this bill to ensure passage of such legislation. 
One industry that has concerns about this legislation is the encryption industry. I sought to have included in the legislative language a provision to guarantee that the highly successful means for encryption research that are used in this country may continue to be used in the future, despite some of the prohibitions included in this bill. Unfortunately, we were not able to work out any acceptable legislative language. We were able to craft language for the report that made clear that most forms of current encryption research were left undisturbed by the bill. While I believe that this is better than nothing, I understand that there are lingering concerns, and I would certainly support efforts to try to address this issue before the House completes work on this important piece of legislation. 
In discussing the anti-circumvention portion of the legislation, I think it is worth emphasizing that I could agree to support the bill's approach of outlawing certain devices because I was repeatedly assured that the device prohibitions in 1201(a)(2) and 1201(b) are aimed at so-called `black boxes' and not at legitimate consumer electronics and computer products that have substantial non-infringing uses. I specifically worked for and achieved changes to the bill to make sure that no court would misinterpret this bill as outlawing legitimate consumer electronics devices or computer hardware. As a result, neither section 1201(a)(2) nor section 1201(b) should be read as outlawing any device with substantial non-infringing uses, as per the tests provided in those sections. 
If history is a guide, however, someone may yet try to use this bill as a basis for initiating litigation to stop legitimate new products from coming to market. By proposing the addition of section 1201(d)(2) and (3), I have sought to make clear that any such effort to use the courts to block the introduction of new technology should be bound to fail. 
As my colleagues may recall, this wouldn't be the first time someone has tried to stop the advance of new technology. In the mid 1970s, for example, a lawsuit was filed in an effort to block the introduction of the Betamax video recorder. I think it useful to recall 
what the Supreme Court had to say in ruling for consumers and against two movie studies in that case:  
One may search the Copyright Act in vain for any sign that the elected representatives of the millions of people who watch television every day have made it unlawful to copy a program for later viewing at home, or have enacted a flat prohibition against the sale of machines that make such copying possible. 
As Missouri's Attorney General, I had the privilege to file a brief in the Supreme Court in support of the right of consumers to buy that first generation of VCRs. I want to make it clear that I did not come to Washington to vote for a bill that could be used to ban the next generation of recording equipment. I want to reassure consumers that nothing in the bill should be read to make it unlawful to produce and use the next generation of computers or VCRs or whatever future device will render one or the other of these familiar devices obsolete. 
Another important amendment was added that makes clear that this law does not mandate any particular selection of components for the design of any technology. I was concerned that this legislation could be interpreted as a mandate on product manufacturers to design products so as to respond affirmatively to effective technical protection measures available in the marketplace. In response to this concern I was pleased to offer an amendment, with the support of both the Chairman and the Ranking Member of the Committee, to avoid the unintended effect of having design requirements imposed on product and component manufacturers, which would have a dampening effect on innovation, and on the research and development of new products. Accordingly, my amendment clarified that product designers need not design consumer electronics, telecommunications, or computing products, nor design and select parts or components for such products, in order to respond to particular technological protection measures. 
This amendment reflects my belief that product manufacturers should remain free to design and produce consumer electronics, telecommunications and computing products without the threat of incurring liability for their design decisions under this legislation. Nothing could cause greater disaster and a swifter downfall of our vibrant technology sector than to have the federal government dictating the design of computer chips or mother boards. By way of example, during the course of our deliberations, we were made aware of certain video boards used in personal computers in order to allow consumers to receive television signals on their computer monitors which, in order to transform the television signal from a TV signal to one capable of display on a computer monitor, remove attributes of the original signal that may be associated with certain copy control technologies. I am acutely aware of this particular example because I have one of these video boards on my own computer back in my office. It is quite useful as it allows me to monitor the Senate floor, and occasionally ESPN on those rare occasions when the Senate is not in session. My amendment makes it clear that this legislation does not require that such transformations, which are part of the normal conversion process rather than affirmative attempts to remove or circumvent copy control technologies, fall within the proscriptions of chapter 12 of the copyright law as added by this bill. 
Further, concerns were voiced during the Committee's deliberations that because 1201 applies not only to devices but to parts and components of devices, it could be interpreted broadly to sweep in legitimate products such as personal computers and accessories and video and audio recording devices. While the manufacturers of these products were understandably concerned, it was quite apparent to me that it was not the Committee's intention that such useful multipurpose articles of commerce be prohibited by 1201 on the basis that they may have particular parts or components that might, if evaluated separately from such products, fall within the proscriptions of 1201(a)(2) or (b). My amendment adding sections 1201(d)(2) and (3) was intended to address these concerns. 
Another issue of concern is that unless product designers are adequately consulted on the design and implementation of technological protection measures and means of preserving copyright management information, such measures may have noticeable and recurring adverse effects on the authorized display or performance of works. Under such circumstances, certain adjustments to specific products may become necessary after sale to a consumer to maintain the normal, authorized functioning of such products. Such adjustments, when made solely to mitigate the adverse effects of the measure on the normal, authorized operation of a manufacturer's product, device, component, or part thereof, would not, in my view, constitute conduct that would fall within the proscriptions of this legislation. 
The problems described may occur at a more fundamental level--with noticeable and recurring adverse effects on the normal operation of products that are being manufactured and sold to consumers. The best way to avoid this problem is for companies and industries to work together to seek to avoid such problems to the maximum extent possible. I am pleased to note that multi-industry efforts to develop copy control technologies that are both effective and avoid such noticeable and recurring adverse effects have been underway over the past two years in relation to certain copy protection measures. I join my colleagues in strongly encouraging the continuation of these efforts, since, in my view, they offer substantial benefits to copyright owners who add so much to the economy and who obviously want devices that do not interfere with the other normal operations of affected products. 
The truth of the matter is that Congress ought to operate contemporaneously with industry to solve problems. Anytime the affected industries beat government to the solution they ought to be praised. In many respects I invite the private sector to be there first and get it done well. If they are there first, they will often solve the problem. Even when they cannot solve the problem, the private sector problem solving process will at least narrow the issues for the government to address. Getting a law passed is very difficult, getting it changed is sometimes even more difficult, and so relying on government really elevates the need to have no garbage in, to result in the right output. 
I would encourage the content community and the device and hardware manufacturers to work together to avoid situations in which effective technological measures and copyright management information affect display quality. There is no reason why the interested parties cannot resolve these issues to ensure both optimal protection of content and optimal picture quality. To the extent that a particular technological protection measure or means of applying or embedding copyright management information to or in a work is designed and deployed into the marketplace without adequate consultation with potentially affected manufacturers, the proprietor of such a measure or means and those copyright owners using it must be aware that product adjustments by a manufacturer to avoid noticeable and recurring adverse effects on the normal, authorized operation of affected products are foreseeable, legitimate and commercially necessary. Such actions by manufacturers may not, therefore, be proscribed by this chapter. 
Again, several individuals and organizations deserve thanks from everyone involved in this debate. I want to take a moment to thank those few particular staff who labored into the night and over weekends to put together this legislation and to accommodate some of my concerns. Ed Damich and Troy Dow with Senator Hatch's office were critical to moving forward on all issues particularly by coordinating the OSP discussions. Beryl Howell and Marla Grossman were similarly important to the process particularly in regards to the education provisions and on drafting language for several key areas. I would like to thank all of the individuals representing various industry and educational interests who were critical not only in educating me on the myriad issues but also on copyright law in general. Finally, I would again like to thank the members of my own staff, Bartlett Cleland and Paul Clement who worked so well to produce a piece of legislation that could guide this country to a digital future. 
In the end, this is not a perfect bill. I would have favored a different approach to some issues. However, this bill is an important step forward in bringing the copyright law into the digital age. I am happy to support this bill and look forward to its final passage.

Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I rise today in order to introduce two bills designed to address the abuse and misuse of executive privilege by the President, the Executive Accountability Act of 1998 and a companion bill designed to expedite appeals of executive privilege claims asserted in independent counsel investigations. I want to thank Senator McConnell who has joined me as a co-sponsor of both these measures. 
Executive privilege is just that--a privilege extended to the President, and the President alone, to be invoked in those rare circumstances in which the President must keep discussions about official acts secret from the courts, Congress and the American people in order to protect national security.

Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I rise to speak today on an issue that I find very important to the future of this country's leading position in the technology, and that is encryption. This issue has been under consideration since I first came to Capitol Hill, and for more than three years nothing has been accomplished by way of assistance to law enforcement, or to industry, or most importantly to the users of encryption in this country. 
My first involvement in this entire discussion came about as a result of the need for protection and privacy. If we are to operate at our highest and best in the information age, instead of settling for something very far below our potential, we are going to need privacy and protection, and we are going to need the ability to operate with integrity on the Internet. The Internet has to be something more than speaking on the public square, it has to have the ability to allow individuals to communicate with each other. It has to have the same kind of rights and protections that are accorded to other aspects of communication. Without this privacy, the potential of the Internet is destroyed. In my judgment, the Internet would be destined to become just a sort of international bull session, nothing more than an international party line of commentary, or an international broadcast device. I do not believe it will fulfill its potential as a communication, entertainment, commercial and educational opportunity unless Internet communications are secure and the right of privacy is respected. 
The Internet allows for the most participatory form of communications ever. In order for us to be able to both invite participation by everyone, and to be able to take advantage of it, we have to be able to exclude some parties from a particular communication. I do not know of any more successful exclusion technique in the electronic world than encryption, especially when so much information is going to be transmitted digitally, much of it through space as well as over hard lines of communication. 
We have a tremendous potential for commerce on the Internet: everything from selling clothes, to real estate, to software itself. Electronic commerce has not reached its full potential, but it can. I think we've got a big agenda there, not just encryption but we've got to have legally binding signature legislation and therefore solid encryption. 
Resisting efforts for mandatory domestic key recovery is also crucial. We have to remind ourselves that the Internet is like so much of the rest of the culture--government can't solve all the problems. At least we have to plead for restraint by those who would harm this technology. As I have said before, now is the time to draw a bright line against federal regulation of the computer industry. Washington must not start down the road of dreaming up regulations to fix problems that may or may not exist. Two things can be predicted with confidence about congressional meddling in this sector of the economy. First, legislation will be obsolete on the day it is passed. Second, it will hurt consumers, workers, shareholders, and the economy. If Congress had helped set up the transportation industry, there still might be a livery stable in every town, and buggy whip factories in large cities. 
The irrationality of limiting the United States to levels of encryption which are far below what the world market is demanding and supplying in other settings, has been mind boggling. This legislation declares that American companies will be full and active participants in the encryption industry. Today, numerous editions of leading American designed and manufactured software bears the stamp, `Not for sale outside the United States,' because the software features robust encryption. That stamp does nothing to make Americans more secure, but it does provide aid and comfort to foreign competitors of American business. This legislation would eliminate that stamp once and for all. 
Encryption, of course, is the most important issue to the future of electronic commerce and if we are to foster the integrity of the Internet we must have the means of communication domestically and international. I have to reaffirm that we must allow the software industry to compete in an international market where robust encryption already takes place. Months ago I went to a Commerce Committee meeting and took with me an ad from the Internet, which was from Seimens company in Germany advertising robust 128 bit encryption, saying that you can't get this from a U.S. manufacturer. The advertisement also indicated, however, that if you buy this you can use it in the United States and you can use it overseas as well, and, so if you want to have robust encryption buy it from Seimens. The Administration has decided to tie the hands of the U.S. encryption industry. To me that's a disaster, but it is also compounded by people beginning to develop relationships with foreign software providers as a result of the unavailability of 128 bit or robust encryption on the part of U.S. providers. 
To see the Germans eagerly promoting this potential, and to have people from my own jurisdiction, from the state of Missouri, say, `John, we have an office in Singapore, we have to be able to speak with them confidentially and communicate with them, and the government is making it impossible for us to send the encryption that we can use domestically. We can't send it to our office in Singapore because we are ineligible to export it.' I don't want the situation to be such that I have to say, `Well, go to Seimens in Germany.' From Seimens you can buy the encryption that can be sent into the United States and from Seimens in Germany it can be sent to Singapore and so you can have your cake and eat it too by dealing with a non-domestic firm. For us to have a policy which provides for the slitting of our own throats, in a technology arena, where we have held the lead and must continue to hold the lead, I think is foolhardy to say the least. If we are to mark the next century as an `American Century,' or even to celebrate this week as high technology week in the Senate, we must be forward thinking and acting. This bill moves us away from antiquated export laws to a future in which American companies will be able to compete in the international marketplace without having one hand tied behind their back by the federal government. 
This bill also clarifies the proper approach for encryption domestically as we move ahead in the digital age. The Administration and the FBI first indicated support for language that would mandate key recovery for all domestic encryption and now support several suggested approaches that would make using domestic key escrow a practical--though not legal--necessity. Director Freeh has gone so far as to mention the need for a new Fourth Amendment that considers the realities of the digital age. I think we need a new and improved approach to domestic encryption, not a new updated version of the Fourth Amendment. I, for one, am not eagerly awaiting the FBI's new release of Fourth Amendment 2.0 or First Amendment '98. 
I think we have to work together to find a reasonable alternative to the current Administration policy and I think we have to ensure secure transactions. That's a clear responsibility. We can't have a situation where we don't have security and integrity in our business transactions. We have to be able to compete effectively in a worldwide marketplace. For us to limit our own potential in terms of competition makes no sense. We have to make sure that we don't allow those who would use information improperly or illegally to have access to it. That has to do with securing the transactions, and the integrity of the Internet as well. 
This legislation is the solution to the problem. It is well thought out and attempts to address the legitimate concerns of all affected parties. I will seek passage of this legislation in this Congress and will commit the resources of my office that may be needed to achieve this end. 
Business Week has recently reported that 61 percent of adults responded that they would be more likely to go on-line if the privacy of their information and communications would be protected. Mr. President, simply put, strong encryption means a strong economy. Mandatory access, by contrast, means weaker encryption and a less secure, and therefore less valuable, network.

Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, 
for years, America's charities and churches have been transforming shattered lives by addressing the deeper needs of people--by instilling hope and values which help change behavior and attitudes. By contrast, government social programs have failed miserably in moving recipients from dependency and despair to responsibility and independence. 
Successful faith-based organizations now have a new opportunity to transform the character of our welfare system under the `Charitable Choice' provision contained in the 1996 welfare reform law. Charitable Choice allows--but does not require--states to contract with charitable, religious or private organizations, or to create voucher systems, to deliver welfare services within the states. The provision requires states to consider these organizations on an equal basis with other private groups once a state decides to use nongovernmental organizations. 
The Charitable Choice legislation provides specific protections for religious organizations when they provide services. For example, the government cannot discriminate against an organization on the basis of its religious character. A participating faith-based organization retains its independence from government, including control over the definition, development, practice, and expression of its religious beliefs. 
Additionally, the government cannot require a religious organization to alter its form of internal governance or remove religious art, icons, or symbols to be eligible to participate. Finally, religious organizations may consider religious beliefs and practices in their employment decisions. 
The Charitable Choice legislation also provides specific protections to beneficiaries of assistance. A religious organization can't discriminate against a beneficiary on account of religion. And if a beneficiary objects to receiving services from a religious organization, he or she has a right to an alternate provider. 
Finally, there is a limitation on use of government funds. Federal contract dollars cannot be used for sectarian worship, instruction, or proselytization. 
I would like to give a couple of examples of how the Charitable Choice provision of the welfare law is currently working. 
Last fall, Payne Memorial Outreach Center, the non-profit community development arm of the 100-year-old Payne Memorial African Methodist Episcopal Church, in Baltimore, received a $1.5 million state contract to launch an innovative job training and placement program. In a matter of only five months, over 100 welfare recipients successfully obtained employment through their participation in Payne's program. A brochure from this dynamic faith-based institution describes why Payne is successful: `The Intensive Job Service Program reaches out in love to Baltimore's most disenfranchised, helping them to identify and strengthen their God-given talents--releasing and developing their human possibilities.' 
Another example of Charitable Choice at work is in Shreveport, Louisiana, where the `Faith and Families' program, under a contract with the state, is running a successful job placement program. Faith and Families offers job-readiness classes in northwestern Louisiana, helps set up job interviews, and opens doors into the workplace. 
The program also links welfare families with faith communities. Churches are asked to adopt a family and provide assistance--possibly child care, transportation, work experience, tutoring, and encouragement--that will help them make the transition from welfare to work. 
I spoke with the director of Faith and Families in Shreveport just last week, and he told me that his organization has helped 400 people get off welfare and find jobs. 
These examples demonstrate that under the Charitable Choice provision of the welfare law, caring, faith-based organizations are providing effective services that help individuals move from dependency to independence, from despair to dignity. 
With this in mind, today I am introducing `The Charitable Choice Expansion Act of 1998,' which expands the Charitable Choice concept to all 
federal laws which authorize the government to use non-governmental entities to provide services to beneficiaries with federal dollars. 
The substance of the Charitable Choice Expansion Act is virtually identical to that of the original Charitable Choice provision of the welfare reform law. The only real difference between the two provisions is that the new bill covers many more federal programs than the original provision. 
While the original Charitable Choice provision applies mainly to the new welfare reform block grant program, the Charitable Choice Expansion Act applies to all federal government programs in which the government is authorized to use nongovernmental organizations to provide federally funded services to beneficiaries. Some of the programs that will be covered include: housing, substance abuse prevention and treatment, juvenile services, seniors services, the Community Development Block Grant, the Community Services Block Grant, the Social Services Block Grant, abstinence education, and child welfare services. 
The legislation does not cover elementary and secondary education programs--except it does cover GED programs--or higher education programs. Further, the bill does not affect the Head Start program or the Child Care Development Block Grant program, both of which already contain certain provisions regarding the use of religious organizations in delivering services under those programs. 
We have taken measures to strengthen the bill by providing more protections to both beneficiaries and religious organizations. For example, the government must ensure that beneficiaries receive notice of their right under the bill to object to receiving services from a religious organization. Additionally, religious organizations must segregate their own private funds from government funding. 
This proposal is necessary because while some areas of the law may not contain discriminatory language towards religious organizations, many government officials may assume wrongly that the Establishment Clause bars religious organizations from participating as private providers. 
The Charitable Choice Expansion Act embodies existing case precedents to clarify to government officials and religious organizations alike that it is constitutionally allowable, and even constitutionally required, to consider religious organizations on an equal basis with other private providers. It is my hope that these protections in the law will encourage successful charitable and faith-based organizations to expand their services while assuring them that they will not have to extinguish their religious character when receiving government funds. 
I am pleased to say that there is broad-based support for the Charitable Choice Expansion Act. Some of the organizations supporting the concept of this legislation include Agudath Israel, American Center for Law and Justice, Call to Renewal, Center for Public Justice, Christian Coalition, Christian Legal Society, the Coalition on Urban Renewal and Education, National Association of Evangelicals, the National Center for Neighborhood Enterprise, the Salvation Army, Teen Challenge International USA, and World Vision. 
America's faith-based charities and nongovernmental organizations, from the Salvation Army to Catholic Charities, have moved people successfully from dependency and despair to the dignity of self-reliance. Government alone will never cure our societal ills. We need to find ways to help unleash the cultural remedy administered so effectively by charitable and religious organizations. Allowing a `charitable choice' will help transform the lives of those in need and unleash an effective response to today's challenges in our culture.

Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I thank Senator Roth and Senator Moynihan for having accepted the Leahy-Ashcroft amendment which will provide electronic access to the IRS information on the Internet. This amendment will require the IRS to maintain its web site with current forms, instructions and publications so people anywhere with access to the Internet can have access to those forms. 
To allow the public to have easy, efficient electronic access to all the IRS information that may be needed to adequately prepare a tax filing is a real benefit to the people, and I thank Senator Roth and Senator Moynihan for accepting the Leahy-Ashcroft amendment which will provide electronic access to the IRS information on the Internet. And I thank Senator Leahy for his involvement in that measure. 
Mr. President, I am pleased that the bipartisan amendment introduced by Senator Leahy and me has been adopted into the current legislation. This amendment will give individuals the ability to access a great deal of material from the IRS. Revenue rulings, treasury regulations, internal revenue bulletins, and IRS general counsel memorandum are just a few of the documents that will routinely be made available in an easy to use format. This information should provide for an easier and more understandable approach to tax planning and preparation. Individuals will be able to see rulings that may be similar to a situation they are in currently and plan accordingly. 
A central idea that I have carried from the time I was elected as a U.S. Senator was that the federal government be open and accessible to the public. I spent time traveling around Missouri, and visited every county, to demonstrate to students how they could access information about the federal government through my website. To rural and urban areas the power of the Internet is tremendous--so much that was far from reach is now accessible. This amendment moves IRS information closer to the public in an orderly educational way. 
As has been mentioned here, the tax code has become increasingly complex and onerous. My wife is a tax attorney, she even teaches tax law at Howard University, and we do not even prepare our own tax forms. My hope is that this modest effort will provide the public with timely, reliable information that may assist in their efforts to prepare their taxes. 
The effort is clearly a first step, that along with the rest of the provisions of this piece of legislation should provide the taxpayer with much more protection than they currently enjoy. Again, I thank the Finance Committee for its work, and Senator Leahy for his advocacy on this issue. 
Mr. President, I ask that the pending amendment be set aside and that I be allowed to send an amendment to the desk for consideration.

Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, the amendment which I have just sent to the desk, known as the Ashcroft-Leahy amendment, would strike a one-sentence provision that holds taxpayers as guilty until proven innocent. The IRS would deem a minimum level of security of a personal identification number code assigned each taxpayer for purposes of electronic filing as actually more binding than an analog signature. 
Let me just sort of put that in ordinary language. Ordinarily, it is the responsibility of the IRS in seeking to act upon a tax return to prove that the signature is actually the signature of the person who purportedly signed it. For those individuals signing electronically, this provision would be reversed so that a person who signs electronically would be discriminated against as compared to an individual who signs in analog form. 
That is a problem, but it is really not nearly the problem that comes when you just open the door to the legal nightmare for taxpayers who might be victims of electronic identity theft, where their identity is stolen electronically, whose pin codes or real electronic signature is fraudulently used. And secondly, not only does it subject people to that kind of risk, but it makes very bad technology policy. As we begin to welcome the use of technology to alleviate the kind of burden that is both on taxpayers and on the individuals in the bureaucracy, it is time for us to welcome the kind of technology which would provide valid authentication but not to switch to individuals who provide their tax returns via the Internet or via electronic filing a kind of discrimination which would be a disincentive for them to use the program. 
The IRS is wedded to technology that is decades old. The kind of things they are talking about, the PIN code system would only make matters worse. A PIN code that anyone can type is not a secure means of authenticating documents. As we proceed into the future of electronic signatures with the use of a wide variety of technologies that will provide for authentication, it is important that we not, in the law, place this prejudice against the use of technology. 
Currently, the Internal Revenue Service plans to implement electronic filing by means of a taxpayer PIN code that would actually be more authoritative than a written signature, so the person filing with a written signature would not undertake some of the responsibilities and liabilities people do with the electronic filing. That disparity in the way people are treated is not reasonable, it is not appropriate, and it is counterproductive. The IRS should use the best technology available for protection of such sensitive information and help to ensure the future of electronic commerce. 
So we offer this Ashcroft-Leahy amendment which simply would strike the one-sentence provision that reverses, in terms of signatures on the Internet, the normal burdens of proof and the normal responsibility of the person proving up the document to prove the authenticity of the signature. To change in this respect for those who file electronically would be to repudiate hundreds of years of legal tradition, in terms of those seeking to prove up documents, that they prove the signature when they prove up the document. 
Madam President, the Finance Committee version of this bill would establish a presumption against taxpayers filing electronically signed tax returns which does not exist for paper returns and which could have devastating consequences. Unless the Senate strikes this presumption, and opposes a similar provision in the House-passed version of this legislation, we will be leaving open the very real possibility that taxpayers who have been the victims of electronic identity theft will find themselves presumed guilty. Do we really want the innocent victim of a malicious computer hacker, forging spouse, a conniving business partner, or an embezzling accountant, to be confronted with a potentially insurmountable evidentiary hurdle when they assert that they either did not sign a tax document, or that the document has been materially altered since they signed it? What is worse is that this provision only places this burden on those who file electronically--another bias against technology. 
Electronic tax filing is clearly the wave of the future and is the best method for both the IRS and taxpayers. For tax year 1997 24.2 million returns--one in five--were filed electronically, up from 19 million in the preceding year. Electronic filing is more efficient and accurate for all parties, but taxpayers should not be asked to give up rights in order to use this better technology. Certainly we did not ask for a greater burden to be placed on taxpayers who use a typewriter instead of a pen to prepare their taxes. 
This language in the IRS bill is the first federal statutory language dealing with the authentication of electronic interaction between citizens and the Federal government. It is very important that we set the right precedent. But this presumption is completely at odds with the view of legal experts on electronic commerce and evidence and would set precisely the wrong precedent. If this presumption becomes law inevitable `horror stories' will result. For many Americans, electronic authentication of their tax returns will be their first experience with an all-electronic transaction. We must be careful that we do not permit situations to occur which will cause the public to feel that electronic commerce and transactions should be avoided if they want to preserve their rights. 
This presumption is antithetical to the jurisprudence developing in the area of cyberlaw. There are several measures being considered in Congress dealing with broad issues of electronic signatures, and none of them proposes to set such an adverse evidentiary standard against those who employ electronic authentication. The drafting committee of the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws, which is laboring to produce a model Electronic Authentication Act for consideration by state legislatures, has just voted to delete any presumptions pertaining to electronic signatures from that civil law measure. The Committee on 
Cyberspace Law of the American Bar Association's Business Law Section discussed this IRS presumption at their last meeting and voted to authorize communications to the Senate opposing the provision. Additionally, the Working Groups on Evidence and on Law and Regulation of the Information Security Committee of the ABA's Science and Technology Section recommended that no presumptions as to identity and intent should attach to an electronic signature. 
With many of the experts in this developing legal area reaching consensus that presumptions should not operate against electronic signatories even in a civil law context, how can we justify establishing one which can be utilized against taxpayers in criminal prosecutions? 
Let's be clear on what this legislation does in its present form. It authorizes the IRS to develop procedures for the acceptance of signatures in digital and electronic form so that electronically filing taxpayers no longer have to send a signed paper form 8453 to the IRS. That is good policy. It establishes the principle that an electronically signed tax document shall be treated for all civil and criminal purposes as a paper document. And that too is good policy. But it permits the IRS to provide for alternative means of subscribing to electronic documents until it adopts procedures for digital and electronic signatures. And it would allow any IRS-authorized method of subscription to create a presumption that the taxpayer actually submitted and subscribed to the tax document--a presumption in both civil and criminal cases. 
Worse yet, the legislative history of this provision, in both the House and Senate bills, is silent as to the minimum standards for authentication technologies that can be adopted by the IRS as well as to the evidentiary burden which must be overcome by taxpayers who allege that they have been victims of identity theft. What, in fact, is the IRS planning to use for authentication of electronic tax documents? Their plans are public, and they consist of issuing a PIN number to taxpayers and relying on that as the primary means of electronic authentication through the year 2007. A PIN number is not generally recognized as an electronic or digital signature for electronic commerce purposes, and it is certainly not secure or reliable. 
The Finance Committee recently held hearings on the plight of innocent spouses, many of whom were caught up in tax disputes when their spouse forged their name on a fraudulent tax return. This provision would make it easier for such a fraud to be perpetrated in the future, as the malicious spouse would simply have to type their marriage partner's PIN number on an electronic return rather than forge their signature on paper. And the victimized spouse would be worse off, because they would have to overcome an evidentiary presumption which does not exist for an ink signature. This presumption is dangerous. 
We have not only failed to require that the IRS utilize only secure and reliable authentication methodologies, but we have also given it carte blanche to determine what burden a taxpayer must bear to overcome this evidentiary hurdle. This is completely at odds with other provisions of the bill which seek to alter the burden of proof in tax disputes in favor of taxpayers. It has been observed that proving a negative can be an impossible task. Yet this provision would let the IRS require taxpayers to somehow prove that they did not place their PIN number, not a digital signature, on a tax document which they may well have never seen. 
Striking this presumption will in no way diminish the ability of the IRS to rapidly 
implement an all-electronic tax system. It will simply compel the IRS to choose secure and reliable authentication technologies and associated procedures for signing tax documents which create strong evidence of identify and intent. Electronic signatures do not require any assist from an evidentiary presumption to meet the legal requirements of a binding signature. To the contrary, electronic and digital signature technologies are already available which provide better evidence than an ink signature on paper. Further, these technologies not only provide superior authentication, but they also accomplish something that no pen on ink signature can--they provide irrefutable evidence as to non-repudiation by demonstrating that not a single word on a document has been altered, added, or deleted since the time it was signed. With such technologies readily available at reasonable cost, why should we permit the use of insecure and unreliable methodologies coupled to an anti-taxpayer presumption? After striking this presumption an electronic tax document will still have the same legal standing as a paper document. It will still constitute prima facie evidence as an authentic and reliable writing. But, if questions arise regarding the genuineness of an electronic signature, or under the current IRS plan a mere PIN number, and the intent with which it was attached, they will be resolved on the basis of the available evidence and will not be prejudged by a presumption against a taxpayer. 
This amendment is already supported by several groups, including the Electronic Frontier Foundation, Americans for Tax Reform, Eagle Forum, Citizen's For A Sound Economy, National Taxpayer's Union, the Chamber of Commerce, the Association of Concerned Taxpayers, Black America's PAC, Citizens Against Higher Taxes, Regulatory Policy Center, and the Seniors Coalition. These are groups that have had the vision to look to the future of electronic commerce and electronic interaction with our government and have seen that bad precedent now will severely damage efforts in the future. I also want to thank Senator Leahy and his staff for their quick response and solid work on this important provision. 
This may seem like an esoteric issue. It is an evidentiary concern within a tax bill regarding procedures and technologies with which most of us are not yet very familiar. But a massive shift to electronic commerce, transactions, authentication and evidence is underway which will soon revolutionize the manner in which the public and private sectors conduct their business. That is why it is so important that we take the correct first steps. I urge my colleagues to join me and act to delete this dangerous presumption from the IRS bill. This legislation will only fulfill our goal of enhancing taxpayer rights if we adopt the principle that those rights should be identical regardless of whether taxpayers file physical or virtual documents. 
I want to especially thank the Senator from Vermont, Senator Leahy, for his involvement in these issues and his sensitivity to the need to have a forward-looking, future-oriented policy expressed towards electronics, electronic data transmission, the filing electronically of tax returns. I personally thank Senator Burns of Montana, who has asked that he be added as an original cosponsor of the Ashcroft-Leahy amendment. 
I ask unanimous consent that Senator Burns be included as an original cosponsor of the amendment.

Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, families are the cornerstone of America. The data are undeniable: Individuals from strong families contribute to the society. In an era when nearly half of all couples married today will see their union dissolve into divorce, I believe it is both instructive and important to honor those who have taken the commitment of `till death us do part' seriously, demonstrating successfully the timeless principles of love, honor, and fidelity. These characteristics make our country strong. 
For these important reasons, I rise today to honor Pat and Don Redding of Kansas City, Missouri, who on May 23, 1998, will celebrate their 50th wedding anniversary. My wife, Janet, and I look forward to the day we can celebrate a similar milestone. The Redding's commitment to the principles and values of their marriage deserves to be saluted and recognized.

Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, today I am introducing three bills: No. 1, The Protect Our Children Act. This legislation substantially increases the penalties on adults who distribute drugs to minors, who sell drugs in or near schools, and who use minors to distribute drugs. 
Each of these crimes currently carries a 1-year mandatory minimum sentence. My legislation would raise the mandatory term for each of these crimes to 3 years. 
The legislation also makes it a crime for an adult to use a minor to commit a violent crime. Adults found guilty of using a minor would be subject to two times the maximum imprisonment and two times the maximum fine for the violent crime itself. We need to make it especially costly for adults who decide to use minors to commit crimes, because they think they can avoid the penalty themselves and because they believe that the minor might not have a substantial liability for punishment. 
The second bill which I am introducing is the Methamphetamine Trafficking Penalty Enhancement Act. Meth production and trafficking are enormous problems across America, particularly in my home State of Missouri. The Methamphetamine Trafficking Penalty Enhancement Act equalizes penalties for crack cocaine and meth trafficking by setting a 5-year mandatory term for 5 grams of methamphetamine and a 10-year mandatory sentence for 50 grams.

Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I am introducing today the Drug Czar Responsibility and Accountability Act. It adds to the responsibilities of the drug czar's office the establishment of Federal policies, goals and performance measures, including specific reduction targets. 
Why is such a measure needed? Consider this: Overall illicit drug use among children age 12 to 17 was 5.3 percent when the President took office. In 1996, it was 9 percent. That is an increase of 70 percent since 1993. Now, the President proposes to cut drug use by 20 percent by the year 2002. In other words, 2 years after the President wants to leave office, he hopes to get teen drug use to only 128 percent of where it was when he took office. 
I happen to have been a Boy Scout. I think most of us in the Chamber have had some association with scouting. We either hauled kids to the campfires, to the Brownies, or to the Cub Scouts or Boy Scouts. The fundamental principle of scouting is you always leave the campground a little better than you found it. 
Here we have a President who, in terms of teen drug use, wants to set as a goal that there will be 128 percent of the drug use that there was when he came into office, and that goal isn't even supposed to be attained until 2 years after he leaves office. 
I don't think we will ever achieve greatness in our culture if we don't at least aspire to good things. Our opportunity is to leave the campground better than we found it, not worse than we found it, and certainly not 128 percent worse than we found it. We cannot defer maintenance of the campground until after we are gone. 
The tradition of America is to provide to the next generation a broader set of opportunities, a brighter set of horizons than we have ever known before. That should not be forgotten when we talk about curtailing the scourge of drugs on our young people. 
Here we have a President who wants to instruct a drug czar to ratchet the drug problem all the way back to 128 percent of what it was when he started and not to get that done until 2 years after he leaves office. I think it is disgraceful. 
Mr. President, because of my concern for combating underage drug use, I will also offer an amendment to the tobacco bill when it comes to the Senate floor to make certain the epidemic of underage illegal drug use is addressed in that respect. My amendment will allow States to use tobacco settlement funds for anti-illegal drug and law enforcement purposes, not just teen smoking programs.

Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, the purpose of this amendment is to make certain that this legislation, the Workforce Investment Partnership Act, and the 1994 School-to-Work law are and remain separate programs. The amendment simply states that none of the funds made available under this Act may be used to carry out activities authorized under the School-to-Work Opportunities Act. The Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee has emphasized that School-to-Work is a completely separate program that is no way part of or linked to S. 1186. Section 316(d)(2) of the bill states: 
Funds shall not be used to carry out activities that duplicate federally funded activities available to youth. 
The committee has cited this section as prohibiting any localities from using S. 1168 funding to expand School-to-Work. Although Section 316 may be clear to legislative counsel and to those of us inside the beltway, there are still concerns about the misuse of adult job training funds for School-to-Work activities. My amendment clarifies in an unambiguous manner that the funds in this bill cannot be used to carry out School-to-Work activities. 
Many concerned citizens are troubled by the possibility that adult job training programs and even vocational education programs will be linked to elementary and secondary education and the School-to-Work Program. The concern is that this bill and the system it sets up would be linked to the School-to-Work system. I share these concerns. This amendment makes it clear to all involved, including those at the State level who will implement this law, that School-to-Work and adult job training are two distinct programs. 
The population that this legislation is aimed to help is different from the population served by the School-to-Work Act. They have different needs and different focuses, and this bill should make clear that they are to remain separate. 
My hope in offering this amendment is to ensure the two programs remain separate and the funds made available under this bill are not used to supplement the School-to-Work Act or to link School-to-Work activities with the Workforce Investment Partnership Act activities. 
No matter how one feels about School-to-Work, and there are some who oppose it and some who support it, you should support this amendment. This amendment does not affect the School-to-Work law in any way, other than to reaffirm the separate nature of the Workforce Investment Partnership Act from the School-to-Work Program. 
The Labor and Human Resources Committee is supportive of this amendment because it further clarifies what they understand the bill to do. In fact, the committee has repeatedly responded to the concerns about this issue by stating: 
School-to-Work is a completely separate program that is no way part of or linked to S. 1186. This amendment seeks to reassure those who are troubled by the possible linking of adult job training system to the School-to-Work Program. But more than that, the purpose of this amendment is to keep these two programs separate, not just rhetorically but in reality and in actuality. 
I thank the chairman for his support of this important amendment. It is my understanding the amendment is acceptable to both sides and is consistent with the understanding of the committee generally. I offer it and urge its adoption. 
Mr. Jeffords addressed the Chair.

Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, my amendment requires random drug testing for all job training applicants and drug testing of program participants based on a standard of reasonable suspicion. If an applicant or participant tested positive, they could reapply after 6 months from the date of disqualification, but at reapplication they must show that they passed a drug test within the last 30 days. A second failure of a drug test would require a two year wait before one could reapply. This provision allows individuals who have failed a drug test to get treatment and assistance and reapply for program funds. 
I think it is important to say that I believe it does not pay us to try to train people who are high on drugs. Nor does it pay us to train people who are involved so substantially with drugs that when they go to take a drug test to get a job, they will be turned down because they are positive for drugs. I believe it is important, then, for us to be sensitive to these facts and to include in the legislation the fact that we will prefer people who are drug free for employment training, because we might as well give them the training because they will actually be able to get and hold a job. This is something that is very important. 
During the last Congress, the Senate passed an identical amendment to the job training legislation. The amendment was agreed to by a vote of 54 to 43 with broad, bipartisan support. The conferees retained the drug testing provision in their conference report in the last Congress. 
So this is an item which is acceptable. 
Since most of the private sector conducts drug testing on job applicants and employees, then a government-funded job training program should be able to do the same. According to the 1996 American Management Association Survey: Workplace Drug Testing and Drug Abuse Policies, we know that the share of major U.S. firms that test for drugs rose to 81 percent in 1996, and that was from 78 percent in 1995. The survey also found that 89% of all manufacturers drug-test, and 100% of all transportation firms test, due to Department of Transportation regulations. 
Additionally, 79% of wholesalers and retailers drug-test. These are all areas where participants are most likely to find jobs. More people are being asked to take drug tests when they show up for a job. Let's make part of their training the fact that they would take such tests and that they would be able to pass those tests. 
Additionally, our federal Job Corps program requires drug testing. Why shouldn't we have the same standards in this government job training program? 
When you have a finite amount of government resources, you should spend them in the most efficient and effective way. 
Since the American taxpayers are funding this job training program, there should be accountability. Taxpayer money is wasted if the person trained with government money cannot get a job because they cannot pass a drug test, which the majority of the private sector will conduct on employees. Since our resources are scarce, we should focus them on people who are likely to succeed. 
Why train someone who will end up never being able to get a job, because they can't pass a drug test? On the other hand, we should train those people who are responsible enough to be drug free and who want to work. These are the people who can benefit from the training. 
In fairness to the program participants, and in fairness to the taxpayers, applicants for the job training programs that will be authorized under this bill should be tested for the use of illegal drugs. 
Finally, Government is in the business of teaching lessons. Requiring drug-testing for a government job training program teaches responsibility to participants. If people know that there will be drug testing in government job training programs, they will have an incentive to stay off of drugs. 
Not testing participants is unfair to them because it falsely leads them to believe that they can be drug users and get jobs, and it is unfair to the American taxpayers who have to pay for those false hopes. 
It is my understanding that this amendment has been cleared on both sides with the understanding, of course, partly in respect to the fact that the Congress previously voted in this respect.

Mr. ASHCROFT. I thank the Chair. I am pleased to have this opportunity to make some comments about NATO expansion, particularly as it relates to the resolution of ratification for protocols to the North Atlantic Treaty. 
As was evident earlier, I had an amendment which was designed to challenge a transformation of NATO that would take place as a result of the resolution of ratification which would essentially expand the scope of NATO. 
I would refer Members of the Senate to the New York Times of last Friday, April 24.

Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I rise to introduce legislation to protect the strength and future growth of the American economy, and to uphold the system of checks and balances that is central to our government. The Clinton Administration's irresponsibility at the Kyoto Summit makes it necessary for Congress to act. On December 11, 1998, this administration agreed to an amendment to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. 
An amendment that clearly did not meet the standards for ratification established by this body in the Byrd-Hagel Resolution by a vote of 95-0. The administration simply ignored the Senate's resolution--thereby ignoring the will of the American people. The resolution was clear and unmistakable it in its criteria. It stated that the administration should not agree to binding emission targets unless developing countries also were bound by the targets and that the administration must not agree to anything that severely damages the economy of the United States. The Kyoto Protocol fails both tests. 
On the first criteria, the Kyoto Protocol does not include a single developing nation. One hundred and thirty-four developing nations, including China, Mexico, India, Brazil, and South Korea, many of whom compete with the United States for trade opportunities, are completely exempt from any obligations or responsibilities for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. 
The Kyoto Protocol would legally bind the United States to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions to 7 percent below 1990 levels by the years 2008 to 2012. It even goes much further than President Clinton's own bottom line that he personally announced last October pledging would not accept a baseline below 1990 levels in greenhouse gas emissions. He also said there must be `meaningful participation' from all developing countries. 
It is clear that the Protocol fails the second criteria. Numerous independent economic studies predicted serious economic harm even if the administration had held to its position that it enunciated last October. These studies found 2.4 million job losses, significant increases in energy costs, a 50-cent increase in gas prices per gallon, a drop in economic growth rates of more than 1 percent a year, and major American industries being driven out of business or driven out of the United States--industries like steel, aluminum, petroleum refining, chemicals, iron, paper products, and cement. 
That is why American agriculture, American labor, American business and industry and many consumer groups have all united in opposition to this treaty. Yet, our negotiators in Kyoto--the ones who were supposed to be looking out for the American people--cut a deal that would have had an even more devastating and extreme impact on the U.S. economy and on the lives of the American people. 
The administration's recent attempt to develop an economic analysis showing `minimal' harm to the U.S. economy clearly are flawed. No models, no numbers, no percentages, no 
economics. It is based on fabrication and vapor, on what Senator Hagel called `wildly optimistic assumptions' such as China, India and Mexico agreeing to the binding commitments in this treaty. 
This is what one observer in Kyoto--the leader on this issue in the United States Senate, along with Senator Byrd--Senator Hagel, had to say about the administration's activities in Kyoto. `After Vice President Gore came to Kyoto and instructed our negotiators to show `increased flexibility' the doors were thrown open and the objective became very clear. The objective was: Let us get a deal at any cost. The clear advice of the U.S. Senate and the economic well-being of the American people were abandoned under pressure from the U.N. bureaucrats, international environmentalists and the 134 developing countries that were not even included--not even included--in the treaty. The United States of America was the only Nation to come out of these negotiations worse than it came in. In fact, there was no negotiation in Kyoto; there was only surrender.' 
From an environmental standpoint, the Kyoto `deal' is completely inadequate. The treaty is so flawed that it will do virtually nothing to slow the growth of manmade greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere. Even if one accepts the validity of the science on global warming, which is still uncertain and at best contradictory, this treaty would do nothing to stop any of these emissions. The Kyoto `deal' excludes the very developing nations who will be responsible for more than 60 percent of the world's manmade greenhouse gas emissions early in the next century. 
In fact, as more and more American scientists review the available data on global warming, it is becoming increasingly clear that the vast majority believe the commitments for reduction of greenhouse gas emissions made by the Administration in the Kyoto `deal' is an unnecessary response to an exaggerated threat--`to an exaggerated threat' that the Vice President himself is caught up in making. Last week, more than 15,000 scientists, two-thirds with advanced academic degrees, released a petition they signed urging the United States to reject the Kyoto `deal.' The petition, expressly states that:  
There is no convincing scientific evidence that human release of carbon dioxide, methane, or other greenhouse gases is causing or will cause catastrophic heating of the Earth's atmosphere and disruption of the Earth's climate. 
The administration understands that the Kyoto `deal' does not meet these standards because they have made it clear that the President will not send this document to the Senate for ratification. 
However, not only did the administration ignore the Senate when agreeing to this deal, they are continuing to ignore it even today. A number of my constituents, particularly farmers and small business owners, have come to me with grave concerns over the administration's `back door' implementation of the Protocol's requirements. 
For example, the Administration has requested $6.3 billion in its 1999 budget in order to begin meeting its obligations under the Kyoto Protocol. This money would go to a number of federal agencies and departments including the Department of Energy, the Environmental Protection Agency, Housing and Urban Development, the Commerce Department, and the Department of Agriculture. 
The administration, in a document relating to electricity restructuring, which was circulating through the Environmental Protection Agency, referenced reducing emission to `meet our greenhouse gas emission budget under the Kyoto Protocol.' The memorandum further states that electricity restructuring also should take environmental concerns into account in order to `deliver on the President's commitments.' 
Many federal agencies are in the process of establishing Kyoto implementation offices. The Environmental Protection Agency currently is discussing whether the agency has the power under the Clean Air Act or the Energy Policy Act to regulate carbon dioxide emissions--a key emission limited under the Kyoto Protocol. 
In the news conference after cutting the deal in Kyoto, administration officials seemed to indicate that since the U.S. has ten years to meet the greenhouse gas emission targets established at Kyoto--the administration has ten years to involve the Senate in its activities. 
Mr. President, the Constitution clearly states that while the Executive Branch has the authority to negotiate international treaties, that only the United States Senate has the authority to ratify such treaties. We cannot allow the Executive Branch to usurp the power of Congress by implementing the treaty--a treaty that will have such a devastating impact on the United States--without the Senate first being ratified by this body. 
A treaty is the most solemn international obligation that can be entered upon by sovereign people. The sovereignty of the United States was purchased with the blood of patriots, and the Constitution defined the treaty making power with great care. The blood and treasure of our nation may not be placed at hazard by a treaty unless the President and Congress are in agreement. The Framers created this shared power in part because the United States intended to reject utterly the European tradition that invested the monarch with unfettered power to conduct foreign policy--even to the extremity of spending the lives of citizens in wars conducted to satisfy his vanity or dynastic ambition. Under our Constitution, the President may not on his own bind the sovereignty of the United States to the terms of a treaty unless that treaty has been ratified by two-thirds of the Senate. 
The treaty making power, then is not only shared and checked, but ratification must meet the high standard of a two-third vote. The Administration's Kyoto agenda is constitutionally offensive in several respects. First, the President is not to behave like a pre-democratic ruler who makes commitments at will that bind the nation. Second, the Executive branch is proceeding to inflict severe damage on our economy and our people, without deliberation by the Congress. Finally, the Administration is proceeding to impose an unratified--and therefore meaningless--treaty, a treaty so badly flawed that it would, on its face, be rejected by the Senate. 
Unfortunately, it is unlikely that the administration's activities will stop merely because 
members of the Senate, members of the House of Representatives, or citizens of the United States point out the Constitutional implications. Therefore, today I am offering the Economic Growth and Sovereignty Protection Act. This act simply would prohibit any federal agency from spending federal funds on implementing the treaty until such time that it is ratified by the United States Senate. 
In addition, since the EPA has raised the issue of whether it has the ability to regulate carbon dioxide emissions, this act would make it clear that no federal agency has such power without the express authority from the Congress. 
Mr. President, the Constitution cannot be ignored. It established a system of checks and balances which must be preserved and protected. The interests and the sovereignty of this great Nation cannot be ignored. To allow other nations' interests to become more important--to dictate our domestic policy--would be unconscionable. The will of the American people cannot be ignored. To do so would crush the very foundation on which this democracy was established.

Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, thank you for this opportunity to comment on an important aspect of this great Nation's efforts to defend freedom generally, and in this specific instance, through the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. 
The Senate is being asked to give its stamp of approval to a new NATO, not only changing in membership, but changing in its scope and purpose. The focus of the change in NATO upon which we are being given this opportunity to vote is the expansion of the membership of NATO. 
But I would submit that there is something far more important than simply this change in the numerics of NATO, simply this change in the number of nations that are members of the alliance. There is an alteration of NATO more profound than the expansion of its membership, and the Senate should not overlook this crucial aspect of the debate. 
Let me just say that I believe NATO has been one of the most successful defense organizations in the history of mankind. NATO has been an agency to preserve the peace and has done that so successfully that we have not had to offer American lives on European soil in the second half of the 20th century. That is in stark contrast to the first half of the 20th century where hundreds of thousands of American soldiers fought for freedom and hundreds of thousands gave their last full measure of devotion in liberty's defense. 
I think the success of NATO, though, is something that should be respected by preserving NATO and not changing the character of the alliance. And, to be frank, since the threat of the Soviet Union no longer exists, a number of officials associated with NATO have come to the conclusion that this laudable organization, this most successful of all alliances, should be devoted to new ends and new objectives. 
I submit that if we allow, in this vote, the devotion of NATO's resources to new objectives and to new ideas, we will be undermining the very success and purpose for which NATO was constituted 50 years ago. 
Let us just look at some of the statements of administration officials as they convey what they propose for the scope and mission of NATO in the future. Here is William Perry, the immediate past former U.S. Secretary of Defense, who left office recently and was replaced in that office by one of our own, former Senator Cohen, now Secretary Cohen. 
This is testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee, March 19, 1998. Of course, it was Secretary Perry who was a part of negotiating this expansion of NATO, which we will vote on in the Senate. Here is what Secretary Perry says: 
The original mission of NATO--deterring an attack from the Soviet Union--is obviously no longer relevant. The original geographical area of NATO responsibility is no longer sufficient. The original military structure of NATO is no longer appropriate. . .the new missions-- 
This is important language-- 
new missions of NATO should be preventive defense--creating the conditions for peace in Europe. . .the geographical area of NATO interests should be anywhere in the world-- 
This is operative language here. 
The geographic area of NATO should no longer be confined to the North Atlantic area. 
If you will read article VI of the treaty, we get into a very clear specification of territory, and it is exacting. It talks about latitudes and longitudes and the like. 
Here Secretary Perry reveals what the real agenda is, that we would create a new geographic area for NATO and it would be `anywhere in the world where aggression can threaten the security of NATO members. . .' 
Secretary Albright has also urged that `an expanding North Atlantic Treaty Organization must extend its geographic reach beyond the European continent and evolve'--key word, evolve-- `into a force for peace from the Middle East to central Africa.' 
We are changing the mission of NATO from a mission which was designed to protect the territory of the member nations to being some kind of international policing operation. 
With that in mind, it is my intention to send to the desk an amendment which would require that the President certify that actions by NATO are in keeping with the terms of the treaty itself. I send the amendment to the desk.

Mr. ASHCROFT. I thank a number of individuals for their willingness to cosponsor the amendment, not the least of which is the individual inhabiting the Chair at this time, the Senator from Kansas, Senator Roberts, Senator Helms, Senator Warner, Senator Hutchinson, Senator Faircloth, and Senator Bond. I am pleased they would support this effort. 
I indicate that this amendment, which is to reinforce the original intent of the treaty to protect the security, the political independence, and territorial integrity of these treaty nations, is what has been and will continue to be a part of our commitment in NATO, and that is reflected in the amendment. 
We have the former Secretary of Defense, William Perry, saying there should be a global mission for NATO. We have Secretary Albright saying we should expand the North Atlantic Treaty Organization into a `force for peace from the Middle East to central Africa.' 
We have witnessed what happens when our soldiers are involved in so-called peacekeeping organizations and operations in Africa. Not too long ago in Somalia, 18 Americans died in a peacekeeping effort. Frankly, the tragedy in Somalia disrupted our foreign policy in Africa for years, and we lost 18 Americans in the process. We have little to show for it. As we noted just 2 weeks ago, one American, a part of a humanitarian team to Somalia, was taken hostage within this last month. We withdrew from Somalia, the warlords are back in business there, and we have not made the kind of progress we ought to make. 
I think the first thing to say is that there was a purpose for NATO. It was manifestly successful, the most successful military alliance ever, and it saved Americans from having to spend their lives in Europe in defense of freedom. The success of NATO is incontrovertible. 
The second point I make, those now asking for an amendment to the treaty are asking to change it from what it was, a treaty to defend the territory of NATO nations, into a `global organization,' according to William Perry and to become `a force for peace from the Middle East to central Africa,' according to Secretary of State Albright. 
Now, just to make it clear that these proposals are a dramatic change from the intention and character of NATO, let me just quote Tom Connally, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, at the time of NATO's establishment. `Let us not forget that this treaty is limited in scope.' Doesn't sound very global. `Its main purpose is to maintain the peace and security of the North Atlantic area.' Doesn't sound much like Middle East and central Africa. `We do not propose to stretch its terms to cover the entire globe.' 
Now it is not impossible to change a treaty, but if this treaty is to be changed it ought to be changed through the appropriate constitutional processes in which the Senate plays a central role in offering its advice and consent. 
Tragically, the focus of all our attention is on three countries to be added to the NATO alliance. But it has not been on this new mission. It has not been on this attempt, this aspiration, to convert the treaty from one which defends the territory of NATO nations to a treaty which would, in fact, attempt to be a force for peace across the Middle East and into central Africa. This responsibility and this problem has not gone unnoticed. 
In last week's New York Times, an editorial reads as follows: `The White House has provided no military rationale for expanding NATO eastward while Europe is at peace and democracy and free markets are taking root in Russia. Instead, the ratification resolution promiscuously opens the door to NATO military actions almost anywhere in the world. That startling expansion of NATO's license to conduct military operations demands extensive debate.' 
That is the New York Times recognizing what so many in the Senate have failed to recognize, that we are not just dealing with this treaty in terms of three additional members. We are dealing with an intended expansion that would take NATO from a limited 
treaty designed to protect a specific territory into a global organization; if you will, a United Nations called NATO, with a standing army subject to deployment at the authorization of the NATO council around the world. 
I think that deserves debate. I think it deserves our inspection. I think there are reasons why we should have real reservations with regard to the transformation of a treaty before our eyes. 
Now, some have argued that my amendment will impose new constraints on NATO not contained in the treaty. Let me make it clear that the amendment which I have sent to the desk merely asks that the President certify that any action taken under the treaty is in strict conformance with the limitations and language of the treaty itself. 
Those who oppose this treaty are those who are opposed to living by the rules of the treaty. Let those who are willing to live within the limits of the treaty sign the rules and play the game. Let those who do not want to play by the rules object to this amendment and say we want the President to have latitude to go beyond the limits of this treaty, to send American forces, in conjunction with NATO forces, into central Africa, to send them into the Middle East in operations outside the scope of the treaty, to deploy American lives in settings where it is an international policing operation, in settings where it is not relevant or essential to the security interests of NATO. 
Given the level of international trade that exists, it is pretty easy to understand that there would be those who would suggest that any country, anywhere, could be an interest of another country. If we are going to convert this treaty to a defense-of-interest treaty instead of a defense-of-territory treaty, we are fundamentally altering the scope of NATO. 
Now, the parameters of the treaty have long been understood. I have just indicated that Senator Tom Connally understood the alliance was limited in scope. A focused and limited NATO was the alliance that was ratified. This expanded scope of NATO has never been subject to the Senate's advice and consent. Truman's Secretary of State Dean Acheson also defined the limits of the NATO treaty in a letter transmitting the treaty to President Truman, a great Missourian. Secretary Acheson acknowledges the parameters of the treaty and stated flatly that the North Atlantic Council will have `No powers other than to consider matters within the purview of the treaty.' 
If Acheson viewed the treaty as limitless in scope, why would he testify about the careful limits in various articles? The Foreign Relations Committee, in its report on the treaty, took pains to show that NATO was not an old-fashioned military alliance. The report states, `In both intent and language it is purely defensive in nature. It comes into operation only against the Nation which by its own action has proved itself an international criminal by attacking a party to the treaty. 
If it can be called an alliance, it is an alliance only against war itself.' 
This was the intention. I don't think we are going to find central African states attacking NATO. I don't think we will find countries from central Africa launching a war machine against the North Atlantic nations. But the Secretary of State wants to be able to deploy NATO forces there in her concept of a force for peace, and I translate that into deploying American troops. The President has sought and asserted his right to deploy American forces as Commander in Chief. This amendment does not seek to infringe on that right. It has to do with protecting American interests by maintaining the scope and integrity of NATO. I don't think we should try to convert the NATO alliance into something it was never intended to be. 
With that in mind, there is a real contrast in terms of what the NATO concept of defense was in the past and what we are currently being told NATO ought to be. In NATO's strategic concepts of the past, collective defense was of paramount importance, a priority.  
NATO defense planning is limited to the defense of the treaty area. . . 
NATO military authorities have no responsibilities or authority except with respect to incidents which are covered by articles 5 and 6 of the North Atlantic Treaty. . . 
Article VI specifies the territory rather directly and comprehensively and tells you what we are really looking at when we are talking about NATO. Here is article VI of the treaty. This is how definite and specific it is: 
For the purpose of article 5, an armed attack on one or more of the Parties is deemed to include an armed attack on the territory of any of the Parties in Europe or North America, on the Algerian departments of France, on the territory of Turkey, or on the islands under the jurisdiction of any of the Parties in the North Atlantic area north of the Tropic of Cancer. . . 
That doesn't sound like central Africa to me. It has the specificity and particularity of a carefully drafted treaty that was designed to protect territories, not to be another mini-U.N. with a standing army, the forces of which can be deployed anywhere around the world. The lives of Americans and the treasure of America should not be directed into international policing operations through a transformed NATO never approved by the American people. We should remain true to the North Atlantic Treaty. 
The article goes on: 
On the forces, vessels, or aircraft of any of the Parties, when in or over these territories, or any other area in Europe in which occupation forces of any of the Parties were stationed on the date when the treaty entered into force, or the Mediterranean Sea, or the North Atlantic area north of the Tropic of Cancer. 
Article VI clearly specifies that NATO is a defensive instrument, an alliance designed to protect the territory. To convert it into something else more or less than that is to involve ourselves in what I would have to say is `treaty creep.' We have heard of `mission creep.' We know what happened in Somalia as the mission expanded, which threatened the lives and safety of our soldiers. We lost lives because we undermined our preparedness; we hadn't planned or designed the operation for that into which it evolved. 
I suggest that if we allow NATO to creep into a wide variety of international policing operations that it wasn't designed for, it will undermine and hollow out NATO. We have seen what international deployments have done to our own military in terms of our preparedness, our maintenance, and our ability to have the fighting force ready that we need. I think it would be perilous indeed if we were to change the nature of this important defensive alliance and amend it in a way that would make it a global police operation instead of the defense of territory that it was designed 
to be. 
So, Mr. President, I have submitted this amendment. I am delighted to have as a cosponsor of this amendment the Senator from Kansas, and I know he wants to make remarks. I have about 10 minutes remaining in my time. 
Senator Grams would like to be listed also as an original cosponsor of this amendment. I am delighted, and I know the Senator from Kansas will welcome his cosponsorship as well. I thank the Senator from Kansas. I look forward to his remarks, which will exhaust the last 10 minutes of the time to which I have been allotted.

Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I rise today to commend Lloyd Pelfrey for his service to Central Christian College of the Bible in Moberly, Missouri. Mr. Pelfrey, an ordained minister of the Christian Church since 1953, will retire as President of the college on May 8, 1998. 
President Pelfrey's service to Central Christian College started when the school opened in September 1957. He has worn many hats during his tenure at the school, serving as: the President of the college, the Acting President, the Executive President, the Dean of Faculty, the Academic Dean, and a Professor of Old Testament. On April 6, 1973, Mr. Pelfrey became the fourth President of Central Christian College. He has held this esteemed position longer than any other president of the college. 
Under President Pelfrey's leadership many exciting transformations have occurred at the college. He oversaw the completion in the construction of the Memorial building. Central Christian College received accreditation with the Accrediting Association of Bible College under President Pelfrey's administration. He also contributed to an increase in the college's endowment. 
I wish President Pelfrey all the best and thank him for his service to the community of Central Christian College of the Bible. May God bless him and protect him in his future endeavors.

Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I am happy to have this opportunity to rise and discuss some of the ramifications of the proposed expansion of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. A number of issues have received attention, and it is appropriate that we focus on those issues and give them very, very close scrutiny. The cost of enlargement, for instance, deserves our attention; the political and strategic benefits or deficits that of new NATO members deserves our attention; and finally, the effect of NATO expansion on the relationship of the United States with the Soviet Union deserve the Senate's full attention. 
But while all these issues are important, I think in some respects they divert inquiry into a fundamental issue regarding NATO's future, and that is, `What is the purpose of the organization?' Is the purpose of the organization being altered inappropriately? Is it being transitioned away from that for which it was initially called into existence? 
The expansion of NATO and the question about whether it should or should not be expanded is significant. But defining the purpose of the organization is even more significant. 
I just might, in an aside here, mention that I am not sure we can redefine NATO. One of the most serious questions I raise is, Is it possible for NATO to be redefined without the redefinition being subject to the advice and consent of the U.S. Senate? If a treaty, once it is enacted and ratified by the United States, could then be changed without the U.S. Senate again offering its advice and consent, we would never need but to enter into one or two treaties, and then, subsequently, administrations could transfer, transition, enlarge, subtract, or shrink the treaty in accordance with the particular foreign policy strategy of the moment. A treaty's purpose might be distorted from defense to trade, or otherwise changed, if it is possible to change a treaty without being subject again to the Senate' advice and consent. 
Now, we obviously find ourselves, with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, looking at a treaty designed to protect the member states from a hostile foreign invasion. The Soviet Union no longer exists. There are nations that were a part of the Soviet Union that now exist, but we find ourselves with a significantly different configuration of forces and challenges to the United States. Challenges to the member states of NATO are different than they were when the treaty was called into existence in 1949. 
So I think it is important now for the U.S. Senate--which is, if you will, the quality control organization as it relates to U.S. treaties--to ensure that U.S. treaty commitments are not expanded inappropriately and the American people are not subjected to obligations that have not been approved through the proper constitutional processes. The U.S. Senate has a role of assessing the quality of treaties as they proceed through the Senate before the Senate's imprimatur of approval is given. 
Here we stand at this moment in time debating perhaps the most successful collective defense organization in the history of the world, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. NATO still stands, although the specific threat for which it was created has disappeared for the time being. We have to ask ourselves at this juncture, `What is the purpose of the treaty?' Would some try to change the purpose of the treaty? Is it appropriate or possible to change the treaty, without amending the treaty, just by beginning to lean everyone in one direction, to turn the treaty to one side or another, or begin to assert that there are new things to be considered because the treaty is evolving? 
I have to say to you, Mr. President, I don't believe in treaty evolution anymore than I believe in the evolution of the Constitution. If you could just evolve treaties, as I said, U.S. treaty commitments would seldom have to be brought before the Senate. In this case, NATO would be evolving and going on its way, entangling this country with potentially serious obligations which place in jeopardy the lives and fortunes of those who serve in our armed forces and those who support the military. I think we have to be very careful that we don't allow treaties to simply evolve. 
It is interesting to me that as we work to address where NATO is and the purpose of the organization, that we be clear about what it is supposed to do. What is interesting to me is that there is a group of individuals who now say that NATO is totally different than the organization created in 1949. 
I want to call attention to this idea that NATO, which was once designed to protect individuals in the North Atlantic area, is now, according to a number of people, becoming an organization with a global scope. Expanding the scope of NATO has serious ramifications: if the responsibility of NATO is no longer confined to specific territory, but now is global in nature, the kinds of required military devices, the kinds of technology, the kinds of cooperation, and the expenses are going to be massively different. 
Here is what the immediate past U.S. Secretary of Defense, William Perry, said in testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee on the 19th day of March of this year: 
The original mission of NATO--deterring an attack from the Soviet Union--is obviously no longer relevant. 
Well, I would say the Soviet Union might be reconstituted, or there certainly might be a threat, but we will give him that much. 
The original geographical area of NATO responsibility is no longer sufficient', Mr. Perry continues. 
Sufficient for what? It is sufficient for the people who live in that area. NATO helps secure the homes and livelihoods of people in the North Atlantic area. 
Mr. Perry states, The original military structure of NATO is no longer appropriate. 
We are going from a military alliance to something else. 
He says: 
The new missions-- 
I am taken aback. `New missions'? How can a treaty organization ratified by the U.S. Senate, in place for 50 years, all of a sudden have new missions, new purposes? 
Mr. Perry continues, `The new missions of NATO should be preventive defense--creating the conditions for peace in Europe.' 
Mr. Perry refers to Europe--not NATO member nations. There are a number of nonmember nations in the European area. All of a sudden, we are expanding beyond the concept of a group of individual countries who have agreed to defend themselves to the projection of a peace guarantee on an entire continent. 
Mr. Perry continues, `The geographical area of NATO interests should be anywhere in the world * * *' 
Mr. President, that is a substantial change. That is a significant departure. This is not the traditional understanding of NATO. This is not in the language of the original treaty. This is an effort to make NATO a worldwide organization. `* * * anywhere in the world where aggression can threaten the security of NATO members.' 
I wish to emphasize that we need to be very careful about anybody who threatens the security of NATO members. But what does this administration mean when it makes statements endorsing a global NATO? We don't have to rely on the former U.S. Secretary of Defense for guidance on that question. We can go to the current Secretary of State. According to the Washington Post, Secretary Albright `also has urged that an expanding national North Atlantic Treaty Organization must extend its geographic reach beyond the European continent and evolve into a `force for peace from the Middle East to Central Africa.' 
I think it is only fair that we go beyond focusing on three new members in Eastern Europe. If a new mission is really what we are talking about, if this is what the intention is, the change here is far more than adding three new countries. The transformation is a shift from the defense of territory--specified and outlined with clear boundaries--to an organization whose impact will be worldwide. According to the Secretary of State NATO should be a `* * * force for peace from the Middle East to central Africa.' 
If what the Senate is really considering here is the transformation of NATO's mission, then I think it requires us to ask, `Is this what was intended when this NATO agreement came into existence? Was it designed to have this kind of elasticity? Was it designed to evolve, as an ameba does, changing shape with different circumstances to fill any void? Not according to the folks who presided in the U.S. Senate in 1949 when this great treaty organization was ratified. 
Listen to the words of Senator Tom Connally, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee at the time: `Let us not forget that this treaty is limited in scope. Its main purpose is to maintain the peace and security of the North Atlantic area. We do not propose to stretch its terms to cover the entire globe.' 
It is interesting to consider these comments by Senators from the past. `We do not propose to stretch its terms to cover the entire globe', stated Senator Connally. His statement offers a striking contrast to the language of a globalist NATO offered by officials from this administration. This administration is now supporting the expansion of NATO to three new members, but is also presiding over an incredibly significant transition in the scope and shape of the organization itself. 
In NATO, the United States was making a calibrated commitment. We joined NATO and considered the possible deployment of U.S. forces with the utmost caution. In 1949, our Congress was not about to deploy U.S. forces willy-nilly around the world. The collective defense mission of NATO was defined explicitly in article V, and I quote: `The parties agree that an armed attack against one or more of them'--of the parties, of the member nations--`in Europe or North America, shall be considered an attack against them all * * *' 
Collective defense was meant to respond to an attack on the United States or another NATO ally. This was an attack on the member nations in Europe within their borders. The allies would 
then take such action, according to article V, as each `deems necessary' to restore the peace for those member nations. 
The geographic scope of the article V commitment was defined explicitly in article VI to make sure there was not any confusion. In article VI, we made it clear. It said the United States would defend the territory--territory of NATO members--not the interests, not the commercial transactions, but the territory of the NATO members. 
The geographical scope of Article 6 included the Mediterranean Sea and the North Atlantic area north of the Tropic of Cancer. 
Article V says if you are attacked, you are to respond to the attack. Article VI has the sort of precision of a real estate transaction, specifically stating where the territory was and how it was to be defended. 
Article IV of the treaty is seen by some now as an escape hatch for expansion of NATO's mission. Article IV of the treaty states: `The parties will consult together whenever in the opinion of any of them the territorial integrity, political independence, or security of any of the parties is threatened.' Terms like `territorial integrity' and `political independence' and `security' flow from and reinforce NATO's collective defense mission. 
As I will argue in more detail, undergirding NATO's collective defense mission was the purpose of article IV. Article IV was not a loophole for any military operation the North Atlantic Council could dream up. 
One of the things I think the Senate should consider carefully is the expansion of NATO, not just by membership but by mission--from the defense of territory to the defense of interests, which is the direction in which things are pointed. If we go from defending territory to defending interests and following those interests, as Secretary Perry indicated and Secretary Albright has indicated, to remote locations on the globe, that threatens some of the very essential purposes of NATO. If you squander defense resources or if your forces are so thinly deployed, it can be very damaging and undermining to the capacity to respond to a real security threat. 
It would be terrible to think that we would have our forces so far-flung that we could not respond to a real security threat. I have to say this: Right now the administration is so willing to deploy U.S. troops and so unwilling to provide resources for the military that we are stretching our resources very thin. If we want to put ourselves in real jeopardy by stretching them thinner, we should change the mission of NATO so that we become an international policing organization effectively answering 911 calls anywhere around the world. Secretary Perry says anywhere around the globe. Secretary Albright says in the Middle East and throughout central Africa. 
The United States is extending defense commitments to these three new potential NATO countries while slashing its defense resources--a 27-percent cut in defense spending over the last 8 years. We need to be very careful. If your defense spending is falling and your defense deployments are rising, you have very low resources to meet high commitments, placing yourself in serious jeopardy. 
Most Americans have agreed we have to have an ability to fight at least in two regions. If we cannot fight in two regions, and if we get into any kind of a struggle somewhere, it is an invitation for an aggressor somewhere else to start something. 
I mean, after all, if we were involved in the Middle East and we only had a capacity to defend one area, that would be the only area we could defend. It would invite rogue regimes, dictators, to be involved somewhere else pretty quickly. North Korea might decide to send its people over the border en masse. So the United States has to sustain the capacity to fight in two regions. 
John Hillen writes in the National Review that we are losing that kind of capacity.  
In 1998, almost all the active Army's heavy-tank and armored-cavalry units outside of Korea and Bosnia would have to go to the Persian Gulf in order to equal the fighting power of America's VII Corps in 1991. And the VII Corps was only one of three American corps engaged in Desert Storm. In other words, it would take all the fighting materiel we have to make up one of the three corps that were fighting in Desert Storm. Given the fact that we have the commitments we have in both Korea and Bosnia, we have to be careful we don't hollow out the force. And expanding the mission, broadening the range of deployments, expanding NATO from the defense of territory to the defense of interests could further hollow out our armed forces. 
Here's how NATO expansion will increase U.S. security commitments. 
Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic comprise 301,000 square miles of new NATO territory and 2,612 miles of new NATO frontier to which the collective defense commitment is extended. 
Total national defense spending fell by 27 percent over the last 8 years. 
If we are going to be a part of defending this new territory, I wonder about whether we can do it with a plummeting rate of investment in national defense. 
Outside normal training and alliance commitments, the Army conducted 10 `operational events' between 1960-91, and 26 since 1991. 
There you have it. We are sending our troops all over the world, and you wonder if we can do that without hollowing out the force when we have a 27 percent drop in our funding. 
The Marine Corps conducted 15 `contingency operations' between '82 and '89, and 62 since the fall of the Berlin Wall. 
We are sending our people all over the place and we are not funding them the way we really should. 
According to the Army Chief of Staff Dennis Reimer, the Army reduced manpower by 36 percent while increasing the number of deployed operations by 300 percent. 
Can you forever shrink your resource base and increase your deployment? 
President Reagan's Deputy Undersecretary of Defense states: 
Like Gulliver's enfeeblement by the Lilliputians, [the U.S.] will be tied down in so many parts of the world for so long that it will be hard-pressed to respond to the major threats against which only overwhelming force would prove effective. 
I think the point I want to make here is we have to be very careful in expanding the mission, changing the mission of NATO from a defense-of-territory to a defense-of-interest mission, projecting deployments in central Africa and a wide variety of other places, as Secretary Perry indicated, around the globe. Are we making sure we have the necessary defense resources in the event there is a real security challenge? If we are stamping out brushfires on the other side of the world, can we defend ourselves against a firefight in our own backyard? 
These are the kinds of things that I think are important. I don't think this administration has made very serious strategic assessments about NATO expansion. `We must pledge that the first new members will not be the last,' according to Secretary Albright, `and that no European democracy will be excluded because of where it sits on the map.' In other words, come one, come all. We are not going to make strategic judgments. In the real world, real soldiers die defending real borders. 
I intend to ask the Senate to make a clear statement on the mission of NATO, a mission that is a defense of territory, not just a defense of interests. I know that Senator Roberts of Kansas and Senator Warner of Virginia have expressed their interest in this respect. We need to pass an amendment that will make sure that the Senate will not be endorsing what I call `treaty creep,' where we just allow a creeping mission to get us to the place where we are no longer able to sustain those things which ought to be sustained. 
It is with that in mind that I will be offering an amendment which would be added to the resolution of ratification. I hope that Members of the Senate will take into account the importance of understanding that we cannot dilute the capacity of the United States to defend its own freedom and to fulfill its collective defense commitment in NATO by making the breadth of this treaty so broad that it becomes a second United Nations, except this time with a standing army. NATO should not become an organization whose forces can be deployed and put at risk inappropriately and unduly in a wide variety of settings not defined by the territory of the members of the North Atlantic area. 
It is with that in mind that I look forward to submitting the amendment and defending the opportunity to place in the resolution of ratification clear language which will define and reassert the only valid definition of NATO, its original purpose, which was the defense of territory, political independence, and security of member states in that particular organization. 
I thank the Chair and I yield the floor.

Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize a tremendous individual who exemplifies citizenship, character, and service to humanity, Missouri State Representative Bonnie Sue Cooper. 
On December 5, 1997, Missouri State Representative Bonnie Sue Cooper finished her tenure as the National Chairwoman of the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC). Representative Cooper accomplished a great deal during her tenure as Chairwoman of ALEC. She succeeded in strengthening ALEC's policy-making operations. She also heightened ALEC's profile among both legislators and the private sector. ALEC thanked Representative Cooper for her hard work by choosing her as the 1997 recipient of the Thomas Jefferson Freedom Award. The gratitude bestowed on Representative Cooper for her excellent service and commitment to principle is reflected in the award. Previous recipients of this prestigious award include former President Ronald Reagan. 
While Representative Cooper's tenure as Chairwoman of ALEC has ended, her legacy to this important organization of State Legislators lives on. It is an honor to commend Representative Cooper for her service to the American Legislative Exchange Council.

Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Children's Mental Health Week which will be held the week of May 4-10. `Putting Our Voices Together For Children' is the theme of 1998's Children's Mental Health Week. The Missouri Department of Mental Health and the Missouri Statewide Parent Advisory Network will serve as co-sponsors of the week; these organizations were instrumental in the establishment of the first ever Children's Mental Health Week in 1992. 
Children throughout the United States have been diagnosed with emotional and behavioral disorders. And yet, some estimate that only one third of the children are able to receive proper treatment and care. The reason for Children's Mental Health Week is to provide our communities with additional information and understanding of these disorders. The week serves to help spread valuable information that will ultimately aid our children and our future. 
During Children's Mental Health Week, green ribbons will be circulated throughout cities to spread the message of support for our children. Numerous events will be hosted to honor Children's Mental Health Week, as well as a two day conference for the spread of further information on children with mental health problems. The week will conclude with an awards ceremony to thank those who make a difference in working for children with emotional and behavioral disorders. 
I would like to thank all the diligent workers who have dedicated their time and energy to help the children who suffer from mental disorders. My best wishes of support and gratitude are extended to the organizers of Children's Mental Health Week.

Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I rise to commend Senators Gorton and Frist for what I believe to be a very important step forward in providing the basis for educational achievement by students. Sometimes I think in all the debate we have about education, we get worried about one group of individuals who might manage funds here and one group who might manage funds there, and whether or not this would be directed by this group or that group. The ultimate objective of our program in education is student achievement. We want students to develop, as a result of our educational efforts, the capacity to grapple with the issues of the next century. We ought to ask ourselves on a regular basis, How is that best done? How do we elevate the capacity and the performance of the students? What is it that gets that done best? 
Well, I think this particular effort on the part of the Senator from Washington and the Senator from Tennessee recognizes two or three important principles in student achievement. First, nothing is more directly correlated to student achievement than parental involvement. The more influence we give to parents, to community leaders, and to the role models who are right around those students in shaping the students' opportunities, the more likely those students are to achieve. Study after study shows that when parents are involved, when schoolteachers and community officials are involved, when the culture around the student is involved in decisionmaking and they get active in the schools, that is when achievement goes up. 
Now, this block grant approach is going to move toward the parents, toward the communities, toward the students, toward the cultural leaders who surround the students, and give the right to make and the opportunity to make decisions that they believe will best motivate and enhance the capacity of students to achieve. 
It is very, very important. 
Second, I believe that it is very difficult to make intelligent decisions for the whole country under the rubric of a single prescription. There are a lot of health problems in the United States. But if we were to say we were going to prescribe a single wonder drug, I think people would wonder about it. They know they would like to be able to go to their doctor to decide what is wrong with them, what their problems are, and to get a prescription that would really make a difference to them. I think when we give the capacity to deploy resources to State and local school agencies and we don't tell them what sort of prescription there has to be but we allow them to use the resources to best achieve what is needed in that area, we provide the basis for student achievement for actually delivering through the educational process what it is we need to deliver. 
I visited a school in southwest Missouri just this last year. Both State and local governments had so many strings on what they said money could be used for that they could not do what needed to be done. They needed to build new classrooms. They were laboring under a requirement that they had to spend so much of the money for teacher's salaries. They wanted to be able to do teacher's salaries. But they first needed classes. Because it was a high growth area, they were trapped between needing to get the classrooms first, for which they could not spend the money, and having to spend the money for teachers. They couldn't use the teachers until they had the classrooms. 
We really need to free the people who care the most about America's future--they are parents, community leaders, school leaders, teachers, and administrators at the local level. We need to free them to be able to deploy resources effectively. 
There is a myth in Washington; that is, that we can make something where one size fits all. The truth of the matter is one size fits none. 
These amendments are fundamentally beneficial amendments which will help Americans develop and shape better schools for their children in which students achieve. 
I thank the Senator from Tennessee.

Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, the Senator from Missouri thanks the Chair. 
The first thing the second-degree amendment which I have offered will do is restore the Coverdell IRA language which has been stricken from the measure by the first-degree amendment offered by the Senator from Michigan. 
I think that debate has been pretty clearly conducted. I believe it is clear that the Coverdell amendment is a virtuous amendment. The suggestion that individuals in public schools don't get as much benefit in terms of the tax break here, it seems to me, overlooks one thing: That virtually the entirety, of the public school cost is already tax underwritten and funded by the Government. Those who are in private schools are not only paying that rate, but as taxpayers they are also seeking to provide education for their children on a secondary and alternative track. To suggest that we should ignore the fact that the totality of the educational experience, virtually the totality of it, has already been paid for governmentally in the public school system is, I think, failing to take into account a very important point. 
In addition to restoring the Coverdell language, which would provide a basis for an IRA for individuals who would save for their children's education, my second-degree amendment adds a permanent ban on Federal funding for national testing of students in our schools unless there is explicit congressional authority for such funding. 
Any movement toward the national control of education, I believe, savages educational principles that we as Americans hold dear. Parental authority and control, local control of schools, school board control, community control, teachers who are free to teach core subject matters, and school boards that are responsive to their communities, not held captive by distant bureaucrats, are a fundamental commitment of this Nation. 
When President Clinton proposed national testing for our children, it was an example of a Federal power grab. The President wants to move power out of the hands of parents and out of the hands of school boards and away from communities and begin, through national testing, to direct the way the schools are operated all across the Nation. It doesn't take an educational expert to know that when you dictate the test, you describe the curriculum. 
I visited lots of schools during my time as Governor, and I have since I have become a Senator. I asked a group of 5th graders not long ago when I was in their school, `If I were to tell you that I was going to test you on the first 50 words in the dictionary this afternoon, what would you study this morning?' It didn't take any of them any trouble to know that they would study the first 50 words in the dictionary. The test dictates the curriculum. 
Last fall, 36 other Senators joined with me to threaten a filibuster of the Labor-HHS and Education appropriations bill unless there was a ban during the fiscal year on Federal funding for the President's national testing proposal. We won an important victory when Congress and the administration agreed to provisions banning deployment of any tests or field testing activities during the year in which we are now operating. However, that 1-year ban is not enough. Congress must permanently ban Federal funding for national testing in order to protect parental involvement and local control of education. 
Why do I oppose national testing, this description of what has to be taught by what you are going to test? First of all, I think we should hold our children to the challenging academic standards that will lead them to greatness. However, any such standards should be set at State and local levels where parents, teachers and school boards are fundamental participants in making the critical decisions that will relate to the children's educational experience. 
Federalized tests mandated from Washington will hurt education in the Nation. First, because the No. 1 indicator of student achievement is parental involvement. Whenever we say to parents, `We're going to decide what is tested, therefore we will decide what is taught, you're not going to be relevant anymore,' we dislocate parents from the process. 
All the data indicate that the most important factor in student achievement is parental involvement. Study after study has proven this. I refer you to a 1980 study reported in Psychology in the Schools. It showed that family involvement improved Chicago elementary school children's performance in reading comprehension. 
Here is the conclusion: 1 year after initiating a Chicago citywide program aimed at helping parents create academic support conditions, students in grades 1 through 6, intensively exposed to the program, improved a half to six-tenths of a grade equivalent more in their Iowa test of basic skills over students less intensively involved in the program. 
Parental involvement boosts student achievement. We should not have a national program which disengages parents. We should not say to parents, `parents need not apply.' We should not be telling parents that we do not care what you think and that we in Washington know better what ought to be done.

Mr. ASHCROFT. These studies show the amazing impact that parental involvement has on children's educational performance. 
I think there is a clear understanding that when parents are actively involved and engaged, students prosper. Why should we have a situation in which Washington begins to dictate what happens in our schools? 
Former Governor George Allen of Virginia, a State that developed widely acclaimed standards of learning, indicates that the most impressive gains happen when we emphasize the grassroots. Governor Allen states: 
If there is one important lesson we have learned during our efforts to set clear, rigorous and measurable academic expectations for children in Virginia's public school system, it is that effective education reform occurs at the grassroots, local and State levels, not at the Federal Government level. 
This confirms the experience I had as Governor and, of course, as an individual who had an intimate responsibility for being helpful to local school districts. I learned firsthand that local control is needed to create educational programs that respond to the needs of local communities. A local community should be able to decide whether it is going to teach with phonics or whether it is going to use some other measure. 
A local community should be able to decide that it wants to teach the new math or the whole math or any method it wants to use to teach basic, fundamental mathematics and arithmetic skills that focus on computation. 
When our military, for example, responded to the Federal Government's demand that they initiate the new math--or what some people called `MTV' math or `fuzzy' math, as one Member of this Chamber on the other side of the aisle referred to it--we saw precipitous declines in student performance. 
I believe when you start saying from the national level that you are going to provide tests that will dictate what is taught, and frequently how it is taught, there is a real threat to the ability of local schools, parents, community leaders and the culture to shape the educational experience that is so fundamental and important. 
Perhaps that is why the Missouri State Teachers Association, which is comprised of 40,000 members--by far the largest teacher association in my State--warned: `The mere presence of a Federal test would create a de facto Federal curriculum as teachers and schools adjust their curriculum to ensure that their students perform well on the tests.' The mere presence of a Federal test begins to direct everything toward the Federal Government instead of toward what parents, teachers and community leaders want. 
In fact, when Jimmy Carter was President of the United States and was considering a national test proposed in this Chamber, Joseph Califano, Carter's Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare, warned, `Any set of test questions that the Federal Government prescribes should surely be suspect as a first step toward a national curriculum.' He went on to say, `In its most extreme form, national control of curriculum is a form of national control of ideas.' 
I think it is time for us to make permanent the funding ban on national testing by the U.S. Government. There are plenty of other instruments that help us understand how our students are doing. It is important that we say that this Congress is on record as prohibiting the utilization of tax resources to undermine schools in determining what should be taught and how it is to be taught at the local level. We do this because, at bottom, students learn best when parents, local officials, school officials, and community leaders make decisions about the schools and participate in them so that student achievement is the No. 1 objective and goal. 
Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.

Mr. ASHCROFT. Certainly. And dumbing down the test would be an easy way to make it look like we were making great progress. 
I will just state that a few years ago, when there was an effort to set national history standards, we watched the politically correct movement overtake school officials as they demanded that we delete people like Robert E. Lee, Thomas Edison and other notables from the history standards and, instead, insert people like Madonna. I think the last thing we need is dumbed-down national standards. We need real academics, not politically correct education. The threat of politically correct curriculum and politically correct tests is something America should not endure. 
I reserve the remainder of my time.

Mr. ASHCROFT. I find it novel that individuals would allege that there are no tests to tell us how we are doing now, but then they can tell us how far behind we are. The truth of the matter is, there are lots of privately generated, academically appropriate tests. There are no politically proper tests that come from Government. The Iowa Test of Basic Skills and the Stanford Inventories are there. That is the reason we know where we are and parents can find that out. 
The leadership is clear on this. I have talked to Senator Lott and his staff. He is going to be strong for this. Representative Goodling has led an overwhelming vote of 242-174 in this direction in the House of Representatives. Senator Coverdell, who is leading this matter on this bill is a part of this effort. It is an important effort. There are lots of national tests. It is said that this would be a voluntary test. Here is what President Clinton said about the voluntary nature of the test: `I want to create a climate in which no one can say no.' 
So much for Federal voluntary programs. `. . . a climate in which no one can say no.' 
Incidentally, that was made in remarks to a joint session of the Michigan Legislature in Lansing, MI, on March 10, 1997. We don't need politically imposed, politically correct things in education. We need academically appropriate, strong things that local communities trust and can mandate and enforce. We don't need direction from Washington, DC. I think we have a clear opportunity here to reinforce local control of schools, parental involvement in the education of their students. I am delighted that the occupant of the Chair has said we should take additional time here to make sure we don't do something that is inappropriate. 
I urge this body to vote in favor of this second-degree amendment.

Mr. ASHCROFT. I believe the fundamental opportunity in education and the opportunity for achievement by children relates to the involvement of parents in education. Whenever we begin to dictate curriculum from Washington, with a national test which will ultimately define curriculum, we will have lost the genius of America's education system, which is local involvement in schools, parental involvement. 
For that reason, I believe this amendment should be adopted. I am pleased that Senator Lott has been in support of this amendment. I am pleased that a number of other individuals are supporting it strongly and am glad to have the cosponsorship of Senator Hagel. I urge its adoption.

Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce, along with Senator Coverdell, a very important piece of legislation. It is a tragedy that this legislation is necessary. However, following yesterday's announcement by the Secretary of Health and Human Services that this Administration supports giving clean needles to drug addicts, I believe that Congress must now act. Congress must act to ensure that federal funds are never used to support these programs. This decision by the Administration, to support clean needle programs--but to withhold federal funding--is an intolerable message that it's time to accept drug use as a way of life. 
Not surprisingly, the American people do not want their hard earned tax dollars spent to give illegal drug users the tool to continue their habit. We already take too much money from the American people. We should not use it to subsidize a lifestyle of which the people so fundamentally disagree. When we pass this bill we will send a message that giving free needles to drug addicts is not a policy that this nation should embrace. 
Federal policy should call Americans to their highest and best and not accommodate them at their lowest and least. That is exactly what needle exchange programs do. They tell drug addicts, `we know that you are too weak to beat your addiction; therefore, we are going to make the lifestyle you have chosen easier.' 
This approach is called `harm reduction.' The Harm Reduction Coalition states on their webpage that the organization `accepts drug use as a way of life.' Therefore, they support policies which make drugs as harmless as possible. There are many that are part of this harm reduction movement who believe that legalization of drugs is the appropriate policy. In fact, the logical conclusion to their belief that drug use is a way of life and that it should be made as harmless as possible is legalization. The harm reduction philosophy is the basis of needle exchange programs. They say that if we provide people with clean needles, there will be less risk involved in using drugs. I am here today to reject that view. 
Since 1988, the United States Congress has banned the use of federal funds for needle exchange programs. Recognizing that government subsidies for drug addicts is bad policy, this ban consistently has been supported by both sides of the aisle. Unfortunately, the 1998 Labor and Health and Human Services Appropriations bill included language to allow the Secretary of HHS to lift the ban after March 31, 1998. Yesterday, the Administration stated--wisely--that the federal funding ban should not be lifted. However, the Administration foolishly recommended that local communities fund these programs. 
This endorsement of needles on demand opens the door to a subsequent decision to fund needle exchanges with the hard-earned money of American taxpayers. Yesterday's endorsement of clean needle programs sends the intolerable message that the Administration accepts illegal drug use as a way of life. It says clearly that this Administration will give approval to taxpayer funding the moment it appears that the decision can be sneaked past Congress. That is why this 
legislation has become necessary. 
Mr. President, needle exchange programs are touted as a way of reducing HIV rates among intravenous drug users. First, there is no sound scientific evidence to support that assertion. Second, even if there were, there are other public health and moral reasons to oppose needle exchange programs. 
Experts agree that the only scientifically sound method of making an affirmative showing that NEPs reduce the rate of HIV is to withhold clean needles from one group of drug users while providing clean needles to another. Since there are obvious problems in conducting such a study, it has not been done. In fact, there are studies which find just the opposite--that there are significant increases in HIV among clean needle program participants. 
Participants in the Montreal needle exchange program were two times more likely to become infected than those who did not participate in the program. Vancouver has the largest needle exchange program in North America which was started in 1988. In 1987, the estimated HIV prevalence among IV drug users was 1-2 percent, in 1997, it was 23 percent. 
Even the so-called `California' study which is heavily relied upon by needle exchange proponents, merely found that it is `likely' that NEPs decrease the rate of new HIV infection in intravenous drug users. 
The nation's drug czar, Gen. Barry McCaffrey agrees that studies have not yet scientifically substantiated the claims embraced by Secretary Shalala in her announcement. In an April 17, 1998, letter to my office outlining the concerns of General McCaffrey, the Office of National Drug Control policy states that `science [on needle exchange programs] is uncertain.' The letter states further that `[s]upporters of needle exchange frequently gloss over gaping holes in the data--holes which leave significant doubt regarding whether needle exchanges exacerbate drug use and whether they uniformly lead to decreases in HIV transmission.' 
A significant concern of those of us who oppose federal funding of needle exchange programs--and I oppose all needle exchange programs, whether federally funded or not--is that they will increase drug use. That is the precise reason that the Secretary was required to show that NEPs do not increase drug use before lifting the ban. There is absolutely no data to support the Secretary's finding that NEPs do not increase drug use. 
While the California study found `no evidence' of increased drug use, the conclusion was based on interviews with drug users--illegal drug users. 
In Vancouver, deaths from drug overdoses have increased more than 5 times since 1988--the year the needle exchange program started. Since their needle exchange program began, hospital admissions for heroin have increased 66 percent in San Francisco. In fact, the researcher who founded the San Francisco program and the founder of the New York program have both died of heroin overdoses during the last two years. 
I think the letter outlining General McCaffrey's concerns says it best. `The bottom line is that General McCaffrey believes that we need a better understanding of how needle exchange programs will impact our nation's fight against drugs before we consider altering the current policy.' 
I believe that needle exchange programs send the wrong message to the youth of America. To say on the one hand, that drug use is wrong, and then on the other hand--to provide the tools necessary to safely use illegal drugs--undoubtedly will confuse the nation's youth. When their parents are paying taxes to the federal government that ultimately will be used to inject heroin into an addict's arm--how do you tell them that the government thinks drug use is wrong? 
According to the drug czar's office, each day over 8,000 young people will try an illegal drug for the first time. While perhaps eight persons contract HIV directly or indirectly from dirty needles, 352 people start using heroin each day. More than 4,000 people die each year from heroin/morphine related causes. 
General McCaffrey, who has been entrusted by this administration to advise the President on drug policy agrees. He says: `The problem is not dirty needles, the problem is heroin addiction. . . . The focus should be on bringing help to this suffering population--not give them more effective means to continue their addiction. One does not want to facilitate this dreadful scourge on mankind.' 
Secretary Shalala also said that NEPs are effective when supported by the communities. I think she would be hard pressed to find a community that embraces the needle exchange program in their neighborhood. I wonder if the Secretary would like a clean needle program in her neighborhood. 
As the name suggests, needle exchange programs are supposed to get a dirty needle back from an addict for every needle they hand out. The idea is that these dirty needles will not be used again or left on the streets. However, according to needle exchange workers, an `exchange' usually does not take place. 
According to the Associated Press, in Willimantic, Connecticut, `more than 350 discarded hypodermic needles were collected from the city's streets, lots, and alleys in a single week.' These were found after a two year old girl found and accidentally pricked herself with a dirty needle. 
One needle exchange worker, who said they got approximately one-third to one-half of the needles back, handed out 950 needles in just one night. That means that about 475 dirty needles are either being used again--defeating the stated objective of these programs--or they 
are lying on our cities' streets, parks and playgrounds. In response to low number of needles they get back, the worker casually said that `one-for-one exchange does not fit the reality of how injection drug users live.' 
Needle exchanges also turn into one-stop shopping for drug addicts. Even the needle exchange proponents recognize this and talk about it as though it were a virtue of the program. From Harm Reduction Communication--`A user might be able to do the networking needed to find good drugs in the half hour he spends at a street-based needle exchange site--networking that might otherwise have taken half a day.' 
There are many tragic examples all over the nation. However, one article from the Pittsburgh Post Gazette best explains what this does to America's neighborhoods. `Our community has worked hard to battle the drug problem that plagues our neighborhoods at many levels. But the needle exchange program gives dealer and users one more reason to stay here. In addition, drug users from outside our community now find reasons to frequent our neighborhood. Drug addiction is not a victimless crime. Not only does it kill the addict, but also, in the process, the addict preys on those around him. Prostitution, burglary, and now violence are an increasing problem in our community. So while the needle exchange people try to help addicts, they do so at the expense of our neighborhoods.' 
This legislation is simple. It says that federal funds cannot be used to support directly, or indirectly, needle exchange programs. 
The Nation's drug policy should be one of zero tolerance. It should not be a policy of accommodation. Drugs are turning our once vibrant cities into the centers of despair and hopelessness. We need an Administration who has no tolerance for the drug culture. An Administration who says that America can be called to a higher standard rather then accommodated in a culture of consuming drugs. 
This Administration has shown that it is willing to ignore the record, ignore sound drug policy, and ignore the will of the American people. This is just another example of Washington, D.C. attacking, through policy, American values. Giving bulletproof vests to bank robbers would make bank robbery safer and simpler, and send the message that we accept bank robbery. A free needle policy is no different. What advocates of free needles on demand would clothe in rhetoric of `harm reduction' and `public health' is, instead a decision to subsidize, tolerate, and facilitate the use of illegal drugs.

Mr. ASHCROFT. Madam President, families are the cornerstone of America. The data are undeniable: Individuals from strong families contribute to the society. In an era when nearly half of all couples married today will see their union dissolve into divorce, I believe it is both instructive and important to honor those who have taken the commitment of `till death us do part' seriously, demonstrating successfully the timeless principles of love, honor, and fidelity. These characteristics make our country strong. 
Pastor and Mrs. Gillming's dedication to one another has spilled over into the lives of many. For forty years, they have served together at the Cherry Street Baptist Church in Springfield, Missouri. Norma and Ken have led their congregation by example through their commitment to one another, as well as their commitment to the community. 
For these important reasons, I rise today to honor Norma and Ken Gillming of Springfield, Missouri, who on May 21, 1998, will celebrate their 50th wedding anniversary. My wife, Janet, and I look forward to the day we can celebrate a similar milestone. The Gillming's commitment to the principles and values of their marriage deserves to be saluted and recognized.

Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, The World Trade Organization (WTO) decision this year against the United States' photographic film and paper industry sounded an alarm for U.S. companies participating in the global arena. Rubber stamping Japanese-style protectionism, the WTO left American companies at a troubling disadvantage in Japan and other Asian countries that replicate the `successful' Japanese model. It is troubling that many ailing Asian economies, after being bailed out by U.S. tax dollars, are still pursuing protectionist trade practices against the very taxpayers that paid their bill. 
In the film case, the WTO found that the Japanese market is open to the Eastman Kodak Co., despite the fact that Japan admits that its system of trade barriers was designed as a `defensive measure for the substantial advances of Eastman Kodak after import liberalization' under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). This decision flies in the face of the U.S. film industry. 
Equally intolerable is the fact that this Japanese-style protectionism is being used to block an array of critical U.S. exports. Even though Japan has the second largest flat glass market in the world, it has systematically excluded foreign imports through an exclusive distribution system in violation of its 1995 Flat Glass Agreement with the United States. The U.S. also has a `market opening' agreement with Japan on automobiles, but the Administration reported just recently that Japan has failed to keep the agreement's `key objectives' and has reversed progress made last year under the accord. 
I am deeply alarmed at the danger that the WTO's misconceived ruling in this case will have. Japan now has a license from the WTO to shelter its domestic film and paper producers from competition. Under the WTO ruling, our Asian trading partners will be encouraged to follow in Japan's protectionist footsteps by taking two steps back for every one step forward in trade liberalization. For instance, China recently announced reductions in overall tariff levels from 23 to 17 percent, but China has been implementing an automobile industrial policy much like Japan's to undercut the gains achieved from tariff reductions. 
It is time to stand up and say, `No more.' No more will we ignore mercantilist trade policies that block U.S. products and destroy American jobs. No more will we allow foreign companies to use their illegitimate gains from their closed market to subsidize exports to our open market. No more will we accept a playing field for our products that is not level. No more, Mr. President. 
As the world's second largest economy, Japan must guarantee the same free and open access to its market as Japanese companies enjoy in the U.S. market. Without that guarantee, U.S. businesses are put at an immediate competitive disadvantage when entering the international arena. 
Therefore, Senators D'Amato, Moynihan, Bingaman, and I rise today to submit a Sense of the Senate that the U.S. should use all available tools against Japan's toleration of a systematic anticompetitive market that impedes U.S. exports. We need to be able to reassure American companies and the many U.S. workers they employ that we are tough on countries that break the rules of free trade. 
We also request the Clinton Administration take swift and aggressive action to open Japan's market, not just for film, but also for the U.S. industries that repeatedly struggle to address the intricate web of Japanese protectionism. 
The Administration must confront Japan's trade barriers forcefully, or the competitiveness of U.S. companies in that market will be continually undermined. In 1996, the U.S. Trade Representative made a finding under Section 301 that Japan's restrictions on Kodak film were a burden to U.S. commerce and an impediment to U.S. film exports. However, the USTR office stated that using Section 301 to address such trade barriers is too aggressive a policy. I strongly disagree. 
When the United States makes trade agreements, the American people expect them to be honored. If trade agreements can be violated without sanction by the WTO, then our rights must be secured through the use of our own law. The only alternative is to accept a new wave of protectionism in Japan and other nations. 
I supported the Senate proposal on `fast track' authority for the President, but if this Administration is unable to ensure that our trading partners live up to their promises under agreements already negotiated, I see little reason to think that Congress will give fast track authority to pursue a new round of agreements. The Administration claims to have negotiated 30 separate free trade agreements with Japan, but U.S. exporters clearly are being denied the benefits they had expected from these agreements. Congress and the American people rightfully expect the Administration to ensure a level playing field for U.S. companies. The WTO's intolerable ruling in the Kodak film case requires you and your colleagues in the Administration to take a more activist and aggressive approach to opening Japanese markets across the board, before protectionism proliferates throughout Asia.

Mr. ASHCROFT. Yes, I do. The testimony presented at the hearing made clear that how we resolve the law enforcement issues at the heart of the encryption debate may affect the exercise and protections of important First, Fourth and Fifth amendment rights. While we must ensure law enforcement the appropriate amount of access we cannot do so at the expense of important constitutional liberties. As I mentioned at the hearing, the FBI has argued that a system of mandatory access to private communications--or a system in which the federal government strongly `persuades' individuals to hand over their rights to the FBI--would make it easier for law enforcement to do its job. Of course it would, but it would also make things easier on law enforcement if we simply repealed the Fourth Amendment.

Several very important rights were addressed by the witnesses during the hearing, and the constitutional concerns of law-abiding citizens must be respected. Importantly, in the ongoing dialogue between industry and federal law enforcement we must make sure that the interests of the citizens of the U.S. are represented and their constitutional rights respected. We must ensure that everyone in the negotiations--including the administration--views the constitutional rights of law abiding citizens as non-negotiable absolutes, not as bargaining chits.

Mr. ASHCROFT. Yes, I certainly share those concerns. The impact to our national security is clear and under the current Administration policy the United States is sending some of our greatest talent and products to foreign shores, enabling foreign competitors, both to industry and to our national security, to gain a strong foothold. In just the past few weeks, Network Associates, our largest independent maker of computer security software, decided to allow its Dutch subsidiary to begin selling strong encryption that does not provide a back door for law enforcement surveillance. This move by Network Associates was necessitated by our current wrong-headed export provisions. We have to re-examine these policies. Simply put, strong encryption means a strong economy. Mandatory access, by contrast, means weaker encryption and a less secure, and therefore less valuable, network. This recent example of the export of a manufacturing enterprise and the accompanying intellectual capital is only one example of a bad policy weakening our economy.

Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, one of my fundamental beliefs is that we should labor to make sure that the collective voice of our constituents is heard and followed in everything we do here. That is to say, the values of Washington, D.C. should not be imposed on the country, but instead the values of the country should be imposed on Washington. One of the best ways to make sure we follow this principle is to provide the country with best information possible about what we do and how we do it. 
We must do what we can to open the doors to government so that all may access the available information. In 1995, I introduced an on-line term limits petition. Thousands of people singed petition. In 1996, I began an effort to educate Missouri's students on how to access the federal government's available information on the Internet. This program, Gateways to Government, was presented by myself or my staff in every county of Missouri, and in more than 135 individual schools. My homepage continues to act as a `gateway' to a great wealth of electronic information about congress and the federal government. 
In this same spirit I rise today to join with Senator Leahy to introduce the Taxpayers Internet Assistance Act of 1998. He has been a real leader on technology issues and shares a great interest in guaranteeing that U.S. citizens enjoy an environment that allows them to know the operations of their federal government. In addition, he has for years championed the rights of individuals to keep their private affairs private, particularly with his principal sponsorship of the Electronic Freedom of Information Act. 
I am also pleased that several other senators are joining our effort as original co-sponsors. Our intent is to provide to the American public an easy and inexpensive way to receive the latest information related to the IRS, including forms, instructions, and recent rulings. 
Under the Taxpayers Internet Assistant Act individuals will be able to access a great deal of material from the IRS beginning in November of 1996. Revenue rulings, treasury regulations, internal revenue bulletins, and IRS general counsel memorandum are just a few of the documents that will routinely be made available in an easy to use format. This information should provide for an easier and more understandable approach to tax planning and preparation. Individuals will be able to see rulings that may be similar to a situation they are in currently and plan accordingly. 
`The difference between death and taxes,' quipped Will Rogers, `is that death doesn't get worse every time Congress meets.' Unfortunately, Mr. Rogers' observation has held true for more than six decades. The tax doe has become increasingly complex and onerous. My wife is a tax attorney, she even teaches tax law at Howard University, and we do not even prepare our own tax forms. My hope is that this modest effort will provide the public with timely, reliable information that may assist in their efforts to prepare their taxes. 
In fact, taxpayers are working longer than ever to pay their taxes. According to the non-partisan Tax Foundation, the average American now works until May 9--a full week longer than when Bill Clinton assumed the presidency--to pay federal, state, and local taxes. I can't help but think of President Reagan's definition of a taxpayer as `someone who works for the federal government but doesn't have to take a civil service examination.' At the very least we can assist taxpayers with easy to access, timely and inexpensive information that can help them in preparing their individuals taxes. 
In addition, our legislation amends the Freedom of Information Act, which maintains the personal privacy of individuals by guaranteeing that any reference to identifying details be deleted to prevent an invasion of personal privacy. Importantly, this legislation does not give any new access to tax information, but instead provides an additional means of receiving the same information already made available in hard copy form or, in some cases, on CD. 
Finally, the legislation requires that the Department of Treasury evaluate the process to ensure that all technical advances are being used that would provide more timely and efficient service to taxpayers. In addition, a further consideration of individual privacy will occur and a process developed to receive comments from the public regarding the on-line taxpayer services. 
This bipartisan approach to continuing the opening of the federal government to all citizens should be viewed as a first step in changing our fundamental interaction with the IRS. We can pass this legislation and provide greater information to anyone who can gain access to a PC. I urge all senators to support and pass this year the Taxpayers Internet Assistance Act of 1998.

Mr. ASHCROFT. Thank you very much. 
Madam President, I rise today to express my opposition to the budget resolution. 
More than just being an accountant's ledger, the Federal budget should embody our Nation's values. Yet, from looking through the budget, the values that are transmitted here seem to be nothing more than an inflated sense of Washington's self-arrogance. The budget represents Washington's arrogance, Washington's belief that the interests of the individual and individual taxpayers are second, if not third, fourth, or fifth, as compared to the bureaucrat and the bureaucratic appetite to consume resources at the Federal Government level. 
I think it is a slap in the face of Americans who thought they sent individuals to Washington to curtail the size of Government, those who have worked to make sure that they sent individuals here to guard their freedoms. It is a challenge to them when they see the House and the Senate march steadily forward on bigger and bigger budgets consuming more and more of the resources of an average family. I believe that I was sent to Washington to cut taxes to make it possible for people to retain more of what they earn to spend on their own families rather than have Washington somehow come to the conclusion that Washington could spend the money more effectively on America's families than America's families could. 
I oppose this budget based on the fact that it is designed to grow Government substantially and it is designed to take more and more of what people earn. I have prepared a series of proposals of $1 trillion in tax cuts and debt and tax limitation measures. I would like to see us put those in our public policy. But, frankly, there is really not a chance to do that because this budget and the budget rules that are proposed are designed to block such measures, ensuring that the priorities and judgments of the Budget Committee remain inviolable. I would like to explain in detail my opposition to this budget. 
First, it increases the size of the Government. The budget 
resolution recommends that the Federal Government spend $9.15 trillion over the next 5 years. That represents a 17.3 percent increase over the previous 5 years. The past 5 years as compared to the next 5 years, a 17.3 percent increase. Five years from now the Federal Government would spend $276.5 billion more than it will spend this year. That is an increase of 16.5 percent. 
So this massive growth of Government I don't believe is consistent with the mandate of the American people. Even President Clinton intoned in his State of the Union Message a little over a year ago that the era of big Government was over. He could hear the footsteps of the electorate in their steady march demanding that we have smaller Government--meaning greater capacity for our families. And, yet, here we go again. We have growth that amounts in the next 5 years to 16.5 percent. 
Second, I oppose the budget because it takes far more tax revenue from the American people than ever before. The budget resolution recommends that the Federal Government collect $9.3 trillion in tax revenue over the next 5 years. That is a 27.5 percent increase over the previous 5 years. Five years from now the Federal Government would collect $327.9 billion more than it will collect this year. That is an increase of 19.5 percent. 
Now that we know what the budget resolution does, we should address the one thing that the resolution does not do. This budget resolution does not cut taxes. 
As a recent report by the Senate Republican Policy Committee reads, `The fiscal year 1999 budget resolution provides for no reconciliation bill. It, therefore, contains no specific tax-cut instruction.' 
Year by year, the amounts by which the aggregate levels of Federal revenues should be changed are as follows: Zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero. 
The numbers in this resolution do not reflect that the report accompanying the resolution holds out the hope that Congress might pass a $30 billion tax cut over 5 years. $30 billion over 5 years is a number which might be hard for folks to anticipate. But here is what it amounts to. It amounts to $1.83 per person per month in terms of tax relief--$1.83 per person per month. Inflation may be tame. But even the most frugal consumer would be hard pressed to stretch $1.83 very far. 
Looking at this another way, $30 billion in tax relief out of the $9.3 trillion in tax revenue represents a cut of three-tenths of 1 percent over 5 years. That is the equivalent of getting a 30-cent discount on a $100 order of groceries. And if that weren't bad enough, this budget resolution would consider offsetting those cuts with tax increases. 
Page 70 of the committee report accompanying the budget resolution reads:  
This `reserve fund' would permit tax relief to be offset by reductions in mandatory spending or revenue increases. 
This is no idle threat. The last page of the chairman's mark lists illustrative examples of taxes that could be raised, including taxes on vacation and severance pay, and adopting some of President Clinton's proposed tax increases. 
I believe it is wrong for us to be considering tax increases, especially at a time when the average American is still working for the Government this year. I say `still working for the Government this year' because, according to authorities, we all work until May 9 now in order to pay for Government. It is only after we have worked all the way until the second week in May that we begin to pay ourselves instead of to pay our Government. 
Compared to last year's resolution, this budget resolution recommends that the Federal Government collect $212 billion more in tax revenue than was recommended for the same period last year. 
Whose interest does this resolution serve? As I mentioned earlier, this budget has its priorities upside down. They are inverted. They are skewed. My clear understanding of Government is that it exists to serve the people. But this budget has that backwards. This has people existing to serve the interests of 
Government. 
Let me read a disturbing line from page 52 of the committee report accompanying the budget resolution: 
The tax writing committees will be required to balance the interests and desires of many parties while protecting the interests of taxpayers generally in drafting the tax cut. 
Why did the Budget Committee feel a need to include a reminder in this report to keep the interests of the taxpayers in mind? Taxpayers should have been in the forefront of our mind. It read as if the interests of the taxpayers are secondary. That said, the American taxpayers deserve more consideration than this budget allows. 
Relief for taxpayers cannot come a moment too soon, and we should have a budget which reflects our ability to constrict Government and to enlarge the capacity of individuals. 
Allow me to place this budget package within the context of the overtaxed worker. 
For the past 5 consecutive years, the growth in personal tax payments has outstripped that of wages and salaries. This is an important point. People have had their taxes going up faster than their salaries and wages have been going up. Not since 1980-1981 have there been more than 2 consecutive years in which tax growth had exceeded wage growth. Well, not until the past 5 years. 
The average American now works until May 9, as I mentioned, a full week longer than the average American worked for the Government when Bill Clinton assumed the Presidency. The average American now is working to May 9 to pay Federal, State, and local taxes. Some individuals think that includes State and local taxes. What do we have to do with that? Frankly, a significant share of what State and local governments charge in terms of taxes is being charged because we have mandated programs on the State and local governments. 
I can't help but think of President Reagan's definition of a taxpayer: `Someone who works for the Federal Government but doesn't have to take a civil service exam.' 
Frankly, all of us have been working for the Federal Government. We will all be working for the Federal Government until May 9 this year--for the government at least. 
The last year that the Federal Government collected less tax revenue than it did the year before was 1983. That was 16 fiscal years ago. If you define a `tax cut' as when the Government collects less in taxes, we have not had a true tax cut since 1983. 
Because of the tax increases of 1990 and 1993, taxpayers will give the Federal Government $600 billion more over the next 5 years than they would have otherwise. 
Why are taxes so high? Taxes are high because Government is too big and because Government spends too much. Taxes are high because our budgets reflect that we believe that the bureaucracy is better at spending money on American families than American families are. I believe that is a mistaken belief. 
This year the $1.7 trillion that Washington will spend is more, in inflation-adjusted dollars, than the Federal Government spent cumulatively from 1800 to 1940. Over the past 20 years, Congress has allowed Federal spending to increase 291.3 percent. Adjusted for inflation, that represents a real spending increase of nearly 60 percent. In the past 10 years nondefense Federal outlays adjusted for inflation have increased by one-third. 
The last year that the Federal Government spent less than it did the year before was in 1965, 34 fiscal years ago. 
When I entered the Senate in 1995, I hoped that the new Republican majority in Congress would pursue a general downsizing of the Federal Government, allocating to States and local governments, and, yes, to the best government of all, the family, which obviously finds the best department of social services and the best department of education, the best department of health when it spends its own resources fostering the needs, ambitions, aspirations, hopes, and achievements of the family, I had hoped that we would reduce the size of the Federal Government to make the resource allocation of this culture more effective and more efficient by placing it in the family and close to the family, where good decisions could best be made. 
Despite our efforts, the Federal establishment is growing more costly and more intrusive than ever before. Federal spending has grown by $200 billion just since 1995. Nobel laureate Milton Friedman observed, `Congress will spend whatever revenue it receives plus as much more as it collectively believes it can get away with.' Another way folks say that, back in Missouri, is, `We live by the `they send it, we spend it' motto.' 
Frankly, it is time to say to the American people `You earned it, we returned it.' We need to give to the American people some of their money back so they can make good judgments and good decisions of how to deploy their own resources on themselves and their families and in their own communities without sending it through the shrinking process of the bureaucracy in Washington, DC. 
This budget resolution assumes a cumulative surplus of $149 billion before any tax cuts over the next 5 years. As each week passes, the call for new spending seems to grow. The Senate spent last week debating whether to pass emergency legislation that would breach the discretionary spending caps, including $4.48 million for maple syrup producers to replace taps and tubing damaged by ice storms in the Northeast. 
Before closing, let me just reiterate my opposition to the resolution for these reasons: 
No. 1, the budget increases the size of Government. It is time for us to increase the size of opportunity for American families. 
No. 2, the budget resolution does not instruct Congress to cut taxes. We were sent here to limit the size of Government, to cut the burden on the American people. The American people are paying more in taxes than ever before in history. It is time--we are not at war--to understand if we are at war, that we are at war with ourselves and we should stop taking so much of the resource of American families. We should make it available to them. 
No. 3, when spoken about, the so-called predicted tax relief would be a proverbial slap in the face, or at least in the wallets, of the American people: $1.83 per person per month. You can't get a cup of gourmet coffee--I couldn't get it if I drank it--at that price. 
No. 4, it would allow Congress to offset the tax cut with a tax increase rather than with spending cuts. 
And, No. 5, it would have the Federal Government collect $212 billion more than the budget resolution agreed to just last year. 
The Senate should reject this budget resolution and adopt a resolution that reflects the values of those who sent us here, one that curtails spending, one that provides tax relief, and one that further limits the Federal debt. I encourage my fellow Senators to vote no on this backwards budget, this budget that really believes and sets a value on the idea that Washington knows best. 
It is pretty obvious to me that you let the person spend the money who you think can make the best investment. And it is pretty clear to me that Washington thinks it can make better investments and better judgments about our family and our culture than can people in their families and businesses in their institutions. I do not believe that Washington knows best. The genius of America is not that the values of Washington would be imposed on the people; the genius of America is that the values of people would be imposed on Washington. But this budget gathers to the bosom of the bureaucracy the capacity to confiscate the resources of the people and to spend them in an arrogant sense that we know better how to spend resources on America and her families than America's families do. Nobel laureate Milton Friedman observed Congress will spend whatever revenue it receives plus as much as they can get away with, and this is one of those settings where it looks to me like we are making that kind of commitment to expenditure. 
I believe Members of this body should look carefully at this 
budget and should understand it does not reflect the values of the American people. It fails, for instance, to obliterate or to curtail or to remove the marriage penalty. If we want a system which would reflect the values of America, understanding that this country is most likely to succeed in the next century if we have strong families, then we would endow the family with strength and the finances to do what families ought to do. Instead, this budget resolution provides the basis for continuing the marriage penalty, which is really a way of fining people for being married and saying to individuals who are married in this culture: We will charge you $29 billion a year. That is the freight for being married in America. 
It is time for us to abandon that and say what we want in this culture is lasting, durable marriages and families that will provide the basis for a culture in the next century which will allow America to continue to prosper and to lead. We cannot do that if we have a value system reflected in a budget which attacks America's principle of strong families rather than reinforces that principle. 
I urge my colleagues in the Senate to reject this budget and to call for a budget which would reduce the impact and size and onerous burden of the Federal Government and to empower the people to make decisions that will foster families and institutions at the local level with the requisite strength to preserve and protect America's greatness. 
Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate Missouri home schoolers who will observe Missouri Home Education Week, May 3-May 9, 1998. As a parent and former educator, it is a privilege for me to participate in celebrating this event. 
As a nation we promote education as a key to success. A good education is associated with responsible, intelligent, and productive citizenship. To maintain greatness as a nation, we must strive for excellence as individuals. And the standard of excellence is largely set by our nation's leaders--especially those in the home. Training in the home that guides children in setting the highest standards for their lives is essential to the continuity of morality in our culture. I am encouraged by all parents and students who take on the task of education in the home. 
There is no bigger responsibility than being a parent. It is my desire that parents be role models to their children. Teachers have always had a place as role models in our society. Each of us can probably remember a teacher who pushed us to achieve more and to reach higher. We are thankful for the leadership of those who promote education and serve as role models. So for home schooling parents, may you find inspiration in performing the dual role of parent and teacher, and may you be doubly rewarded for your efforts. 
In Missouri, home schooling has had great success. I look forward to the continued contributions that Missouri home schoolers will have in education and to the positive impact home schooled children will have in Missouri's communities and across the United States.

Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, no President of the United States would declare war on a foreign nation and send young Americans into harm's way overseas without ensuring that they were properly armed and that they had a clear objective. 
And yet, here at home, the Clinton Administration has declared war on illegal drugs while pursuing a policy of defeatism that is turning young children into sitting targets for international drug lords and domestic suppliers. 
The President has utterly failed to announce worthy goals or to commit sufficient resources to fighting drug use. We are left with the rhetoric--but not the reality--of a war on drugs. 
The President's decision to certify Mexico is just the latest sign of surrender in the drug war. Since taking office, the Clinton Administration's record on combating illegal drugs has been a national disgrace. 
The first sign of surrender in the President's war on drugs came within weeks of his first inauguration. After attacking President Bush for not fighting a real drug war, President Clinton announced that he was going to slash the Office of National Drug Control Policy staff from 146 to 25. 
The ONDCP, commonly known as the Drug Czar's office, is singularly responsible for coordinating our nation's anti-drug efforts and the new President's first act was to cut the agency by more than 80 percent. 
But the reductions in the Drug Czar's office foreshadowed more dangerous cuts in federal law enforcement and interdiction agencies. In its fiscal year 1995 budget, the Clinton Administration proposed cutting 621 drug enforcement positions from the DEA, INS, Customs Service, FBI, and Coast Guard. 
Even worse, between 1992 and September 1995, the Drug Enforcement Administration--the nation's primary drug-fighting agency--lost 227 agent positions, a reduction of more than 6 percent of its force. 
Mr. President, the Clinton Administration by 1996 had cut the drug interdiction budget 39 percent below the level spent during the last year of the Bush Administration--the same Administration that, four years earlier, candidate Clinton attacked for being soft on drugs. 
But the signs of the Clinton Administration's surrender are not found solely in budget tables and staffing decisions. 
The power of the President to curb illicit drug use within our country can also be found in the President's unique platform from which he can implore, persuade, and encourage the American people to make good and moral decisions. He can use what Teddy Roosevelt called the bully pulpit to call Americans to their highest and best, rather than accommodate behavior at its lowest and least. 
Yet, in this regard, the signs of surrender are everywhere. 
After more than five years in office, this President's most memorable pronouncements on drug use remain his admission to smoking, but not inhaling marijuana and his later clarification --provided live before MTV's largely teen audience--that if given the opportunity to do it again, he would have inhaled. The President laughed as he made the latter remark. 
I plan to discuss the consequences of the Administration's drug war surrender in just a moment, but let me just make one point here. Since President Clinton's first year in office, marijuana use among 8th graders has increased 99 percent. I have the feeling the parents of those 8th graders are not laughing, Mr. President. 
The President also can use his appointment power to influence public policy. Indeed, the President has the authority to choose the Surgeon General of the United States, a person we often hear referred to as our nation's family doctor. 
When it comes to issues of human health and welfare, the Surgeon General enjoys a bully pulpit similar to that of the President. 
The President's first choice for Surgeon General was Dr. Jocelyn Elders. Dr. Elders will long be remembered as the Condom Queen for her vocal support of condom distribution in elementary schools. 
But when Dr. Elders was not busy distributing condoms in schools or extolling the `public health benefits' of abortion, she found the time to call for a study of drug legalization, a truly dangerous idea. 
Until very recently, the President also failed to use his office's power of persuasion to chart an international drug control strategy that included specific performance measures and identifiable goals. 
As recently as the end of last year, the President and his allies were criticizing the House-passed plan to reauthorize the Drug Czar's office because the plan included hard targets for the Administration to achieve. 
The only way Members of Congress--and more importantly, American taxpayers--can judge whether or not a government agency is doing its job effectively is to compare its performance to identifiable goals. We spend more than $16 billion annually on anti-drug programs and we need a way to determine whether or not we are getting our money's worth. 
Although the Administration finally conceded that performance goals are needed, they objected to the standards passed by the House. Among the specific targets the President found objectionable: 
By the year 2001, overall drug use should be cut in half, down to 3 percent; The availability of cocaine, heroin, marijuana, and methamphetamine should be reduced by 80 percent; 
The purity levels for the same drugs should be reduced by 60 percent; and drug-related crime should be reduced by 50 percent. 
After the House passed these targets, the Clinton Administration balked. General McCaffrey said the goals were unrealistic and would be counterproductive to the anti-drug effort. 
Now I recognize that these goals will be difficult to achieve. But it seems to me, Mr. President, that if our goal is to save children from lives marked by drugs, crime, and violence, we have no choice other than to strive for the noble, not just the doable. 
The Clinton Administration contends that it should set its own objectives and targets. Unfortunately, this Administration does not set the bar high enough. 
Judging from the goals and targets recently proposed by the Drug Czar's office, it is clear that this Administration has no confidence in its ability to counteract the rise in illegal drug use. 
Whereas overall teen-age drug abuse has doubled since 1992, the Clinton Administration now proposes to cut such abuse during the next 5 years by just 20 percent. In other words, by 2002--two years after he has completed his second term--the President hopes to reduce youth drug use to 130% of the level when he first took office. If that is victory, I would hate to experience the President's idea of defeat. 
Unfortunately, if we look around us, we can see overwhelming evidence of defeat. The Clinton Administration's cease-fire in the war on drugs has had all-too-predictable consequences: 
The proportion of 8th graders using any illicit drug in the prior 12 months has increased 56 percent since President Clinton's first year in office. Marijuana use by 8th graders has increased 99 percent over that same time. 
Since President Clinton took office, cocaine use among 10th graders has doubled, as has heroin use among 8th graders and 12th graders. 
LSD use by teens has reached the highest rate since record-keeping started in 1975. 
The list goes on and on, and yet, Mr. President, the numbers don't tell even half the story. The young lives lost to overdose, the marriages and families torn apart by drug abuse, the high-school dropouts, the children born with little hope of surviving because of her mother's deadly addiction, the victims of crime-filled inner-city streets . . . these are the real casualties of the President's surrender in the drug war. And their numbers are growing. 
Seen against this history of failure, it becomes clear that the President's decision to certify Mexico is just the latest sign of the President's surrender. 
Consider for a moment the following: 
Over the last year, there has not been a single extradition of a Mexican national to the United States on drug charges. 
Drug-related corruption among Mexican law enforcement officials continues to escalate, with the most obvious and devastating example being the arrest and conviction of Mexico's drug czar on charges of drug trafficking, organized crime and bribery, and association with one of the leading drug-trafficking cartels in Mexico. 
The Mexican Government also failed to make progress in dismantling drug cartels. In testimony given before a Senate Subcommittee a month ago, DEA Director Thomas Constantine said that major drug cartels in Mexico are stronger today than they were a year ago. 
Mexican seizures of heroin and methamphetamine were down sharply last year and drug-related arrests declined from an already low level. 
By any objective criteria, the efforts of the Mexican Government over the past year do not warrant certification. 
The Senate today could reverse the President's judgment and vote to decertify Mexico, but if history is any guide, we won't. Congress has never overridden a Presidential certification. 
It seems that some of my colleagues are reluctant to do anything that might possibly embarrass the Mexican Government. Every year, they take to the floor to denounce the corruption and the lack of cooperation by the Mexican officials, but then get weak-kneed when it comes time to withhold the smallest amount of foreign aid or actually sanction Mexico. 
While these towers of timidity propose launching another warning shot across the bow of the Mexican ship of state, they fail to see that our own culture is sinking under the weight of an illicit drug supply that flows through our porous Southwest border. 
The facts prove conclusively that the Mexican government has not `cooperated fully' with U.S. narcotics reduction goals nor has it taken `adequate steps on its own' to achieve full compliance with the goals and objectives established by the 1988 U.N. anti-drug trafficking convention. Under current law, this is the standard by which we are to decide whether or not to certify a foreign government. 
Mexico's efforts over the past year do not come close to warranting certification. The time for threats and warning shots is over. We should vote today to disapprove of the President's inexplicable decision to certify Mexico. 
We cannot afford to surrender the war against drugs in America through policies of accommodation and defeatism. Rather than challenging America to her highest and best, the Clinton Administration's drug policy accommodates behavior at its lowest and least. We can and must do better.

Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize a tremendous community which exemplifies citizenship, character, and service to humanity, the Zion Grove Missionary Baptist Church. 
On January 18, 1998, the members of the Zion Grove Missionary Baptist Church held their long and eagerly anticipated `Mortgage Burning Party.' Under the guidance of their respected pastor, the Reverend Frank L. Selkirk III, Ph.D., the Zion Grove Missionary Baptist Church will draw to a close its financial debts and begin to look forward, with faith, hope and love to a future filled with opportunity. 
The history of this wonderful church has been nothing short of a small blessing. From its humble beginning on October 15, 1938, with a congregation of only eight members, Zion Grove Missionary Baptist Church continued to grow and flourish with each year and each dedicated pastor until it reached its present location at 2801 Swope Parkway in Kansas City, Missouri. This church and the community which comprises it are examples of dedication, perseverance, and commitment to the future. 
With God's blessing, and the faithful support of the Zion Grove Missionary Baptist Church community, `The Mortgage Burning Party' will be a celebration of the blessings that will continue to reward the Zion Grove Missionary Baptist Church.

Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize a tremendous individual who exemplifies citizenship, character, and service to humanity, Helen Cox. 
Helen Cox of Willow Springs, Missouri has been a foster parent since 1989. Throughout her tenure as a foster parent, Helen has cared for over 150 foster children. Helen has spent countless hours drying tears, rocking children to sleep, and sitting up night after night with children unable to sleep. The golden rule of doing unto others as you would have them do unto you is exemplified in Helen's home. Through patience and firmness, Helen has taught these children that household tasks, school work and other responsibilities are a part of learning how to survive and thrive in the world. The comfortable country environment, that includes the friendship and therapy of animals, has nurtured many children. 
Helen recently celebrated her seventy-second birthday and was honored at a reception on December 7, 1997, by the Foster Parent Association of West Plains, Missouri. Even at the age of seventy-two, she is serving others and maintaining frequent contact with many of the children who were placed in her home. It is an honor to commend Helen for her commitment to provide a loving home for the many children she has served as a foster parent.

Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I appreciate this opportunity to spend a few moments speaking about two of America's most fundamental values. These values are embraced by our people across the Nation from sea to shining sea. If we were to inventory values among the American people, I think these would percolate to the top. They are the values of family and the values of work. These values come together when we think about how our workplaces impact families. 
Sometimes when they come together, it is through collision. This collision takes place when the value of family conflicts with the value of work--the workplace actually competes with the family and the family's needs. Sometimes, though, they can come together through cooperation instead of by collision. I think that is what we ought to seek to encourage in our culture that these two most important values of our culture--work and family--should be able to coexist and to cooperate. They must be able to coexist and cooperate to build a strong America. But when one of these values undermines, erodes or undercuts the other value, we develop tensions that keep us from operating at our highest and best. 
How we resolve the particular conflicts between these values that are important will determine how well we do in the next century. Most of us want to be survivors in the next century; we don't want to be succumbers. We want to be swimmers; we don't want to be sinkers. We want America to continue to define the world culture. We want the 21st century to be marked as an American century. We can do that if the Congress builds an important framework which allows people to respect these values in cooperation rather than in conflict. If we make it possible for the value of work to be a value which can be elevated without undermining or eroding the value of family. 
So it is important for us to make sure that, as a Government, that we allow rules to exist and we provide a framework in which both the value of work and the value of family can flourish. Without hard work, we will never make it. Without strong families, we will never make it. Without finding a way to harmonize these competing interests--we will never be able to succeed in the next century. 
Since 1965, the amount of time that parents spend with their children has dropped 40 percent. This is a decrease of almost half of the amount of time that parents spend with their children. This does not necessarily threaten the work part of the equation, but it certainly indicates that there is a serious challenge to the family side of the equation. These two values of work and family must work together--must be elevated together. And if we have elevated work to the detriment of family, we have to find out ways, we have to seek out ways, we have to search for ways to make it possible for families to spend more time together. 
A 1993 study found that 66 percent--two out of every three adults surveyed nationwide--wanted to spend more time with their children. 
How can we begin to restore a balance? How can we restore the capacity of families to have that kind of chemistry within them that builds the strong sense of loyalty, of belonging, and of confidence that provides the basis for transmitting values from one generation to the next? 
The family is the best department of education; it is the best department of social services and health; it is the best employment training in the world. If we have strong families, we will succeed. 
How can we make it possible for these 66 percent of American adults who want to spend more time with their children to do so? 
Fifty-five percent of the adults surveyed are willing to give up some seniority or pay at work in exchange for more personal time. People feel this need to be with their family very strongly. 
According to the U.S. Department of Labor in its report `Working Women Count'--and here is the cover of the report. This was the executive summary of the cover from the Women's Bureau, the U.S. Department of Labor. According to that, `The number one issue women want to bring to the President's attention is the difficulty of balancing work and family obligations.' 
That was out of this report from the President's Department of Labor, U.S. Department of Labor, May 1994. 
In 1940, just 2 years after the passage of the Fair Labor Standards Act, 67 percent of all the families had sort of a traditional structure. Let's go to the next chart. 
In 1938, only 2 out of 12 women with school-aged children worked outside the home. So for these women, they had lots of time with their children. Only 2 out of 12, 1 out of 6--about 17 percent--only 2 out of 12 worked outside the home. Look at the difference today. By 1995, we had a situation where 9 out of 12 women with school-aged children worked outside the home. 
This represents a major change in America's families, a substantial change in the structure of the home, a major change in the ability of people to spend time with their children. It is becoming very clear that we need to do something to make it possible, if we can, to allow families to spend time together. 
By 1995, only 70 percent of families had a traditional structure; 43 percent of all families had two working spouses. 
In 1995, almost 70 percent of single women headed families with children. That is a real situation where not only do you not have a mom and dad to work to help children together, but you have one-parent families. And if you take that one-parent family into a rigid employment environment where there is no ability to accommodate the needs of the family, you basically have a situation where there is no capacity to meet the needs of children when the work of the family comes in conflict with the work of the workplace. 
There is a way for us to improve this situation. There is a way for us to help American families meet the needs of their families and the needs of the workplace as well. This solution was recognized as far back as 1945 when the Federal Employee Pay Act was passed to give Federal workers a compensatory time-off option. I want to restate the date. That is 1945. That is a long time ago. In 1945, over half a century ago, Federal workers began to have the ability, instead of taking time-and-a-half pay for overtime hours they worked, to take time off sometime later when they realized, `Wait a second, all the time-and-a-half pay in the world will never buy me more time with my family if I can't get a break. Could I possibly make it some time so that when I work an extra hour, instead of getting an hour and a half pay for the overtime, I would get time off sometime later to spend with my family?' 
This concept was recognized again in 1978 when Congress gave flextime options to the Federal Government. I think it is important to note that that was a major step forward. It took individuals looking down the tunnel of time a little bit to understand there would be more and more women in the work force, more and more families without time spent by parents for children. 
Among those who were at the forefront of the march to help preserve the capacity of families to spend time with their children is the senior Senator from Alaska, who was part of this 1978 effort to give Federal Government employees options for flextime in addition to comptime. 
What is important is that in 1994, President Clinton decided that flextime was so valuable that he extended this sort of flexible-working-arrangement time situation to a whole group of individuals in the executive department of Government, because he understood the need that workers and their families have to spend more time together. The Federal workers have it. 
Here is a little chart: Flexible scheduling today. Who can benefit? Mr. President, 2.9 million Federal employees are eligible for flexible scheduling benefits under the current law. 
Who can't have it? By law, 59.2 million private-sector workers cannot make the same choices about their work schedules. Special privilege to the Federal worker with flexible scheduling; the absence of this capacity to assist individuals, reinforce the value of family and work together for non-Federal workers. 
When asked, 8 out of 10 respondents supported continuation of the program in the Federal sector. The General Accounting Office, conducted the study and workers indicated that they approve the program; 72 percent stated they had more flexibility to spend time with their families. Just think of that, flexible working arrangements had helped 72 percent of the Federal employees spend more time with their families--that is something we should encourage--rather than discourage, all Americans to do. 
What is interesting is that these studies also included that productivity went up. What we are beginning to define here is a win-win situation. The workers have their capacity to spend more time with their family--at the same time--the employer has its capacity elevated because productivity goes up. This defines a new way of looking at the relationship between employees and employers. We need for the next century to see ourselves as teams going forward together, not adversaries that can only move forward if the other moves backward. That is a very important concept as we face the 21st century. We will never do well in the 21st century if we don't understand that we only walk forward together. 
Seventy-four percent of Federal employees participating in these programs said that alternative work schedules improve their morale. Overwhelmingly, American workers want the same options to be available in the private sector. 
There is a group of those who survey public attitudes, Penn and Schoen, these are pollsters who often work for President Clinton. Their studies show that 75 percent favor allowing employees the choice of getting time off, time and a half either in wages or as time off. Three out of four, 7 1/2 out of 10 people surveyed said they would like to have that choice--they just want a choice. Fifty-seven percent said they would take time off instead of being paid, if the option were available, from time to time. 
What is interesting is that you don't have to make a choice under these proposals to always take time as comptime and never get paid for it. As a matter of fact, you can take it as comptime when you have something, some needs, arising in your families, not take it as comptime if you need the money more--it is your decision. Unlike the current situation when workers have no choice, no choice whatsoever, as to whether time is more valuable than money. 
If you decide you want it as comptime and later on change your mind because you need the money, the proposal allows you to cash in the comptime. Fifty-eight percent of those who would choose the option of time off would choose it more often than pay, they say. This indicates that there is a strong demand and a capacity of American workers who believe they could make their own choice here. They would like simply to have the choice. In fact, a recent poll by Money magazine found that 64 percent of the American people and 68 percent of women would rather have their overtime in the form of 
time off than in cash wages. 
We wouldn't be here to tell people that they had to take it in time off, to say they must take it in wages or must take it in time off. I think what we ought to do is allow people to have the flexibility to meet their needs at the moment, to meet the needs of their families at the moment. There are times when they might prefer to work a little extra and have the extra cash, but there are times when they would be asked to work overtime and they would like to say, `You know, I have been working a lot, I need to spend time with my family, we need to take a day off together, we need to go to the zoo, we need to go to the basketball game, we need to see our son and daughter in a play; how about I work the extra time you are asking me and I get time and a half off later on?' Eighty-two percent of the people said they support the Republican proposal to give working men and women more control over their time. 
This is the challenge we face. We have two competing values in America: the value of work, which is understood as one of the primary values of our culture, and the value of family, family the primary institution of our culture. We shouldn't have them colliding and conflicting in the law. We should have them cooperating, and we should find ways to give people more options to make choices that respect both of those values. 
Let me make a few points about the amendment which I propose. First of all, it does not alter the 40-hour workweek. It is a new section at the end of the Fair Labor Standards Act that does not revise the 40-hour workweek, and it is voluntary, totally voluntary. Anyone who wants to operate under the current law could continue to operate that way without discrimination, and if there are any violations of this provision, the penalties are doubled for violations. 
It just provides that there is a potential for compensatory time off when time is more valuable than money to individuals. There would be limits so that we wouldn't have a situation where people might be putting a lot of compensatory time off into a bank and then if the employer went out of business or were to leave the area that the person, his or her time off or income would be jeopardized. Accumulation would be limited to 160 hours. At the end of every year, any accumulated time would be cashed out so that if you didn't use your comptime by the end of the year, you just got time-and-a-half pay. Or any time prior to taking the time off that a worker decides, `Hey, I don't think I am going to be able to afford to take that time off, I just would like to have my money instead,' the law would allow the worker to just take the time-and-a-half pay instead of the time off for comptime. Under this amendment, cashing-out your comp time bank is an absolute right. 
There is a strong provision in this amendment which would allow for a reasonable use, at the employee's option, of the time off if it does not unduly disrupt the employer's operation. The undue-disruption criterion has been used in the employment setting for quite some time now, so that there is relatively good understanding that employers are required to make a significant showing, and can't just unreasonably deny an employee's request to take that time off. 
Sometimes people worry about whether or not there would be some sort of coercion under this proposal. I think it is important for us to understand that there are strong protections to prohibit coercion. The protections that are provided in this law would be far greater than the protections that are enjoyed by the State and local and Federal Government workers as it relates to comptime now. 
For instance, for State and local workers, workers can be required to participate--as a condition of employment--in comptime provisions. Ours would be totally voluntary in the private sector. So that is a protection, a safeguard, against coercion of any worker who didn't want to participate in comptime. This would be an authorization for an employer and employee to work together, but an employee who chose not to participate in getting comptime off could, with total assurance, have the resources 
instead, and even if the worker decided to take the comptime off and later changed his or her mind, just like that, the money has to be paid. 
Management can decide when a worker must use comptime under the State and local workers' law. Not so under ours. Management cannot dictate, and the workers would have the right to make choices about when to use them. 
Under the State and local workers' law, comptime is paid in cash only when the worker leaves the job. Under the State and local situation, in order to convert your comptime to cash, you have to leave your job. Not so under the provision of the amendment which we are proposing. Any time you want to convert your comptime to cash, you could automatically do it, as a matter of right. Just say, I want to change from the comptime which I have in the bank, time I had intended to take off, and I would like to have the overtime pay instead. 
Under S. 4, participation is strictly voluntary. It cannot be required. This is in stark contrast to the required participation condition of State and local workers which currently is the law now. 
Under this proposal, workers cannot be coerced into using their comptime. For state and local government workers--management can decide when the comptime is to be used. Under this proposal, workers cannot be coerced, comptime must be cashed out on request under our proposal and must be cashed out at the end of every year. 
You can only cash out your comptime under the State and local provisions which have been in effect now for the last, basically, dozen years. You can only get your money when you leave the job. Under our proposal, you get the money anytime you decide you want the money. 
Now, in addition to the compensatory time option to make the values of family and work harmonious--so that they are in cooperation, not in conflict--so that they work together in harmony and unity to provide a better setting for workers, there is another thing besides comptime. It is called flexible schedules. 
One of the most popular programs in the Federal Government is the ability to--the ability to--allocate hours from one week to the next and to figure the 40-hour week over a 2-week period. A lot of Federal workers have done this so that they can take a day off, an extra day off every other week. 
When a lot of folks are asked the question, would you like to have every other Friday off or every other Monday off or would you like to have a weekday off every other week, they respond very positively to that. In order to do that, sometimes you will have to allow people, as a matter of choice, to say, `I'll work more than 40 hours in one week in return for working less the next week.' So that the most popular schedule among Federal workers in flexible working arrangements is to work 45 hours the first week, 35 hours the next week, and in so doing by working 9 hours a day for most of the days, have every other Friday off. 
Now this gives people a chance to take a weekday off so that they can go to the schoolhouse and talk to teachers or they can attend events or maybe even just go to the motor vehicle department and stand in line so they can get their license renewed. Or maybe just be told that they did not bring the right supporting documents and get sent home to get whatever is necessary. 
But this ability to have flex hours at the option of the workers--at the request of the workers--so that people can take an extra day off every other week and still preserve their paycheck and still have the complete capacity, is an important thing. This flexible credit hour provision is important because not all workers earn overtime. In other words, comptime alone will not solve the problem. Workers who do not earn overtime also would like to have some time off so they can just rearrange their schedule but would be precluded from doing so under a comp time only plan. 
Flexible scheduling. Sure, lots of people who work overtime can take Friday off every other week, if they are working enough overtime. The vast majority of people do not get overtime, but they would like to have flexible scheduling. They would like to have some time off in which they can meet the needs of their families. 
Only 20 percent of workers who get paid by the hour report receiving overtime during a typical week--only one out of five. Seventy-two percent of those reporting overtime compensation are men. So that some of the people who need flexibility--women--need to be able to take some time off, but are not the ones who are getting the capacity to take time off. Comptime alone would help only 1.9 million working women. That is only 4.5 percent of all the working women in the private sector. 
Other flexible scheduling options: Instead of helping just 4.5 percent of the women, flexible scheduling options would help 67 percent of all working women. In addition to the comptime for people who actually get overtime, we ought to be working with individuals who are only going to get 40 hours a week. We can do this by giving them the opportunity to tailor that 40 hours a week in ways that gives them time off to spend with their families, spend with their children, or if they do not have families, they can spend it on themselves. 
The idea that individuals should not be able to agree with their employers to arrange things so they can have a more fulfilling life--to be with their children or take care of themselves--is an idea of the past. American workers know how to accommodate their needs and should be able to agree with their 
employers in a framework of protections to do that. 
Comptime would only help 5 million working men. That is only 10 percent of the working men in the private sector. The other flexible scheduling options provided in this amendment would benefit 61 percent of all men working in the private sector. 
Who would gain from flexible scheduling? Mr. President, 59.2 million private sector workers would have new choices in setting work schedules and making time for their family and friends--30.4 million men, 28.8 million women. 
These are individuals with families; these are individuals who have something that competes with the workplace for their interests. We should not make it a situation where in order to do your job you cannot be a parent or be a good parent or in order to be a good parent you have to be a bad employee. We should provide the flexibility of scheduling. We should tailor the laws of this country to make it possible for individuals--to make it possible for individuals--to be able to meet the needs of their families and the workplace. 
We mentioned earlier, when we surveyed the situation in Government, the General Accounting Office said two things happened: Morale and productivity went up, and worker satisfaction and their ability to spend time with their families went up. Wait a second. Here is a win-win situation. The value of work went up and the value of family went up. When Government can provide a basis for enhancing the value of families and enhancing the value of work in this culture, we ought to seize that opportunity. Too much of what we do impairs the value of these cultures. 
Well, there are others who have said there are other solutions. Frankly, the solution that has been proposed on the other side of the aisle is more unpaid leave, more of the so-called Family and Medical Leave. And that is a tragedy because unpaid leave exacerbates one of the problems that families are enduring--that is, they need resources. 
A lot of families would not have both adults in the work force if they did not need the money. So telling people that they should not get money, that they should take unpaid leave, is saying, sure, we know you are having a problem spending time with your family and a problem funding your family, so you should take more time with your family and, therefore, have greater difficulty funding it. That is a vice. That is a crack into which we should not let families fall. 
That exacerbates the tension between the home place and the workplace. It does not lift them both together. Let me give you some data which I found to be stunning. The Family and Medical Leave Commission report, which included notable Members of this Chamber, reported that in order to make up for the money people lost when they took family leave, 28 percent of the families had to borrow money--go further into debt. 
This basically says, if you need to have some time off, you have to go into debt to spend time with your family. We should not try to force people into financial crisis. As a matter of fact, 10.4 percent of the families who took family and medical leave had to go on welfare in order to accommodate the needs that arose from the lack of resources when they took family and medical leave. And this is stunning, 42 percent--41.9 percent; let me not overstate it--41.9 percent had to put off paying bills. 
I don't know about most folks, but if I have to put off paying a bill, that is a matter of serious tension. If you have to go on welfare just to make up for your family and medical leave that you took for your time off, that is a matter of serious tension. Or if you have to go into debt, 28.1 percent had to borrow money under the family and medical leave provisions in order to meet the needs of their family. That is serious tension. 
I think it would be far better if, instead of asking people to take a pay cut, which you have to do in order to address the needs of your family under family and medical leave, that you should allow us to have flexible working arrangements where you might have 
compensatory time off as a result of overtime you have worked or you have a flexible working schedule that you have designed. 
Well, the provisions in this bill are not the kinds of things that are new or novel or have not been tested. Since 1945, comptime has been available to Federal workers. We have seen how it works. Since 1985, it has been available to State and local workers. We know how it works. And we have designed a superior product with more choices for workers in this amendment than are existent for Federal workers and for State and local workers who like the program. It seems like common sense. 
We offered this during the 104th Congress, the Work and Family Integration Act. It was selected as one of the top 10 agenda items on the Republican side of the Senate for the 105th Congress. This past summer the bill was filibustered by the other side of the aisle. 
Yesterday, there was a lot of talk in this Chamber about having time for debate, having time for amendments, and the need to have amendments and debate. Well, you know, last year we brought up the Family Friendly Workplace Act. There was not a single amendment brought forward by the individuals who opposed this on the other side of the aisle. Not one amendment came to the floor, and yet they would not let us vote. They talked and talked and talked. I stood on this floor and encouraged them to offer amendments to address their concerns. I encouraged them to offer these amendments so the issues could be resolved--so we could end up with a product they could support. Not one amendment was offered. 
We did fail to get two cloture votes while I, along with many other Republicans, stood on the floor and asked for our colleagues on the other side of the aisle to offer their amendments. They simply were not forthcoming. We even had Republican Members come down to offer our own amendments to address some of their concerns. But we were unable to because Democrats were stonewalling the issue. 
Eventually President Clinton rhetorically supported comptime. He even spoke to me personally about it. The very day of the last failed cloture vote, I was told that flextime is the most important thing we could do for American families by the President himself. But when we tried to begin negotiations, it became a series of unreturned phone calls while making continued statements to the press of the importance of flextime and their desire to compromise--but no real negotiations. 
Not only did I try to get the White House to sit down and talk, so did the chairman of the Labor Committee and Congressman Ballenger, the sponsor of the House comptime bill. We were told, `Wait until we finish the budget,' and then `Wait until the fast track vote,' and wait and wait and wait. 
I am reminded of the old saying in the Ozarks, `Wait is what broke the bridge down.' I think the bridge collapsed under the waiting of the bridge. We are still waiting. 
Well, we will not wait idly by while millions of Americans are denied the ability to balance their work and family demands. This is something the American people deserve. This is something that is essential to the survival of our culture. We must respect our families. We must give them the opportunity to survive, and we must have a competitive and productive work force. And there are ways for this to happen. We must harmonize these values. They must work together in cooperation. They cannot work antagonistically in conflict. 
This is an issue that the Democrats in Congress and the President will not be able to make disappear. I will continue to bring this issue up at every opportunity. We have been accused of being unwilling to compromise. Well, we have made changes in the bill to try to address concerns that have been raised. 
We added bankruptcy protections to ensure that employees will be able to collect accumulated comptime if their employer declares bankruptcy. We limited the number of hours that an employee can accrue from 240 hours to 160 to make sure that a person does not 
get too many hours of comptime out there and somehow it might not be fulfilled. 
We have put a sunset provision on the bill saying, look, we are only trying it for 5 years. Let the American people find out about it. If it is abusive to the workers, it will be over in 5 years. It will not be abusive. If this was an abuse of workers, they would have curtailed it after 5 years in 1950, from the time it started in 1945; or for State and local workers in 1990, after it was started in 1985. 
We completely eliminated the flexible credit hour provisions of the bill so that we are just talking about flexible scheduling. This amendment only permits workers to move 10 hours from one week to the next, but that would provide a basis for a day off every other week. 
We will find out who really supports giving workers the flexible work schedules that workers desperately need. We will do so by asking that this bill move forward. We will find out who believes that it is appropriate for Government to allow flexible work schedules for their own employees and for salaried workers but not for laborers, those who have built this great Nation. Everybody has flexible work time. All the Government does, all the salaried workers. The boardroom has it, the people on salary. 
Local and State governments have it. But who doesn't have it? Hourly workers in America, the people who built this country. They are in the minority now. They don't have it. I believe it is time for them to have this same kind of capacity to be with their families the way others have found it to be with theirs. We also will find out who really cares about women's positions in the workplace. 
It is interesting to note that Working Woman Magazine says this:  
Poll after poll shows that Americans want to spend time with their families and cite flexible scheduling as a top priority. . . . Give women what they want, not what you (Members of Congress) think they need. 
That is what Working Woman Magazine said. This is a fight that must be continued. I believe that this is a fight that should be continued for the hourly workers of America, who don't happen to be Federal workers, who don't happen to be State workers, who don't happen to be local government workers, who don't happen to be salaried workers, who don't happen to inhabit the walnut-paneled boardrooms of America, but do happen to have families and do happen to have the same kinds of needs. 
President Clinton and the Democratic platform have all endorsed flextime as a way to help Americans balance the needs of work and family. It is time for that endorsement to become a reality. It is time for Congress to stop ignoring the serious challenges that are facing families in today's workplace and give American workers what they want and need. 
This issue will not go away. This issue of giving working Americans the ability to balance work and family must be addressed. I am not going to tie up this supplemental appropriations bill with this amendment at this time. But I lay this before the Congress as a clear signal and indication that this is a must-address issue. I will bring this issue back to the floor on an insistent basis. While we are meeting the emergency needs of Government, we cannot continue to ignore the needs, emergency needs, of families and of the American work force, particularly those who have built this Nation as hourly workers. 
So I will withdraw my amendment at this time. I will indicate that this is a must-address issue, but I will not allow it to foreclose or preclude or otherwise impair our ability to address the emergency needs of troops that are deployed by this country overseas. But I will say that neither will I allow this body to ignore this issue and thereby ignore the needs of American families, just as we are not going to ignore the needs of the American Government. 
Mr. President, I ask for the opportunity to withdraw my amendment.

Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, thank you very much. I am pleased to have this opportunity today. We are speaking about a supplemental appropriations measure that relates to emergencies, about the needs that individuals in Government have. I would like to talk about emergencies that relate to the needs of America's families. Frankly, I want to talk about how we value women in our culture. 
Over the last 2 months, our sensibilities have been assaulted with the national debate on the President's behavior toward women in the workplace. I am worried that this preoccupation with the President's alleged sexual advances in the workplace is taking the focus off the real concerns of working women everywhere. 
Working men and women face a unique challenge in the workplace. Not only must they navigate the choppy waters of sexual politics in their own jobs, but at the end of the work day, they head home to their second full-time jobs as moms and dads. 
Working moms wake up each morning, hustle to ensure that the toddler is bathed, changed, fed and dressed, all the while keeping track of the 7-year-old or 4-year-old or a 3-year-old, doublechecking homework, packing lunch. With all these balls in the air, working moms must then get dressed and head off to the workplace, stopping to drop off the youngest at grandma's or at preschool. Then it begins again after 8 hours on the job. 
These are monumental challenges that America's supermoms meet and beat every day. Yet, we in Congress have been unable to extend to working moms and dads an invaluable option for the workplace. For 2 years, the Senate has debated and declined to pass flexible work arrangements that would grant these working moms and dads and all workers the freedom to adjust their work schedules to meet the needs of their families. Flexible working arrangements could allow a mom to leave work early on a Friday when the nurse at the first grader's school calls to ask that the child be taken home. That mom could take that afternoon off and make up the missed hours the following Monday, or any day that next week, without suffering a loss of pay. 
This is currently illegal under today's outdated labor laws, and we find that America's families are in a state of real need. And while we are looking to meet the needs of Government, 
I think it is appropriate that we work as well to meet the needs of America's families. I think it is time that we fix this absurd result in the law. 
I send an amendment to the desk and ask for its immediate consideration.

Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, in today's fast-paced, information-based society, the rigid and inflexible provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act have paralyzed those whom it was meant to help. It is interesting to note what Franklin Delano Roosevelt's words were: `Those who toil in factory and on farm to obtain a fair day's work' were to be the focal point of the Fair Labor Standards Act. 
That Fair Labor Standards Act now deprives employees of the right to structure their daily lives on and off the job to meet the responsibilities they have both at work and at home. It is not the employer who holds the employee in this Catch-22. It is, however, the Government. Inside-the-beltway elitists who think they know best continue to deprive America's working families of the right to make decisions which employees think meet their circumstances best. 
The charge to America's lawmakers now and into the next century is to restructure the rules regulating the workplace to help increase long-term productivity. How do we build a workplace for the next century rather than try to recreate the workplace of the last century? How do we reflect the needs of the American family as it currently exists, rather than try to impose upon the American family, as it currently exists, the laws which were shaped 70 years ago to deal with families as they then existed? 
The days are past when the Federal Government can treat employment policy and employee productivity as if they were wholly unrelated. Our ability to compete in an international marketplace of intense competition is going to be largely dependent on our ability to provide for workers an accommodating, comfortable work environment where they can both meet the demands of the workplace and the marketplace and also meet the very compelling demands of their families. 
I just might add that not only is this an issue of economic productivity, in terms of this ability to sort of boost production and boost moral and boost the sense in which individuals are able to work effectively; this is a matter that relates to whether or not the most fundamental unit of American culture, the family, can be successful, or whether we are going to make it impossible, whether our Government will be at war with the values of American families. 
I don't think there are very many people anyplace in this culture who wouldn't underscore the fact that when moms and dads can spend time with their kids that those kids do better, that we build a strong future. 
And yet we have to make sure that our culture does not have rules and regulations which make it impossible for moms and dads to accommodate the needs of the youngsters. 
As Washington's establishment clings to the workplace policies of the 1930s, which assume employer-employee relationships that are always adversarial, we have to make sure that Government itself does not become adversarial to the fundamental values of American culture and American life. Prime among those values is the value we place on families. And essential to that value on families is the ability of moms and dads to find time to spend with their children. 
The law has assumed for too long that if something is good for the employer, it is bad for the employee. And if it is good for the employee, it must be bad for the employer. That cannot be so. We will not succeed in the marketplace of the next century assuming that we must always fight, that we must always be antagonistic or we cannot be successful. As a matter of fact, we know that the real key to success is teamwork, employers and employees working together, accommodating each other's needs, making sure that what is good for one is good for the other. We have a great opportunity to do that by giving employers and employees the opportunity to have adjustable work schedules and to allow for moms and dads not only to meet the demands of the workplace, but allow them to accommodate the needs of their families. 
America's employers have found that this adversarial basis for writing the employment law, which happened to have characterized the way it was written in the 1930s, is counterproductive and it hurts our competitiveness. However, our companies are managing within the narrow constraints of the Federal law to establish progressive employment practices in cooperation with their employees. 
Employees are becoming owners of their companies through employee stock option plans, and profit-sharing incentives are on the rise. The benefit of giving employees greater input in their decisionmaking processes is making command and control style situations far less acceptable. So what we have to do really is to find a way to accommodate these competing demands of the home place and the workplace if we are going to be successful. 
Let me just stop for a moment to give some data about the difference between the family as it was and family as it is. 
First of all, back in the 1930s, when we originally crafted our Fair Labor Standards Act, about one out of every six or seven --about 16 percent--of the moms of school-aged children were in the work force. That means that five out of six--or six out of seven--were in the home place. And so the need for flexible working arrangements was not the same as it is now. 
There has been a virtual sea change in the work dynamic in America in the way in which the work force is configured. Very frankly, now, instead of one out of six or one out of seven being moms of school-aged children who are in the workplace, now four out of five moms of school-aged children are in the workplace. So that the vast majority of moms of school-aged children are working as opposed to the vast majority in the 1930s not working. And this means that our needs are different. It means that it is impossible for us to get the same kind of return on a legal system which no longer provides a basis for meeting the needs of the culture since the culture's needs are vastly different. 
There are some companies that are going to very significant ends to try to help their employees, companies like TRW, Eastman Kodak, Computer Sciences Corporation, the insurance company Mass Mutual. They are finding ways to make their employees' lives better by offering what they can in terms of flexible working arrangements. 
However, the Federal law limits the extent to which they can offer these benefits. I might just add that these companies are trying--they are trying--to match what is available in the Federal system for Federal employees. They are trying in many ways to match what is available at the State system for State employees. But they cannot because they are prevented by the law. 
They have sought to provide flexible working arrangements, but if you are trying to have flexible working hours, it has to be within a week. There can be no change that goes over from one week to another in the employment week. That means generally that if you need to make up an hour that you want to miss on Friday afternoon, you cannot make it up on the next Monday unless you are a Federal Government employee. 
Oddly enough, the Federal workers have had that privilege since 1978. And what is interesting about it is that Federal workers have had it not only since 1978, but it has been vastly successful. When the General Accounting Office, for example, decided to inventory the extent to which individuals in the Federal system respond constructively to flexible working times, they found that 9 out of 10 Federal workers who had an opinion on flextime said that it was good--it was very good--9 out of 10. It is very hard to find 9 out of 10 Federal workers who will agree on virtually anything. So the Federal Government workers find that it is a very good way to try to meet the competing demands of the home place and the workplace. 
And secondly, not only is flextime highly regarded in the Federal system, but comptime is the ability to say, look, I have worked a little overtime, instead of paying me time and a half for that overtime, will you give me time and a half off at another time so I can spend time with my family? That is a very popular program with Federal workers. So popular was that with workers at the Federal level that it has been extended, that capacity to be involved in that kind of operation has been extended to other Government workers, particularly at the State and local level. 
So we have a real interesting situation where the universe of workers is not treated fairly or equally. Governmental workers had the opportunity for flextime and comptime. Both at the State level they have comptime, and at the Federal level they have comptime. They have flexible working arrangements at the Federal level. They simply do not in the private sector. No comptime in the private sector. It is against the law to have comptime in the private sector, and when it goes from one week to the next. 
These kinds of privileges, these kinds of opportunities really would make it a lot easier on our families. They would give parents the ability to go and attend to a sick child. They would give parents the ability to attend events where children are being honored or children are performing. They would frequently give the opportunity to individuals who had built up some comptime to take some time off, perhaps extend a vacation or provide for a 3-day weekend without sacrificing their salaries. 
This benefit, which is available to Government workers in 
virtually every level, is not available to workers in the private sector who are paid by the hour. But interestingly enough, salaried workers have pretty much had the ability to have flexible working arrangements for quite some time. 
The salaried worker takes a 2-hour lunch break to take care of personal business or leaves early to go to a child's soccer game. The hourly worker who sits beside the salaried worker is tied to his or her desk and has to deprive his or her family of that same kind of attention. Now, this result is not due to their employers being unwilling to help. This result is due to the Federal Government's policy--our law under the Fair Labor Standards Act--which makes flexible working arrangements and comptime for private-sector workers illegal. 
Some of these hourly workers have come to Washington to tell their stories about how Federal policies impact their everyday lives. 
One of those individuals I remember who came was Arlyce Robinson. She was a worker who had a great story to tell about working on an hourly basis, and the snow storm that hit the town, hit Washington, DC, as a matter of fact. They had to send workers home, and said, you can't work--well, they closed the offices for a day. The workers wanted to make up that day in the next week. But in order to make up that day in the next week, those 8 hours which they missed, those hours would have had to have been paid as overtime. 
The employer could not afford to have a 50 percent increase in his labor costs for that time, so those workers simply were unable to make that time up the next week. That is a serious problem for individuals who are on that kind of a schedule and who are not on salary but are on an hourly wage. 
Leslie Langford is a secretary at Mass Mutual in Springfield, MA. Her husband is a printer. They have a son who has just had his first birthday and a daughter about 6 years old. She put it this way:  
I've been an hourly employee with Mass Mutual for 14 years. As a full-time employee and mother of two young children, including a child just over a year old, it is one of the most valuable commodities in my life. And I can't afford to waste any of my time, like many of you. 
She says: 
I find it a challenge to juggle the needs of my employer and my family. 
She wants to have the ability to have comptime and flextime in the private sector. She put it this way: 
Family-friendly legislation such as this is not only desperately needed but long overdue in this country to benefit working parents and their children. 
So you have situations where individuals who work by the hour simply are not allowed by the law to cooperate with their employers to develop work schedules which will accommodate the competing needs of the home place and the workplace. As a result, families suffer. 
Now, as I mentioned, salaried workers frequently get flexible schedules because salaried workers do not punch the clock. The boardroom and the managers have flexible schedules in that respect. Government employees have flexible schedules because they have the authority under the Federal Government. In 1978, Congress recognized the benefit of flexible working arrangements and passed the Federal Employees Flexible and Compressed Work Schedules Act. And the Senator from Alaska, 
Senator Stevens, was the Senator who helped shepherd that act into existence. 
That act allowed the Federal Government employees to experiment with flexible work schedules, which are still illegal in the private sector. The program allows hourly workers to work an extra hour one week in order to work an hour less the next week. As a matter of fact, it goes beyond that. Sometimes people work 45 hours one week, so they only have to work 35 hours the next week. By doing so, they can arrange their time so they have every other Friday off. There are lots of parents who would like to have the capacity to take every other Friday off or a weekday off every other week. 
These authorities, which make it possible for Federal employees to have flexible work schedules, are specific in the law to Government employees alone. And the law forbids private workers to have the same kind of situation. I know of one family in my home State of Missouri, a family in the St. Louis area where there is a Federal worker--one of the spouses is a Federal worker--the other is a private sector worker. One has the privilege of flexible working arrangements, the other does not. The disparity is stark. And the burden inordinately falls on the worker who has the flexible work capacity because of the ability of that worker to get flexibility in the area of governmental work. But I do not think you should have to work for the Government or should have to be a salaried worker in the management pool in order to be able to be a good mom or dad. You should be able to do it because our Government should not be at war with the values of this culture. 
Our Government should be reinforcing the values of the American culture and strengthening our families--not attacking them. And a failure on the part of Government to allow for flexible working arrangements, a failure on the part of Government to allow people to work with their employees to have family-friendly working arrangements, is simply a way for Government to attack our values rather than to underscore our values. 
As a matter of fact, it was as far back as 1945 that Congress recognized that when an employee paid by the hour works overtime hours, that monetary compensation does not always make up for the time that the worker misses with his or her family. 
Now, flexible work arrangements, which I have mentioned, the ability to assign work from one week to next week, to take fewer hours of work in one week and take more hours in the next week, that is a very popular program in the Federal Government. That is flextime. 
The compensatory time is simply when you are being asked to work overtime, you have the right to request that some of what you do by way of overtime be reflected not in additional salary but you can take some time off. 
The overtime rules in our culture generally are, when you are asked to work overtime, you get time and a half. But some people realize no matter how much time and a half they get paid, that doesn't help them get more time with their families. So occasionally they say, `Instead of paying time and a half, will you give me time and a half off instead of the payment, so instead of me working the full week next week, I could take time and a half off in those hours; I would still be paid as if I worked a full week, but I get the time off to be with my family.' 
Now, that became a possibility in the Federal Government system back in 1945. In that recognition, Congress amended the Federal Employee Pay Act to allow the Federal Government employees the choice of being compensated for overtime work with either money or time. Of course, in 1985--it took 40 years--the Congress gave this same choice to State and local employees, the ability of an employee to say, `I would like to have some time off; instead of being paid time and a half, how about time and a half off in the next pay period or at some time down the road.' 
Time can be more valuable than money, and certainly when it relates to our families that can be true. That has never been more true than it is today. Yet some Members of Congress continue to fight giving the same rights to private-sector employees. A Family Friendly Workplace Act would give hourly workers this same choice. 
President Clinton recognized the benefits of flexible work schedules when he directed the use of flexible working arrangements for executive branch employees. On July 11 of 1994, the President of the United States, President Clinton, said, `Broad use of flexible work arrangements to enable Federal employees to better balance their work and family responsibilities can increase employee effectiveness and job satisfaction, while decreasing turnover rates and absenteeism.' The President has clearly recognized the value of flexible working arrangements with an Executive order. He states that the broad use--broad use, not narrow use--of these arrangements to allow workers to come to agreement with their employers is where we can find win-win situations--better for the worker, better for the employer. 
What does he say is the consequence? Better balance of their work and family responsibilities--I underscore that; thank goodness the President believes in that and cares about it--and he says increased employee effectiveness and job satisfaction. Wait a second, here is job satisfaction and effectiveness, boosting productivity, and on the other hand we have a win-win situation for the employees, with better service for their family. 
This is not the old antagonism of, `It can't be good for the employer unless it is bad for the employee,' or saying, `It can't be good for the employee unless it is bad for the employer.' No; this is an opportunity to move forward in labor policy as saying yes, let's make it good for the employee and also make it good for the employer; let's authorize people to cooperate and authorize them to act as a team and to improve their performance. 
Unfortunately, though, private-sector employees are denied this same right. As I indicated before, salaried people have it; Government people have it, at the State and local level; the boardroom has it. But individuals working by the hour are a 
minority, frankly, of individuals working in America now. When you consider Government workers and salaried workers, you get individuals working by the hour. Our labor law of the 1930s prevents them from having this benefit. It makes illegal the opportunity of these individuals to collaborate, to confer with, to cooperate with their employers to be able to serve their families more effectively. 
If everyone agrees that flexibility is good for Federal Government employees, for salaried workers, everybody appears to say it works for salaried people, for America's boardrooms, why is the group of hard-working Americans, the hourly-paid individuals, why are they being discriminated against? Why can't they have this? The laborers of this Nation--stock clerks, mechanics, factory workers, clerical workers, store clerks, baggage handlers, gas station attendants--the list goes on and on--people who actually serve America, who build America, who make it possible for this country to run, why is it that they are discriminated against by having a law prohibiting flexible working arrangements and prohibiting compensatory time arrangements? 
Because Congress has decided that they cannot make these decisions for themselves; is that it? Is it that the Congress feels the backbone of the Nation doesn't have the requisite intellect to figure out whether they would be better served by time and a half off instead of time-and-a-half pay? That somehow these private sector workers who work by the hour are not as bright as the Government workers who work by the hour and therefore don't have the capacity to make these judgments? Surely that can't be the case. I know that it is not the case. 
Frequently during my opportunity to return to my home State, I spend time working in jobs in a variety of settings. I have sacked groceries, I have sacked seed corn, I have worked to manufacture windows, I have worked in a whole variety of settings, and I have learned one thing--that the American people are bright people. They know whether they need time off. They know whether they would rather have time with their families or overtime pay, and they would, by far, appreciate the opportunity to be able to cooperate so that they could make that choice. The poll data on this issue bears that out. The American people do not believe that Government should prohibit them from making these kinds of decisions and choices. As a matter of fact, they think that big Government, which would prohibit that kind of awareness and activity, is sad and that it deprives them of their ability to serve their family. 
Now the Family Friendly Workplace Act is an act that is designed to correct the inequity. It recognizes that hourly workers, the people who build America, should have the opportunity to cooperate with their employers to work out arrangements, to help those hourly workers find time to balance the demands of the family and the workplace. The legislation will drag the Fair Labor Standards Act into the realities of the working family of the 1990s instead of the 1930s. 
The bill would permit the fair labor standards rigid 40-hour maximum workweek schedule to be modified only if consented to by the employee. This is important. There are those who say we can't really expect this to be a fair situation and this will be an abused situation. These provisions in the law that we are promoting in the Family Friendly Workplace Act will double the penalties that would normally come from overtime violations. They will strengthen the hands of the worker to be 
treated fairly. These will not provide a place where the worker is in jeopardy. They will provide an opportunity for the worker to make good decisions. I believe it is important for us to make sure that we have those protections. 
Under the law as proposed, we have strengthened substantially any penalty for an abusive corporation, any penalty for an employer that says that the worker must work overtime and not be compensated. There are a number of safeguards. Let me say this, the law provides this is at the option of the worker. So if the worker says, `I would like to take time and a half off down the road, instead of having time-and-a-half pay, I would like to be able to do that,' that gives the worker that option. But in order to protect the worker in that option, we have made it possible that any time after that decision is made the worker is eligible to change his or her mind. So immediately, the next week, 2 weeks later, or any time prior to taking the time and a half off, the worker is able to say, `Cash me out, I want the money.' This is a little bit of a burden on the employer, because the employer can't count on not having to pay the money. The employer will have to maintain a readiness to cash it out if it is overtime that was worked for pay instead of work for compensatory time. But employers are willing to do this. Employers are also willing to provide this option because they want to help workers meet these needs. 
So there is a safeguard in the bill that it gives the worker the right to cash it out at any time. It also provides that at the end of the year, if there is a great accumulation or if there is any accumulation of compensatory time, the time is cashed out so that the money is given. This is designed to make it so that there aren't inordinate opportunities or accumulations of compensatory time that are never paid off. As a matter of fact the company will have to pay at the end of every year, any unused compensatory time. 
So you have the ability of the worker to cash in the compensatory time at any time. You have the requirement that the company pay off the compensatory time at the end of the year. You have elevated penalties--basically, double the normal penalties--in the event there is any abuse here. And I think you get the message that the Family Friendly Workplace Act is designed to be friendly to families but it is not designed to force families into any kind of a situation that they would not otherwise be involved in. They don't have to take overtime as time off. They can take overtime as pay, and that option enures to them any time prior to taking it as time off. Of course, you couldn't take the time off and then demand to be paid for it. Obviously, that would be inappropriate. 
The most successful corporations in America reflect the new realities of American life. They are decentralized, flexible, they are nonhierarchical. Meanwhile, our workplace laws for the private sector are, unfortunately, stuck in a time warp of centralized, hierarchal, one size, so-called, fits all, and we found out that one size fits none. America understands that there isn't any single way things are done for everyone. We need flexibility. We need to be able to accommodate different appeals, different needs, different styles of living, kinds of living. 
I think we need to be able to accommodate individuals in this respect. Congress has ignored the realities faced in the workplace and families too long. American workers need the Government to get out of the way so that Americans can work in 
partnership with and in cooperation with their employers, not just against their employers. That is what will characterize America in the next century, if we are successful. 
Now, I believe it is essential that we act on flextime and comptime this year. The American people, at about 80 percent of the people, believe this is something we ought to do. This has been delayed over and over again. The Democrats delayed this benefit on a number of occasions last year, and today there were individuals from the other side of the floor saying how they want to debate, want to be able to bring amendments to the floor. 
In our last effort to bring this to the floor, we brought it to the floor and those on the other side of the aisle would not bring any amendments. They would not allow us to go to a vote. They would not bring amendments. They would just talk because they were not interested in amendments. They were not interested in negotiations. There were no serious negotiations. They were just interested in stalling. They were just interested in filibustering. They were just interested in prohibiting the American people from having these kinds of flexible, working arrangements at the salaried-worker level. Now we know they can't stop them from having them at the hourly level. They can't stop them at the salaried-worker level. They already have those arrangements. We know Government workers have these arrangements already, too. 
Today we heard a lot of speeches about how we need to debate openly and bring amendments to the floor, how we need to make sure that there is lots of discussion and we get votes on a variety of things. I think that is an important concept that I would like to see honored as it relates to this agenda for the American people. We are going to debate and act on flextime this year. I can indicate with a relatively high degree of confidence that this is a Senator who is going to do everything possible to make sure that we get that done. I think it is important, because it is an agenda that is important to the American people. 
There will be those who talk about other ways to try and help the American people. I know last year they said what we really need is a different plan for more medical and family leave. The family and medical leave provisions in the law now which allow a worker to say to the employer, `I've got a sickness in the family and I'm going to take time to leave for that sickness,' that allows a person to leave the workplace, but a person that leaves under family and medical leave law, when they leave, their pay stops. 
So in order to be a good parent under the Family and Medical Leave Act, you have to take a pay cut. Any time you leave under that particular law, your pay terminates. 
Now, what we are looking for, I think what is very important, is in the area of flextime and comptime people don't have to take a pay cut in order to be a good parent. They can meet the needs of the home place and leave the working place, because they have built up some comptime or they have flexible working arrangements and they don't have to take a pay cut to do it. 
Now, it seems to me that there is a real problem in saying that the solution to the country's distress is making people take pay cuts in order to be a good mom or dad. Most of the time when you have both people in the work force, it is because they need the money. If you just read the Washington Post, I 
believe from this past Sunday, there is a big feature that indicates people have both breadwinners in the workplace because they can't make ends meet without both of them working there. And to tell them, if you want to be a good parent, you can just take a pay cut and do so under an expanded Family and Medical Leave approach is foolhardy. 
Look what happens to people when they are involved in the Family and Medical Leave Act. Leave-takers, according to a Government study here--and this was a study that was populated by Members of the Senate and overseen by a variety of Government individuals--people lose wages when they take medical leave. Here is how they have to make up for what they have done: 
28.1 percent of the people had to borrow money to make up for the wages they lost in medical leave. Well, let's not force them to do that. Let's give them the opportunity to have flexible working arrangements, to get some comptime built up, or to work flexible working hours. 
10.4 percent of the people who took medical leave had to go on public assistance in order to make ends meet. I don't think that's the way we want to have people accommodate the needs of their families, by going on public assistance. 
41.9 percent of the individuals who went on family and medical leave had to stop paying their bills because, in order to take leave, they had to stop getting their paychecks. 
Now, it seems to me that we have a real choice here. Family and medical leave says if you want to serve your family, yes, you can take time off, but you have to lose your income, you have to take a pay cut when you take time off. But with the Family Friendly Workplace Act, with flexible and compensatory time available to individuals, you don't have to take a pay cut. You are able to build up some time by having compensatory time available, and when the time comes that you need to take some time off, you can do it without taking the pay cut. I think if it kept 28.1 percent of the people doing it from having to borrow money, or another 10.4 percent from going on welfare, or 41.9 percent from putting off bills, not paying their bills, when you put those numbers together, there is a tremendous group of individuals who find themselves severely stressed, borrowing money, going on welfare, not paying their bills. Those are the kinds of things we don't want to add, in terms of stress, to the American family. 
If you said to people that in order to be a good mom or dad, you have to go on welfare, I think we would say that is an affront to the dignity of the American worker, that is an assault on the value of work, that is an assault on the character of what it means to be an American or to be productive. Or if we said that in order to be a good mom or dad and take some time off, you have to stiff your creditors 42 percent of the time, you have to stop paying your bills, the American people don't want to do that. They should not want to do that. Or that you have to go to a bank or a loan company to borrow money, run up your credit card debt, and pay outrageous interest in order to be able to accommodate a sick child or witness your child's participation in the school play. 
The American people don't think they ought to have to take these kinds of pay cuts, borrow money, go on public assistance, or put off paying their bills. That is why, at an amazing rate, they indicate their preference is not to have this kind of mandated pay cut, but to have family-friendly workplace arrangements that allow hourly workers to have the same kind of benefits that salaried workers already have, that allow hourly workers to enjoy the same kind of benefits that are enjoyed by people in the boardroom, that allow hourly workers in the private sector to have the same kind of benefits that salaried workers in the private sector have and the same kind of benefits hourly workers have had in Government. 
Comptime has been available at the Federal Government level since 1945. Comptime has been available for State and local governments since 1985. Flexible working arrangements have been available for individuals in the Federal Government since 1978. That is when we began the program. The President of the United States lauded the program officially and extended it by Executive order in the mid-1990s to Government workers, and it is time to say, wait a second, we really can't afford to have this second-class group of citizens that we will call hourly workers in America. They are not the Government workers, they are not salaried workers, and they are not boardroom workers; they are just hourly workers. We can't afford to give them a lower standard. We should not be saying to them: You can't have the same kind of benefit for a win-win situation. You can't cooperate with your employer. You can't make it possible for your family to endure some of the struggles you endure without going into debt, on welfare, or not paying your creditors. We don't want you to have that kind of potential. 
I think we ought to extend the potential of family-friendly, flexible workplace opportunities, including comptime, to all the families of America. As I indicated earlier, this is not the first time this subject has been debated in the U.S. Congress. This subject has been debated on a couple of occasions. But in no circumstance have individuals on the other side of the aisle been willing to go to a vote in this matter. While earlier today there was quite a discussion about the need to go to a vote and to have amendments, when this issue was brought up previously, there was not a single individual who brought an amendment to the floor to add to this legislation. For days, we talked about this legislation, but no one would bring an amendment. It wasn't because there was an agreement with the legislation; it was merely a way to try to keep us from voting, which they were successful in doing, by stonewalling. Now, the American working people should not be stonewalled. The working arrangements of the 1930s simply do not fit the families of the 1990s. We have in many, many families both parents in the workplace, and we need the flexibility to get the job done well. 
Here is a letter from a security guard who occasionally gets overtime:  
The federal government should do everything it can to promote family life, particularly since both parents typically work in today's world. 
Given the choice, which the Family Friendly Workplace Act allows, parents would have the ability to be with their kids on occasions when current guidelines prohibit. In my case, my job as a security guard occasionally calls for overtime. Under this legislation, I would be allowed the choice to receive pay or to be more involved in coaching, attending school events and other general activities my kids are involved with. 
Our government serves people in many ways, but there is no better way to serve than building strong families, which the Family Friendly Workplace Act obviously seeks to accomplish. 
There is a security guard that I think feels capable of making judgments about whether or not he wants to be paid for all of his overtime, or whether he would like to be able to opt to have some time off. I am just delighted that there are moms and dads in America that would like to be more involved in coaching, attending school events, and other general activities with kids. Yet, our Government is keeping that from happening. 
Here is a letter from a 29-year-old working mother:  
I am a 29 year old working mother. I have a two-year-old daughter and am pregnant and due. . . . 
I recently heard about your Family Friendly Workplace Act. Under the current law, the law firm in which I am employed does not allow me to have a flexible work schedule. 
No wonder it doesn't; the law doesn't allow it. 
In my current condition, I need to be able to take off for doctor appointments. Due to the fact that I have a complication in my pregnancy, I have more appointments than average. If I was able to take time in one week and work more the next, it would be very helpful to me and other mothers. . . 
My two-year-old daughter is healthy, but there are some days when she needs extra attention and some days that she is sick. Some days she is just two! 
Those of us who are parents are familiar with kids that are `just two.' 
If I was able to take the time I needed for some mornings and make it up the next week, it would make my life much easier. 
Well, these letters are just a few. As we debate these issues during this session and over the next few days or as we approach voting on this particular measure, I would just say that it is fundamentally important for us to recognize the need to provide America's working families with the same kind of advantage, with flexible time, which American families that work for Government have. If it's good enough for Government workers, it is good enough for private workers. If Government workers are smart enough to know when they want comptime as compared to pay and are able to figure that out and when they 
would like to be able to rearrange their schedules to be involved with their children, I firmly believe that private workers have the same kind of intelligence and capacity. I think it is incumbent upon those of us in Government to make sure that we begin to legislate policy which is consistent with the principles of America and the principle of strong families, which is one we ought to be careful to understand and reinforce. 
So I think we are going to have a great opportunity in this session. I expect that it will be a great opportunity as we legislate in this particular matter. We are going to have the opportunity to provide flextime and comptime to America's private-sector hourly workers. It is a privilege that is understood by the salaried workers in the private sector, understood by both the hourly and salaried workers in Government. Flextime is understood by people in the Federal Government system. Comptime is understood by, and enjoyed by, people in government systems everywhere, State, local and Federal. 
We have delayed this benefit package for too many days. I say `we,' and I have done that to label the U.S. Senate. But the delay has come from the other side of the aisle. No amendments were offered when we brought this up before, but no vote was allowed. It's time that we have serious amendments, serious negotiations, and that we seriously embark upon providing the people of this country with this opportunity to serve their families. 
Today's speeches about how we need to debate openly and bring amendments on a family-friendly agenda could not be more on point. So let's have the debate, let's have the family-friendly agenda, let's have those amendments as it relates to the opportunity for hourly workers in the private sector to be able to spend time with their families as a result of voluntary agreements with their employers, to have flexible working arrangements and compensatory time arrangements similar to those of salaried workers and similar to those of Government workers. 
We are going to debate and act on flextime and comptime this year. I look forward to the debate very much. I am grateful for the opportunity to submit this amendment in this respect. 
Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, tomorrow the Senate will resume consideration of the emergency supplemental appropriations bill with the hope of concluding action on the bill during Tuesday's session. 
As a reminder to all Members, a second cloture vote on H.R. 2646, the Coverdell A+ education bill, was postponed last Friday to occur on Tuesday, March 24, at 5:30 p.m. in an effort to work out an agreement for an orderly handling of the bill. Therefore, a second cloture vote is scheduled to occur on the Coverdell A+ bill on Tuesday at 5:30 p.m. if an agreement cannot be reached in the meantime. In addition, as under the previous consent, all second-degree amendments must be filed by 4:30 p.m. 
Subsequently, Members can anticipate a great deal of action on the supplemental appropriations bill tomorrow as the Senate works through amendments to the legislation. Also, it is hoped progress will be made on the Coverdell education bill during Tuesday's session. In addition, the Senate may consider any executive or legislative items cleared for action.

Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I rise to participate in the debate regarding NATO. 
One of the interesting facts about the debate is that the mission of NATO has not been a matter of significant discussion. 
There are a lot of questions--about the cost of enlargement, the political and strategic benefits to potential new members of NATO, and the effect of any expansion of the NATO alliance on our relationship with Russia--that have all been discussed. These issues have received the most attention. 
But while expansion of NATO numerically is significant, perhaps the mission of NATO deserves serious consideration as we look at an institution which has not only been involved in a long heritage of successful maintenance of the territorial integrity of our comembers of this organization in Europe, but has also been a vital part of protecting American interests. 
NATO has been very successful. Earlier, the Senator from Washington stated that NATO has been the most successful multinational defense organization in the history of the world. And I think that is a fair statement. A major achievement of the organization is the fact that a third world war has not erupted in Europe. It is pretty clear that the Soviet Union, in its days of power and strength, dared not infringe on the territory of those protected by the NATO alliance. That is to the credit of the organization. 
Article 5 of the NATO treaty was the heart of the organization. And I would like to refer the Members of the Senate and those interested in this debate to Article 5 at this time. 
Article 5 States: 
The Parties agree that an armed attack against one or more of them in Europe or North America shall be considered an attack against them all and consequently they agree that, if such an armed attack occurs, each of them, in exercise of the right of individual or collective self-defense recognized by Article 51 of the Charter of the United Nations, will assist the Party or Parties so attacked by taking forthwith, individually and in concert with the other Parties, such action as it deems necessary, including the use of armed force, to restore and maintain the security of the North Atlantic area. 
What the heart of the treaty really designates is that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization was an organization designed to affect and protect the territory--the territorial integrity --of the Nations that were its member states. 
After the collapse of the Soviet Union, we did not have the same kind of threat to the territory of the NATO states that had existed prior to the collapse of the Soviet Union. I think few of us would argue with the proposition that the NATO alliance really was an alliance which drew a bright line to defend against the potential incursion by the Soviet Union. 
Since the Soviet Union collapsed, there has been discussion among NATO planners to find a new mission for the Alliance. Counterproliferation, the advancing of political `interests' of NATO members, peacekeeping, and crisis management became the kinds of issues discussed at NATO--an entirely different mission than it originally had and, frankly, a mission that is not consistent with the charter of NATO itself. 
The assembled NATO powers, in 1991, adopted and promulgated a strategic concept. For the strategic concept of 1991, there was an interesting transition in the statement of what NATO is all about. Collective defense, the concept in Article 5 which has been the central theme and thesis of NATO for its years of great success, was relegated to the bottom of the list of mission priorities. 
As a result of putting collective defense at the bottom, a number of other things were listed as missions of NATO. In some respects, I find these new mission priorities to be challenging because they are not the kinds of things for which NATO was created, and they are not the kinds of missions that the U.S. Senate and its giants in the Senate ratified when ratifying the NATO treaty 50 years ago. 
The `fundamental security task' in the new strategic concept of 1991 was `To provide one of the indispensable foundations for a stable security environment in Europe . . . in which no country would be able to intimidate or coerce any European nation or to impose hegemony through the threat or use of force.' 
This is a major expansion and a substantial change in the mission of NATO. It is a change in the direction in which the organization is headed. It changes NATO's responsibility. Clearly, no longer is NATO for the collective defense of a limited territory. NATO now has the impossible task of stopping intimidation and coercion throughout NATO and non-NATO Europe alike. So the mission of NATO has been transitioning from the mission ratified by the Senate, and it has been evolving, as if treaties are allowed to evolve. It has been organic, rather than static or having specific boundaries. 
The catch phrase that defines this effort is that NATO must `go out of area or go out of business.' This whole concept, I think, demands very close observation. 
Mr. President, I have tried to point out that the objectives specified in the strategic concept of 1991 embraced by the NATO allies is a set of objectives far different from that which the NATO organization was authorized to achieve in its Charter, which was ratified by the U.S. Senate. I believe that NATO was not intended for these new purposes. 
The understanding of the U.S. Senate in 1949, and the understanding of the American people, has been that NATO is designed to protect territory--the territory of member nations--not designed to be on call in other areas in Europe and, as the Secretary of State has mentioned, in Africa and literally to the uttermost parts of the Earth. 
I will be submitting an amendment for consideration by the Senate to make it clear that collective security will remain the heart of NATO, and that this is the only mission allowable under the treaty, because it is impossible to amend the treaty without bringing it back to this Senate for amendment. 
My amendment is tailored not to constrain NATO's effectiveness in the future, nor is it intended to micromanage NATO's military planning from the Senate floor. The central portion of the amendment is taken directly from the North Atlantic Treaty itself. My amendment states that any military operation outside Article V must be based on the principle of collective defense, namely, the territorial integrity, political independence, or security of a NATO member. 
I thank the Senator from Georgia for his agreement in allowing me to finish my remarks.

Mr. ASHCROFT. Madam President, the events surrounding the President of the United States and the White House of the United States find us in a peculiar and uncomfortable situation. It is, however, more than peculiar, and it is more than discomforting. It may, in fact, be disabling. The President has sought to defend his conduct and to defend his circumstance by saying it's OK to be able to become compartmentalized or to segment his personal life from his public life. At least this is the spin which comes from the White House. I perhaps should not say that that comes from the President's own mouth. 
I think the Congress has sort of bought into the compartmentalization of this crisis at the White House. We discuss it on the talk shows, we discuss it in the cloakrooms, but we don't discuss it on the Senate floor. 
The new allegations against President Clinton are grave. They carry serious implications, not just for the President but for the Nation as a whole, and it is time for us to consider them in the U.S. Senate. 
Kathleen Willey is a longtime friend of the President. She was a strong Clinton supporter. She was his employee in the White House. She accused this President of sexual assault just outside the Oval Office and of lying under oath. The President's response has been to tell us only that he is `mystified' and `disappointed.' 
Mystified and disappointed? My thoughts exactly. I am mystified that the President has refused to account fully for his actions and disappointed that President Clinton would sacrifice the Office of the Presidency in order to promote his own personal concerns or save himself. 
Back in January when the Monica Lewinsky scandal erupted, I said if the allegations were true, the President had disgraced himself and his office and should resign. I stand here this afternoon to renew my call. If Mrs. Willey's charges are true, then the President should resign. 
Permit me to make three observations about Mrs. Willey's accusations or charges. 
First, the Willey allegations increase the likelihood that the House will be forced to open impeachment proceedings. The Clinton-Willey conflict brings the murky details of this sordid affair into the light of open day. The President is accused of committing sexual assault and lying under oath. Mrs. Willey and the President have sworn to irreconcilable versions of the facts. These charges are serious, and they must be resolved. They cannot both be telling the truth. And America cannot walk away. 
The Congress, for our part, must have the courage to do what we know to be right. The alleged conduct, if true, I believe constitutes an impeachable offense. Congress should stop looking at the polls and start looking at the Constitution, stop thinking about self-preservation and start thinking about how justice can best be served. Madam President, justice should never be denied simply because it is uncomfortable. 
Second, the White House must drop the myth that the President is not distracted by the maelstrom of allegations which are surrounding him. The President has lost control of his personal legal problems. Let us dispense with the fiction that the President is able to work in `compartments,' all the while hacking and clubbing at Ken Starr and the officials charged with learning the truth. Instead, he has chosen to stonewall. He now stands accused of an impeachable offense by a person who was his friend, political supporter, and employee. 
Here is the truth. It is not possible for the President to do his job while dealing with this tide of accusations and innuendo. No one could do the job well. And neither can he. Already, the Washington Post has reported that the President behaves like a person overtaken with anger at Kenneth Starr. Already, David Broder and other respected commentators have suggested that the growing scandal is damaging the President's ability to lead. 
Finally, President Clinton's moral leadership has been destroyed. It can be regained only if he proves that these charges are false, if he clears the air here, if he makes a complete statement understanding to the American people, and assures them of his situation. 
I had hoped that Bill Clinton would address these charges through a direct and candid accounting to his employers, the American people. But, yes, he did choose to stonewall. He cannot hope to regain his moral authority to lead unless he makes a full and candid accounting to the people, and he does so immediately. It is inevitable that the truth will prevail. And I would prevail on the President to account fully for his actions without further delay. 
A final point. These allegations are serious. They deal with charges of perjury, obstruction of justice, and sexual assault. For Kathleen Willey's sake, conservatives ought not be rejoicing, and we ought not to be laughing. I deeply regret having joked about the Lewinsky affair in remarks that I made earlier. It was inappropriate, and I was wrong. There is nothing funny here. The allegations of Kathleen Willey make clear to all of us that there is nothing funny here. This is not comedy; this is tragedy. 
Mrs. Willey's appearance last night on the CBS program `60 Minutes' I think exposed America to an individual who was vulnerable, who was in distress, who was in need, and trusted the President of the United States. And it is very clear that she thoroughly believes that her trust was betrayed in a substantial and significant way. 
A betrayal of trust by the President of the United States is an important matter, particularly if it relates to the way in which his office is conducted, particularly if it relates to an individual who is particularly vulnerable, an employee, particularly if it relates to an incident that takes place in the context of the White House and the Oval Office. And I found her testimony to be compelling and convincing. I believe it makes, again, the clear case for the necessity of the President to explain fully his situation to the American people.

Mr. ASHCROFT. Madam President, I want to take just a few minutes to speak about the nomination of Frederica Massiah-Jackson to be a U.S. district judge for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, a nomination that was withdrawn earlier today. I think this is the right move at the wrong time. It should have been clear to the administration over a month ago when we debated this nomination on the floor that this individual was not fit to serve as a Federal judge appointed for life. 
At that time, I called for the President to withdraw the nomination. And I am glad that he has finally seen fit to do so, or that the administration finally saw fit to follow that course, although the letter is really a withdrawal request from the nominee herself. I remain troubled that this individual was nominated for a lifetime appointment in the first place, and, once nominated, did not withdraw sooner. 
One enduring lesson of this nomination is that it is critical for the Senate to take its constitutional advice and consent role seriously. We have heard much in recent weeks about the so-called `vacancy crisis' in the Federal courts and that the Senate needs to speed up its processes to give judicial nominees a quick up-or-down vote. Today's action by the administration agreeing to withdraw this nomination demonstrates the danger of worrying more about filling the courts than fulfilling our constitutional obligation to screen judicial nominees. 
Last November, this nomination was on the verge of confirmation. At the end of the last session, there was a tremendous effort to rush a number of nominations, including this one, through the Senate along with others in a series of confirmations at the close of business. I resisted those efforts because I felt this nomination had serious defects that demanded complete examination in the light of day. Once this nominee's record was examined in the open, it became clear--including clear, I think, ultimately to the President--that this nominee was not fit. I also resisted those efforts because law enforcement officials in Philadelphia informed me that they were gathering additional information concerning the nominee. In the light of these concerns, I placed a hold on this nomination, and I refused to lift it despite the insistence of several. 
Some would point to this as an unnecessary delay that has contributed to the so-called `vacancy crisis.' But we would be creating an actual crisis, not solving an imagined one, by giving individuals confirmation when they do not deserve it. We would have been creating, in my judgment, a crisis by confirming Judge Frederica Massiah-Jackson with a lifetime appointment. 
The Senate has a constitutional obligation to give its advice to the President with respect to judicial nominees and, in a case like this, to withhold our consent. I take this responsibility seriously, and we must all take this responsibility seriously, in the light of the nominees the President has sent to the Senate. 
This nominee demonstrates the caliber of nominee the President has sent to the Senate. Notwithstanding his elaborate vetting process and the ABA screening, this is the nominee whom President Clinton chooses for a lifetime appointment. One has to wonder about any vetting process that raises no objections to a nominee like this one. And one has to wonder what kind of evaluation process the American Bar Association conducts that it deems Massiah-Jackson `qualified.' 
But the truth of the matter is this: The Constitution does not give the Justice Department, nor does it give the White House Counsel's Office nor the ABA, a formal screening role in judicial nominations. The Constitution entrusts that to the U.S. Senate. It is an important responsibility. And we would not be taking our constitutional responsibilities seriously if we did not scrutinize nominees, as we have done in this case ultimately. 
The Senate Judiciary Committee has now had its second hearing, and in my judgment, that hearing shed little additional light on this nomination. The hearing did make it clear that Judge Massiah-Jackson was less than forthcoming in her first hearing. It is now clear--as it was last month--that her claim that she had never been reversed in a sentencing appeal is false. It also was evident that she had failed to apprise the committee of other cases in which she had been reversed on appeal. 
Indeed, a number of new cases were raised at the hearing that make it even more obvious that this nomination should be rejected. Case in which child rapists were given light sentences, or where Judge Massiah-Jackson wondered aloud from the bench whether the Commonwealth should have been wasting time and prison space on a defendant who had AIDS. 
But, in general, the nominee's inability to remember key details of cases that had been raised publicly over a month ago--let alone the new cases raised at the hearing--rendered the hearing pointless. 
Judge Massiah-Jackson failed, in my view, to provide compelling answers to the questions raised about her record. As a consequence, it is clearly time for the Senate to stand up and be counted and reject this nomination. 
Nomination fights are not pleasant, but there is a principle worth fighting for here: America deserves better than this. 
This nominee is so far below the minimum quality we should expect from a Federal judge it is tragic. 
The local law enforcement community is horrified that they are about to be saddled with this judge for life. They are concerned that many in Washington seem to be willing to rubber-stamp nominees, no matter how unqualified. 
The thrust of the objections of local law enforcement officials--and the basis of my own opposition--are fourfold. This nominee: has shown disrespect for the court by using the English language's most offensive profanity in open court; has recklessly risked the lives of undercover police officers by disclosing their identity; demonstrated hostility to prosecutors by suppressing evidence and dismissing charges against criminals; and shown leniency to criminals in sentencing violent criminals to probation-only, and using lesser-included offenses to avoid mandatory minimum sentences. 
Philadelphia District Attorney Lynne Abraham, Democrat, at great political cost, came out against the nomination in a letter to Senator Arlen Specter on January 8. Her letter captures the nature of the local law enforcement community's concern. She wrote:  
This nominee's judicial service is replete with instances of demonstrated leniency towards criminals, an adversarial attitude towards police and disrespect toward prosecutors unmatched by any other present or former jurist with whom I am familiar. 
The Senate cannot confirm this nominee in the face of the strong opposition of local law enforcement community. To do so would be the height of arrogance and another example of the `Washington knows best' mentality. 
The American people deserve a better caliber of nominee. This nomination sends the wrong message to criminals, to law enforcement and to victims of crime. The Senate should vote to reject the nominee now.

Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I rise today to address a rather disturbing article that appeared not only in the Washington Times but also in the Washington Post, a similar article. The headline in the Times says: `China in New Nuclear Sales Effort.' The headline in the Post: `U.S. Action Stymied China Sale to Iran.' 
These articles represent a concern of mine, because they detail China's continuing nuclear proliferation, not just nuclear proliferation, but proliferation to the nation of Iran. 
According to these articles, U.S. intelligence discovered secret China-Iran negotiations concerning Chinese transfer of hundreds of tons of anhydrous hydrogen fluoride. Anhydrous hydrogen fluoride is a material used in enriching uranium to weapons grade uranium. 
This transfer was scheduled to go to Iran's Isfahan Nuclear Research Center. The Isfahan Center is the principal site of Iran's efforts to manufacture the explosive core of an atomic device, according to the articles. 
So what we have here, both in the Washington Post and in the Washington Times, is the chronicling of China's effort to send these kinds of components and processes to Iran in order for Iran, a rogue nation, to enhance its capacity to be involved with atomic weapons of mass destruction. 
This revelation of new Chinese efforts to aid Iran's nuclear weapons program is deeply troubling, and it follows solemn commitments from Chinese leaders just last October that China would cut off nuclear assistance to Iran. 
What is more troubling to me, however, is the fact that the Clinton administration has overlooked more than a decade of similar promises that have been broken just as quickly and routinely as last October's promise has now been revealed to have been broken on the face of the front pages of this city's newspapers. 
This continued course by this administration to simply take at face value assurances consistent with other assurances and, unfortunately, consistent with the disregard for those assurances in terms of policy, causes us to question whether or not we should have been racing into these agreements, and particularly according to China the special standing which we have provided to China based on the events of last October. 
It is pretty clear to me that, in spite of the fact that China assured us last October that they were going to be adopting a different posture in regard to nuclear proliferation, their policy and their practice was not altered. Their policy and practice of providing this kind of proliferation to rogue nations remains in place.

Mr. ASHCROFT. Now, this most recent set of incidents, of course, revealed in the Washington Times today, and in the Washington Post as well, and I am sure in other newspapers across the country, was the subject of a special briefing to Members of the U.S. Senate very recently. I was not a part of that briefing and I do not know what was said at the special briefing, but the information that I am including is information from these news sources. I want to make it clear that I would not be breaching any special information provided to the Senate. I was not a party to it. But the information is well known. 
What is perhaps in some measure troubling is that the administration sought to portray this episode with China as a success. They say, `Look what we stopped. Look what we were able to do.' They say that China responded more swiftly to our complaints this time, that when we caught them red-handed in the process of breaking their word, they were more ready to admit they were breaking their word. To hear administration officials talk, the swiftness of China's response to the exposure of their proliferation activity is grounds for disregarding that the administration was hoodwinked by the Chinese all along. 
Well, the inventory since 1981 is sort of the litany, if you will, of the insistent and nagging record of proliferation violation after proliferation violation after proliferation violation upon proliferation violation. These things provided a basis for saying to the administration, we should not trust the Chinese, at least without some record, without some record that proliferation will stop, and yet within days after our CIA labeled the Chinese as the world's worst proliferaters, we in this administration seemed ready to believe their next assurance. And, of course, these newspapers indicate that our belief should have been in their practice and policy of the past, which has been a policy of betrayal and a policy of disregard, not a policy of compliance with agreements relating to nonproliferation of nuclear weapons. 
Who knows what other nuclear assistance projects China has in store with Iran or other rogue regimes. Who knows how many such projects we have not detected, have not called their hand on, have not asked them to stop because we did not know about them. We happen to intercept information here. 
Given China's past proliferation record, and given that the 1997 CIA report that called China--and I quote--`the most significant supplier of weapons of mass destruction-related goods and technology to foreign countries'--that was a quote; the CIA labeled them that less than a year ago--it is pretty clear that people of good sense would say, maybe we ought to ask that they be compliant, maybe we ought to ask that they observe their agreements for at least a short interval before we endow them with our full trust and confidence. 
I opposed President Clinton's decision to begin nuclear cooperation with China based on the CIA report, based on this heritage of denying and breaking these agreements. And now the newspapers of this morning, from both the right and the left, if you will, have said that China was in the process of breaking these agreements currently after China has given its word. 
In order for United States-China nuclear cooperation to proceed, the President certified to Congress that China--and this is what he certified--`is not assisting and will not assist any nonnuclear-weapon state, either directly or indirectly, in acquiring nuclear explosive devices or the material and components for such devices.' 
The President's haste to make this certification seriously undermined U.S. counterproliferation credibility, credibility that would be desperately needed just a few weeks later in a confrontation with Saddam Hussein over the same issue of the threat of weapons of mass destruction--not a unique issue. 
Mr. President, the startling inconsistencies in this administration's policy regarding the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, these inconsistencies are putting the national security of our country at risk. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright talks about NATO's new central mission as combating the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. The United States almost went to war last month in the Persian Gulf over the threat of weapons of mass destruction. 
We still face the prospect of having to use military force to address the threat posed by Saddam Hussein's weapons of mass destruction. And yet, in spite of all this, the administration's rhetoric on counterproliferation--in spite of the continuing object lesson of Saddam Hussein and the threat posed by his terrorist government--the Clinton administration has entered into a nuclear cooperation agreement with China, the world's worst proliferater of weapons of mass destruction. And we know, as of this week, that China is repudiating the basis of those agreements. 
Just as Saddam Hussein has outmaneuvered this administration to keep his weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, China has outmaneuvered this administration to continue to proliferate weapons of mass destruction to Iran. Not only is Beijing continuing to pursue nuclear assistance to Iran, but, according to the CIA, China is a major supplier to Iran of chemical weapons and missiles technology as well. 
I call on the President to put a halt to nuclear cooperation with China. The President, in my opinion, has pursued a policy of blind engagement with the Chinese. It is a policy which disregards the facts, the litany of breaches on the part of the Chinese. It disregards the facts of continuing breaches of their agreements by the Chinese who continue to proliferate weapons of mass destruction. In light of the reports on China's continuation of proliferation activity, the proposed United States-China summit meeting in June should be reconsidered. 
Mr. President, the decision to begin nuclear cooperation with China was a political one. It was driven by the administration's desire to have a `meaningful' meeting, an event strategy. Well, `meaningful' events cannot replace substantive foreign policy. We cannot say in one part of the world to Saddam Hussein, `Well, we'll go to war with you over weapons of mass destruction,' while we are winking at someone else, saying, `Well, it's OK if you continue to break your word and proliferate weapons of mass destruction' to equally dangerous rogue regimes. It undermines America's credibility in combating the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. It is not worth the photo-op that we get from the Chinese by having a summit if we have to destroy our policy and threaten the security of this globe to do it. 
I believe that it is time for us to have a policy, a policy that is unmistakable and clear and a policy that is respected, that weapons of mass destruction are not to be tolerated and that the United States will not extend privileges of nuclear cooperation to those who would take nuclear resources and make them available to rogue nations as weapons of mass destruction.

Mr. ASHCROFT. Madam President, I rise today to talk about the role of government in the technology sector. Two things can be predicted with confidence about congressional meddling in this sector of the economy. First, legislation will be obsolete on the day it is passed. Second, it will hurt consumers, students, teachers, workers, shareholders, and the economy. if Congress had helped set up the automobile industry, there still might be a livery stable in every town, and buggy whip factories in large cities. America's dynamic, world-leading computer industry must be kept free of regulation by slow-moving federal bureaucrats who cannot possibly understand or keep pace with the most dynamic sector of the economy. 
Taken together, these developments highlight the need for Congress to step back and draft with care the necessary legislation to extend copyright protections to those who develop content for the digital age, instead of blindly racing ahead to enact a Clinton Administration proposal supported by major Hollywood interests. 
Consider the consequences. Last year, Americans purchased 11 million PCs and 16.8 million VCRs. This year, another 12.6 million PCs and 16.6 million VCRs are expected to be purchased in the United States. These devices enjoy great popularity. At least one VCR is found in 90 million homes and at least one PC is found in 42 million homes, specifically because of the convenience, entertainment and efficiency they bring. They are popular precisely because they are useful and technologically advanced. Nonetheless, a House subcommittee specifically rejected an amendment that would have assured consumers access to the next generation of these products. 
This isn't the first time someone has tried to stop the advance of new technology. In the mid 1970s, for example, a lawsuit was filed in an effort to block the introduction of the Betamax video recorder. At that time, representatives of Hollywood declared that the VCR would destroy their business. They could not have been more wrong. Last year video tape rentals accounted for a $16 billion portion of the entertainment market. Indeed, people in the movie industry have stated that video sales often make a movie profitable, and some movies are produced exclusively for the home rental market. The movie industry has not learned from history. The same doomsayers are at it again, decrying the lawful use of products by consumers. Their rhetoric has been updated for the digital age, but their message remains the same. 
This is an important debate that is currently taking place in the Congress and that is the discussion regarding how best to update the copyright laws for the digital age. In particular, I want to bring to the attention of my colleagues two significant developments that occurred in the last weeks, and to urge you to join as cosponsors of S. 1146, the Digital Copyright Clarification and Technology Education Act of 1997. 
In order to help focus the debate on the best way to update the copyright laws for the digital era, I introduced S. 1146 in September. This legislation is a comprehensive effort to address three broad areas of critical importance to the future of the Internet: (1) the scope of copyright liability for on-line and Internet service providers; (2) the use of computers by teachers, librarians, and students to foster distance learning opportunities and to promote the preservation of important historical works and resources; and (3) the proper implementation of two international copyright treaties. Subsequently, Representatives Rick Boucher and Tom Campbell introduced a similar comprehensive bill in the House (H.R. 3048) to foster the growth of the Internet for the benefit of everyone in society. 
Two important developments took place in the past two weeks that underscore the importance of a comprehensive approach to updating the copyright laws. First, on February 25th, 40 distinguished professors of intellectual property law and technology law said in a letter to the Chairmen of the Senate and House Judiciary Committees that they believe these two bills, S. 1146 and H.R. 3048, `taken together, would bring U.S. law into compliance with the WIPO treaties while preserving the principle of balance which is at the heart of the American copyright tradition.' They went on to say: `At this crucial moment in the history of American intellectual property law, it is important that Congress do neither too much nor too little to bring copyright law into the digital era. In our view, the Ashcroft-Boucher-Campbell bills get the balance right.' 
Second, just one day later, in a major blow to consumers and the high-tech community, a House subcommittee voted out legislation that would make it illegal to produce or even possess future generations of VCRs and personal computers. Faced squarely with the question of whether the next generation of products found in virtually every home in America should be deemed unlawful `circumvention' devices, a majority of the subcommittee voted for the interests of copyright owners over the interests of consumers and the computer companies that have done so much to make our country the technology leader of the world. 
The Subcommittee vote endangers both the liberties that consumers now enjoy and the vitality of the technology industry, which has been the premiere engine for growth in the United States. This approach also suggests the tendency of Congress to `fix first, ask questions later.' The bill demonstrates the dangers of fixing what we do not understand. Now is the time to draw a bright line against federal regulation of the computer industry. Washington must not start down the road of dreaming up regulations to fix problems that may or may not exist. 
I think it useful to recall what the Supreme Court had to say in ruling for consumers and against two movie studios in that case: 
`One may search the Copyright Act in vain for any sign that the elected representatives of the millions of people who watch television every day have made it unlawful to copy a program for later viewing at home, or have enacted a flat prohibition against the sale of machines that make such copying possible.' 
As someone who filed an independent brief in the Supreme Court as the Missouri Attorney General in support of the right of consumers to buy that first generation of VCRs, I want to reassure consumers across the country that I will fight against legislation that would ban the next, exciting generation of technology. 
What kind of a bill should we consider? One that looks to the future. Above all, one that maintains the balance the professors of intellectual property and technology law have reminded us is at the core of our great copyright tradition and protection of property. The House subcommittee bill would make it all but impossible for someone to make a fair use of a copyrighted work, even though a fair use exception has been a fixture of copyright law from the beginning. What is more, the bill would actually make it illegal to make a copy of a portion of a protected work for fair use in certain circumstances. This is not balance. This is a blank check payable to Hollywood. 
Unlike the bill starting to move through the House, S. 1146 will spur technological innovation in small entrepreneur workshops and clean-room factories; it will create new educational opportunities in brick schoolhouses and family living rooms; and it will help preserve deteriorating manuscripts in your local library and the nation's largest universities. 
The Digital Copyright Clarification and Technology Education Act will encourage the use of computers and other new high-tech products to foster educational opportunities for everyone from children to senior citizens. Twenty-two years ago, Congress recognized that television could connect teachers in one part of town to students in another part of town. Today, technology has moved forward and has provided this country with fantastic new opportunities. We need to update the law so that schools may use computers to bring the world into the classroom and the classroom into the home. 
This legislation will ensure librarians and archivists may use the latest high-tech equipment to preserve deteriorating books, manuscripts, and works of art for future genrations to enjoy. New digital technology can enhance the educational experience and preserve our shared culture and history far into the future. Library patrons and students shouldn't be consigned to outmoded equipment when exciting new digital products are on the horizon.

Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I am pleased to take part in the debate to reauthorize the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1997, commonly known as ISTEA. This debate was originally scheduled to take place the first week in May. As we all know, the current measure is designed to end in the last week in April. Had we not debated this until the first week of May, there would have been an interruption in the funding and the opportunity to build highways in this country. So I express my appreciation to the majority leader for moving this debate up and making it possible for us to address this issue. When we are talking about the construction of infrastructure, which allows the body politic to be nourished by the stream of commerce, it is important that we don't interrupt that stream. I thank the majority leader, however, for the people of Missouri, the crisis is not yet over. The necessary funds for their road improvement projects still have not been approved. 
It is with great concern for the State of Missouri that I rise today. It is concern for everyone that relies on our transportation infrastructure to go to work or school, to the grocery store and to return home. It is concern for the workers who improve our existing roads and build new ones. I urge the Senate to quickly relieve the people of my state of the uncertainty caused by the lack of consistent funds, that hangs over their heads. 
It also is imperative that we pass a six year ISTEA authorization bill that gives states a fair return on their transportation dollars. These funds enable states to invest in improvement projects that affect Americans daily lives. Every day millions of Americans depend on our roads and bridges to safely and timely go about their lives. The need for safe roads is universal to every thriving community and the life of every American. Investment in our transportation infrastructure translates into safer and less congested travel. 
I have been contacted by several of my constituents expressing their frustration with Congress' failure to authorize the funds necessary to continue their road improvement projects. As they spend more and more time, stuck in traffic waiting to return home to their families, they wonder, `Why Congress has not acted?' They wonder, `Why is ISTEA stuck in traffic, as well?' 
While Congress has been unable to finish the job of passing the highway bill in a swift manner, there has been several Members of this body that have worked tirelessly to move this legislation forward. I am grateful, on behalf of the citizens of Missouri, for the work that has been done on this bill to ensure a fair return to Missourians for the kind of contribution that they make to the highway trust fund. I especially thank the senior Senator from Missouri, Kit Bond, for his irreplaceable effort in this battle. No Senator in this Chamber, in my judgment, has made a more conscientious and consistent effort to make sure that there was fairness in the allocation of these highway resources than Senator Kit Bond. Without his work, our current debate would not be to make sure the road construction continues unimpeded but to get it started again. 
To me, the issue is clear, and it has been clear throughout the entire debate. When a Missourian fills a gas tank and pays 4.3 cents in Federal fuel taxes, that money should go to 
improving roads rather than paying for additional Federal spending on some social program in a distant State. That is another improvement that this bill reflects, putting highway taxes back into the highway trust fund. 
I think the decision, which involved both the authorizing committee and the Budget Committee, to dedicate the 4.3 cent fuel tax to highways is a good one, and I am pleased to support that aspect of this bill. When this is all over, Missourians will now see a 91 cent return on each dollar as opposed to a dismal 80 cents that it received under the former funding scheme. Under the formula that was passed out of the Environment and Public Works Committee, Missouri will receive $3.6 billion compared to $2.4 billion that Missouri received over the last 6 years of the 1991 highway bill. Missouri's average allocation per year would be around $600 million as opposed to around $400 million that the State received under the old bill. I believe this allocation of highway trust money to the development and construction of highways is appropriate. I would add that this is not taking from other Government programs. This is the allocation of highway trust money for highways. Uniquely, we are beginning to get to the place where we focus resources that we take from people who use the highways on the highways. That is a major benefit. Although, I would like to see a 100 percent return on Missouri's investments, I appreciate the advancements made over the last few days. Also, I am committed to working with the Budget Committee to see that these additional funds are offset so we can stay within the budget caps that were approved by this Congress last session. 
Regrettably, we were unable to resolve these issues and a number of other concerns during the First Session. In order to continue funding to the states for their highway needs, Senator Bond authored the six month extension plan while ensuring that Missouri receives its fair share of highway dollars. The six month extension is scheduled to end April 30, of this year. I have recently received word from the Missouri Department of Transportation that their last bidding process for road construction contracts will be in March. 
I would like to share with you some of the long term projects that are in jeopardy because of our failure to act expeditiously. These are all top priorities for the Missouri Department of Transportation. `The replacement or rehabilitation of seven bridges on Interstate 70 in the St. Louis area. A new exit on Route 40 in St. Charles County to Chesterfield Airport Road.' Here is a few not to far from my home in Southwest Missouri the, `Widening to five lanes of Route 71 in Newton County. Rehabilitation of the Interstate 44 bridge at Route 50 in Franklin County. Widen and resurface 3 miles of Route 39 in Barry County.' The list goes on. 
Mr. President, federal funds make up about seventy percent of all funding for road and bridge construction in Missouri. With seventy percent of the funds hanging in uncertainty the Department of Transportation must end the bidding process. As the State of Missouri stops issuing construction contracts, contractors stop asking their employees to come to work. 
In order to put this into perspective I would like to share with you an e-mail that I received from one of my constituents from St. Louis, Missouri. This constituent has been in the road construction industry for nearly thirty years. He writes,  
. . . We the construction workers, have always strived to produce quality, on time projects. You, the U.S. Senate have failed once again to provide those needed funds in any sort of timely manor . . . I received a notice on January 22, 1998 that the Missouri Department of Transportation was going to cancel all future lettings after March 1998. I wish I could make you understand the devastating effect this will have on the Missouri Construction Industry, it's workers and the many related and non-related industries in our state. 
I was hoping to be contacting you regarding a better allocation of those tax dollars back to Missouri to better represent the amounts paid into the trust fund, I now find myself doubting if there will be any authorization at all . . . 
I do understand. I am grateful for the words of insight that I have received from my constituents. 
I quickly would like to address one more issue. This is the amendment that was voted on yesterday to take away State highway funds if they do not establish a blood alcohol content of .08 for drunk-driving violations. I opposed this amendment, not because I do not abhor drunk driving. Far too many of us have lost loved ones as a result of this tragedy. However, I believe States are in the best position to make the decision on the most effective way to eliminate drunk driving. The `stick' approach offered in the amendment was rejected by the 104th Congress, when we repealed the Federal speed limit. I believe the `carrot' approach, contained in the safety provisions of this bill--which provides a .08 option--is the appropriate method to allow States the freedom to establish comprehensive programs to discourage drunk driving. That is why the National Governors Association, the National Association of Governors' Highway Safety Representatives, the National Conference of State Legislatures, the National Association of Counties, and the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials support the safety provisions contained in the bill, rather than the amendment offered by the Senator from New Jersey. 
The people of Missouri gave me the privilege of serving them in this body. We would be derelict in our responsibility to them and the people of this great country, if one person lost their job because of our failure to act. I urge the Senate to once again avert the continued loss of time to our families, the loss of funds to our states and the loss of jobs for our workers, and quickly pass a long term ISTEA bill.

Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I rise to address the disturbing comments made yesterday by U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan. Apparently emboldened by his recent agreement with Saddam Hussein, Annan stated on ABC's `This Week' that the United States would have to consult with the Security Council before launching military strikes against Saddam Hussein. 
He stated: 
If the United States had to strike, I think some sort of consultations with the other members would be required. 
Let me state categorically that the United States does not require the permission of the United Nations to use our military forces in the pursuit of our national interests. Nor does the United Nations have any authority to require that the United States use our military forces if it would seek to deploy them. 
The United States has never, at any time, ceded to the United Nations any power to require the deployment of American forces against the wishes or the judgment of the United States, nor have we ceded to the United Nations any power to forbid the use of our military force. 
Mr. President, the comments by Secretary General Annan over the weekend are indicative of a growing arrogance of a United Nations that has grown accustomed to dictating American foreign policy toward Iraq. With U.S. policy toward Iraq in drift over the last 6 years, Secretary General Annan was able to take the lead in dealing with Saddam's provocations. What has the United Nations achieved? Has Saddam been punished? Have his weapons of mass destruction been destroyed? 
On the contrary, Saddam is stronger today than he was before instigating the crisis 4 months ago. He is better off across the board militarily, politically, and economically. He has blocked weapons inspections and moved weapons technology and equipment for several months. He has won greater prestige in the region and in the Arab world generally. He will be allowed to sell more oil. There is growing talk of dismantling the rest of the sanctions regime. 
The administration has compared Saddam to Hitler, but the President's policies are laying the groundwork for another Munich in the Persian Gulf. Saddam is the chief terrorist of a terrorist government whose weapons of mass destruction threaten the United States and our allies in the Middle East. The administration seems pleased, however, to make concessions to Saddam through the United Nations. More oil sales and a politicized inspection regime for Presidential sites in Iraq have meant victory for Saddam. 
Mr. President, the absence of Presidential leadership on Iraq has not served the United States well in the Middle East. Statements by the U.N. Secretary General that imply U.N. oversight of U.S. military forces are indicative of U.N. arrogance and disrespect for U.S. sovereignty. The deployment of our forces to defend our national interests is not subject to the approval of the United Nations or any other multinational organization. 
I intend to place before the Senate an opportunity for the body to state clearly the ability of the United States to make decisions about the deployment of its forces, without regard to, or prior consent from, the Security Council or any other international organization. I believe it is imperative that we make it clear that the United States will not cede any measure of sovereign control of its Armed Forces to the United Nations. 
The Constitution charges the President with the duties of Commander in Chief, and it is time for this administration to defend America's interests with clarity and resolve. The drift and inconsistency that has defined this administration's Iraq policy over the last 6 years will only be perpetuated by subcontracting U.S. foreign policy to the United Nations. 
If we continue to drift, Mr. President, the President of the United States will find himself asking permission of U.N. bureaucrats before he takes action to secure the interests of the United States. That cannot be allowed. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. ASHCROFT. I thank the Senator from Virginia. His recognition of the contribution of Senator Bond of Missouri is appreciated and appropriate. I think the decision, which involved both the authorizing committee and the Budget Committee, to dedicate the 4.3-cent fuel tax to highways is a good one, and I am pleased to support that aspect of this bill. I believe that when this is all over, Missourians will now see a 91 cent return on each dollar as opposed to a dismal 80 cents that it received under the former funding scheme.

I would add that this is not taking from other Government programs. This is the allocation of highway trust money for highways. Uniquely, we are beginning to get to the place where we focus resources that we take from people who use the highways on 
the highways. That is a major benefit. I would like to see a 100 percent return on Missouri's investments. I appreciate the advancements made over the last few days, and I am committed to working with the Budget Committee to see that these additional funds are offset so that we can stay within the budget caps that were approved by this Congress last session. 
I quickly would like to address one more issue. This is the amendment that was voted on yesterday to take away State highway funds if they do not establish a blood alcohol content of .08 for drunk-driving violations. I opposed this amendment, not because I do not abhor drunk driving. Far too many of us have lost loved ones as a result of this tragedy. However, I believe States are in the best position to make the decision on the best way to eliminate drunk driving. The `stick' approach offered in the amendment was rejected by the 104th Congress, when we repealed the Federal speed limit. I believe the `carrot' approach, contained in the safety provisions of this bill, which contain a .08 option, is the appropriate method to allow States the freedom to establish comprehensive programs to discourage drunk driving. That is why the National Governors Association, the National Association of Governors' Highway Safety Representatives, the National Conference of State Legislatures, the National Association of Counties, and the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials support the safety provisions contained in the bill. I look forward to the continued debate on the underlying policies in this bill. 
Now I would like to address the policy and constitutional principles raised by Senator McConnell's amendment, which I have cosponsored. The specific issue raised by Senator McConnell's amendment is whether we should reauthorize provisions in the ISTEA bill which treat two identically situated individuals differently, based solely on their race. Let me just say, again, the question or issue raised by Senator McConnell's amendment is whether we should reauthorize provisions of the bill which require that we treat two identically situated individuals differently only because of their race. 
Specifically, a provision in the ISTEA measure requires that 10 percent of the amounts made available under certain titles of the act shall be set aside for small business concerns owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals. The provision goes on to define `socially and economically disadvantaged individuals' by cross-reference to section 8(d) of the Small Business Act. 
If you go to that section, you will find that a Government contractor shall presume that `socially and economically disadvantaged individuals' include black Americans, Hispanic Americans, Native Americans, Asian Pacific Americans, and other minorities. The net effect of these provisions is that if two bids come in from two subcontractors, one owned by a white male and the other by a racial minority, and the bids are the same, or even close, the job will go to the minority-owned company, not the low bidder. 
I find this objectionable as a matter of public policy. But the question facing the Senate is more than a debate over policy. The U.S. Supreme Court has made it clear that a constitutional principle is at stake. Members of this body have differed on the question of whether the Government should treat people differently solely because of their race. Personally, I believe that we all desperately want a future of racial reconciliation in which race is simply no longer relevant. People of good faith can differ on how best to achieve racial harmony. My own view is that the best way is to usher in a future of racial reconciliation by ending race-conscious Government programs, starting today. You don't end racial discrimination by promoting racial discrimination. 
But, while the race-based set-asides in ISTEA are part of this broader debate about whether the Government should let racial factors cloud its decisions--a debate that raises difficult questions--the ISTEA race-based set-asides are an easy case. In 
the first place, the particular race-based set-asides in the transportation bill represent an issue of constitutional principle. 
We cannot evaluate these set-asides as if we were legislating on a blank slate. The Supreme Court, and now a Federal district court on remand, have considered these set-asides and declared them constitutionally suspect. These courts did not consider a similar program, or a related program, but the exact program that is at issue today. 
In the 1995 Adarand decision, the Supreme Court held that race-based Government programs are subject to the most exacting level of scrutiny. The Court rejected the notion that the Government's use of race should be subject to a more relaxed standard because the Government's stated purpose was assisting rather than disadvantaging racial minorities. Instead, the Court made clear that when the Government makes distinctions on the basis of race, it is engaging in a dangerous business, and such laws will survive only if they are narrowly tailored to serve a compelling Government interest. 
The Supreme Court stopped just short of declaring the program unconstitutional, leaving that task for the district court after any additional development of the record that was necessary. In June of last year, the district court to which the Supreme Court referred the measure confirmed what seemed obvious; namely, that the Federal Government's race-based set-asides were unconstitutional under the Supreme Court's demanding test of strict scrutiny. As Judge Kane emphasized, the race-based presumption of economic disadvantage is both over- and underinclusive. Indeed, the district court said it is not narrow at all; it is both too broad on the one side and too narrow on the other side. It falls because it is not narrowly tailored. Judge Kane observed that the Sultan of Brunei--I assume because this is an Asian Pacific person, a minority--in spite of being one of the wealthiest persons in the world, would qualify because of race-based consciousness that is specified in the act and would presumptively qualify as a disadvantaged business entity. The district court understands that if you are trying to correct social and business disadvantage, economic disadvantage, and instead of using something that is narrowly tailored to address social and economic disadvantage you use something as broad as race, you are using a category which is overly broad and can't be considered to be strictly tailored--can't be said to be narrowly tailored. 
We know there are individuals in the Asian Pacific ethnic group or minority who are as wealthy as any individuals in our entire culture and some as poor as any individuals in our entire culture. The fact is that the racial identity of an individual does not carry an individual into the specific narrow category of being socially or economically disadvantaged. 
My concerns with the effect of the court decisions on Congress' ability to reauthorize these provisions, led me to convene a hearing in the Constitution Subcommittee of the Judiciary Committee of the Senate, which I have the privilege of chairing, to examine the constitutionality of the provision. At that hearing we were privileged to receive testimony from Valery Pech, who, along with her husband, Randy, runs Adarand Constructors, the plaintiff in the Adarand cases. She provided the subcommittee with a firsthand look at how this program has operated in practice and the impact it has had on their business. 
She testified how this program has caused their firm to lose several contracts, despite being the low bidder on the job. She has also testified that the beneficiaries of this program, which is purportedly targeted at disadvantaged business entities, are, in fact, well-established firms. It has already been noted on the floor of this Senate that most of the time those firms, when they win a contract, win it based on the fact that they are the low bidders, but when they are involved in this kind of contract for federally related tasks, they do not even have to be the low bidder. 
I think it should be said that the general public of the 
country does not want to spend its money if it is not really helping someone who is needy, but just helping someone who is a part of a broad category to get a job which they don't earn by being the best in the competition. The American way is not to award the prize to the one who has this race or that race, or has this disadvantage or that disadvantage by the law. The American system has been to reward achievement and merit. This is a fundamental value of our culture. It is also reflected in our Constitution, and it was reinforced in the Adarand case, both at the Supreme Court level and on the remand. This is not the only set of cases that has decided this. 
As a matter of fact, it has been represented on the floor that there has been no other case in which this has been decided. But I think, if not directly on point at least so similar that one could not ignore it, is the case of Houston Contractors Association v. The Metropolitan Transit Authority of Harris County. In that instance, it was another U.S. Federal district court which ruled, consistent with the U.S. Supreme Court, that such set-asides and quotas and preferences as are contained in the ISTEA bill are simply wrong. Those courts, I believe, would provide more than an adequate basis; they would provide a compelling argument that we adopt the amendment as propounded and proposed by the Senator from Kentucky. 
The two Adarand decisions make plain the unconstitutionality of the ISTEA set-asides. But removing this provision from the bill as unconstitutional should be an easy decision for Congress for a second reason--the program uses race for a plainly impermissible end. The Constitution obligates the Congress to reject unconstitutional legislation whether or not the courts have, as here, already held the legislation unconstitutional. Wholly apart from the conclusions of the two Adarand courts, it is obvious that the ISTEA set-asides use racial classifications in an impermissible way. 
Reasonable persons can differ as to whether the Constitution forbids the Government from using race as a factor in rectifying past racial discrimination. You might have a different situation if you were saying the statute set up a presumption that there had been racial discrimination and then used race as the basis for rectifying that racial discrimination. That is not what the Disadvantaged Business Enterprise Program does. 
As its name suggests, the Disadvantaged Business Enterprise Program seeks to assure that a certain percentage of Government contracting dollars flow to--and here are the words--`socially and economically disadvantaged individuals.' 
The statute then defines a disadvantaged business enterprise as any business owned by members of certain ethnic groups and, since 1987, businesses owned by women of any race. 
In the statute, you say that you are trying to correct the problem, which is social and economic, and then you get to the remedy, and the remedy that is proposed is not based on social concerns, it is not based on economics; it is based on race. 
The truth of the matter is that the Supreme Court says you have to narrowly tailor the remedy and focus the remedy on the problem, but here the statute says that there is a problem that is social and economic but then has a solution which is racial. Obviously, the district court even saw the humor of the lack of fit between problem and remedy. So far does the racial remedy miss the social and economic problem that it would allow the Sultan of Brunei, one of the richest people in the world, to be presumed socially and economically disadvantaged. 
It is clear, you do not have to have a Supreme Court ruling, you do not have to have the district court rulings, you do not have to have a second district court ruling in the State of Texas to tell you this. I don't think you have to be a rocket scientist or law school professor. If the problem is social and economic and your solutions should be narrowly tailored, the solution should be social and economic. It should be focused on the problem. But instead of this statute focusing the solution on the problem of social and economic disadvantage, it focuses the solution on race, which wasn't something that was mentioned as the problem to begin with. 
The notion that every small business owned by racial minorities is somehow economically disadvantaged is nonsense. It flies in the face of reality. As a matter of fact, it is an affront to many of the businesses owned by racial minorities or women in this country. Many are very successful. For us to presume that because a black person or a Hispanic person or an Asian person owns a business it is disadvantaged or it is economically failing is for us to engage in rank prejudice, in my 
mind. 
I cannot imagine going up to someone and saying, `I see that your computer business is disadvantaged, it's economically failing, it needs Government assistance, you are a charity case.' 
`Why?' 
`Because your race is a minority race.' 
That is un-American to me. It would be an affront to me if I were told that in spite of my balance sheet, in spite of my portfolio, in spite of the fact that we had orders backlogged, we couldn't supply the demand, in spite of the fact our profits were up, we were still economically and socially disadvantaged just because of the way we were born, the color of our skin. That is an affront to the dignity of the individuals that this law apparently hopes to protect. 
I simply could not in good conscience go to my fellow Americans and say, `Well, your bottom line may show that you are successful and your stock may be worth millions and you may be getting lots of contracts and you may be beating everybody else in your business, but you're a failure because of your race,' or `you are disadvantaged because of your race.' That is something that we should not do as a country. Government should not go to people and say, `We're going to presume you're a failure, we are going to presume you economically can't make it, that you are socially disadvantaged because you are of a certain race or a certain ethnic minority.' 
I can't believe that. Why should we suggest that? We have seen time and time again, and we see it more and more frequently, people without regard to race, because of this economy. The economy of America doesn't make decisions based on race--look how many of the role models that are used in selling products all across this country are people of a wide variety of racial and ethnic backgrounds. Some of the most valuable endorsements in America are endorsements from people who, according to this law, would be socially and economically disadvantaged because of race. I would hate to tell some of those people they were disadvantaged. They might take out their wallet and buy me on the spot. They might buy everything that I own, and they could probably do it out of petty cash. 
I think the day has passed when we as a nation should try to tell people because they are of a particular race that they have an economic or social disadvantage, when it is pretty clear, when the facts of the matter just might be incontrovertible that they are not disadvantaged. 
At the hearing we held in the Constitution Subcommittee, a number of witnesses testified concerning the unconstitutionality of these set-asides and the futility of the Clinton administration's efforts to implement this flawed program and to continue to tell people that based on race alone they are somehow economically disadvantaged or unsuccessful. For example, Professor George LaNoue, of the University of Maryland, provided a detailed account of how the administration has failed to conduct the kind of detailed statistical analysis necessary to justify a race-based program. There is no evidence of how specific groups have been the subject of particular acts of discrimination and how the program is tailored to address these instances of discrimination. Thus, according to Professor LaNoue, there is no compelling interest to justify the use of race as a proxy or as a way of defining remedy in this context. 
Other constitutional scholars focused on the critical lack of narrow tailoring in this statute. As Professor Eugene Volokh of the UCLA law school stated:  
The statute as now written . . . is not something that can be saved through any regulations. It seems to be fatally overinclusive, and that strikes me as an easy case that it is not narrowly tailored. 
Easy case. 
Professor Volokh's testimony reflects the fact that the Constitution allows the Federal Government to use race as a factor only in the rarest of circumstances and only with surgical precision. Well, surgical precision would probably have lopped off the Sultan of Brunei, I might say. 
As the constitutional scholars on our panel concluded, the race-based set-asides in this bill are not drafted with sufficient precision or supported with enough statistical evidence to survive constitutional scrutiny.

Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, the Constitution gives the Congress an important duty in upholding the Constitution. The oath we take to uphold the Constitution gives us an obligation to vote against unconstitutional laws. The hearing I held in the Constitution Subcommittee convinced me that this is clearly one of those unconstitutional provisions that should be removed from the statute. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, the latest confrontation with Iraq shines a harsh light on an important truth. The collapse of the Soviet Union consigned to the ash heap of history has not created a world safe for democracy. The `Evil Empire' may have vanished but, alas, the world remains a dangerous and unpredictable place. 
In Iraq, we are confronted with a dictator as evil as Hitler. Saddam has killed thousands of his own citizens, licensed acts of terrorism, and produced and stockpiled weapons of mass destruction. It is a reign of terror unmatched in the post-cold war era. 
And how has this administration responded? Rather than draw a bright line in the sand, the President has been relegated to the role of spectator. 
The Commander in Chief has surrendered his moral authority at home and found himself ill-equipped to defend American interests abroad. 
At the moment of truth, America's acting Secretary of State--Kofi Annan--cut a deal with the devil and, tragically, a weakened, uncertain President endorsed the settlement before the ink had even dried. 
Today, we hear reports that there is no final consensus on what to do if Iraq violates the settlement. Have we known Saddam to keep his promises? What if he does not adhere to the agreement as in previous cases? The United Nations apparently cannot come to an agreement on what to do about it. 
The President's failure to lead has handed America's foreign policy to a cast of functionaries at the United Nations. Mr. President, U.S. foreign policy should not be subcontracted to Kofi Annan or written at the United Nations. America should not sacrifice one ounce--any other ounce--of her sovereignty to the architect and acolytes of one world government. 
This ill-conceived transfer of sovereignty has left America and her allies with an emboldened Saddam. In Iraq today, Saddam has a firmer grip on power, carries more regional prestige and can sell more oil. Some dare call this a triumph of diplomacy. 
As I indicated to Secretary Albright this week: `Preservation of the status quo is not a diplomatic triumph, Madam Secretary, it's a tragedy. The clear winner of this round is Saddam Hussein.' 
Instead of being penalized for his defiance, Saddam is winning bonus points: more oil sales, heightened standing, and new momentum to end the sanctioned regime. Ironically, in agreeing to agree, Saddam has committed to do nothing more than he was obliged to do all along. 
Mr. President, by the grace of God, America won the cold war. We triumphed over the `Evil Empire' of Lenin and Stalin. It is time for us to stand again for liberty and freedom. 
Saddam is a brutal dictator, a tyrant whose actions at home betray his intentions abroad. 
Let us sound a certain trumpet for America's vital national interests--in the Middle East and around the world. Let us not be governed by the whims and the will of Kofi Annan and the United Nations. Let America lead the world by the force of our principles and the power of our ideas, with the hope that one day the long tug of memory might look favorably upon us as we look approvingly on those who answered freedom's call in decades past.

Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I rise today to acknowledge and honor the achievement of Assist International, World Serv, the Hewlett Packard Foundation, and the Erie Area Chamber of Commerce in delivering medical aid to the people of Ethiopia. This group of organizations has worked to provide medical equipment to Ethiopia that can save hundreds of lives. This generous gift, valued at over one million dollars, will bring hope and health to many in Ethiopia. 
These organizations and the concerned Americans associated with them have demonstrated the true spirit of charity. The group cooperatively has donated a state-of-the-art cardiac heart monitoring unit to the Black Lion Hospital--Ethiopia's leading teaching medical facility. In addition to the cardiac unit, beds, mattresses, and other system support equipment will be provided. 
World Serv and Assist International have a strong history of providing humanitarian aid to relieve human suffering in needy countries. Assist International donated medical equipment to a site in Mongolia which was then approved by the World Health Organization to perform open heart surgery. The Hewlett Packard Foundation donated the medical equipment in the Black Lion Project in its goal to ease human suffering internationally. Finally, the Chamber of Commerce of Erie, Pennsylvania, has joined together with the other organizations and has raised the funding for transportation, installation, and training costs of this project. Specifically, I commend the Erie Area Chamber of Commerce for this cooperative effort and for holding the third annual `Aid to Africa' banquet to raise funds for humanitarian projects. 
The Black Lion project is an example of the compassion and generosity that other countries appreciate and admire in the United States. It gives me great pleasure as the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Africa Subcommittee to know that Americans are finding ways within the private sector to aid other countries in Africa. It is my pleasure to ask the members of the Senate to join me in recognizing and honoring the work of the members and staff of Assist International, World Serv, the Hewlett Packard Foundation, and the Erie Area Chamber of Commerce.

Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I rise to continue to explain the basis for my opposition to the nomination of Frederica Massiah-Jackson to be a U.S. district judge for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. 
Although I have already spent time on the floor detailing this nominee's record, I think it is important and valuable to spend the time necessary to demonstrate the serious flaws of this nominee and to also highlight the caliber of the nominees that we are receiving from the President of the United States. 
There are a number of categories into which my objections to this nomination might fall. 
One would be a disrespect for the court and its environment, perhaps most clearly typified by the willingness of this nominee to use profanity in the courtroom. 
No. 2, a contempt for prosecutors and police officers that is evidenced in the way she has treated them and handled them as they have appeared in court and the way in which she has handled evidence assembled by those officers. 
Those are two major problems that I have with this particular nominee. 
No. 3, the concept of leniency in sentencing; the effort made by this nominee as a judge in the State of Pennsylvania to reduce the sentences which were given to those who had been convicted of crimes is notable. It has, as a matter of fact, even caught the attention of the appellate courts at which time those sentences have been reversed. 
These are among the most important factors that lead me to the conclusion that Judge Massiah-Jackson should not be confirmed as a United States district court judge. 
She should not be considered for a lifetime responsibility in administering justice in the United States of America; that in the event that the President refuses to withdraw this nomination, which he should do, that the Senate of the United States of America should reject this nomination. 
Let me just go through some of these points in order to establish a factual basis for these conclusions supporting the categories which I have mentioned. 
First is the contempt for prosecutors and police officers that Judge Massiah-Jackson has evidenced in the conduct of her responsibilities as a judge in Pennsylvania. 
In the case of Commonwealth v. Ruiz, Judge Massiah-Jackson acquitted a man accused of possessing $400,000 worth of cocaine because she did not believe the testimony of two undercover police officers, Detective-Sergeant Daniel Rodriguez and Detective Terrance Jones. It was the second time she had acquitted alleged drug dealers nabbed by the same officers. The first time, the two undercover officers testified that they found two bundles of heroin on a table right next to the defendant's hand. The judge not only refused to believe this testimony, she went one step further. As the officers were leaving the courtroom, the judge reportedly told spectators in the court: `Take a good look at these guys [the undercover officers] and be careful out there.' 
This identification by the judge was reported in the Philadelphia Inquirer. 
Detective-Sergeant Daniel Rodriguez confirmed this outrageous courtroom incident in a signed letter to the U.S. Senate. The detective-sergeant had the following comments regarding the incident, and I quote:  
I thought, `I hope I don't ever have to make buys from anyone in this courtroom.' They would know me, but I wouldn't know them. What the judge said jeopardized our ability to make buys. And it put us in physical danger. 
I really believe that this officer sincerely wrote that letter and that he intended for the letter to say exactly what it said and that he felt the sense of physical danger that was occasioned by the special identification that the judge had made of him and another police officer. 
Detective Terrance Jones, the other undercover officer that was identified by Judge Massiah-Jackson in open court, according to the Philadelphia Inquirer, also confirmed the facts in a signed statement to the committee staff. He stated that the comments `jeopardized our lives.' Detective Jones also notes: 
As a law enforcement officer who happens to be African American I am appalled that self-interest groups and the media are trying to make the Massiah-Jackson controversy into a racial issue. This is not about race. This is about the best candidate for the position of Federal judge. 
Let me go to another case, the case of Commonwealth v. Hicks. In this case, in an action that led to a reversal by the appellate court, Judge Massiah-Jackson dismissed charges against the defendant on her own motion. 
Although the prosecution was prepared to proceed, the defense was not ready because it was missing a witness--a 
police officer who was scheduled to testify for the defense apparently had not received the subpoena. The defense requested a continuance to clear up the mixup concerning the subpoena. The commonwealth stated that it had issued the subpoena. The defense did not allege any wrongdoing or failure to act on the part of the commonwealth. Nonetheless, without any evidence or prompting from defense counsel, Judge Massiah-Jackson decided she simply did not believe that the commonwealth's attorney subpoenaed the necessary witness. Judge Massiah-Jackson held the commonwealth liable for the defense's lack of preparation for its own unpreparedness, and Judge Massiah-Jackson, on the motion of the court, dismissed the case without even the suggestion from the defense that the case should be dismissed. The facts ultimately revealed that the subpoena had been issued, but the officer was on vacation and had not received it. It was not the fault of the commonwealth. Judge Massiah-Jackson's decision was reversed on appeal as an abuse of discretion. The appellate court concluded that, `Having carefully reviewed the record, we are unable to determine the basis for the trial court's decision to discharge the defendant. Indeed the trial court was unable to justify its decision by citation to rule or law.' 
There is a lot of discussion about whether we need to send this nomination back for additional information and for hearings before the Senate Judiciary Committee. 
This particular case, for instance, was discussed at the hearing. When asked by a Senator if she had any comment or explanation of the situation, Judge Massiah-Jackson just replied, `No, Senator, I don't.' 
It occurs to me that it is not necessary to reconvene the committee and to move this matter back from the floor of the Senate asking that there be opportunities for explanations for cases like that when those opportunities were available then. 
Commonwealth v. Hannibal is a case that is demonstrative of this particular nominee's lack of judicial temperament. 
In court, in response to prosecutor's attempt to be afforded an opportunity to be heard, the following exchange took place on the record: 
The Court. Please keep quiet, Ms. McDermott. 
Ms. McDermott for the Commonwealth: Will I be afforded---- 
The Court. Ms. McDermott, will you shut your f***ing mouth. 
That is from the transcript of June 25, 1985, at page 17. 
Judge Massiah-Jackson was formally admonished by the Judicial Inquiry and Review Board for using intemperate language in the courtroom. This incident, incidentally, was also discussed by the committee with the judge, and the conduct was admitted. 
In the case of Commonwealth v. Burgos and Commonwealth v. Rivera, during a sentencing proceeding, the prosecutor told Judge Massiah-Jackson that she had forgotten to inform one of the defendants of the consequences of failing to file a timely appeal. Of course, such a failure would prejudice the commonwealth on appeal. Judge Massiah-Jackson responded to this legal argument with profanity, stating, `I don't give a [expletive deleted].' This incident was discussed at the committee hearing, and the conduct was also admitted. 
District Attorney Morganelli of Northampton County, PA, has suggested that the reason there are not more instances of foul language on the record is that Judge Massiah-Jackson's principal court reporter routinely `sanitized the record.' 
It does not appear to be a coincidence that both of these profane outbursts were directed at prosecutors. Instead, Judge Massiah-Jackson's foul language appears to be part and parcel of her hostility to law enforcement. 
Let me move to the issue of the leniency in sentencing which has been characteristic, I believe, of this judge's record. In the case of Commonwealth v. Freeman, the defendant shot and wounded a Mr. Fuller in the chest because Mr. Fuller had laughed at him. Judge Massiah-Jackson convicted the defendant of misdemeanor instead of felony aggravated assault. She sentenced him to do 2 to 23 months and then immediately paroled him so that he did not have to serve jail time. The felony charge would have had a mandatory 5- to 10-year prison term. Judge Massiah-Jackson explained her decision stating, `The victim had been drinking before being shot,' and the defendant `had not been involved in any other crime since the incident.' 
Here we have an individual who shoots another individual, and this judge not only makes it a misdemeanor so that the sentence can be reduced from a minimum of 5 to 10 years to 2 to 23 months, but then paroles immediately the individual so that no jail time is served after the conviction. The judge explains this behavior saying that the person who had been shot had been drinking as if somehow, I guess, if you are drinking you are eligible to be shot; and that the defendant `had not been involved in any other crime since the incident.' 
This case was not discussed at the hearing. No appeal was taken from this case. 
In the case of Commonwealth v. Burgos, during a raid on the defendant's house, police seized more than 2 pounds of cocaine along with evidence that the house was a distribution center. 
The defendant, Mouin Burgos, was convicted. Judge Massiah-Jackson sentenced the defendant to only 1 year's probation. 
Then District Attorney Ronald Castille criticized Judge Massiah-Jackson's sentence as `defying logic' and being `totally bizarre.' He commented, `This judge just sits in her ivory tower * * * She ought to walk along the streets some night and get a dose of what is really going on out there. She should have sentenced these people to what they deserve.' 
This case was discussed at the hearing, and Senators and the judge had an opportunity to explain their positions. No appeal was taken from this case. 
In the case of Commonwealth v. Williams, a first-degree robbery, unreported sentencing reversal case, I would like to provide just one more example of Judge Massiah-Jackson's leniency in sentencing, an example that I think is also relevant to whether we should have another hearing on this nominee. 
In the case of Commonwealth v. Williams, the defendant robbed a 47-year old woman on the street at the point of a razor. The defendant used the razor to slash the woman's neck and arms and took her purse. The defendant had to undergo surgery to repair the slashed tendons in her hand and was forced to wear a splintering device that pulled her thumb back to her wrist. The defendant pled guilty to first-degree robbery. Under the Pennsylvania sentencing guidelines, that offense carries a range of 4 to 7 years, with a mitigated range of 3 1/4 to 5 years. Despite these sentencing ranges, Judge Massiah-Jackson sentenced the defendant to a mere 11 1/2 to 23 months. In order to do so, Judge Massiah-Jackson not only had to deviate substantially below the guidelines range but also had to ignore a mandatory weapons enhancement that raises the minimum sentence 1 to 2 years. The Commonwealth did appeal this meager sentence, and Judge Massiah-Jackson was reversed for her sentencing errors. 
Now, this decision is important not only because it demonstrates her leniency in sentencing but also because of what it says about the equity of giving Ms. Massiah-Jackson an additional hearing. We have heard a lot about Judge Massiah-Jackson's right to be heard and have been given the impression that she has been the victim of sandbagging by her opponents. It is true that there is information that was not available at the time of the committee's hearing. This sentencing case, for example, was not addressed at the hearing. But why wasn't it addressed at the hearing? That is no one's fault but Judge Massiah-Jackson. 
The committee's standard questionnaire asks every candidate to list any judicial decisions which were reversed on appeal. Judge Massiah-Jackson failed to list this case. Indeed, she testified that she had never been reversed on a sentencing appeal. So if this case wasn't debated or discussed at the hearing, it wasn't debated or discussed because at the hearing she had failed to disclose this when the committee had requested that she disclose it, and when asked additionally if there were cases like this upon which she had been reversed she informed the committee that she had not been reversed on sentencing appeal when in fact this case represented such a reversal. 
Now, it seems ironic to me that when we finally find out about the existence of those things which she said did not exist, she should be accorded a second hearing now to explain that which she failed to disclose. I think that is a serious problem. This is not only a failure-to-disclose problem but this is the disclosure of something which was specifically denied in the hearing. 
I make this point to make clear that this is not just a simple matter of giving someone a right to confront new allegations. She had the opportunity to respond to the allegations in this setting by providing the evidence in the first instance, or the case or the notification that she had been reversed on appeal, and in the second instance by not denying that she had ever been reversed on appeal. It strikes me that we are creating a troubling precedent by affording nominees a second hearing at least in part to explain materials that were requested prior to the first hearing. 
Let me move on to the case of Commonwealth v. Smith. This is leniency not just in sentencing but a predisposition on the part of this judge to suppress evidence and to do so improperly. 
Judge Massiah-Jackson has also demonstrated leniency in improperly suppressing evidence. The case that perhaps most dramatically illustrates this point is Commonwealth v. Smith, a case discussed by the chairman of the Judiciary Committee in the Chamber yesterday. It is a case that I also mentioned. 
In this tragic case, the victim, a 13-year-old boy, was raped at knifepoint in some bushes near a hospital. Eventually, the young boy managed to run away from his assailant nude and bleeding. Two nurses at the hospital saw him, and he told them what had happened, pointing out the bushes where he was attacked. The two nurses called the hospital security guards. They saw the defendant in the case emerge from the bushes with his clothing disheveled and then saw him walk quickly away. The women yelled out for the man to stop, and the police arrived on 
the scene and apprehended the defendant. 
The defendant denied raping the boy, but the police searched him and found a knife matching the description of that used in the rape. At that point the police arrested the defendant. Shockingly, Judge Massiah-Jackson ruled that the police lacked probable cause to arrest the defendant and suppressed all evidence, including the identification of the defendant by the two nurses. 
Now, not surprisingly, the appellate court, when confronted with this dubious judgment, reversed Judge Massiah-Jackson. 
So the situation is this, that Massiah-Jackson, lenient in suppressing evidence, was reversed by the appellate court. It has been pointed out, and I would thank Senator Specter for having so pointed out, that after a remand to the trial court the defendant was acquitted in a new trial before a different judge. But what seems to have received less attention is that all this occurred after Judge Massiah-Jackson was reversed by the appellate court. Unlike the second judge who conducted a full trial, Judge Massiah-Jackson threw out the evidence on the ground that the police lacked even probable cause to arrest the defendant despite his proximity to the crime scene and the victim, and the other facts that are attendant thereto, including the identification by the individuals who were there at the time of his arrest. It is, of course, one thing to acquit someone after a trial but the notion that the police officers did not even have probable cause to arrest the defendant is just shocking, and the appellate court agreed. 
And the litany, incidentally, of illustrations regarding leniency in sentencing could go on. Last year there were 50 separate cases that were singled out just as exemplary of this leniency, but that was just last year. And organizations, law enforcement organizations, organizations that serve the culture by providing the safety and security for persons and their property which defines a civilized culture, have come out saying this individual should not be confirmed as a U.S. district court judge. 
The Philadelphia Lodge of the Fraternal Order of Police announced its opposition to the confirmation of Massiah-Jackson on January 13 of this year. And just yesterday I had the privilege of attending a press conference in which Philadelphia Fraternal Order of Police President Richard Costello made his opposition to this nominee unmistakably clear. The National Fraternal Order of Police announced its opposition on January 20. In coming out against this nominee, here is what the National President of the Fraternal Order of Police, Gilbert Gallegos, stated: `Judge Massiah-Jackson has no business sitting on any bench, let alone a Federal bench.' 
After describing the incident in which Judge Massiah-Jackson pointed out undercover police officers in open court, Mr. Gallegos stated, `I cannot adequately express my outrage.' The National Fraternal Order of Police President concluded, `To confirm Judge Massiah-Jackson would be an affront to every law enforcement officer and prosecutor in the Nation, all of whom have a herculean task of fighting crime. We shouldn't have to have [both] the judges and the criminals against us.' 
I note the presence of the majority leader in the Chamber, Mr. President, and I would gladly yield to the majority leader with the understanding that at the conclusion of his remarks my right to speak in the Chamber be retained.

Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I had hoped to offer to the Senator from Pennsylvania an opportunity to make brief remarks, and that is the reason I placed the quorum call, for an opportunity to make that offer. 
The nomination of Frederica Massiah-Jackson is a nomination which I think should call us each to a very serious consideration of our responsibilities here in the U.S. Senate. Judges who are appointed for life, who really do not answer to the voters, do not answer to the administration or the executive branch, have a very high degree of power in the culture and we should be very careful about the individuals that we endow with the authority of becoming Federal judges. The National Association of Police Organizations understands that and the National Association of Police Organizations announced its opposition on January 22, to this nominee. 
Further, there is opposition from the local law enforcement community in Philadelphia, opposition from individuals that one would not expect to ordinarily oppose a nominee except in extraordinary situations: Lynne Abraham, who is the district attorney in the Philadelphia area--a Democrat, someone you would expect to be aligned with the President and his nominations--at great political cost, with substantial display of putting the benefit of the community in Philadelphia above party loyalty, came out against the nomination of Frederica Massiah-Jackson in a letter to Senator Specter, at least that is my information, on January 8. She wrote: 
My position on this nominee goes well beyond mere differences of opinion, or judicial philosophy. Instead, this nominee's record presents multiple instances of deeply ingrained and pervasive bias against prosecutors and law enforcement officers--and, by extension, an insensitivity to victims of crime. Moreover, the nominee's judicial demeanor and courtroom conduct, in my judgment, undermines respect for the rule of law and, instead, tends to bring the law into disrepute. 
This nominee's judicial service is replete with instances of demonstrated leniency towards criminals, an adversarial attitude towards police and disrespect toward prosecutors unmatched by any other present or former jurist with whom I am familiar. 
That is a very serious charge from the prosecutor, someone of the same party as the President who nominates this judge. I quote again: 
This nominee's judicial service is replete with [full of] instances of demonstrated leniency toward criminals, an adversarial attitude toward police and disrespect toward prosecutors unmatched by any other present or former jurist with whom I am familiar. 
The words `full of' were my amplification. Her text did not include that. 
Other local law enforcement officials who feel that this is a nomination which should not go forward--the Northampton County District Attorney, John Morganelli, another Democrat, announced his all-out opposition to this nomination on January 6, 1998. Mr. Morganelli provided members of the committee with a letter detailing the numerous incidents of unprofessional conduct that have marked Judge Massiah-Jackson's tenure on the State trial bench. The concluding paragraphs of that letter are worth quoting at length: 
[The] record is one of an unusually adversarial attitude toward the prosecution and police. Much personal animosity towards prosecutors and police in general. Other portions of her record indicate a tendency to be lenient with respect to criminal defendants. 
I continue with his letter: 
This judge sat as a fact finder in the vast majority of her cases because criminal defendants almost always felt it advantageous to waive their right to a jury trial in order to present their case directly to the judge. * * * In addition, she has shown a lack of judicial temperament with respect to vulgar language from the bench on the record and much of it off the record. Also, as indicated above, Judge Massiah-Jackson has attempted to meddle with the appellate process in Pennsylvania by contacting appellate courts and improperly attempting to influence appellate decisions. Her comments, conduct, record and lack of judicial temperament by itself should call into question her stature to serve as a Federal Judge. 
Numerous District Attorneys and police organizations in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania oppose this nomination as a slap in the face to the law enforcement community. 
That is the conclusion of District Attorney Morganelli's letter, opposing the confirmation of this judge. 
In addition, the Executive Committee of the State of Pennsylvania's District Attorneys Association has unanimously voted to officially oppose the nomination. On January 8 the Executive Committee of the Pennsylvania District Attorneys Association, in a unanimous vote, officially opposed the nomination. The President of the association wrote a letter on January 26, expressing the association's opposition. 
I would just comment it is not usual for prosecuting attorneys, or for district attorneys, or for police organizations to attack judges, especially judges who are sitting as judges in their jurisdictions, the same judges they have to go before on a regular basis in seeking to effect justice in the society, to make sure we have the right law enforcement, the right prosecution, the right conviction and the right detention of those who have been deemed guilty of a crime. It is not comfortable, it is not easy, it is not expected. It is, I think, fair to describe it as rare, that someone would, as a prosecutor, or that the association of prosecutors, or that the police, or the associations of police, would come forward and make statements that say not only is this the worst judge I have ever seen but this is the worst judge of which I have any awareness. These are individuals who have a substantial awareness of the judicial system as a result of their broad experience in the system. 
If my recollection serves me correctly, the district attorney in Philadelphia, Lynne Abraham, is a former judge herself. She has an ability to know what the circumstances of the judge's responsibilities are. And when she comes forward to say that this judge is a judge that is so out of touch with the balance necessary to accord fairness in the system by being so predisposed to the defendant's position and antithetical to the prosecutor's position, and antagonistic to the position of the Commonwealth as opposed to that of the individual who is seeking to be declared innocent of the charges, she just indicates that we can do better. And I think that is really the case that we have here. 
The pool of legal talent in Pennsylvania is not shallow. We have talked about Philadelphia lawyers all across the country for a long time, because Philadelphia is known as a center for individuals who know how to work with the law and to do it effectively, who know what their responsibilities are and to make sure that those responsibilities can be carried out in the best interests of their clients. And I believe that there are those in that community who could well serve this President as nominees and could well serve this country as nominees. And I believe it is the responsibility of the U.S. Senate, when you have a nominee who is not of the caliber and quality that is appropriate for membership on the Federal bench, for the Senate to stand up and say so. And I believe that is our responsibility here. 
I don't believe that the Founding Fathers of this great country put the U.S. Senate in the stream that leads to the Federal judiciary so that it could act in a way which is a rubberstamp, so that it could say, well, in spite of the fact that this individual is an affront to the judicial system, disrespects it with profanity, disrespects its participants by profaning them and their conduct, is so lenient with criminals that it causes major questions, has to be reversed on criminal appeals and, when asked about it, denies ever being reversed until the appeals are found--I don't think we have to have that kind of person. I don't think we are here to pass that kind of person through to a lifetime tenure, to a system which will, really, give her great latitude in imposing upon the people of this country the authority of the United States in demanding or commanding adherence to the law. I really think that we can do better. And I think we ought to do better. 
It is not hard for us to do that. Surely we have cooperated 90, 95 percent--I don't know--of the time, that these cases go through. Most of them never even get debated. This case was--they insisted that we debate. When I was last at a committee meeting I thought we should not move this case to the floor for debate. There was an outcry, a substantial, significant outcry, insisting that we move this case to the floor for debate. Now that we have moved it to the floor for debate there is a substantial outcry to move it back to the committee. 
I think the real fact of the matter is we know, we know enough about this case to say this is not an individual that we want to welcome into the lifetime tenure of the Federal judge. It does not mean the individual cannot have merit, cannot do different things, is banished from any other responsibilities. It is simply someone who is not suited to be endowed with the authority of a Federal judge, a serious responsibility in this society and culture. 
I suppose we can let this individual go back for additional committee hearings or additional deliberations. But in my view that is a mistake. And, in my view there are times when the Senate should simply act as the Constitution calls upon it to 
act, that is to either provide the advice and consent which is appropriate and constitute the nominee as a member of the judiciary or deny the advice and consent and move on because America can and should do better. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, thank you very much. I yield myself so much time as I may consume, and I ask that the Chair inform me when I have consumed 15 minutes. 
I thank you very much for allowing me to participate in this debate. It is appropriate that we bring to the floor nominees who are well known to the committee for debate by the full Senate. I commend the chairman of the committee for bringing this nomination to the floor. I have no objection to these nominations coming to the floor and no objection to voting on these nominees. I only objected to this nominee coming to the floor to be approved by unanimous consent because I think we deserve the opportunity to debate these nominees, to discuss them and to have votes on them. 
So many people who are not familiar with the process of the Senate may think that when a Senator says that he wants to have a debate that he is trying to delay. I believe the work of the Senate should be done in full view of the American people and that we should have the opportunity to discuss these issues, and then instead of having these things voted on by unanimous consent at the close of the business day with no record, I think it is important that we debate the nominee's qualifications on the record. 
I think it is important because the judiciary is one-third of the Government of the United States. The individuals who populate the judiciary are lifetime appointments. 
The United States Constitution imposes a responsibility on the Senate to be a quality screen, and it is the last screen before a person becomes a lifetime member of the judiciary. So we need to do our best to make sure that only high-quality individuals reach that level, individuals who have respect for the Constitution, who appropriately understand that the role of the courts is to decide disputes and not to expand the law or to somehow develop new constitutional rights. The legislature is the part of the body politic that is designed to make law. The courts are designed to settle disputes about the law. 
It is against this background that I am pleased to have the opportunity to debate the nomination of Margaret Morrow. 
Let me begin by saying that Ms. Morrow is an outstanding lawyer. No one wants to challenge her credentials. No one believes that she is not a person of great intellect or a person of tremendous experience. She is a person who has great capacity. It has been demonstrated in her private life, her educational record and in her life of service as an officer of the California Bar Association. 
The only reservations to be expressed about Ms. Morrow, and they are substantial ones in my regard--they are not about her talent, not about her capacity, not about her integrity--they are about what her interpretation of the role of a judge is; whether she thinks that the law as developed in the court system belongs on the cutting edge, whether she thinks that the law, as developed in the court system, is an engine of social change and that the courts should drive the Nation in a direction of a different culture and a direction of recognizing new rights that weren't recognized or placed in the Constitution, and that needed to be invented or developed or brought into existence by individuals who populate the courts. That, I think, is the major question we have before us. 
So let me just say again, this is an outstanding person of intellect, from everything I can understand a person of great integrity, a person whose record of service is laudable and 
commendable. The only question I have is, does she have the right view of the Constitution, the right view of what courts are supposed to do, or will she be someone who goes to the bench and, unfortunately, like so many other lawyers in the ninth circuit, decide that the court is the best place to amend the Constitution? Does she think the court is the best place to strike down the will of the people, to impose on the people from the courts what could not be generated by the representatives of the people in the legislature. 
So, fundamentally, the question is whether or not this candidate will respect the separation of powers, whether this candidate will say the legislature is the place to make the law, and whether she will recognize that courts can only make decisions about the law. Will she acknowledge that the people have the right to make the law, too? After all, that is what our Constitution says, that all power and all authority is derived from the people, and they, with their elected representatives, should have the opportunity to make the law. 
It is with these questions in mind that I look at some of the writings of this candidate for a Federal judgeship, and I come to the conclusion that she believes that the court system and the courts are the place where the law can be made, especially if the people are not smart enough or if the people aren't progressive enough or if the Constitution isn't flexible enough. 
I can't say for sure this is what would happen. I have to be fair. I have to go by what she has written. I will be at odds with the interpretation of some of the things said by the committee chairman. I respect the chairman, but I think that his interpretation of her writings is flawed. 
In 1995, in a law review comment, Ms. Morrow seemed to endorse the practice of judicial activism, that is judge-made law. She wrote: 
For the law is, almost by definition, on the cutting edge of social thought. It is a vehicle-- 
Or a way-- through which we ease the transition from the rules which have always been to the rules which are to be. 
She is saying that the law is the vehicle, the thing that takes you from what was to what will be. I was a little puzzled when the committee chairman said that the committee found that she didn't mean the substantive as expressed in the courts and the like. Let me just say I don't believe the committee made any such findings. I have checked with committee staff, and it is just not the case that the committee made findings. 
It is true that a majority of the members of the committee voted this candidate to the floor, but the committee didn't make findings that this was not a statement of judicial activism. Frankly, I think it is a statement of judicial activism, despite the fact that Ms. Morrow told the committee that she was not speaking about the law in any substantive way, but rather was referring to the legal profession and the rules governing the profession. 
The law, by definition, is on the cutting edge of social thought? Social thought doesn't govern the profession, social thought governs the society. The transition of the rules from the way they have always been to the rules which they are to be? I think it is a stretch to say that this really refers to the legal profession. 
If she meant that the legal profession is a vehicle through which we ease the transition from the rules which always have been to the rules which are to be, that doesn't make sense. Clearly she is referring to something other than the legal profession or the rules of professional conduct. 
Some have suggested that because Ms. Morrow initially made these remarks at a 1994 Conference on Women and the Law, that it is plausible that she was referring to the profession and not to the substantive law. But I think it is more likely that her statement reflects a belief that the law can and should be used by those who 
interpret it to change social norms, inside and outside of the legal profession. 
Truly, that is a definition of activism, the ability of judges to impose on the culture those things which they prefer rather than have the culture initiate through their elected representatives those things which the culture prefers. 
Frankly, if it is a question of a few in the judiciary defining what the values of the many are in the culture, I think that is antidemocratic. I really believe that the virtue of America is that the many impose their will on the Government, not that the few in Government impose their will on the many. 
Reasonable people can disagree on the proper interpretation of Ms. Morrow's statement. Others can argue about whether or not hastening social change is a proper role for judges in the courts. But I think it is fair to conclude that Ms. Morrow's comments were an endorsement of judicial activism. 
In 1993, Ms. Morrow gave another speech that suggested approval of judicial activism, quoting William Brennan, an evangelist of judicial activism. Morrow stated:  
Justice can only endure and flourish if law and legal institutions are `engines of social change' able to accommodate evolving patterns of life and social interaction in this decade. 
She said these remarks were not an endorsement of activism. She told the Judiciary Committee the subject of the comments was, once again, not the law but the legal profession and the California State Bar Association. 
To say that both law and legal institutions are engines of social change I think begs the question of whether you are just talking about the State bar association. In this statement, Ms. Morrow refers specifically to the law and legal institutions. Ms. Morrow's words were a call for activism to those who administer the law. 
Again, the committee chairman indicated that the committee found that she was referring to those things she referenced in her testimony. That may have been the conclusion of some on the committee as a basis for how they voted, but I don't believe the committee made any findings about what her statements meant. 
Ms. Morrow was the president of the California State bar in 1993 and 1994, one of the things for which she is to be applauded. She was first woman elected president of the bar. But according to press reports, her first bar convention as president was `marked by only one big issue: gun control.' Even U.S. Attorney Janet Reno traveled all the way to the San Diego convention to exhort attendees to work against Americans' `love affair with guns.' 
And although a 1990 U.S. Supreme Court decision prohibited the California bar from using dues for political activities and specifically listed advocacy of gun control legislation as an example, Ms. Morrow said the bar should consider the Court's ruling, `assess the risks, and then do what is right.' 
So looking into the face of a Supreme Court decision of the United States, Ms. Morrow said, `Yeah, we should figure out what we think is right and assess the risks,' I suppose of getting caught and what the consequences would be, `and then just basically do what we think is right.' 
I think if we are going to ask someone to undertake the responsibility of administering justice in the Federal judicial system, we have to expect them to accord the Constitution of the United States respect. We have to expect them to accord the rulings of the Supreme Court of the United States respect, and to assess the risks and do what is right is not a philosophy. 
Frankly, one does not need to assess the risks if one is going to do what is right. If you are going to do what is right, there are no risks. Rather than imply that the Court's prohibition on using bar dues for political purposes may be somehow circumvented or disregarded, Ms. Morrow could have stated her clear intention to respect the Court's decision and to urge her membership to do the same. 
Ms. Morrow not only has indicated her willingness to use the law `on the cutting edge' and to use the law, the legal profession and the courts to change the rules whereby people live and to make law and not just interpret law or decide disputes, she has argued that when the people get involved in making the law, the result is dubious and should be called into question and into doubt.

Mr. ASHCROFT. I allocate myself such further time as I may consume in making this next point. 
Mr. President, Ms. Morrow's supporters argue that her comments about judicial activism are taken out of context or misinterpreted, but I don't believe that they are. Her supporters will have a harder time explaining away Ms. Morrow's disparaging and elitist views about direct citizen involvement in decisionmaking processes. 
If she is not clear about saying that she would displace the legislative function by being a judicial activist in one arena, that is, when it comes to interpreting the law and expanding the Constitution, she is very clear about her disrespect for legislation enacted by the people. 
In 1988, she wrote an article and smugly criticized the ballot initiative as used by the citizens of California. Here is what she wrote in that article: 
The fact that initiatives are presented to a `legislature' of 20 million people renders ephemeral any real hope of intelligent voting by a majority. 
What she is saying, in other words, is that whenever the people get involved, decisions will not be intelligent. She suggests that the courts are going to have to step in and do the right thing, what they know to be better than what the people have said, and take over. I think a lot of Americans would be concerned if the courts simply took over. 
By the way, I noted there was a substantial list of letters that were sent to the desk on behalf of individuals that endorsed Ms. Morrow.

Mr. ASHCROFT. I think the fact that these grassroots organizations oppose this nomination reflects the fact that they distrust an individual who distrusts the people. Whenever you have someone moving into the Federal court system who expresses in advance the fact that when people get involved in government, it renders an intelligent result ephemeral or unlikely to take place, I think they have a right to be disconcerted and upset. 
She continued in her article: 
Only a small minority of voters study their ballot pamphlet with any care, and only the minutest percentage takes time to read the proposed statutory language itself. Indeed, it seems too much to ask that they do, since propositions are . . . difficult for a layperson to understand. 
Basically, this says that lawyers are smart enough to understand these things but ordinary people cannot and, as a result, cannot make intelligent decisions. I have noted before that it is not a requirement to be a lawyer to be a Member of the Senate. Ordinary people can run for the U.S. Senate. And they do. You need only be 35 years old. 
I have also noticed that, very frequently, only a small minority of the Senators have read, in the totality, the legislation which is before the Senate. If you are going to say that laws are not effective and should not be respected because they were not read thoroughly or not everybody who voted on them was a lawyer, that would be a premise for disregarding any law passed in the United States. It would be a premise for saying that the laws of the United States are not to be accorded deference by the courts. And sometimes I think that is the way the courts look at them. 
They look at the laws that are enacted by the Congress and they say, `Well, we're going to have to expand that. We're going to have to change that. They weren't smart enough. The representatives of the people weren't smart enough. They didn't know what they were doing.' 
Frankly, this distrust of democracy is the kind of thing that provides the predicate for judicial activism where individuals substitute their judgment for the law of the Constitution, where courts substitute their preferences for the people's will as expressed in the law. 
This has been a particular problem with the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, which has been striking down propositions approved by the voters of Californians right and left. 
Proposition 140. A three-judge panel affirmed a decision by Judge Wilkin, a Clinton appointee, to throw out term limits for State legislators. The ninth circuit en banc reversed and upheld the constitutionality of the initiative. 
Here you have it. The people of California decide they want term limits, and you have a Federal judge who thinks, `Well, they don't know what they're doing. They're just people. They aren't lawyers. They didn't read this carefully enough,' and it is set aside. That is the attitude we cannot afford to replicate there. 
Proposition 209. Judge Henderson struck down this prohibition of race and gender preferences. People of America do not want quotas and preferences. They want to operate based on merit. So the people of California did what the people should do when they want something in the law, they enacted it through the constitutional method of passing an initiative. 
But the judge, Federal judge, thinking himself to be superior in wisdom to the voters--maybe the judge had been reading the article by Ms. Morrow that said, `The fact that initiatives are presented to a `legislature' of 20 million people renders ephemeral any real hope of intelligent voting by a majority'--struck down that initiative. 
Proposition 187. This law denying certain public benefits to illegal aliens was declared unconstitutional by another judge. 
Proposition 208 was recently blocked in its enforcement by Judge Karlton. 
Over and over again in California we have had this problem caused by judges who basically think that the initiatives of the people are not due the respect to be accorded to enactments of the law. And when judges place themselves above the people, when judges elevate their own views to a point where they are saying that they have a legislative capacity to say what ought to be the law rather than to resolve disputes about the law, I think that is when we get into trouble. 
Now, many confirmation decisions will require Senators to anticipate what will happen. We cannot really know for sure what is going to happen. Almost 4 1/2 years ago the Senate confirmed, by unanimous consent, without a vote, Claudia Wilken to be a district court judge in the Northern District of California. 
She was asked about things like this before the Judiciary Committee. And she stated, `A good judge applies the law, not her personal views, when she decides a case.' She said judges should fashion broad, equitable relief `only where the Constitution or a statute' requires. But she's the judge who said that the term limits initiative passed in California in 1990 was unconstitutional. Now, when the Federal Constitution itself has term limits for the President, you have to wonder if she is not just trying to substitute her judgment and displace the judgment of the people of California. 
Last April, Judge Wilken ruled that the term limits initiative, which was passed by the voters in the State, and approved by the California Supreme Court--violated the Constitution. The new law, Judge Wilken held, was unfair to those voters who wanted to support a candidate with legislative experience. I wonder if maybe she had been reading the material of the nominee in this case. I wonder if she really believed that `The fact that initiatives are presented to a `legislature' of 20 million people renders ephemeral any real hope of intelligent voting by a majority.' 
The ninth circuit court of appeals, which covers California, is the circuit in which these questions arose. Unfortunately, it is the most active circuit judicially. I think we have to be very careful when we are appointing individuals to courts within that circuit that we do not find ourselves reinforcing this judicially active mentality. 
Let us just take a look at what kind of legal environment they are in out there. 
In 1997, the Supreme Court reversed an astounding 27 out of 28 ninth circuit decisions. 
In 1996, it was 10 out of 12 decisions that were reversed. 
In 1995, it was 14 out of 17. 
It is obvious that the ninth circuit is out of control, filled with individuals who believe that the people are to be disregarded, that the intelligence resides solely in the court system. Frankly, I think that is a troublesome problem. 
Here is what one of the judges on the ninth circuit said, expressing pride in the fact that the court was frequently reversed. Chief Judge Procter Hug said in a recent interview:  
We're on the cutting edge of a lot of cases. 
Does the phrase `cutting edge' remind you of anything? Another one of those quotes from Ms. Morrow. 
We're on the cutting edge of a lot of cases. If a ruling creates a lot of heat, that's why we have life tenure. 
I really believe that life tenure is supported by the need for independence, but it is not to be a license to take over the legislative responsibility of Government. 
It is not to be a license to be out there on the cutting edge, to be writing new laws, instead of deciding controversies presented by application of old laws. 
On the ninth circuit, no judge is reversed more than judge Stephen Reinhardt, the renegade judge who in recent years has argued that the Constitution protects an individual's right to commit physician-assisted suicide. Of course, he was reversed by the Supreme Court. He recently ruled that school-administered drug tests for high school athletes violated the Constitution. His creation there of a new constitutional right again was reversed by the U.S. Supreme Court. Finally, Reinhardt argued that farmers lack standing to challenge the Endangered Species Act because they have an economic interest in doing so. This decision also was reversed by the Supreme Court. And just last week, Reinhardt reversed a lower court decision and held employers are prevented by the Constitution from conducting genetic tests as part of their employees' routine physicals--another new constitutional right found by an activist judge. 
Judge Reinhardt seems to share the arguments made by Ms. Morrow in her article about initiatives. To Reinhardt, the Constitution is not a charter to be interpreted strictly; rather, it is an outline for creative judges to fill in the blanks. 
I think judges who believe that the Constitution is written in pencil and who think that the Bill of Rights is written in disappearing ink are judges that are out of control. We have to be careful we don't put more individuals on the bench who have a disregard for the separation of powers and who do not understand that what the people do under the authority of the Constitution is valid and must be respected. 
I see my colleague from the State of Alabama has arrived and is prepared, I believe, to make remarks in this respect. I want to thank him for his outstanding work on the Judiciary Committee. He takes his work very seriously. He is a champion of the Constitution of the United States. He understands that the people are the source of power. He understands well that judges are very important. It is important that we have intelligent judges, capable judges; but also, judges that respect the fact that they have a limited function of resolving disputes. And in so doing they are not to amend the Constitution or extend the law but to rely upon the legislature or the people to do that whenever is necessary. 
I yield to the Senator from Alabama 10 minutes in which to make his remarks in opposition to this nominee.

Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I yield to myself the remainder of the time and ask you to inform me when there is 1 minute remaining. 
I am concerned about this nominee who has indicated that when the people are involved in developing the law through a referendum, you don't get intelligent lawmaking. I am concerned about that because from her writings it appears that the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals embraced that very view. When the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals sought to set aside the California voters' commitment to term limits, they did so based on what they considered to be the lack of expertise of the people. Here is what Judge Reinhardt said when he set aside the term limits initiative in California: 
The public lacks legal or legislative expertise--or even a duty to support the Constitution. Our usual assumption that laws passed represent careful drafting and consideration does not obtain. 
Where might he get an idea like that idea, to allege that the people are disregarded because they don't have legal training. 
Here is what Ms. Morrow said: 
The fact that initiatives are presented to a legislature of 20 million people renders ephemeral any real hope of intelligent voting by the majority. 
This is the judge who has been reversed over and over again when the California Ninth Circuit was reversed 27 out of 28 times by the Supreme Court. They are embracing this philosophy in those kinds of items. 
Reinhardt said: 
The public . . . lacks the ability to collect and study information that is utilized routinely by legislative bodies. 
Where could he have gotten that? Same philosophy as Ms. Morrow who said: 
. . . propositions are often lengthy and difficult for a layperson to understand. The public . . . casts its votes for initiatives on the basis of 30- and 60-second advertisements. 
Both of these reflect a distrust of the people: One an activist judge, one of the most reversed judges in history; the other an offering of this administration for us to confirm. 
I am calling into question the judgment and the respect that this nominee has for the people. And it is based on her statements. By contrasting her to Judge Reinhardt, I am trying to point out that the same kind of mistakes made by the most reversed judge on the ninth circuit are the kinds of mistakes that you find in Ms. Morrow's writings, and I think it reflects a confidence in lawyers and judges that permits them to do things that the law doesn't provide them a basis to do. 
The law says the people of California have a right, if they want to have term limits, to have an initiative that embraces it. But what does Judge Reinhardt say? Judge Reinhardt says: 
Before an initiative becomes law, no committee meetings are held, no legal analysts study the law, no floor debates occur, no separate representative bodies vote on the bill. . . . 
He does that as a means of setting aside the law, saying the people are simply too ignorant. They have not studied this carefully enough. 
Where would Morrow be on that kind of issue? According to her writings: 
In the legislative, many eyes review a bill before it is put to a final vote. Legislative counsel [another lawyer] examine it for technical or legal shortcomings. Various committees look at it from different perspectives. Pros and cons are debated. 
We have already in California and on the west coast in the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, a court of appeals that is reversed constantly. In their setting aside of initiatives, in their invasion of the province of the people, and in their invasion of the legislative function, they take a page out of the writings of this candidate. But I don't think we need more judicial activists. I think it is clear she believes the cutting edge of society should be the law and its profession. I think the cutting edge needs to be the legislature and the people expressing their will in initiatives. That is where the law should be changed. The engine of social change should not be the courts. The engine for social change should be the people and their elected representatives. When the people enact a law through the initiative process, it is imperative that the will of the people be respected. 
Even if you graduate from the best of law schools and you have a great understanding of legal principles, our country says that the people who cast the votes are the people whose will is to be respected. Because she seems to believe otherwise, I do not think this nominee should be confirmed by the U.S. Senate.

Mr. ASHCROFT. Thank you very much. 
Mr. President, we live in an information age. We have come to a conclusion and an understanding of an important fact, which is that those individuals who control information and have information are in a position to make good decisions. And, as a matter of fact, the basis of good decisions really determines the outcome of arguments and determines the strategy that will be developed, determines the course of a nation. No one is able to make good decisions without good information. In the computer world, it is put this way: Garbage in, garbage out. If you don't have good information going in, you don't get good information coming out. It is that simple and easy to understand. 
It works with computers; it also works with the U.S. Senate. If we don't get good information, we can't make good decisions. If we don't get accurate information, we can't make the kinds of decisions the people expect us to make in this office. 
There are a variety of issues which have characterized the debate as it relates to the potential confirmation of Dr. David Satcher: issues relating to the New England Journal of Medicine's conclusion that the African AIDS studies were unethical and that they were improper; issues relating to the study of newborns and the transmission of AIDS from mothers to their children in the United States; the maintenance of an experiment that left the identification of the children unknown long after we had therapy that would have been available to them if we just identified the children by virtue of the blood samples. 
We have had the issue of both of those AIDS studies. We have had the issue of partial-birth abortion. We have had the issue about needle exchanges. We have had issues raised in this Chamber about the Accident Prevention Center at the Centers for Disease Control, that center which is so focused, in some respects, on guns and their impact on the lives of Americans. It has been an issue because there has been a suggestion that guns, in some respects, qualify as a disease and has become something that we should address in the Congress. I personally don't believe that the second amendment to the United States Constitution, which guarantees the opportunities of individuals to have guns, is a disease. I think it is a valuable right for this country, and it is one we ought to cherish. 
But in all of these issues, the ability of the Congress to make good decisions, the ability of the Senate, specifically, to make decisions about a confirmation depends on the reliability and availability of the information. 
There are some troubling aspects about the unavailability and the unreliability of information that have characterized the information flow in this confirmation proceeding. The Centers for Disease Control seems to have felt that it could selectively provide information regarding the controversial AIDS study in Africa, the study which the New England Journal of Medicine criticized because people were given sugar pills, or placebos, at a time when there was a known therapy. And it is pretty clear that when there is a known therapy, medical ethics say you are not allowed to give people just sugar pills and send them on their way, watching them die. 
The New England Journal of Medicine took the Centers for Disease Control to task over this. The Centers for Disease Control was asked about it by my office and by others, and a meager stream of information came out. 
I hold in my hand today a report of May 22, 1997. This report has yet to be delivered to me by the Centers for Disease Control but came into my possession from a third party who had gotten this report through a Freedom of Information Act demand last year. It seems to me that when we ask for information like this, the Members of the Senate ought to be accorded at least the courtesy of the information being provided, but when we read the report, it may well be that it is the nature of the report, it is the content of the report that makes it difficult for them to want to share it with the Senate. 
Paragraph No. 3 says:  
Whether the use of a placebo in this study is ethical. 
So they are still debating 3 or 4 years after the start of this study serious questions at CDC about whether what they are doing is ethical, the way they are treating individuals in these African trials. I personally agree with the New England Journal of Medicine that to treat people as if they are laboratory subjects and not as human beings, to give them placebos when it is known that the HIV virus ultimately is fatal is unethical. 
But what is important here is, and I quote the language: 
This concern is because a placebo-controlled trial in the United States would be unethical. 
Here you have a document from the Centers for Disease Control admitting that for us to do this in the United States to the citizens of the United States would be unethical. I think that is substantial. For me, human beings are indivisible. It says in our Declaration of Independence, we are endowed by the Creator with certain inalienable rights. We don't have superior standing in terms of ethics and expectation because we happen to live in the United States. This flat statement by those in authority at the Centers for Disease Control reporting on this randomized placebo-controlled study in Africa flatly states that a placebo-controlled trial in the United States would be unethical. 
I find the unavailability of this kind of report to the U.S. Senate in a confirmation process to be troublesome. I think we have a right to be asking for good information. I think absent good information we won't make good decisions. 
If this were the singular situation in which there had been the absence of information in this confirmation hearing, I might say, `Well, gee, they have a lot of things and perhaps this is to be overlooked. This must have been an error.' But early in the debate, needle exchange programs and the support by Dr. Satcher of such programs were raised. Several Senators came to the floor saying he has never supported a needle exchange program; he would never support federally funded needle exchange programs. 
We asked for information from the CDC about that. We only got the information, frankly, after we had the leader intercede to give us information. When it came, it did show that there was a report from CDC that said that they approved of and thought reasonable and appropriate substantial Federal funding for needle exchange programs. 
But even--I thank the Chair for the 8-minute warning. I allocate myself 5 minutes additional. 
So there was a report that said the CDC itself supported substantial Federal funding for needle exchange programs. That is where you give dope addicts needles so that they can shoot up the dope and have less opportunity to be contaminated by a dirty needle. 
But what was strangely missing, uniquely missing, was the fact that Dr. Satcher had written a cover letter to the report endorsing the report. When I asked for the information, it wasn't forthcoming. Finally, when we insisted, they sent the report, but they didn't send the cover letter of Dr. Satcher. That had to come from collateral sources that we were able to generate. 
Stonewalling is a problem in Washington, and it is inappropriate to think that we can fail to tell the truth in this city and have the kind of Government that Americans deserve. It is a problem in a variety of settings, but it is a problem as it 
relates to the U.S. Senate and to this confirmation hearing. 
Additionally, I asked in my exchanges with the CDC whether or not they ever funded conferences that promoted clean needles, and they said no. They even sent documents showing that there were certain conferences devoted to clean needles which they declined to fund. But then later we find that there are documents, as the agenda of conferences, that reveal the cosponsorship of the Centers for Disease Control and other so-called health agencies that are designed exclusively for the purpose of clean needles. The name of the conference was `Getting the Point'--the needle point. 
We can debate needle exchange programs. There are very serious ethical problems in providing dope addicts with clean needles. What is a young person to think when the junkie comes up and says, `The Government provides us with these clean needles.' Must be OK to use dope, to have tax dollars spent by Americans to provide clean needles to dope addicts so that they can focus their activities and operate safely to inject drugs. The folks who pay taxes in those neighborhoods where the clean needles are distributed must wonder about the commitment of their Government to protect them rather than to provide a safe haven for drug users. 
But this is a disturbing set of circumstances, where we simply have an absence of information as a result of a stonewall on the part of the administration, and I believe that those who provide that approach are not the kind of individuals who ought to be trusted with the responsibilities of Government. 
I believe an individual who supports needle exchange programs, who would accommodate drug use instead of seeking to curtail drug use, who thinks that the problem is dirty needles instead of the addiction to heroin, is not the type of person who ought to be leading our culture as it relates to drug policy or health policy. 
I believe that the absence of information and the willingness to stonewall and not provide information does not characterize the way in which we would want to deal with our own doctors, our family doctors, and certainly would not characterize the way we would expect the family doctor of the United States of America to deal with us. 
It is in that respect that I think we understand that the absence of information keeps us from making good decisions--garbage in, garbage out. And when the agency decides to provide to the U.S. Senate, selectively, information which reinforces what it wants us to know, but withhold information about things that it hopes we do not find out, we should not reward that kind of behavior, that stonewalling, if you will, that absence of truth, that selective revelation of what they want us to know but not what we need to know. We should not reward that with confirmation. 
There is an epidemic in Washington, DC, of bureaucracy that feels like it can tell people only what they think the people want to know. It is because there are those in the bureaucracy who feel they know so much better than the people. But that is contrary to the values of America. 
The real value of America is not that the values of Washington, DC, be imposed on the people. The genius of this democratic republic is that the values of the people would be imposed on Washington, DC. For the values of the people to be understood, they have to be recognized and accorded dignity and respect, and they have to be formed in the context of information which is complete and thorough. 
Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.

Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I rise to say to the U.S. Senate that this responsibility which we are considering today is a very important responsibility. The Nation's doctor is a very important position. We should be very careful about doing those things which can and need to be done in making sure we confirm appropriately or deny confirmation appropriately to someone nominated for that responsibility. 
It is in that regard that I have sought to raise issues that are, I think, fundamental to the values of the American people and ask serious questions about them. I want to review those at this time. 
The first thing I mention is that Dr. Satcher transmitted to the Secretary of Health and Human Services a report favorably saying that substantial Federal funds should be committed both to providing needle exchange services and to expanding research into these programs. Both recommendations, according to the CDC's comment, are reasonable and appropriate. That transmission saying that needle exchanges should have substantial funding was made in a report under Dr. Satcher's signature going to the Secretary of Health and Human Services. 
It is pretty clear to me that one of the leadership responsibilities of the Surgeon General is the responsibility to inform the President or the Secretary of Health and Human Services of policies that ought to be adopted. This nominee has said that needle exchange programs ought to have substantial Federal funding and they ought to be studied carefully. 
Now, in my view, it doesn't make sense to give dope addicts needles with which to conduct their poisonous activity and with which to propagate bad habits of intravenous drug use. What are we saying to young people if the junkie comes along and says, `Don't worry about this, we have clean needles. The Government approves it. They give us the needles to use.' What are we saying to the families when the needles from the junkies are left by the hundreds around the neighborhoods so that young children will find them? As soon as you provide free needles--a town that tried this found 300 discarded needles by junkies in one week. 
No. 2, this nominee for Surgeon General conducted studies on individuals in Africa when the studies would have been unethical in the United States. The regulations provide that you are not allowed to do to other people what you won't and can't do to yourself. The New England Journal of Medicine made clear the absence of ethics in this situation. 
No. 3, David Satcher persisted in conducting blind HIV studies of newborns in the United States, ignoring the need to identify the blood samples and notify parents of HIV infections in children, even after therapies were developed which could help those children in those settings. When the Congress got upset about it and decided to discontinue the program altogether, Dr. Satcher said, `No, we want to continue it without telling parents and without identifying which of the children is HIV infected,' and came and lobbied the Congress in that respect. 
I don't think that calls us to our highest and best. I think that accommodates America at something far less. So you have this pattern. 
In addition, we have tried to get information from the Centers for Disease Control and Dr. Satcher. They have given us partial 
bits of information. The report in which the CDC commended the idea of Federal funding for needle exchange was sent to us but it didn't have Dr. Satcher's cover letter on it--conveniently didn't. The denial of needle exchange support by Dr. Satcher conveniently didn't indicate that Federal funds, provided through the CDC, had the sole purpose of promoting needle exchange programs. 
When we asked about the ethics of the African trials we simply didn't get all the information from the CDC. We were not given memos internal to the agency which we have received from other sources that have raised the very ethical issues in CDC by medical personnel there that we have been raising on this floor. 
Now if trust is a fundamental component of the relationship between the doctor of a nation and the people of the Nation, there has been in some substantial measure a breach of the necessary trust in the absence of candor and the absence of providing information in this setting. 
Last but not least, let me say that Dr. Satcher has said that he supports the President's position on partial-birth abortion. The President's position has been that he is going to continue to make it available in this country and refuse to have a reasonable law which would prevent it. In my judgment, it is time for us to say that we expect the leadership on health in this country to comport with the understanding of the health community that partial-birth abortions are not indicated, they are not necessary, and that to endorse the political agenda of the President rather than the health agenda of America is inappropriate. This is about whether someone who is indifferent to infanticide can care for our children.

Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I rise today to speak out in opposition to the nomination of Judge Frederica Massiah-Jackson to be United States District Judge for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. 
We have heard in recent weeks about the so-called vacancy crisis in Federal courts and that the Senate needs to move more quickly in putting the Clinton nominees on the bench. 
Well, I for one am more concerned about the quality of nominees than I am about the quantity of nominees. And I am quite sure that we should not respond to a perceived vacancy crisis by giving a lifetime appointment to Frederica Massiah-Jackson. 
Before putting this nomination into the context of judges in Washington, and the battles over judges, it is worth emphasizing the remarkably strong and unified opposition of local law enforcement to this nomination. I have not had a long history of appointments and confirmations here in the Senate--3 years. We have confirmed scores of judges over the course of 3 years. When I was Governor, I had the opportunity to appoint a couple of hundred judges. I appointed all seven members of the supreme court of the State of Missouri. It was a privilege for which I was deeply grateful and I took it very seriously. I thought it very important that we appoint individuals of high quality. 
Never in my experience with judicial appointees here in the U.S. Senate or in my time as a Governor, when I appointed several hundred judges in my home State, did I ever see a community of prosecutors step forward and say, `Don't do this.' Never before have officers of the court--and prosecutors are officers of the court--felt the necessity to stand up and say, whatever you do, don't confirm this one. Don't appoint this individual. 
At noon today I participated in a press conference with national and local law enforcement officials. Other participants included John Morganelli, the district attorney from Northampton County in Pennsylvania, and Ralph Germak, the district attorney in Juniata County of Pennsylvania, and Richard Costello, the president of the Philadelphia Fraternal Order of Police. 
I thank them for their willingness to come forward. They came to the news conference to express their opposition to Judge Massiah-Jackson. Interestingly enough, these are not individuals that you would normally expect to publicly express their opposition. District Attorney Morganelli is a Democrat. The nomination of this Democrat judge from Philadelphia was made by a Democrat President. It takes courage to put one's country and the judicial system above one's party. But District Attorney Morganelli chose to do so. 
Not only did District Attorney Morganelli come forward, but he also made us aware of District Attorney Lynne Abraham, a Democrat district attorney for Philadelphia. At great political cost to her, Ms. Abraham said this nominee is simply unacceptable. She wrote in a letter addressed to Senator Arlen Specter on January 8 of this year, referring to Judge Massiah-Jackson: 
This nominee's judicial service is replete with instances of demonstrated leniency toward criminals, an adversarial attitude toward police, and a disrespect toward prosecutors unmatched by any other present or former jurist with whom I am familiar. 
The severity of that statement is matched only by its candor and its courage. It is not easy for a district attorney who has the responsibility of sending prosecutors into that courtroom to come forward with that kind of testimony about a nominee. Most of us would not want to tell the truth about a judge that we were going to have to face over and over and over again. When District Attorney Morganelli and District Attorney Lynne Abraham come forward, speaking at great personal risk, I do not take that lightly. 
When Richard Costello spoke, as the president of the Philadelphia Fraternal Order of Police, he mentioned casually a fact that sent a chill down my spine. He said, `I have been shot twice.' And then he related the story of how Judge Massiah-Jackson had ordered undercover policemen to stand up and be recognized in court so that any drug dealers that were there would recognize them if they saw them on the streets. You can imagine what happens to an undercover policeman who is trying to make a drug buy in a case and the drug dealer recognizes the policeman. It could well be that that individual's life would not be worth that much. 
I think these individuals who have come forward have a unique blend of personal experience and an unparalleled amount of courage to provide this important information to the U.S. Senate. Nomination fights are difficult. I wish we didn't have all these fights stacked at once. But there is a level of quality that we must expect from individuals who are appointed for life to the 
Federal bench. If that level of quality does not exist, we must find it elsewhere. 
I do not believe that the talent pool of individuals available to be Federal judges in America is shallow. I do not believe that we cannot find moral people who are decent, who have an ability to stay in the middle of a controversy instead of joining one side or the other. I do not believe that the number of trained, skilled lawyers in the Philadelphia, PA community is so low that we have to accept individuals who, according to the district attorney, have an adversarial attitude toward police and disrespect prosecutors. The prosecutors are a part of the court and judicial system. They are entitled to respect. But this nominee is so far below the minimum quality we should expect from a Federal judge that it is tragic. The local law enforcement community is horrified. They are about to be saddled with a judge that they say is the worst. 
There is a principle, I think they call it `the Peter Principle,' where they kick people upstairs. They keep promoting them because they want to get rid of them. These officials who came forward in this case are not even willing to do that. They understand that this would be a mistake of unparalleled proportions. Washington may seem willing to rubberstamp nominees no matter how unqualified, but these courageous individuals from Philadelphia--and, I might add, the prosecutors association from the State of Pennsylvania, which voted unanimously against this nominee--are not. 
I began a minute ago to address the idea of the talent pool, the idea that there are people talented enough and capable enough, and who have the requisite integrity to do a good job. I am firmly convinced of that. What really troubles me is that the Senate here, now, is talking about maybe we can try and allow this individual to have another hearing, in spite of the fact that the written responses were inadequate, in spite of the fact that the oral responses of this judge, when heard previously, were inadequate, that somehow we could explain away everything. It is as if there is no other option. 
I do not think we should try to find a way to make the worst nominee that these folks have ever seen somehow marginally acceptable. We should not be seeking the lowest quality possible in the Federal judiciary. We should be seeking the highest quality possible. 
Let me go through some of the objections that the local officials outlined. These happen to be the basis for my own opposition. They are fourfold. 
This nominee has shown disrespect for the court by using the English language's most offensive profanity in open court. This is not a subject of debate. This is the subject of court records. You see, there were certain times when this judge's personal court reporter wasn't there to take down the testimony and so a reporter unaccustomed to the language of this judge just filed the report with the offensive language in it, instead of scrubbing the report. 
I think for us to say that a judge who uses the crudest profanity that we know in America in a way that demeans the prosecutor in a courtroom is someone that we should not reward by elevating to a lifetime appointment as a Federal judge. It is just that simple. There are some who said there have been apologies and it did not happen very often. I know that there are several cases in court records which show the kind of language that was used. They don't happen to occur in records that were kept by the regular reporter. But, in my judgment, when we have a deep talent pool, why should we say to those who are both in the system and hoping someday to be made Federal judges, or otherwise, that `it doesn't matter what kind of language you use. You just can come up and say you are not going to do it anymore and next time make sure that the reporter scrubs it out of the record.' We really need to make a statement that people who disrespect the participants in the judicial system do not belong as Federal judges with lifetime appointments, accountable to no one. 
Second, I already mentioned the eloquent testimony of Richard 
Costello, the president of the Philadelphia Fraternal Order of Police, and how this judge so favoring dope dealers asked undercover police officers to stand up and be identified in court. You know any dope dealer in the court wouldn't have been identified to the police officers, only the police officers to the dope dealers. Here is a judge who recklessly and without regard to the lives of police officials, puts those lives at risk. Officer Costello indicated that he attended the funerals of seven police officers who had been killed in the line of duty, and he didn't appreciate in the least a judge jeopardizing his fellow officers and his own ability to survive. 
Third, this judge demonstrated hostility to prosecutors by suppressing evidence and dismissing charges against criminals. I think the statement by the chairman of the committee with regard to the young man who was raped and the assailant who was captured, identified crawling out of the bushes, was eloquent and powerful. We need judges who will be fair and impartial. 
Last but not least, this judge has shown leniency to criminals in sentencing violent criminals to probation only, even when they have been involved in violent crimes on a repeated basis. The judge has used a technique to get to a place for lower sentences. When a person would be charged with a crime and the evidence would come in and show unequivocally that they are guilty of the crime, the judge would find guilt of a lesser included offense so that she could avoid having to impose the minimum sentence and could give a lesser sentence. 
There has been a great deal of talk about how there have not been very many appeals. Some have asked, `How many times has she been reversed on appeals?' Let me say this, if you are a criminal you are not going to appeal when the judge turns you loose. You are not going to appeal when the sentence is low. It's very difficult for the prosecutor to appeal. 
The Senate cannot confirm this nominee in the face of the strong opposition of the local law enforcement community and on the basis of these four fundamental facts, which are established clearly in the record and which require no additional committee meetings to examine. This judge has been a profane judge, disrespecting prosecutors in the courtroom by referring to them with the lowest level of profanity known in the English language. This judge has recklessly risked the lives of law enforcement officers by making undercover agents reveal who they are to the drug-running community. This judge has demonstrated a hostility toward prosecutors by suppressing evidence unnecessarily and improperly on a repeated basis. And this judge has shown leniency toward criminals by sentencing violent criminals only to probation when the record clearly shows that not only are they violent criminals, but they are violent repeat offenders. 
For us to confirm this nominee of this President would be to betray our oath of office to provide advice and consent. For us to confirm this nominee would be the height of arrogance and another example of `Washington knows best,' when the folks at the local level know what is right and they have come forward with great courage and inordinate candor to share with the Senate their sentiments about this nominee. 
As I mentioned earlier, never in my experiences with the appointment of hundreds of judges have I ever heard from prosecutors like we have in this matter. I've never seen so many stand up, be willing to call a news conference and say, `This kind of candidate is totally unacceptable.' 
We have heard a great deal in recent weeks about the vacancy crisis in the Federal courts, and we heard it said that Republicans are delaying for the sake of delay. In the case of Massiah-Jackson, I have asked that we debate this issue for the sake of the country and for its courts. 
I must confess that this issue is here in the U.S. Senate because of me, because at the close of the last session, I was contacted by no less than a half a dozen different Senators who urged me to let this nomination go through in the dark of night as a matter of unanimous consent. They said, `Let's get it over with; let's just get this done.' 
Well, that would have been an unfortunate mistake. It would not have allowed these prosecutors and local officials to assemble their briefs. It would not have allowed us to hear the evidence. It would not have allowed us to make good decisions as Members of the U.S. Senate. I resisted those efforts because I felt the nomination raised serious questions, it had serious defects that needed to be examined in the light of day. 
When the President comes and asks us to work hard to make sure we do a good job on nominees, I think that is a sincere request, but we should take him at face value. I think these nominees are important enough for us to debate, I think they are important enough for us to decide, and I think we should debate them and decide them in the light of day. There is no need for us to rush this particular item back into a committee room somewhere so something can be done absent the light of day and the scrutiny of the public. It is time for the U.S. Senate to stand up and to say that there are times when the President simply sends us individuals who are unacceptable. 
I placed a hold on this nomination and refused to lift it, despite the insistence of a number of Senators, including Senator Specter. Some would point to this as unnecessary delay, but we will create an actual crisis, not an imagined one, if we send individuals of this caliber into America's courtrooms. 
The Senate has a constitutional obligation to give its advice to the President with respect to judicial nominees, and, in this case, I think we should withhold our consent. I think that the President should have withdrawn this nominee. I can't imagine the President understands the character and nature of this nominee's conduct and wants the Senate to ratify that conduct by sending this nominee into a lifetime appointment. Surely the President is familiar with the litany of disrespect assembled by this nominee in her prior service. 
One has to wonder about the vetting process that raises no objections to a nominee like this one. You wonder what kind of job the American Bar Association did. They purport to be the `Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval.' I maybe ought to apologize to Good Housekeeping for saying that, because never has a product with the `Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval' fallen so short of its advertised billing. 
The truth of the matter is this: The Constitution does not give the American Bar Association or the Justice Department or the White House counsel's office the screening responsibility for Federal judges. The responsibility to screen Federal judges is resident in the U.S. Senate. 
Some have said, `Well, we ought to have another committee hearing; we ought to have this; we ought to have that.' The U.S. Senate acts as a committee of the whole. When the nomination comes, we are each eligible to evaluate the evidence. We are each charged with the responsibility, duty and opportunity to help make sure that the judicial branch of this country is properly staffed. 
The President should withdraw this nomination. The American people deserve better. This nomination sends the wrong message to criminals, suggesting that you can find a friendly judge whose predisposition is adversarial to the prosecutors. That is not my conclusion, that is the conclusion of the prosecution community in Pennsylvania. It sends the wrong message to young people that it doesn't matter what kind of language or respect you accord to the judicial system, you can still be moving up the ladder. Finally, this nomination sends the wrong message to law enforcement that the U.S. Senate doesn't mind promoting someone who puts the lives of law enforcement officials in jeopardy. 
I call on the President to withdraw this nomination. If the President refuses to withdraw this nominee, the Senate should vote to reject the nominee now. There is no need for additional proceedings. The President himself says we should have up-or-down votes. He says that there is a backlog. Well, if there is a backlog, why slow the system down with a reexamination of an individual who is unqualified to serve, who will not take this responsibility of the American judiciary to its highest and best, but who, unfortunately, will be found as reinforcing it at its lowest and least? 
Nothing will be gained by further delay or sending the nominee back to committee. We know more than enough now, and we know more than enough about the talent pool of lawyers in Philadelphia, PA, to know at least there are some lawyers there that could have a far superior propensity for public service than this nominee who has already soiled a reputation while serving in a public position of responsibility. 
We are constantly being told that if there are problems with nominees, we should bring them up and vote them down. Now is the time to dispose of this nomination. Now is the time to say America deserves better. We deserve better than someone who would profanely abuse the courtroom and the participants in the judicial system. 
We deserve someone who would do better than to jeopardize the lives of law enforcement officials. 
We deserve a judge who would be fairer than to arbitrarily dismiss evidence so that criminals could go loose unjustifiably. 
We deserve someone who knows better than to avoid tough sentences when there are repeat violent offenders against the people of our cities and States. 
I believe we have the votes, and after a debate in which people can see the kind of nominees that the President is sending to the Senate, we should vote this nominee down. 
I thank the Chair.

Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I rise to continue my argument and my debate in regard to this candidate for Federal judgeship nominated by President Clinton. 
Earlier in the day, I had raised several objections to this particular nomination, and in response to my objections, a number of answers were developed on the part of the Senator from Pennsylvania. I want to return to my objections. I think they are well-founded, I think they are important, and I think they should be observed and understood by the Senate. 
I raised the objection today that the absence of judicial temperament on the part of this judicial nominee was an infirmity which should be considered by the Senate. In particular, I said that she had used the foulest of profanities known to the English language in open court and in reference to a prosecutor. 
In explaining that, a proponent of this nomination indicated, `Well, everyone has used profanity at one time or another.' Let me just point out that I think the use of profanity in open court by the judge presiding over the court is different than the fellow who hits his finger with a nail while fixing the fence in the backyard. As a matter of fact, I think it would be important for me to just outline just what happened in this instance. 
In the case of Commonwealth v. Hannibal, in response to a prosecutor's attempt to be afforded an opportunity to be heard--the prosecutor was asking for the judge's attention--the following exchange took place on the record: 
The Court [judge]: Please keep quiet, Ms. McDermott. 
Ms. McDermott [for the Commonwealth]: Will I be afforded---- 
The Court: Ms. McDermott, will you shut your [blanking] mouth? 
Judge Massiah-Jackson was formally admonished by the Judicial Inquiry and Review Board for using intemperate language in the courtroom. 
I realize she has apologized in this respect for having done so, but I think it tells us something about the temperament of the individual involved. I don't think it is very instructive just to concede that other people may have used profanity at some place or on the ball field or in the cloakroom. The use of profanity in this Chamber would be a serious affront to this Chamber, as would any personal attack or other indiscretion or discourtesy in this Chamber. But let me go to a second example that relates to the judicial temperament displayed by this individual. 
The case of Commonwealth v. Burgos and Commonwealth v. Rivera. During a sentencing proceeding, the prosecutor told Judge Massiah-Jackson that she had forgotten to inform one of the defendants of the consequences of failing to file a timely appeal. Such a failure would prejudice the Commonwealth on appeal. Judge Massiah-Jackson responded to this legal argument with profanity, stating: `I don't give a [blank],' and the word is probably imaginable. 
A district attorney, John Morganelli, the Democratic District Attorney of Northampton County, Pennsylvania, has suggested that the reason there are not more instances of this foul language on the record is that Judge Massiah-Jackson's principal court reporter routinely `sanitized the record,' and the instances I have referred to here occurred in settings where, according to District Attorney Morganelli, there was not the regular court reporter. 
Now, I know that people lose their temper and that people use profanity, but I think these incidents reflect the absence of the requisite judicial temperament, but I think it reflects more than that. When you indicate to officers of the court that you are disparaging their character, when you describe someone's mouth with foul language, you are not just using foul language, you are attributing a character deficit to an officer of the court, a prosecutor. I think that is unacceptable. 
Perhaps those would be the kinds of things to be ignored or overlooked or to pass by, but I find it disconcerting. I find it disconcerting that it would be suggested that, well, since everybody uses profanity, it's OK for judges to use profanity in open court. 
I raised the issue earlier today of the contempt for prosecutors and police officers on the part of Judge Massiah-Jackson. It was suggested that the fact that she revealed two undercover police officers and pointed them out to be observed in the courtroom was a way of threatening their safety, because drug dealers would have an extra chance to look at them and know who they are and to be cognizant of the fact that they might be persons from whom a drug buy might be made sometime and, be careful, these people would be part of a prosecution effort. 
The Senator defending the judicial nominee of the President indicated, `Well, these people had already testified in court, so it perhaps didn't matter.' Well, it may not have. It may have been that during the testimony, they were seen by the other people. But let's look exactly at what Judge Massiah-Jackson said about these individuals and see if it tells us something about whether or not we would want this kind of person to be a Federal judge appointed for life, a Federal judge endowed with the authority of the United States of America, answerable to no one. 
As the officers were leaving the courtroom, the judge told spectators in the court: 
Take a good look at these guys and be careful out there. 
I submit to you that for a judge to say, take a good look at these police officers and basically say, `Watch out for them, they're the guys who might apprehend you in your nefarious activities,' tells us something about the judge. 
I quoted earlier the president of the Philadelphia Fraternal Order of Police, who said that the officers involved felt like this was a threat to them, that it would expose them additionally to bodily harm. 
It was suggested by a Senator defending the nomination that that was unreasonable, and it may not be as big a threat as some might think it to be, but Detective Sergeant Daniel Rodriquez confirmed the outrageous courtroom incident in a signed letter to the Senate. The detective sergeant had the following comments regarding this incident:  
I thought `I hope I don't ever have to make buys from anyone in this courtroom.' They would know me, but I wouldn't know them. What the judge said jeopardized our ability to make buys and put us in physical danger. 
It may well be that there are arguments that could be expressed in the Senate a couple hundred miles away that it really didn't put these officers in danger. I can't really say whether it would or it wouldn't, but I am prepared to take the word of the police officer involved, and I am prepared to consider his statement to be honest, and I am prepared to understand that he feels restrained now as a police officer in a way that he wouldn't have felt restrained previously. 
It appears to me that Judge Massiah-Jackson was willing to 
make statements which would impair the capacity of police officers to function. Detective Sergeant Daniel Rodriquez felt strongly enough about it to make such a comment in writing. 
Detective Terrance Jones, the other undercover officer that was identified and disclosed and about whom the warning was issued to the people in the courtroom by Judge Massiah-Jackson, also confirmed the facts of the situation in a signed statement to the committee staff. He stated that the `comments jeopardized our lives.' 
It may be that there are those on the floor of the Senate who don't take the comments that seriously. I really think that Judge Massiah-Jackson must not have taken seriously the threat to the integrity of these officers; she must not have believed them. Maybe some Senators don't believe them either. But Detective Jones said that the comments of the judge jeopardized the lives of police officers. Maybe not, but I would tend to think if I were an undercover police officer, that kind of exposure and identification, even if you had already testified, they must have felt that there was something there that was substantially threatening. 
He wrote in his letter: 
As a law enforcement officer who happens to be an African-American, I am appalled that self-interest groups and the media are trying to make the Massiah-Jackson controversy into a racial issue. This is not about race, this is about the best candidate for the position of Federal judge. 
And it is obvious he doesn't think the best candidate is Judge Massiah-Jackson after she, in fact, jeopardized his life, according to him. 
Earlier today, I also raised the point about contempt for prosecutors and police officers, and that seemed to be construed as some sort of inappropriate attack. 
In this case, let me talk about another example, Commonwealth v. Hicks. In an action that led to a reversal by the appellate court, Judge Massiah-Jackson dismissed charges against the defendant on her own motion. 
Although the prosecution was prepared to proceed, the defense was not ready because the defense was missing a witness. A police officer who was scheduled to testify for the defense apparently had not received his subpoena. The defense requested a continuance, saying, `OK, we'll try this later. We'll clear up this mixup concerning the subpoena.' The Commonwealth stated it had issued the subpoena. 
The defense did not allege any wrongdoing or failure to act on the part of the Commonwealth. It did not say the Commonwealth failed to issue the subpoena, that they fouled this up, that the case was fouled up as a result of misdeeds on the part of the State or the Commonwealth. 
Nevertheless, without any evidence or prompting from the defense counsel, Judge Massiah-Jackson simply did not believe that the Commonwealth's attorney subpoenaed the necessary witness. So here you have the defense unprepared to go forward, and the judge held the Commonwealth liable for the defense's unpreparedness, and on the court's own motion dismissed the case. 
Here is a judge that expresses her contempt for the court and the prosecutors, profaning the court and profaning the prosecutors. Here is a judge who expresses her contempt for police officers by inappropriately identifying them and warning the community against police officers. You have a judge who is willing to dismiss cases on her own motion even when the defense is willing to just take a continuance to clear the matter up and to bring the witnesses to court. 
What it turns out to be in the case is that the missing defense witness had been on vacation. The subpoena had been issued by the Commonwealth. The officer had not received it, but the Commonwealth had done everything it possibly could to issue the subpoena to help assist the defense in the preparation of the trial by providing the necessary witness. And Judge Massiah-Jackson's decision obviously was reversed on appeal as an abuse of discretion. But it tells us something. It tells us something about this judge and this judge's attitude toward police officers and prosecutors. 
The appellate court concluded, having carefully reviewed the record: 
We are unable to determine the basis for the trial court's decision to discharge the defendant. Indeed, the trial court was unable to justify its decision by citation to rule or law. 
When a judge does something and cannot cite any rule or any law to support it, the judge is just imposing her own preference, her own personal preference in the matter. 
The imposition of judges' personal preferences is one of the real challenges we face in this country in a crisis of what I call `judicial activism.' 
One of the other issues I raised regarding Judge Massiah-Jackson is the issue of leniency in sentencing. 
Here is an example. Commonwealth vs. Nesmith. The defendant had a criminal history of 3 prior juvenile arrests and 1 adjudication, 19 prior adult arrests, 8 convictions, 3 commitments, 3 violations and 2 revocations. If we were at the right season of the year we could then end with `and a partridge in a pear tree.' Nineteen prior arrests, 8 convictions. 
He was tried and convicted of striking a pedestrian with his car, leaving her seriously injured--broken legs, pelvis, four bones of the back--by the side of the road, fleeing the scene of the crime, and then beating into unconsciousness one of the woman's relatives who tried to thwart his escape. Judge Massiah-Jackson sentenced him to 2 years' probation--probation. This is an individual with eight previous convictions. Judge Massiah-Jackson sentenced him to 2 years' probation, a sentence that deviated more than 3 years below the lowest point of the standard range of the guidelines and more than 2 years below even the lowest point of the mitigated range. 
The defendant committed these crimes while on parole, having 
just been released from prison for an assault conviction. Over the Commonwealth's strenuous objection, Judge Massiah-Jackson sentenced him to 2 years' probation. Judge Massiah-Jackson, however, explained that the defendant's actions were `not really criminal. He had merely been involved in a car accident.' 
You wonder about a judge who can look at an individual who hits a pedestrian, flees the scene of the crime, beats into unconsciousness one of the women's relatives who tried to thwart his escape, and then characterizes the activity as merely being the activity of one who has been involved in a car accident. 
Here is another instance of leniency in sentencing. 
Commonwealth vs. Freeman. The defendant shot and wounded Mr. Fuller in the chest because Mr. Fuller had laughed at him. I don't know how you know someone is laughing at you or whether they are laughing because they just have a thought of something funny. In any event, the defendant shot and wounded Fuller in the chest because Fuller had laughed at him. 
Judge Massiah-Jackson convicted the defendant of a misdemeanor instead of felony aggravated assault. She sentenced him to 2 to 23 months--not 2 to 23 years--2 to 23 months, and then immediately paroled him so that he did not have to serve jail time. The felony charge would have had a mandatory 5- to 10-year prison term. Judge Massiah-Jackson explained her decision, stating that `the victim had been drinking before being shot'--the victim had been drinking before he was shot--`and that (the defendant) had not been involved in any other crime since the incident.' 
I think the people of the United States of America deserve a judge who will say that an individual who shoots someone, perhaps for smiling or laughing, is an individual who deserves a serious sentence. 
Here is yet another example of lenient sentencing, Commonwealth vs. Burgos. During a raid on the defendant's house, police seized more than 2 pounds of cocaine, along with evidence that the house was a distribution center--2 pounds of cocaine. The street value of 2 pounds of cocaine is astronomical. 
The defendant, Mouin Burgos, was convicted. Judge Massiah-Jackson sentenced the defendant only to 1 year's probation. Then-District Attorney Ron Castille criticized Judge Massiah-Jackson's sentence as `defying logic' and being `totally bizarre.' He commented:  
This judge just sits in her ivory tower . . .. She ought to walk along the streets some night and get a dose of what is really going on out there. She should have sentenced these people to what they deserve. 
Well, earlier this afternoon I had the privilege of relating the fact that virtually the entire law enforcement community of Pennsylvania has noticed this predisposition to be antagonistic to law enforcement. 
The Executive Committee of the Pennsylvania District Attorneys' Association voted unanimously to voice their objection to the appointment of this individual to the Federal bench. The Fraternal Order of Police, both locally and nationally, has expressed its opposition to this nominee. And frankly, the Democrat district attorney in Philadelphia sent a letter saying this is the worst judge that she had ever seen. The letter also states her opinion that whoever is appointed to the Federal district court for that district should be a black woman--that they need to have a black woman on the bench there--but also stating that Judge Massiah-Jackson cannot be the one. 
It takes real courage for a district attorney to say that about a judge who will stay in her current role if the Senate heeds the warning of the district attorney. And the district attorney will have to continue to send prosecutors into that court and be involved in that legal environment. But not only did District Attorney Abraham from Philadelphia, who is a Democrat, make such a contention, District Attorney Morganelli also made the same kind of statements, saying that we really have no business confirming an individual whose record is so replete with this kind of abuse. 
These points are points that I believe are easily understood. It takes a substantial amount of effort to obscure these points. But these points are understood--and they are painfully understood by those who are closest to this situation and involved in the courts on a daily basis: the police officers and prosecutors. Obviously, we would not expect defense attorneys to be here objecting to this nominee. 
This nominee lacks the fundamental commitment to the judicial system, to respect it, and to respect the participants of it. She has demonstrated that on many occasions. And profanity in the courtroom is important. It reflects a disregard for the court. But when it is profanity directed to officers of the court, it is a disregard for the system itself. And I do not think it is appropriate to minimize that. It makes a difference to me. I think it makes a difference to the American people whether or not we have judges who respect the institution over which they preside. 
I raise the issues about the antagonism to the police. It is pretty clear that when you warn the community to be careful of the police, to `watch out,' that you reveal a disrespect for this system that we do not need to institutionalize on the Federal bench. And when you use virtually every contrivance that you could possibly imagine, and even then when the appellate court says there is no basis in law, no basis in rule that would support the kind of leniency that you find in some of these cases, I think it is pretty clear that we have an individual whose predisposition is so favorable to the violators of the law that those who would enforce the law and the need for the culture to enforce the law are at a serious disadvantage in a courtroom like that. 
It is clear to me--very clear to me--that this is a nominee whose resume does not merit reward, whose recommendation by the President should be withdrawn rather than confirmed. 
During the closing hours of the session last year, prior to the break for the year-end recess, the Judiciary Committee was meeting. There was a debate over whether to send this nominee to the floor. And among those who are now saying that we have to have more meetings and more time in the committee were those who carried me to one of the anterooms off the committee room, and begged me, `Let's send this to the floor so it can be debated on the floor.' I said, `I don't think this is appropriate to send to the floor.' And they said, `You don't have to support her on the floor, but do not stop the committee from acting to send her to the floor at this time.' 
Frankly, the rules of the committee would have made it possible for me at that time to have stopped this individual from coming to the floor. It just strikes me as ironic that those who prevailed on me to send this nominee to the floor, and to allow her to come to the floor, are now arguing that somehow those of us who want to vote on this candidate on the floor or a withdrawal by the President are doing an injustice--that somehow by accommodating them and providing a basis which would allow the candidate to make it to the floor, that we were now wanting to act on that candidate and somehow wanting to act inappropriately. 
I think all of that is just so much process--whether you had the committee hearings, and how many you had. The key to this whole situation is, what kind of information do you have? And do you have the capacity to make a good judgment about whether or not to confirm a nominee of the President of the United States? 
This nominee who disrespects the system, disrespects the participants, disrespects law enforcement, this nominee who has done virtually everything within her power to make it easy on those who have violated the law and tough on those who would enforce the law, does not merit our confirmation. The President ought to withdraw her nomination, and, absent that, the Senate should vote to reject this nomination for the Federal bench. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I rise to speak in opposition to the confirmation of the nominee for Surgeon General of the United States, David Satcher, and I allocate myself such time as I may consume in opposition. 
Mr. President, we have had extended debate on this nomination. It is conceded by individuals from every quarter that the nominee is a person of great talent, of substantial intellectual capacity, and who has made a substantial contribution to the medical community. The reservations which I have expressed in no way are designed to derogate the record of achievement that this medical doctor has assembled. But there are a series of concerns which I have raised, some of which are so serious that I believe they would cause us to refrain from voting to confirm this nominee to lead us as America's family doctor. 
I would like to just mention four of them, as I conclude my remarks today. As is contained in the unanimous consent order, there will be another hour of debate on this issue tomorrow prior to the vote on cloture, and in the event cloture is invoked, there will be a vote on final passage immediately thereafter. 
These four points, though, I would like to raise, and I believe each of these would be adequate or sufficient as a basis for denying confirmation here. But certainly the cumulative impact of these particular concerns should weigh heavily on the minds of Senators as we move toward the votes related to the confirmation of this nominee. And in my case they clearly indicate that we should not vote in favor of this confirmation. 
The first is this. This is a nominee who favors partial-birth abortion. Partial-birth abortion is a procedure that has been demonstrated to be a cruel, inhumane, unnecessary procedure. The American Medical Association opposes it. Three-quarters of the American people oppose it, especially those who understand what it is. And for this nominee to side with the political agenda of the President rather than the health agenda of the United States of America indicates, I think all too clearly, that the agenda will be politics rather than health. We ought to have a Surgeon General who has a health agenda and does not repair to the politics of the President or anyone else. 
Next, during the time when this nominee presided over the Centers for Disease Control, he and the Centers for Disease Control sponsored studies in Africa regarding the transmission of AIDS from HIV infected mothers to their children. 
Rather than implement an ethical strategy for that research that was consistent with the ethics in the United States, they conducted the tests by giving half of the individuals in the study sugar pills or placebos, when there was a known, effective treatment. This was such a breach of the ethics of the medical profession in testing that the New England Journal of Medicine, the No. 1 medical journal in the United States of America, very seriously and aggressively cited this ethical lapse and said that these studies were unethical and should be discontinued on that basis. 
The truth of the matter is, the studies go forward. There are a lot of reasons that have been put forth in this debate about why they have gone forward. Some have talked about informed consent. It is clear the level of informed consent there would never pass muster here. 
What is clear to me is this nominee views lives differently in Africa than he could be allowed to view them in the United States. This nominee views lives differently before they are born, in the partial-birth abortion arena, than I think the American people do. 
Next, there were CDC studies on HIV-infected newborns in this country. No identification was made of the newborns. The studies were conducted after the blood samples were de-identified. This may have been an appropriate strategy before we knew that we could help a newborn that tested positive for HIV. But once we developed a potential therapy, to persist with the studies in the absence of identification of the infected newborn and notification to the parent so that remedial action could be taken, it seems to me a tremendous moral lapse, and it was characterized by one of the most notable AIDS researchers in the world as a breach of the ethics not only of the United States, but international ethics. 
When the Congress got upset about this and sought to ask Dr. Satcher and the CDC to cease these tests where you learned about the fact that there were X number of HIV-infected babies but you couldn't identify them, and therefore, you weren't able to tell the parents, what did Dr. Satcher do? He came to the Hill to lobby Congress that we should keep doing that, in spite of the fact that we had the ability, once we learned about the HIV virus, to be able to curtail it with the therapy, with the administration of drugs and other things. I think that compounds the ethical problems that were identified in the Africa studies, and it compounds the ethical problems that relate to the disregard for human existence that characterizes his embrace of the President's position on partial-birth abortion. 
The last item which was the subject of significant debate today was the needle exchange program. While Dr. Satcher has indicated that he doesn't support needle exchange programs, the documents that have only recently been released by the Centers for Disease Control find him in endorsement of needle exchange programs, and urging that there be large amounts of Federal money to support needle exchange programs. 
I don't believe that we need a family doctor for America who says we ought to subsidize the drug culture by providing free needles, by saying to the drug dealers, you can get all the needles you want, and when you want to go and tell our young people that they should get involved in your drug culture, you can have the authority of the Government with you to say it must be OK; surely, the Government wouldn't provide us with these free, clean, sterile needles to use in shooting up drugs if it weren't in your best interest. 
I think that sends the worst message possible to young people that the Government is a subsidizer of and a promoter of an environment in which drugs can be used with lowered risk. 
My own sense is that it makes no more sense to provide clean needles to drug dealers than it would be to provide bulletproof vests to bank robbers. We could surely make bank robbing a safer occupation by providing bulletproof vests, but we wouldn't want to do it. Neither should we make intravenous drug use a sort of project of the Government because we might be able to provide some 
safety to some user. 
I won't go into the details; we have already done that. We already know that people who don't care enough about themselves to use good needles or clean needles in drug use won't take care of the needles once they have used them. One town found over 300 needles in the course of 1 week after a privately funded clean-needle program was implemented there. I don't think we want our playgrounds and our streets and our cities to be littered with once-used free needles supplied by the Government that could later infect our children. 
All of these things that relate to a disregard for the right health strategy for America are disqualifying events for this candidate: partial-birth abortion, the African AIDS studies, the domestic blind HIV tests on newborns, where we persisted in this practice even after we discovered an effective therapy for these infants, and last but not least, the clean-needle exchange program, which basically wants to accept drug culture as a way of life instead of calling America to its highest and best and saying that the real problem is heroin, the real problem is drug addiction, the real problem is not the absence of a needle program funded by the taxpayers. The taxpayers do not want us to destroy their neighborhoods by subsidizing drug dealers who will not only use the clean needles, but leave them in places where they can infect the children of America. 
For those reasons, I believe it would be appropriate for us to reject the nomination of Dr. David Satcher to be Surgeon General. We do need a Surgeon General, but we don't need one so badly that we need to welcome one who doesn't really call us to the highest and best health that America ought to have. 
Mr. President, I thank you very much for the opportunity to make these concluding remarks. With that, I yield back the remainder of my time on today's debate, reserving, obviously, the time to be a participant in the debate tomorrow on this issue. I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I rise today to acknowledge and honor the achievement of Assist International, World Serv, the Hewlett Packard Foundation, and the Erie Area Chamber of Commerce in delivering medical aid to the people of Ethiopia. This group of organizations has worked to provide medical equipment to Ethiopia that can save hundreds of lives. This generous gift, valued at over one million dollars, will bring hope and health to many in Ethiopia. 
These organizations and the concerned Americans associated with them have demonstrated the true spirit of charity. The group cooperatively has donated a state-of-the-art cardiac heart monitoring unit to the Black Lion Hospital--Ethiopia's leading teaching medical facility. In addition to the cardiac unit, beds, mattresses, and other system support equipment will be provided. 
World Serv and Assist International have a strong history of providing humanitarian aid to relieve human suffering in needy countries. Assist International donated medical equipment to a site in Mongolia which was then approved by the World Health Organization to perform open heart surgery. The Hewlett Packard Foundation donated the medical equipment in the Black Lion Project in its goal to ease human suffering internationally. Finally, the Chamber of Commerce of Erie, Pennsylvania, has joined together with the other organizations and has raised the funding for transportation, installation, and training costs of this project. Specifically, I commend the Erie Area Chamber of Commerce for this cooperative effort and for holding the third annual `Aid to Africa' banquet to raise funds for humanitarian projects. 
The Black Lion project is an example of the compassion and generosity that other countries appreciate and admire in the United States. It gives me great pleasure as the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Africa Subcommittee to know that Americans are finding ways within the private sector to aid other countries in Africa. It is my pleasure to ask the members of the Senate to join me in recognizing and honoring the work of the members and staff of Assist International, World Serv, the Hewlett Packard Foundation, and the Erie Area Chamber of Commerce.

Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I yield myself as much time as I may consume. 
Mr. President, the nomination of David Satcher for U.S. Surgeon General has been a matter of significant discussion over the last several days. I would like to indicate that I rise to oppose this nomination. There are a number of very important reasons why I believe we should not confirm this nominee. 
During the last several days of discussion here on the Senate floor, we have gone through a number of topics, none of which reveals a record that would recommend Dr. Satcher to be the Surgeon General of the United States of America, none of which would say that this individual ought to be America's family doctor. 
We looked at the Third World AIDS studies that have been conducted and that are ongoing under Dr. Satcher's supervision at the Centers for Disease Control. You will remember that those Third World AIDS studies were the subject of an editorial in the New England Journal of Medicine, which has simply said that those studies are not being ethically conducted, that as a matter of fact, the studies were unethical. In short, the New England Journal of Medicine says that to give people sugar pills, or placebos, when there is a clearly understood and accepted therapy that is available, pharmaceutically or otherwise, is unethical, and that has been the position of the CDC in this situation. They have simply persisted with the administration of placebos, or sugar pills, for individuals, in spite of the fact that there is proven therapy available that should be or could be given to those individuals. It has been clear, even in the words, I believe, of Dr. Satcher himself, that these are studies that could not be conducted in the United States. It is simply that we don't treat human beings as laboratory subjects--to give them a placebo when there is a known therapy in this country. So the first thing we discussed pretty substantially last week were the Third World AIDS studies. In these studies the activities of the CDC, under Dr. Satcher, had been labeled conclusively, in my judgment, and at least very strongly by the New England Journal of Medicine, as unethical. They were called unethical because, in the face of known therapy, individuals were just given sugar pills, even though we know that an infection or a virus like HIV is often considered a fatal virus. 
The second item of concern related to the way in which Dr. Satcher has conducted himself as the head of the CDC has related to domestic newborn AIDS studies. In the eighties, there was a program to test the blood of newborn infants. It was a test that was conducted after identifying marks were taken off the blood samples so that researchers just found out what percentage of the samples were HIV-infected. Researchers kept that for epidemiological reasons or for statistical purposes, in order to find out in a particular community what percentage of the newborns were being born with HIV. 
Now, since that study began, and during the pendency of Dr. Satcher's tenure at Centers for Disease Control, new therapies have been developed that could maybe make a difference for some of these children. But Dr. Satcher persisted in doing the tests after the markings were taken off the blood samples, so that no one would be able to know which babies had the HIV and which didn't. We just continued to assemble the statistical data in the blind newborn studies. 
There are individuals who have raised very serious questions about this. Those individuals have been very prominent in the AIDS research community and in the medical community. These individuals say it's one thing to maintain a statistical basis if there is no known therapy, if there is nothing you can do, but it is another thing after a therapy is found to continue forward in a situation where you don't take the identifying characteristics for the blood and you just persist and then you don't notify--so you don't have any information to give to parents because you have taken the names and the identifying characteristics away from the blood. 
That was irresponsible. As you well know, there was quite a controversy in the Congress about that. And that whole program has been shut down. 
But my view is that the leading doctor for American families should have a view toward how to help families understand how to improve their health standing. When there is a therapy that becomes available, one should not persist in the maintenance of nameless statistical records and epidemiological data. One should try quickly to get that data to the people so that they can arrest the development of the disease in their children, so they can take remedial steps. And not only did Dr. Satcher preside over a continuity in the program that ignored the potential therapies, but also when the Congress came in to shut down a program designed for statistics which ignored the potential for helping individuals, Dr. Satcher sought to stop the Congress and lobbied the Congress to allow it to continue. 
I have discussed these two issues: The HIV studies in Africa and the HIV studies on newborns in the United States with the epidemiological data and statistics about how many in each town were HIV infected. 
I think it is important for us to understand that both of these studies place too much emphasis on the data and upon the research aspects without enough emphasis on the actual health of individuals. 
In each of those cases, very serious questions have been raised about the ethics and the conduct of those kinds of experiments. There is, though, another area of concern which I hope to be involved in more fully today during the debate, and that is the concept of needle exchanges for dope addicts. Most Americans do not want their tax dollars to support programs which provide drug paraphernalia, needles or other things, to drug addicts. There are some of those in the public community who think that we can preserve the health of drug addicts if we will provide them with good paraphernalia, if we can just provide them with the right kind of needles we can help them lead healthy lifestyles. We could help armed robbers have greater health in the conduct of their robberies if we would provide them with bulletproof vests. But I don't think we want to do that. As a culture, we are not in the business of supporting the administration of illegal drugs. 
I will spend substantial time later in the day talking about the commitment of Dr. Satcher in promoting needle exchange programs and using public resources to help promote needle exchange programs. There has been substantial debate over this. Frankly, there has been some confusion in the Senate about this, and I think it results from the fact that the CDC and Dr. Satcher have not been forthcoming. It is very clear to me that they have not been complete in their disclosure of what they have been doing and what they have been supporting. We have asked for document after document and, as previous discussion in this debate revealed, the CDC has been loath to send us information and documents. But all the trickle of information reveals a greater and greater commitment, on the part of this nominee to be Surgeon General of the United States, to support needle exchange programs which would provide those who are breaking the law with the capacity to do so, perhaps at less disease risk. But I question whether or not most Americans want to be spending their tax resources to provide needles for dope addicts instead of improving the education of their children or pursuing a variety of other objectives which might be undertaken. 
A fourth, very important item that relates to my reservations about Dr. Satcher is that the Centers for Disease Control, instead of focusing its energy on diseases and the eradication of diseases, has in some cases diverted its attention to areas far afield from the area of disease control or prevention, or even the development of therapies for diseases. 
Here is one example of another area they have moved into--the area of accidents. The CDC has decided that significant 
studies related to gun ownership are the equivalent of the examination of diseases. As Larry Craig, the Senator from Idaho, has eloquently argued on this floor, the second amendment to the Constitution--the right to bear arms--is not an epidemic. The second amendment to the Constitution of the United States is not a disease. We really do not intend for the Centers for Disease Control to be involved in some debate about the politically correct response to this set or the other about gun ownership. The Centers for Disease Control should focus its energy and deploy its resources in a way that will help American families have greater health and will help them maintain freedom from disease and the threats that real health problems can bring to them. 
Those are an array of issues which I think will be discussed again today, and have been discussed in this debate at some level. But I would like to focus my remarks on one additional matter for the next few minutes in this debate. It is simply this: That a Surgeon General who sanctions partial-birth abortions is unfit to serve the people of the United States of America. A Surgeon General who acquiesces in partial-birth abortions is unfit to serve as the family doctor for the people of this country. 
Dr. Satcher, in a letter of October 28th, 1997, to Senator Frist, said the following:  
I have no intention of using the positions of Assistant Secretary for Health and Surgeon General to promote issues related to abortion. I want to use the power of these positions to focus on issues that unite Americans, not divide them. 
Satcher goes on in his letter: 
As a family physician, medical educator, and public health leader, I have devoted my entire career to mainstream consensus building efforts to improve the health of the American people. 
Yet, Dr. Satcher has stated that he supports the President's position regarding partial-birth abortion. On October 21, 1997, in a response written to Senator Coats of Indiana, Dr. Satcher stated that he supports the President's position on partial-birth abortion. 
Mr. President, is that a mainstream consensus building position shared by America? Is the position of President Clinton mainstream? Is that position supported by most Americans? Does it build consensus? Thankfully not. This is pretty clear. 
A recent CNN-Times poll reveals that fully 3 out of every 4 Americans believe that partial-birth abortion is wrong. Nonetheless, President Clinton, Dr. Satcher, and their allies on Capitol Hill persist. The suggestion that Dr. Satcher is only going to do things that are mainstream to build consensus is immediately belied by his performance on this issue. 
Lest there be any confusion, we are talking about an abortion procedure that allows a child to be partially born from a mother's womb only to have its skull crushed by a doctor who pledged to `do no harm.' Most Americans by now understand the horrors of partial-birth abortion. They understand that this is a late-term abortion. They understand that these abortions are conducted in a way that results in the child being born 80 to 90 percent, and while just a small portion of the child remains in the mother's body, the child is then killed. This procedure occurs at a time in the pregnancy when the child could survive outside the mother's womb. 
One of the things that really strikes me is that partial-birth abortion is revealed on a continuing basis by science to be less and less acceptable in the American culture, because there are so many things known today that weren't known a few years ago. We held hearings in the Senate Judiciary Committee, Constitution Subcommittee on Abortion, and we solicited the testimony of Jean A. Wright, medical doctor and master of business administration. She is an individual who is board certified in pediatrics, anesthesia, and in both sub-boards of critical care medicine. What she pointed out was very important; that is, that these children who are subject to partial-birth abortion have an increased sensitivity to 
pain. 
So much of the argument surrounding abortion has alleged that these children can feel no pain, that it is not a person, that this is just a group of cells, and this is not anything to be concerned about. As technology progresses, science reveals that indeed these young, preborn children are very sensitive to pain. 
I just wanted to point out that in our hearings Dr. Wright made a very, very compelling presentation about the nature of this pain. The way they found out about pain in preborn infants comes from techniques that have been developed for doing surgery on preborn infants. When these surgeries are performed they sometimes measure things like blood pressure and the level of hormones and other substances in the blood. And when a person is undergoing pain, his blood pressure goes up. When a person is undergoing pain, that person's blood composition changes in response to pain. 
Medical personnel have noticed, both when they are doing surgeries on preborn infants inside the mother and when they withdraw the child from the mother for later placing it back in the womb to do surgery, that the elevation in the pain levels of these preborn infants is very substantial, at least as seen in the indicators that are associated with pain. So that the child's blood pressure goes up very substantially and the blood's hormonal content goes up. As a matter of fact, it is not a suggestion that preborn infants feel pain less than full-term infants and newborns. It looks as if prior to being born the sensitivity to pain is higher than it is once one is born. That would make sense because the preborn infant is not accustomed to being knocked around, or invaded, or cut on, or otherwise injured. So the child's sensitivity is very high. 
With that in mind, I think this knowledge just dramatizes the whole issue of partial-birth abortion--this issue of taking a late-term child, withdrawing that child substantially from the mother, and then destroying that child, which otherwise could survive with the kind of medical help that is frequently attendant to premature births. 
Dr. Satcher says that he has a mainstream approach and that he is going to pursue consensus, but he indicates that he favors these kinds of abortions. I just do not think that is a very unifying approach. I don't think it is the kind of view that is reflected in the mainstream of America. But not only is Dr. Satcher's view outside the mainstream of America, Dr. Satcher's view on this issue is also outside the mainstream of America's medical community. It is not just that the American people broadly defined don't accept his views. Dr. Satcher departs also from thousands of his colleagues in the medical profession who have declared emphatically that there are no health reasons or health justifications for performing partial-birth abortions. The American Medical Association opposes the procedure. 
I have to leave it to the AMA, in the face of their opposition to this procedure which Dr. Satcher is willing to embrace, to explain why they would support Dr. Satcher, and I would leave it to them to explain the inconsistency which I believe that particular position reveals. 
The group called the Physicians Ad Hoc Coalition for Truth is a nationwide coalition of doctors now numbering over 600 members. This organization has insisted there is no medical need or justification for the partial birth abortion procedure and that it should be banned. 
So we have a clear indication that not only is partial-birth abortion in the mind of the public improper--three out of four people do not support it--but groups as diverse as the American Medical Association and the Physicians Ad Hoc Coalition for Truth say there is no reason for it and reject it. Of course, as I indicated, testimony from Jean Wright of Emory University about pain in preborn infants provides another basis for the American people to say this isn't the kind of thing we want to support. 
Dr. Roy C. Stringfellow, of Colorado, wrote:  
President Clinton's medical reasoning for his stance on partial-birth abortion has been clearly shown to be flawed and not in any way in touch with reality. 
I am sure Dr. Satcher understands this, and I am sure he is aware of the fact that the AMA as well as many other medical groups and medical experts have recognized President Clinton's flawed reasoning. 
It concerns me greatly that Dr. Satcher does not have the courage to take an appropriate stance in regard to this issue. If he cannot be trusted to take the side of medical reality versus political expediency in this case, how can we trust him to fulfill the office of Surgeon General? 
We haven't had a Surgeon General for 3 years. We did not have a Surgeon General for 3 years because the last Surgeon General was so irresponsible, so outspoken as to literally wage an assault on the good judgment and values of the American people and on the values of the medical community. But I do not think we need a Surgeon General so badly that we will have to embrace a Surgeon General who will be politically instead of medically correct. And I don't think anyone who supports widely-opposed medical issues that are as clear, convincing, and consensus oriented as partial-birth abortion, or who will just defer to what political bosses dictate in that respect, should be elevated to such a position of high trust and respect as Surgeon General. 
I have just a few exemplary letters that I will be reading. They are by individuals from all across the country, from Massachusetts, Colorado and Montana to Florida and Louisiana. 
Dr. Helen T. Jackson of Brookline, MA, shares a concern: 
As a practicing obstetrician and gynecologist, I hereby state that there is no place in medicine for partial-birth abortion. This is a barbaric procedure which should not be accepted in any civilized society. No Surgeon General should be a rubber stamp for the President's position. 
This is not just a question here about partial-birth abortion. This becomes a larger question. If a Surgeon General is willing to go against the best of medicine in order to cave in to political demands from the President on an issue so important as the life and death of unborn children by partial-birth abortion, I think we have to ask ourselves, will we get the kind of advice and help from the Surgeon General that we need and want? 
Dr. Douglas B. Boyette wrote: 
Please let it be clearly understood that I would oppose the appointment of Dr. David Satcher in his quest to become Surgeon General. He supports President Clinton's veto of the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act. Obviously, this physician lacks clear judgment and, therefore, would be an inappropriate candidate for such an important position. 
Let me read a letter from yet another doctor. Dr. John I. Lane of Great Falls, MT, writes: 
I strongly urge you and your colleagues in the Senate to let the President know that this Nation deserves a physician of the highest caliber, not a politician, to serve as Surgeon General of the United States. 
I think Dr. Lane would reflect the concerns of a lot of people in this country. Sure, we would be glad to respond to someone as our America's family doctor, as our leader in terms of health concerns, but there is nothing more important between the doctor and the patient than the responsibility of trust. You would hate to think you were going to your doctor and, instead of getting good medical advice, were getting political advice. The American people want a doctor to lead us to better health, not to parrot politics. I agree with the letter of Dr. John Lane of Great Falls, MT, when it says, `The Nation deserves a physician of the highest caliber, not a politician, to serve as the Surgeon General of the United States.' I think it is pretty clear that we owe a duty of responsibility to the American people in this confirmation deliberation to make sure that we do not confirm someone who is 
going to advance a political agenda rather than a health agenda. 
Too often I think a lot of people realize this. They feel there are going to be political health agendas instead of the real health agendas. People have had real reservations about the way the research funds of the United States have been allocated. They have had real reservations about what has been done in terms of trying to conquer various diseases. It seems to them that some diseases are more politically popular and get a lot of support and research dollars, in spite of the fact that the same number of dollars might really save far more lives somewhere else or might be devoted to developing a promising therapy which is on the verge of complete development and discovery. But, instead, politicians take the resources and redirect them toward political objectives or to political constituencies instead of having the resources directed in the areas of real medical assistance. 
In a setting like this, we should find out whether an individual is going to be subject to political exigencies or whether the individual is going to take the direction of medicine. I think a real question is raised here when, repudiating the American Medical Association position on partial-birth abortion, repudiating the advice of the overwhelming number of experts that it is never medically indicated, the proposed Surgeon General of the United States decides to embrace a political position of the President rather than to advocate a medical position for the people. That is troublesome. 
Or consider the letter of Peggy B. James, a clinical assistant professor at the University of Florida College of Medicine:  
As a physician practicing for the past 17 years, and as a mother of three children, one of whom was delivered very early and was very ill but is doing very well now, I am abhorred that Dr. Satcher's confirmation may take place. 
Here you have a clinical assistant professor, a mother, a medical doctor, who has had experience--one of her own three children born very ill and very early, but doing very well now--who understands the tangibility of a child that is not born at full and the tangibility of its survival. She is, frankly, shocked that a person might be endowed with the mantle of respect to lead America in health decisions who favors allowing the destruction of such children rather than trying to protect them. `I am abhorred,' she says, `that [the confirmation] may take place.' 
One more letter. Finally, W.A. Krotoski, a retired medical director of the U.S. Public Health Service, living in Louisiana, asserted: 
The position of Surgeon General of the United States is too important to place in the hands of people who are willing to deny their oaths and medical facts. Should Dr. Satcher be selected, he will have enormous influence over the dedicated group of health care professionals who constitute the U.S. Public Health Service. Please don't allow this influence to be that of denied integrity regarding human life. 
It is not a matter of minor consequence. The opportunity of the Senate in confirmation hearings is a sobering opportunity, and it is not a matter of pleasure to come to the floor to say that we can and ought do better and that we need someone who is a physician above being a politician, someone who will lead us to better health rather than reinforce the politics of an administration. I think that is something we are owed and something for which we ought to aspire. 
So I read through these letters from Dr. Stringfellow, Dr. Jackson, Dr. Boyette, Dr. Lane, Dr. James, and Dr. Krotoski. These are letters which speak about the mainstream medical community's understanding, and they call us to our highest and best. They diagnose something. The best diagnosis is the diagnosis that is in advance; it doesn't wait until you get the disease. It says, if you persist in a kind of behavior, you will find yourself in a substandard position. 
This is what we have here. We invite someone to be the health leader for the United States of America whose commitment, when push 
comes to shove, is to politics over health, or at least who is willing to accommodate the political position of the President on partial-birth abortion, rather than someone who is willing to stand up and say what is true in the hearts and minds of mainstream and what is true in terms of the medical community. I think that kind of diagnosis by these physicians is very helpful. We should heed the warning of these doctors. In a sense it is a health warning. 
Mr. President, what message would we send by embracing a Surgeon General nominee who would support such barbarism? What does it say about who we are? What does it say about the moral condition of our Nation, when the Surgeon General, in the face of the American Medical Association and in the face of expert medical testimony, would seek to put a political position in place, or would reinforce that political position? He may say, well, I am not going to be there to talk aggressively on this issue. I am not going to be there to make a big thing over abortion. 
I can assure you that when the debate comes to the floor of the Senate, the Surgeon General's position will be recited. To have it suggested that there would be an opportunity for a person to be Surgeon General and not lead on an issue this important, whose position would be inconsequential on a position this important, would simply be to deny what the responsibility of the job is. The job is to lead. The job is to lead toward better health. And if a person is willing to put politics above better health in situations like this and say we are not going to emphasize it, I do not believe a person really is saying they understand what the nature of the job is. 
There has been and there will be more talk of what Tuesday's vote signifies. The New York Times suggested that this is a fight about abortion. They put it this way: 
Conservatives want to block this highly respected nominee because of his mildly stated views on abortion. 
Well, frankly, this is about partial-birth abortion. This is about whether we are going to cloak an individual with the title, prestige, impact and influence of the Surgeon General of the United States of America who is willing to support partial-birth abortion against the will of the American people and against the wisdom of America's medical community. 
Now, there are other issues involved here. It is not exclusively about abortion, but it is about abortion. The New York Times is right. It suggests that it is about abortion, and, Mr. President, this is about abortion. It is about partial-birth abortion, a procedure so cruel, a procedure so inhumane, a procedure the barbarism of which is so significant that rational support is hard to generate. I do not believe that reasonable and rational support can be accorded this procedure. The procedure itself defies that kind of support. This nomination is about whether a man who championed this horrific act is fit to serve as the Nation's family doctor. I am a little bit troubled by the phrase in the New York Times editorial, `mildly stated.' It has been stated on the Senate floor, I believe by the senior Senator from New York, that this procedure is `infanticide.' 
I wonder if the New York Times believes that if someone just mildly states their support for infanticide that makes infanticide appropriate? I wonder if we had a mild statement in support of genocide, whether that would make genocide acceptable? You know, mild statements sometimes cover over the most serious of circumstances. I remember a Presidential nominee who resolved that abortion should be safe, rare and legal--a pretty mild statement. But it is the same President who has consistently vetoed bans on the barbaric procedure known as partial-birth abortion. If my time as Governor and Senator have taught me anything it is this, that government and its officials teach. Teaching that partial-birth abortion is acceptable is wrong. 
There is a struggle in the country. There is an idea that our young people do not have the right view of themselves. They do not have the kind of esteem which we would like young people to have. Somehow, our children do not have the kind of self-image, according to a number of individuals, that we would want them to have. Maybe we contribute to the absence of the right kind of esteem and self-image in children when we indicate to them that they can be survivable, and they can be substantially born, but it's still OK and appropriate if someone wants to destroy them at that stage of their existence. 
If we want to teach children self-esteem, maybe we should begin to esteem children a little more ourselves. In the absence of the right value for children to place on their own lives, maybe we should seek to place a greater value on the lives of children ourselves. I think America deserves better than a Surgeon General who would show a callous disregard for innocent human life, even if it is a mild statement of approving partial-birth abortion. A man who would sanction and support partial-birth abortion cannot provide the moral leadership that the office of Surgeon General so desperately needs. 
Mr. President, I thank you for this opportunity to open this debate. I believe more than anything else, America needs a Surgeon General who will tell the American people the truth; whose efforts in the Surgeon General's office will not be to protect the political agenda of any individual but will be to help the health agenda of the American people. When we are offered individuals who are willing to go in the face of the American Medical Association and the medical community to support partial-birth abortion and support the President rather than the health concerns of the country, I think are shown a clear symptom of a problem which we would rather do without. The best way to avoid that problem is to insist on better for the United States of America. 
I note the presence of the senior Senator from New Hampshire on the floor. He introduced the legislation to ban partial-birth abortion. He is an individual who has been a great fighter for the rights of the unborn. He tackled the issue of partial-birth abortion in a setting that was very difficult and thereby demonstrated his outstanding courage. I am pleased to yield to the senior Senator from New Hampshire, such time as he may consume in regard to this nomination.

Mr. ASHCROFT. The Senator from Missouri had the privilege of being Governor for a period of time that spanned 8 years, and during that time there were substantial changes made in terms of the known treatments for AIDS. Since that time there have been substantial changes made, not the least of which is the O76 regimen for AZT treatment of newborns and expectant mothers. 
Do you know whether or not at the time of this alleged signature by the then Governor of Missouri that treatment was known and had been proven and had been developed?

My question is: Is it possible that a study that is based on epidemiological and statistical value would have that value and be appropriate until such time as maintenance of a blind study would be in a position to deprive individuals of care which had recently been developed.

Mr. ASHCROFT. I guess I will have an opportunity to respond, but my point is that it may be appropriate to do blind studies when there is no known therapy, but when a therapy is discovered, like it was in 1994, a year after I left the Governor's office, then it would be incumbent upon one seeking to protect the health of the children to identify the children and provide the information to those children. 
So I look forward to the opportunity and I look forward to seeing the documents that you would present purporting to bear my signature approving those studies. I would be interested to see those documents. I ask that you please provide them.

Mr. ASHCROFT. I would be very interested in seeing my signature on the document. More importantly, the point is this: There are times when it's appropriate to have a study and not provide notice. But when it becomes clear that there are therapies available and to persist in the studies without providing notice, that changes the whole dynamic. I think this is an essential and critical fact that hasn't appeared in your analysis and maybe hasn't appeared adequately in mine. So I will be pleased to discuss it, because the 1994 discovery of the AZT regimen, which cut by two-thirds the incidence of HIV virus cases that otherwise would occur, changes the dynamics. 
That brought the issue to the attention of the Congress, and the Congress forced the cessation of the studies on the part of Dr. Satcher. He lobbied against ceasing the studies even in light of that. 
I thank the Senator.

Mr. ASHCROFT. The Senator from Missouri thanks the Chair. 
Madam President, I rise to oppose this nomination because this nominee has an approach to America's drug crisis which is an approach of tolerance--in many respects--rather than an approach of eradication. That is clear by the fact that this nominee has shown a clear willingness to encourage needle exchange programs and to groups of individuals that want to sponsor needle exchange programs and to embrace a concept waiving State laws in America that are against drug paraphernalia that accommodates the problem of drug abuse. 
This afternoon, I would like to take some time to review evidence that shows where we are in this debate in our culture. We can then juxtapose that with the views of the current nominees. 
To begin the discussion, we must understand that the Surgeon General of the United States has a very important responsibility, not only to the people of America--advising you and me and families across America on our health concerns--but also in advising the Secretary of Health and Human Services and advising the President of the United States in terms of health policy the Nation should be following. 
In that role, the Surgeon General--`America's Doctor'--should not only value life, but also should value the quality of life in this great land. 
Drugs in America impact not only the quality of life of those addicted to the illegal narcotics, but also the children in our schools and the citizens of our cities. If you look carefully, it is pretty clear that of the number of people in our prisons--the majority of them have been involved with some substance abuse in the commission of their crimes. 
The Nation's drug policy should be one of zero tolerance. It should not be a policy of accommodation. Drugs are turning our once vibrant cities into centers of despair and hopelessness. We need a Surgeon General who rejects and fights the drug culture--who has no tolerance for the drug culture. A Surgeon General who says that America can be called to a higher standard rather than accommodated in a culture of consuming drugs. 
Many special interest groups are calling on Congress and the administration to turn our drug policy into a policy of accommodation and tolerance. Let me just sort of try to help you understand what kind of an approach that would be. 
Rather than treating drug addiction as the problem-- understanding that it is a criminal act and that it should not be tolerated, many groups have increasingly called for a `harm reduction' policy. Harm reduction advocates policies to literally reduce the harm of injecting illegal drugs. These policies include providing clean needles to drug addicts and for some--legalization of drugs. 
This was the case with the former Surgeon General of the United States, Joycelyn Elders, who actually said that we ought to just legalize drugs, we should make them available on a broad basis so that more people could have easy access to them. I think that is the wrong approach. I think accommodating drug users, I think providing a greater accessibility to drugs, providing safe accessibility to drugs sends all the wrong messages. 
The `harm reduction' school of thought is the idea that if we provide people with either free drugs or clean needles, so that there will be less risk involved in using drugs, that we will have done the right thing. 
The Harm Reduction Coalition's Home Page provides that HRC `supports individuals and communities in creating strategies and obtaining resources to encourage safer drug use. . . Rather than perpetuating the `all or nothing' approach to drug intervention, harm reduction--and here is the key phrase--`accepts drug use as a way of life.' 
Once you come to the conclusion that you want to accept for this country drug use as a way of life, you really have embraced something that is--very troublesome as far as I am concerned. I think America wants to reject drug use as a way of life. We do not want to accommodate ourselves with the concept of more and more young people and more and more citizens of our culture who are involved in drug use. I think what we really want to be able to do is say we want fewer people to be involved in drug use, and that as a way of life it is something we want to reject rather than embrace. 
I see that my colleague from the State of New Mexico is here and has come to the floor. And I intend to speak for quite some time on this issue. I would be happy to ask for unanimous consent that he be able to make some remarks, and then that the Record would reflect that his remarks would be somewhere outside the confines of mine. I think he would probably prefer that.

Mr. ASHCROFT. Thank you very much. 
As I said, there was a stream of thought in this country that says, we ought to begin accepting drug use as a way of life. It is known as the `harm reduction' school of thought. It is a philosophy that tries to limit some of the harm and to provide as much support as is necessary to drug users in the culture. 
Now, this is the philosophy behind the needle exchange programs which have gained the favor of the nominee, Dr. Satcher. By giving addicts clean needles, the argument goes, you reduce their chance of becoming infected with HIV, therefore, you improve their quality of life. 
I, along with a majority of Americans, believe that such policies are nothing more than a subsidy for drug use--providing equipment for drug users to administer illegal drugs to themselves, and hoping somehow that in this safer environment for them and somehow that they have fewer infections. 
I indicate that that is not the view of most Americans. And I do not think it is the view of many sensible individuals, including Gen. Barry McCaffrey, who is the director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy. We frequently refer to General McCaffrey as the `Drug Czar.' These are the words of General McCaffrey: 
The problem is not dirty needles, the problem is heroin addiction. . . The focus should be on bringing help to this suffering population--not give them more effective means to continue their addiction. One does not want to facilitate this dreadful scourge on mankind. 
Well, I couldn't agree more with General McCaffrey. We do not want to facilitate the dreadful scourge of drugs on mankind. We do not want to accept drug use as a way of life. Furthermore, it is crucial that we understand whatever we do in Government--we teach--we send signals to young people. 
What are young people to think when they encounter a junkie who wants to convince them to use IV drugs, and young people say, `Oh, I don't know. I've been told that's wrong. And I've been told that's dangerous.' But the junkie says, `Oh, don't worry about that. The Government gives us needles. And we can do this without risk or harm. You don't think the Government would provide us with the tools if this was something that's really wrong, do you?' 
I think it would be hard, as a young person who was otherwise tempted, to understand that the government would not be endorsing drug use. What does this do to our children? What kind of message does it send to America in terms of that to which we aspire? Does it carry us to our highest and best or does it accommodate us at our lowest and least? 
Is this harm reduction a means, by saying that we will tolerate this, that we are willing to embrace it, and not only embrace it but to subsidize it? And in so doing, are we willing to corrupt the next generation because we are trying to provide a clean needle? Besides--there are real questions about whether clean needles reduce drug use or not. 
Obviously, the Congress has rejected this policy of facilitating, in the words of General McCaffrey, the `dreadful scourge on mankind.' 
In 1988, the U.S. Congress began banning the use of Federal funds for needle exchange programs. The representatives of the 
people of the United States of America said, `My taxpayers, the people who send me here, don't want to spend their money buying needles for drug addicts.' 
I keep thinking to myself, I will bet you they don't want to buy bulletproof vests for bank robbers either. You could improve the health condition of bank robbers, if you wanted to, and make it safer for them. Under those circumstances, they would less likely die in the commission of a robbery if you would strap a bulletproof vest on them. But I don't think we want to do that because we don't want to participate, with Federal money or State money or any money, in the commission of a crime. It is something we are against doing. 
I do not think we want to participate in the commission of the drug crimes which spawn the robberies, spawn the assaults in our cities by saying, `We're going to make this easier for you. We're going to make it less risky for you. We're going to make it cleaner for you. We're going to make it more convenient for you. So any time you need a needle, we can give you one. You won't have to find one or you won't have to try and get one some other way illegally. We'll just make it available to you. That way, you won't ever have to quit taking drugs.' 
In 1988, Congress began banning the use of Federal funds for needle exchange programs. 
Last year, in 1997, Congress included language in the Labor, Health and Human Services Appropriations bill that would allow the ban to be lifted if the Secretary of Health and Human Services determines that needle exchange programs reduce HIV among intravenous drug users and does not encourage drug use. Well, I think it would be a very difficult finding to be able to make. 
Since it is the function of the Surgeon General to advise the Secretary of HHS on such policies, Dr. Satcher's position on the needle exchange program is crucial in the debate. 
Here you have it. The law now says that we will not spend tax dollars in this respect unless the Secretary of Health determines that needle exchange programs reduce HIV among intravenous drug users and they do not encourage drug use. So all he would have to do is say, well, I kind of think they probably will reduce--or accept a study that might say that they do, or accept a study that says they don't encourage drug use. And having done that, he is in the position to have the law of the United States go from not supporting needle exchange to supporting needle exchange programs. 
Dr. Satcher's needle exchange position has been very difficult to determine. It has been difficult to determine in substantial measure because they have not been forthcoming. There has been a set of responses made by the Centers for Disease Control which are incomplete. And the more complete they are, the more troublesome they become. 
A 1992 study conducted by the University of California moved the harm reduction debate into the mainstream of public debate. Also, this is the most often cited study showing that needle exchange programs reduce HIV in intravenous drug users. 
In 1993, CDC was asked to `review' the California study and give its `opinions and recommendations for Federal action in response to needle exchange' programs. 
In the review, the CDC embraced the study findings that needle exchange programs reduce HIV infection among IV drug users and show no evidence of encouraging drug use. 
The CDC, led by Dr. Satcher, made its recommendations not only on Federal action but also made recommendations on policy changes to State and local governments.  
The ban on Federal funding of needle exchange programs should be removed to allow States and communities the option of including needle exchange programs in comprehensive programs [programs that share Federal funding]. 
In the review, the CDC found the recommendation that State and local governments repeal their drug paraphernalia laws as they `apply to syringes,' to be `reasonable and appropriate.' 
So here you have the Centers for Disease Control, under the leadership of Dr. Satcher, saying that we ought to urge States to repeal their drug paraphernalia laws concerning syringes that it is a reasonable and appropriate recommendation. He is sending word up the chain to the Secretary of Health and Human Services that that is what ought to be done. 
He is also saying the ban on Federal funding of needle exchange programs should be lifted to allow States and communities the option of including needle exchange programs in comprehensive programs. 
The review also found the California study recommendation that `substantial Federal funds should be committed both to providing needle exchange services and to expanding research into these programs.' And they found that recommendations was `reasonable and appropriate.' 
So here is what you have. You have the CDC recognizing and evaluating the California study. And then you have the CDC saying, under Dr. Satcher's direction and leadership, that the recommendations are both reasonable and appropriate. 
And what are those recommendations? 
They are to spend substantial Federal funds to provide needle exchange services and to expanding research into such needle exchange programs, and they are to recommend that state and local governments repeal their drug paraphernalia laws as they relate to syringes, and they are to say that the ban on Federal funding of needle exchange programs should be lifted. 
Here you have a real conflict. You have the people of the United States against providing needles for drug addicts. You have Dr. Satcher running the CDC, evaluating studies and saying that it is reasonable and appropriate to start spending Federal tax dollars. Then he concludes, based on the studies, that there is no increase in HIV transmission or drug use as a result of needle exchange programs. 
Now, I have to say that this so-called review by CDC has been very controversial. In fact, it was made public only during the past 2 years after a needle exchange advocacy group obtained and disseminated a copy. Prior to that time CDC even denied Freedom of Information Act requests to obtain copies of the review. 
Here is what you have. You have the CDC on record in favor of needle exchange programs under the direction of Dr. Satcher. You have a refusal of the agency to provide copies of their review of the report. I can understand Dr. Satcher's trying to distance himself from this review. When I asked for a copy of the CDC's review of this report, it was not forthcoming. And when it was forthcoming, it came to me with a critical piece of the operation missing. What was missing from the report was the letter of Dr. Satcher--the cover letter--where he is `pleased to submit the attached review.' 
Now, I have some real reservations about the fact that the CDC would send out the report and not include the cover letter from this nominee. I can understand why this nominee would not want the cover letter to accompany the review because he has sought to lead Members of the Senate and committees of the Senate that he has not endorsed, not participated in programs that would promote needle exchange or clean needles for drug addicts. But I think it is beneath the dignity of the CDC and beneath the integrity of the Senate of the United States to send out the review without having the letter of endorsement on the review that is signed on behalf of David Satcher. 
In my opinion, for us to make good judgments about individuals who are before the Senate, we have to expect agencies to comply completely with our requests. To provide documents that we ask be provided--selectively--in ways which favor prior statements of a nominee, and to withhold items which might not be as favorable to the nominee and to provide items that might be more favorable to the nominee reflects poorly on the compliance of the agency. It could reflect on the integrity of the nominee if the nominee himself or herself is in control of the agency. 
It might be possible to argue that, well, maybe the cover letter does not really apply to the recommendations and maybe the signature on the cover letter, which purports to be a signature for Dr. Satcher, is not one that ought to be considered, but I hope that agencies in providing information to the Senate would allow the Senate to make judgments like that. 
The Centers for Disease Control has withheld relevant and material information I believe in an effort to mislead this body on Dr. Satcher's position on Federal funding for needle exchange programs. 
A statement was made on the Senate floor that suggested I was trying to mislead my colleagues by saying that Dr. Satcher supports needle exchange programs. A Senator stated that `Dr. Satcher has never advocated taxpayer funded needle exchange programs for drug abusers. Dr. Satcher has recommended to Congress that we allow scientific studies to answer the key questions involved with this issue. Dr. Satcher believes we should never do anything to advocate the use of illegal drugs; the intravenous use of illegal drugs is wrong. He has said that he opposes the use of any illegal drugs.' 
The key point here is after I indicated Dr. Satcher had promoted and sought to promote illegal drug use, statements were made in the Chamber that he has never advocated taxpayer funded needle exchange programs for drug users. 
Well, I think you can tell from the report I just quoted, which was sent to us finally, begrudgingly--minus the cover letter from Dr. Satcher--that directly contradicts `Dr. Satcher has never advocated taxpayer funded needle exchange programs.' No question about it. 
Let's look at the record. In addition to this, although it is difficult to find since the CDC consistently has withheld and delayed getting requested information to my office, Dr. Satcher has not been forthright in addressing his view on public funding for needle exchange programs. He has embraced the lawyer speak, Clinton speak that we have all heard too much of in the last 6 years. When asked the question about his position on the Federal funding of needle exchange programs, he talks about quality science or the administration's position. He does not simply answer the question. 
When my office requested information from the CDC on the `number of needle exchange programs, education or research conferences sponsored with Centers for Disease Control funds,' I was told that the CDC did not fund such conferences. The cover letter, transmitted with part of the information that we had requested, stated that the `CDC has participated in several conferences and other activities designed to reduce the spread of HIV/AIDS' but said categorically there were no CDC funded conferences in this respect. 
Understanding again the lawyer speak, the CDC only funds conferences `designed to reduce the spread of HIV/AIDS,' therefore, we had to ask for information on all conferences funded by the CDC that were designed to reduce the spread of HIV and AIDS. We asked for this information 5 days ago and still have not received it. 
Even though the CDC stated that it did not fund such conferences. Even though we have a great deal of information, including conference brochures, indicating that the CDC does fund such conferences. They found one `Award of Notice' relevant to my request, it was a needle exchange conference that the CDC decided not to fund. This was a Harm Reduction Action Coalition conference that was supposed to be funded by the CDC but the funding was terminated because the CDC could not approve the final agenda. The CDC is forthright in giving me information about a needle exchange conference finding--it is relevant to the request when they terminated funding but not when the funding for the conference actually went through. 
Let me go over it. We asked them if they had ever funded a conference that regarded needle exchange and whether they would fund such a conference and they sent us documentation that said here is a conference which we're going to fund--which happens to be the needle exchange advocacy group we already have talked about today--but the funding was terminated because we could not agree on the final agenda. They understood that they wanted to support Dr. Satcher's representations to Senators and to the members of the committee of the Senate that he does not support needle exchange programs. 
So we will look at the record. First, he submitted the review I just mentioned recommending the end to the Federal ban. Under Dr. Satcher's leadership the CDC has cosponsored conferences designed to advance the needle exchange agenda. 
I have mentioned the cover letter that I was sent by the Department of Health and Human Services Legislative Affairs Office, but now I quote:  
The CDC does not provide funds to support needle exchange programs, nor has the CDC directly funded any educational research conference on needle exchange, although CDC has, of course, participated in several conferences and other activities designed to reduce the spread of AIDS. 
What you have here is I have asked them if they ever support 
conferences on needle exchange. They say no. They say we can show you a document of a conference we denied because it had needle exchange in it. And then outside of their own response with documents we get this logo from a conference sponsored by CDC `Getting the Point.' I do not think it takes a rocket scientist to know that this is a needle. `A conference about clean needle programs sponsored by the Chicago Department of Public Health and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.' 
Now, it may be a coincidence that the Centers for Disease Control provided me information about a conference which they were going to fund but then terminated the funding, but when I have asked for information from them about conferences which they did sponsor and they omit those carefully--but I doubt it. 
It may be a coincidence that they omitted the cover letter which provided Dr. Satcher's direct connection to the assessment of the Centers for Disease Control for Federal funding for clean needles and for the conclusions of the California study--which--incidentally are not based on good science--but I doubt it. 
It seems like it is all too convenient that this agency--in pursuit of this nomination--selectively has provided to the Senate those things which reinforce the stated position, the public position of the nominee and has then deleted from the record those things which do not comport with the position of the nominee. 
It not only happened as it related to the cover letter on the evaluation of the California study; it happened when we wanted to know whether we really find ourselves sponsoring clean needle conferences and agendas around the country. And conveniently enough the cover letter was deleted and conveniently enough the conference that was funded was deleted, but the conference which was not funded was included in the evidence. 
I quote from a letter from the Illinois Drug Education Alliance--who attended this Chicago--`Getting the Point' Conference which was addressed to Dr. Satcher. 
Dear Director Satcher. As President of the Illinois Drug Education Alliance, I take strong exception to how the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are promoting clean needle programs in the State of Illinois. My understanding is that no Federal money is to be spent on clean needle programs, so I do not understand how the CDC can justify promoting clean needle programs. 
In Chicago, on June 30, 1997, the Chicago Department of Public Health and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention cosponsored a conference `Getting The Point' on clean needle programs. I was one of three IDEA (Illinois Drug Education Alliance) board Members who attended the conference, and I can personally testify that it was totally weighted toward clean needle programs. There were no (in italics `N-O') speakers presenting the opposite view. 
Judy Kreamer, the President of the Illinois Drug Education Alliance, persists to write: 
We were further alarmed to learn that the CDC is providing technical assistance and financial support for another conference `HIV Prevention Among Injection Drug Users.' This Illinois Department of Public Health conference also presents a clearly biased perspective. After a number of telephone calls and cooperation of IDPH, we were able to include a panel, featuring a nationally known expert, to present the opposing view. 
Critical point. The kind of representations made by Dr. Satcher to Members of the Senate have been that he opposes Federal funding, does not advocate Federal funding for clean needle programs. 
That was made so convincingly to a number of Members of this body that when I rose to say early in the debate that he advocated clean-needle programs or needle exchange programs, there were those who rose to vociferously contradict it and assure us that that was not the case. I think this evidence speaks for itself.

Mr. ASHCROFT. Madam President, the CDC also cosponsored with the Atlanta Harm Reduction Coalition, which is one of the groups who believe that reducing the harm of IV drug use through needle exchanges is an appropriate way for us to begin to accept drug use as a fact of life and a way of life in the United States.

Mr. ASHCROFT. Madam President, the CDC claims it does not sponsor needle exchange conferences. Two times during the confirmation process, Dr. Satcher was given the opportunity to make his position on Federal funding for needle exchange programs known. Both times, in response to written questions, he wrote: 
I believe that, as a nation, we must remain open to the input of quality science. Secretary Shalala's 1997 report to Congress concluded that needle exchange programs `can be an effective component of a comprehensive strategy to prevent HIV and other blood-borne infectious diseases in communities that choose to include them.' At the same time, the administration's position on Federal funding of needle exchange programs is that we do not have adequate science to conclude that such programs do not encourage drug use in communities. Thus, we have not asked that the ban on Federal funding for these programs be lifted. 
Dr. Satcher was asked and given the opportunity to state clearly, in writing, what his position was, and it is pretty clear that this answer is consistent with the way they responded to my request for documents. Asked about his commitment to a clean-needle program, he said that he believed we must remain open to the input of quality science, and then he cited the administration's position. Well, quality science without values can be dangerous. 
The Surgeon General of the United States should reject such policies as an acceptance of defeat and an embrace of hopelessness. We should not decide we are going to accept drugs as a way of life in the United States. We should not spend resources providing clean needles to drug addicts or for conferences that promote the distribution of clean needles. 
In theory, there are those who really think clean needles would help. In practice it doesn't work that way. Let me just give you some information about needle exchange programs. 
First, needles are not always exchanged. Therefore, they do not keep dirty needles out of our communities. The New York Times' reporter went into a needle exchange center and received 20 syringes without exchanging any needles. His companion received 40 syringes. They serve them up by the dozen. According to the Associated Press, in Willimantic, CT, `More than 350 discarded hypodermic needles were collected from the city's streets, lots and alleys' in a single week. 
Now, there's a great environment for children in America--to have used hypodermic needles from drug addicts discarded under the guise of a `clean-needle program,' protecting the drug addicts, but exposing the children of America. It is obvious that we are teaching the wrong things to children when we teach them that we will provide them with clean needles so that they can involve themselves in drugs, but in one week in a small town in Connecticut, there were 350 discarded syringes. You know, of all the clean-needle studies I have heard about, they don't talk about the discarded syringes. Frankly, I suppose it is supposed to be laid at the feet of the Congress because we said it would cut down on HIV infections in drug users and would not increase drug use. Well, it doesn't ask about what happens to the children of the country. I think maybe we ought to think a little more carefully about what happens to the children. 
Here is an article from USA Today, September 17, 1997: 
Ms. Fiske says the exchange gets back one-third to one-half of the needles it gives out. That's not ideal, she says, but `one-for-one exchange does not fit the reality of how injection drug users live. Some of them are homeless. What are they going to do--put the dirty needles in their pockets for a week? 
So the clean-needle advocates say, if we have 50 percent of the needles tossed on the road or available as sort of medical waste, contaminated with perhaps the deadly virus of HIV, that is a sacrifice we are willing to make in order to be able to accept drug use as a way of life. I don't think that is leadership or where we want to lead this country. That is not the kind of health 
to which we want the Surgeon General of the United States to summon us. We don't want to be summoned to an environment of drug use and dirty needles laying around. 
It goes on: 
It is 1:30 p.m., time for the exchange to close. Within minutes, the tables and leftover supplies are wedged back inside Acker's car. But she isn't done yet. Now she drives about a mile back to the neighborhood near the old exchange site and pulls up in front of a row house. 
Out comes Kellie Jones, a sometime drug user who has spent a rough 45 years on the streets. Acker gives her a garbage bag full of 900 boxed, sterile syringes. By 10 that night, Jones says, the bag will be empty and the clean needles will be in neighborhood shooting galleries. 
She distributes the needles, she says, because `AIDS is such a horrible death,' one she has seen. `The public should know that this isn't about condoning drug use. This is about stopping the madness.' 
I think if you are going to give out 900 needles in one night, 450 will come back and the rest will be found somewhere in the culture, it is about the madness. I think it injures the quality of life in our communities. 
From the Pittsburgh Post Gazette, a letter to the editor: 
. . . Aside from my personal aversion to the destruction needle exchange undeniably perpetuates in the life of the addicts, there are several other key issues that . . . are of concern to myself and my neighbors. 
Our community has worked hard to battle the drug problem that plagues our neighborhoods at many levels. But the needle exchange program gives dealers and users one more reason to stay here. In addition, drug users from outside our community now find reasons to frequent our neighborhood. 
Drug addiction is not a victimless crime. Not only does it kill the addict, but also, in the process, the addict preys on those around him. Prostitution, burglary, and now violence are an increasing problem in our community. So while the needle exchange people try to help addicts, they do so at the expense of our neighborhood. 
You wonder about taxpayers who establish neighborhoods, who own homes, pay their taxes, what they think of a Government that provides needles so that addicts will come to their neighborhoods and they help addicts at the expense of the neighborhood.  
The needle exchange people, who do not live in our community, have been allowed to operate openly for more than two years here, while the police and neighbors looked the other way. We have seen no noticeable changes of a positive nature. The drug problem only gets worse. 
Sadly, AIDS is a fact of drug addiction. But the truth is, nothing but recovery and abstinence can truly save the addict. Most addicts do not die from AIDS, but from a host of other tragic consequences directly related to a life of addiction . . . 
This citizen from Pittsburgh, PA, I think tells us something about needle exchange programs. 
Here is a letter from the editor of the New York Times: 
Ever since the Lower East Side Harm Reduction Center-- 
Remember the harm reduction group, the kind of group that sponsors these kinds of programs that have been subsidized by American tax dollars through the CDC. 
Ever since the Lower East Side Harm Reduction Center, a needle exchange program, began operating in a storefront in a residential population of working poor, our community has witnessed drug abuse not seen since Operation Pressure Point cleared the area of drugs in the 1980's. Needle exchange is a link in a chain called `one-stop shopping.' You can receive your Government-sponsored clean needles (there is no limit to the number), rob and steal to get money for drugs (or sell your clean needles), buy cocaine in store fronts, or heroin on any corner, then leave behind a pool of blood, dirty syringes, glycine bags, alcohol swabs, and bottle caps--the debris of a depraved individual. The needle exchange program has legitimized drug use on the lower east side. 
`The needle exchange program has legitimized drug use.' That is the key. That is the problem. We don't want to make drug use legitimate. 
And by a tacit approval has invited a population of predators into our community. Statistics on the spread of AIDS cannot be the only criterion for measuring the success of the program. 
One of the inevitable consequences of needle exchange programs is that the police look the other way. I mean, after all, if you are going to give them the needle with which they are to use the illegal drug, you are not really in the position to go and ask them to stop using the illegal drug. 
So we compromise the integrity of the law enforcement community. We make them duplicitous individuals who say one thing but have to do another. We make the police house, a station house, a house divided. 
From South Tucson, the Arizona Daily Star News: 
When the unmarked police car pulled behind the Wagon Wheel Bar yesterday afternoon, a young woman in a black hat was squatting by the back wall with both hands on one ankle. `She is shooting,' said Gerald Brewer, South Tucson Police Chief. Brewer was checking areas frequented by intravenous drug users when he happened upon the woman who stood and walked over toward South 6th Avenue when the police car stopped. `Police, stop,' Brewer yelled, as he stepped from the car and walked after the woman. But she didn't stop, even as Brewer pulled a gun from his ankle holster and shouted at her several more times. She disappeared around the corner of the bar and Brewer didn't follow. She had shot the dope up and already she was rubbing her ankles. So there is no substance on her. `She has discarded the syringe,' Brewer said, explaining why he didn't chase her. After turning a trick, prostitutes go to drug houses near South 6th Avenue to buy heroin. Then they fire up in a vacant lot, or an alley, before heading back to 6th Avenue to repeat the cycle. 
The point here that is being made is since it is no longer illegal, since the government gave you the needle, once the drug is injected into you, and you are no longer carrying the substance-- at least outside your body and in your bloodstream --you are no longer subject to arrest, you end up demoralizing the police, and you end up making it impossible for individuals to enforce the law. 
This article is from the Vancouver Sun about Glasgow, Scotland which is called `The drug injecting capital of the world.' That is a title we don't want to wrest from their control. They have a massive needle exchange program there that makes it possible for individuals to be drug injectors very conveniently, theoretically, safely. 
The article from the Vancouver Sun says: 
Michelle is 20. She is soaked through, wearing all the clothes she owns. A thin, pretty, guarded girl in a sodden, flimsy top and light trousers. She has been on drugs for 5 years, and sleeps in an abandoned warehouse with her boyfriend, Michael, 26. Both had spent the equivalent of $800 Canadian on two days of heroin. Michelle isn't sure if she has 17 or 25 convictions for shoplifting. Michael has spent all but six months of the past 10 years in prison for two serious assaults. `I was out of it, stoned, both times', and has been on drugs for longer. Before Michael, Michelle lived with another junkie who repeatedly beat her up. She lost the baby she was carrying. `I'd rather be dead than to live like this,' she says. The unemotional delivery convinces you she means it. And, as she walks away in the rain, you realize that she is almost certainly moving toward it. 
Yes. `The drug injection capital of the world,' fueled by a 
clean needle program. 
As teen drug use continues to rise, as the use of heroin, cocaine, and marijuana continues to rise, the Federal Government should not be sending the message that drug use should be accepted. The Federal Government should not embrace drug use as a way of life. The Federal Government should not subsidize illegal drug use through clean needle programs. And the Centers for Disease Control should not advocate spending taxpayer dollars to provide clean needles which will find their way into the alleys and playgrounds and streets of American cities discarded by irresponsible IV drug users. And people who run the programs now that are privately funded or otherwise locally funded say that the 50 percent return is all you can expect. 
Teen drug use is up 105 percent from 1992 to 1995. The Office of the National Drug Control Policy, led by America's Drug Czar, General Barry McCaffrey, strongly opposes the needle exchange program. 
On August 20, the Office of National Drug Control Policy issued a statement: `Federal treatment funds should not be diverted to short-term harm reduction efforts like needle exchange programs.' 
We are told by those who keep statistics on drugs that more teenagers and young adults tried heroin for the first time in 1996 than ever before. Imagine what would be the case if it had the endorsement of the Federal Government. 
Speaking in front of a Harvard research conference, General McCaffrey called spending money on the needle exchange program a `copout.' He said, `The problem isn't dirty needles. It is the injection of illegal drugs.' 
His statement, I believe, is the policy that is appropriate. 
Here is a story from the Buffalo News, August 24, 1997 `Accepting Defeat.' 
The needle exchange is one of the few places where addicts aren't treated like losers, although that is how many view themselves. `There is no more shame in me,' said a 36-year old woman from the Buffalo who has been shooting up for 15 years. The woman, who asked not to be identified, has lived in heroin shooting galleries, and worked as a prostitute to support her addiction that costs more than $100 a day. She wears her terrible life on a racked, puffy face. To prevent three of her children from being placed in foster care, she sent them away years ago to live with a sister in North Carolina. But she can't stop thinking of them. She has attached to her blouse a section of an old rosary that belonged to her daughter's godmother. Next to it is a piece of jewelry she found, a gold heart surrounded by the words `Perfect Mom.' `I pray a lot despite the life I lead,' she said. `I know it sounds farfetched. It helps me think that maybe there is a chance I can have my children back.' 
The Buffalo News talked about the two sites which together have distributed 713,000 hypodermics in less than 4 years. They have also taken in about 600,000 needles, not in the exchange program necessarily, many of which would have littered the city neighborhoods in the exchange program. 
Needle exchange programs are not always as effective as their advocats suggest to the public. Connecticut has six needle exchange programs, and repealed its syringe prescription law in 1992. It has intravenous drug use related AIDS at 61 percent. This is almost double the national average. 
New York has 10 needle exchange programs, but has intravenous drug use related AIDS at 49 percent. It is also a lot higher than the national average of 33 percent. 
Italy and Spain have a 70-percent HIV rate among IV drug users, and have never had a restriction on the sale of needles. So they are freely available there. It is pretty clear, at least, I think from looking at the data, that there is no conclusive evidence that making needles available and providing them freely reduces the HIV infection rate. Embracing the harm reduction--defeatist--philosophy to any degree will lead to further 
tolerance of drug addiction. 
The so-called `syringe experiment' I think we have all heard about. First, they started a needle exchange program. Then they opened the needle park so that they could give addicts a place to shoot up. Obviously, it is a park in which they just allow drug use. Then, in order to cut down on crime, they began giving 1,000 addicts doses of heroin. And that will increase to 5,000 this year. This is an effort, a growing momentum, to legalize all drugs. 
It is a question of whether or not we as a culture want to say that we accept drug use as a way of life, or whether we want to say we want to correct this problem in America. 
I believe that we ought to stay with General McCaffrey; that the problem is not dirty needles. `The problem is heroin addiction. The focus should be on bringing help to this suffering population--not to give them more effective means to continue their addiction. One doesn't want to facilitate this dreadful scourge on mankind.' 
How does this relate to the nomination of Dr. David Satcher? Unfortunately it relates directly. Dr. Satcher has been less than candid with the U.S. Senate, and has been less than candid with Members of this Senate in providing his record on the needle exchange programs. The Centers for Disease Control, under his direction and authority, selectively has provided to the Senate materials which would indicate that he does not have a program supporting needle exchange when a more thorough review of the Record indicates that he has personally endorsed programs that would promote needle exchange opportunities. 
It is troublesome to me why this nominee would provide information on a selective basis. 
It is, second, troublesome to me that he would support a clean needles program. 
And, third, I would say that the single most important thing that must exist between the Nation and its family doctor is the idea of trust. I believe that the elements of that required trust are lacking in the way that the CDC has provided information, and its selective provision of information and its withholding of information that is important. 
The needle exchange program is just one of the reasons that I believe this nomination should not go forward. The needle exchange program flies in the face of the values of the American people whom I believe really endorse General Barry McCaffrey--understanding that the addiction is the problem, and for us to support that addiction with a clean needle program would make no sense. 
For these and the reasons relating to the AIDS studies, for the reasons related to the deployment of the resources of the Centers for Disease Control to limit the availability of or access of citizens to their second amendment rights, I believe we should reject this candidate. 
I was, I think, safely in the population of the Senate believing that there were no problems with an individual whose record is so replete with qualification and qualification at one time. It is true that Dr. Satcher is a remarkable person, and he has done great things. I thought that one of the Senators failed to mention that the Denver Broncos had won the Super Bowl for the first time under Dr. Satcher's direction of the CDC. But that is about the only good thing that hasn't flowed. 
But the truth of the matter is that there are other important considerations. David Keene came to my office late last year and began to alert me to the need for us to look more carefully at this candidacy, and to see the critical points of attention between the values of America and the willingness of this candidate to support things like the needle exchange, and to support things like research on other continents that could not be done here to support concepts like partial-birth abortion. 
While all of these things are related to science and can be undertaken by individuals of great intellect and may only be undertaken by individuals of great intellect and training, they are at odds with the values of America. There should be an understanding that Americans do not want to sponsor the criminal activity of intravenous drug use, that Americans do not want to treat people on the other side of the world as medical experiment subjects instead of as human beings. They don't want to give them sugar pills if giving sugar pills would be illegal in the United States. They don't want to pretend that we have been ethical by saying that we got the consent of all the people involved in the medical studies when those consents were not only seriously challenged--but had to be strengthened--on the advise of ethics boards because the consents were not appropriately obtained. 
This conflict of values is at the heart of this nomination. I believe the conflict is so substantial that we would be well served to ask the President to send us an individual whose commitment to the public health reflected the values of the American people. 
I take this opportunity to thank Mr. Keene who came to see me and who brought to my attention the need for this particular kind of investigation, which I believe demonstrates that this nomination should not be confirmed by the Senate.

Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, and I do not intend to object, I am troubled by moving to this measure because I have sought information from this administration, from the Centers for Disease Control, and that information has not been forthcoming. 
I thank the majority leader for his willingness to assist me in this respect. He has been very gracious and helpful to me in seeking to get the information that I have requested. I will continue to propound that request, and I have agreed that it would be appropriate to proceed with the measure at this time. 
I want to thank the majority leader. While I do not intend to object, I do want to say that I think it would be inappropriate to conclude the debate on this matter in any respect, by a vote or otherwise, absent the kind of cooperation that I think the Senate deserves, when the President has brought a nominee to the Senate and individual Members of the Senate have asked for information. 
With that in mind, I thank you for this opportunity to express myself on this. I do not object.

Mr. ASHCROFT. Thank you very much. 
Mr. President, as I explained earlier when the unanimous consent was sought by the leader to bring this matter to the floor of the Senate, there is an absence of some materials that are important and pertinent to an evaluation of this nominee as a result of the failure or lack of cooperation of this administration to provide to Senators information upon our request. So I indicate at this moment that there will be things that are reserved for debate at a later time when we have that material available to us. 
I am pleased to go forward now and take this opportunity to outline some of my reasons for opposing the nomination of Dr. David Satcher for U.S. Surgeon General and Assistant Secretary for Health. 
While a case against Dr. Satcher is a compelling one, I must confess from the outset to being a grudging participant in these struggles over political nominees. It is really not one of the more pleasant tasks in the Senate. It gives me no satisfaction to deny anyone an opportunity to serve his or her country. Nomination fights can be difficult, they can be abrasive, they can be partisan, and sometimes they work neither to educate nor to unify the Senate. Yet, after three years in Washington, I believe that America deserves better, America deserves higher quality, and America deserves higher standards of ethics than the standard that has been sent to this Senate by the administration for confirmation. 
A nation, like a person, rarely loses its integrity, or its capacity, or its ethics all at once. Instead, our values tend to be lost little by little. And I think we have seen that in this administration. 
I can remember a Surgeon General of this administration who wanted to legalize drugs. We have seen Cabinet Secretaries come forward to admit their infidelity. Then one day the Vice President goes out and endorses and embraces Hollywood and all of the values that Hollywood would propound to undermine the ethics and character of America. The next day the President vetoes a partial-birth abortion bill and basically defends what Patrick Moynihan, the Senator from New York, has labeled as `infanticide.' And so it goes. 
Finally, we wake up to find our President accused of a kind of conduct in the White House with employees that I wouldn't even want to try to describe here on the Senate floor. Frankly, I don't know what is more tragic: That the Office of the President has been so thoroughly debased in the debate and comments and accusations in the society, or that our values have been so demeaned, that it appears much of the public doesn't believe that we can expect any better. 
Frankly, if my time in government has taught me any one thing it is that we teach when we govern. We are assigning values to things when we govern. When we approve of something we say to the culture `This is good,' and when we disapprove of something we say `This is bad.' In assigning values in a culture, the values of which have been under serious attack, asking questions is an important one of our responsibilities. 
Government and its officials teach, and what we are teaching these days is wrong. Although Dr. Satcher is a person of incredibly strong medical credentials in terms of his expertise and his capacity, his effort has been devoted in an area and in a number of ways which call into serious question the values that we would be teaching and the kind of ethical standards we would be saying are OK, if we were to confirm him. 
While our Nation is challenged by the crisis of drugs, the tragedy of illegitimacy, and the breakdown of the family, our public officials have been too busy accommodating America in these things, rather than calling America to her highest and best. Piece by piece, our Nation's integrity has been sacrificed, and too often the Senate of the United States has participated in confirming nominations or ratifying proposals without looking carefully at the ethics involved or the values that are being challenged when a nomination is being confirmed. 
Dr. Satcher's elevation to the post of Surgeon General of the United States, Dr. Satcher's confirmation, would reject America at her highest and best and would simply say that we are willing to accept a series of values which are far beneath what the American people endorse. Dr. Satcher, for example, has embraced partial-birth abortion. He tolerates abortions for minor children without parents' consent. He supports free needle programs, so that drug addicts would be aided and assisted in the administration of their drugs by a Government program that provides free needles. 
I think this accommodates people where they are, at a low level, instead of challenging people to where we need to be, at a high level. I think America deserves that kind of challenge for quality and integrity and ethics. I question the value of a Government program and its ethics when it provides needles to drug addicts so they can administer drugs in a way which is more healthy--if you could say that. Why should the United States of America participate in that? 
Consider the following information. Dr. Satcher has promoted research on African women who were HIV positive. That research denied them known, lifesaving drugs and therapy. Our Nation's top medical journal is the New England Journal of Medicine. Virtually everything that you ever hear, in terms of something new, something at the cutting edge of improving medicine, is written of and announced in and discussed on the pages of the New England Journal of Medicine. The New England Journal of Medicine chastised Dr. Satcher, literally branding his research in these African HIV trials--in which some African women bearing children were given sugar pills or placebos--as being unethical. 
I think America deserves better. America deserves a Surgeon General who repairs to the highest standard of ethics. America deserves better than a Surgeon General who would experiment on the most vulnerable members of the world's population. 
Dr. Satcher has championed blind tests that sent thousands of HIV positive infants home without parental notification. That happened in this country, not in Africa. Infants were tested for HIV. The tests were maintained as blind so that no parent would know if the child that was tested, their baby, was testing positive for HIV. This practice intentionally left moms and dads without an awareness or understanding of whether their child was infected with the HIV virus. 
It might be argued, `Well, the moms and dads might be able to find this out because they realized they were living in risky lifestyles or were at high risk for HIV infection themselves.' That might be true. It might not be true. But what happens if that mom or that family decides to give the child up for adoption? 
If there had been a test of the child's blood which indicated whether or not it was HIV positive, the adoptive parent might not be privy to that information, especially if the information isn't even available to the natural birth parent. I think America deserves better. I think this country deserves better than a Surgeon General who would have those kinds of tests conducted and not provide that kind of vital, potentially lifesaving information. 
I understand that people might want this kind of information for statistical purposes, so we could develop an awareness of the statistics about AIDS and which communities have the highest levels of AIDS. But I think Government too often views people as statistics. I think we need a Government that views people as human beings and understands the importance of individuals and parents and children. Ignoring the potential for an early diagnosis on the HIV virus is, I think, something that would raise serious questions. I would not want to be a parent who was not told if my child had HIV, in spite of the fact that the Government had conducted a test which would reveal it. 
Certainly, if I weren't the natural parent and I were in the shoes of someone adopting a child, I think I would want to know, not so that I might not adopt the child, but so that I might take whatever measures would be necessary. One might begin to take the steps which could curtail the incidence of the kinds of diseases that can attend and participate in the eventual collapse of an individual who is HIV positive. There is progress being made in the area of AIDS research. But it seems to me if you have some life extending knowledge, you would want to make that available because you might extend a life to the time when a cure would become available. 
America deserves better than a Surgeon General who is more concerned about the secrecy of experiments than he is about the lives of the specific patients involved. There are scientists and medical doctors who are more concerned about statistics. It may well be that they should be commended for their interest in statistics. But I think America's family doctor, the Surgeon General of the United States of America, should be one who reflects a concern about individual lives and about individual health conditions. He should call America to her highest and best as it relates to health and should never, never settle for America at her lowest and least. 
Maybe this is what America has come to expect from Washington. It may be what we expect, but it is less than we deserve. It is time for us to stand up and defend values--values like honesty, integrity and decency--and it's time for us to demand a Surgeon General who will appeal to the better angels of our nature, who will attend the health of the Nation, not one who would participate in the `clean needles' approach to the drug problem. 
These are issues that I intend to elevate in the Senate's consideration of this nomination: The African HIV studies overseen by Dr. Satcher during his supervision of the Centers for Disease Control and the ethical debate that swirls around these studies, including the indictment by the New England Journal of Medicine that these studies were unethical; the domestic AIDS detection programs that refused to identify the blood samples with the children so that the parents would never be told as a result of that test whether their children had AIDS, sending parents home with AIDS-infected children without giving them the benefit of what the studies could have shown; there are the clean needles programs which, frankly, don't appeal to us at our highest and best but accommodate the culture at its lowest and least and put the Government in the drug business. 
I think there are real reservations about the kind of signals that sends. What does it teach? What does it teach a young person if a junkie says to him or her, `You ought to try this,' and the young person says, `Well, I don't know if I should.' Then the junkie says, `Well, look, the Government gives us these clean needles,' rips open a pack, and says, `so that you won't have any problem, so this will be a safe procedure for you.' I have real 
reservations about that. I think the people of the United States of America deserve better than that. 
I think the United States of America deserves better than a Surgeon General who is willing to endorse the President's position on partial-birth abortion. It is clear to me that the people of this country understand the heinous terror, the horror, and the tragedy of partial-birth abortion. We do teach by what we endorse, when, by confirming something, we authorize and ratify it. I think we have real problems when we would purport to confirm an individual who is endorsing partial-birth abortion, especially when it is now well understood by medical authorities that it is not even a medically needed or indicated therapy. 
All of these things are interesting points. There are other matters which will be the subject of discussion. But America deserves better. We deserve a family doctor who will lead us to our highest and best, rather than accommodate us at our lowest and least. I mentioned in a colloquy, with the leader of this Senate, that we had sought information from the Centers for Disease Control and from the administration about this nominee and we had not been sent that information. Some of the information which we will be using in the debate has come as a result of Freedom of Information Act demands, which information hasn't been forthcoming without those kinds of inquiries. As a result, I think you can expect the debate to be more thorough as the information arrives. 
These are the broad outlines. America deserves better. America ought to have a Surgeon General who calls us to our highest and best, not one who accommodates us at our lowest and least. We should not have a Surgeon General who would participate in an assault on the values of America, opposing 80 percent of Americans who believe partial-birth abortion is wrong. We should not have a Surgeon General who believes that it would be OK to have clean needles programs that put the Government in the business of participating in the administration of illegal drugs. We should have real reservations about a Surgeon General whose regard for Third World populations allows him to use your tax dollars to have lower standards in conducting medical research on people overseas than the standards he would use in the United States of America. I think that has implications for who we are as a people and it has implications for the way other nations view us, if we are willing to do things with their population we wouldn't do with our own population. Obviously we would have reservations about the maintenance of a program which tests the blood of young children for HIV but does not provide their parents with the information that would allow them to make good judgments about their health care later on. 
With those things in mind, I would just signal that, as the information becomes available, I would expect additional Members of the Senate to come to the floor and participate in this debate. We will have a chance to examine each of those categories in detail with a view toward assessing whether or not this Senate should teach the kinds of things that would be taught to the American public if we were to confirm this nomination.

Mr. ASHCROFT. Thank you, Mr. President. 
There have been a number of charges made and some pretty strong language suggested, as well as a lot of repetition and volume regarding some of the circumstances surrounding the conduct of Dr. Satcher in his role as an individual involved both in domestic health situations and international health situations. 
Let me begin by going through a number of these issues and referring to what notable authorities and investigators have indicated. 
When I raised the issue of the CDC, under the direction and in cooperation with Dr. Satcher, being involved with blind HIV testing for newborns--and while learning about the level of HIV present in the newborns not providing information to parents and sending newborns home without that kind of information--there was a pretty vociferous response, indicating that there were things in the studies that were worth learning. I don't challenge that. There are things that are worth learning that can be learned from medical research. As a matter of fact, it is sometimes easier to learn a lot of things more quickly if you don't really pay much attention to the ethics that are involved. You can learn the most, probably, with research that might be damaging to individuals. 
So the mere fact that there are items to be learned and that there is value in terms of statistical data that can be assembled from the study, doesn't justify the existence of a study. As a matter of fact, when you are running rats in a study, you can learn a lot of things very quickly. The reason we use animals in a lot of studies is because we accord to human beings a kind of standing that says the learning objective is not the end of all that we do: we also have to respect the dignity of the individuals involved. 
So I just wanted to mention a couple of the kinds of things that were said around the country and by authorities regarding these so-called blind HIV tests. 
Here is what was said in the New York Daily News on the 27th of June in 1995. They put it this way:  
Only politics, radical politics, explains the separate standard for AIDS. 
Meaning there is a separate approach: 
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention carried this illogic to an absurd end by requiring testing of newborns, then keeping the results secret. That let officials track the epidemic but denied treatment. Fearful of the push to use the results for actual care, the CDC turned churlish and quit testing. 
It is kind of interesting to me that the New York Daily News, which doesn't have an ax to grind here, indicates that there was a set of circumstances that resulted in the CDC pursuing a logic to an absurd end, including testing newborns and keeping the results secret. And then when it was suggested that the CDC provide information to parents, instead of approaching the problem this way, the CDC just decided to quit the program altogether rather than provide information to parents. 
My view is that our objective in health, in confirming one who would be a health voice for all the people, should not be that one promotes controversial health measures by just keeping people from knowing about the situation. We should be informative and have a culture of information for people. If people have trouble accepting the information, we should work with them to help them get into a position where they digest the information appropriately and take steps to curtail the risks. 
The Washington Post made a pretty clear statement about this at the same time. I think it is important for us to understand 
that the Washington Post isn't some sort of organization that would be unfair in its assessment of this kind of situation: 
For the last 10 years, the Federal Government's Centers for Disease Control has urged doctors and hospitals to advise pregnant women at risk for AIDS to be tested for the disease. Now the CDC has recommended extending this effort to all pregnant women. 
The Washington Post goes on to say: 
This expansion is due primarily to completion of a study showing that administering the drug AZT to an infected mother during pregnancy and delivery and to her baby for a period after birth reduces incidence of transmission of the disease from 25 to 8 percent. If only those pregnant women known to be at risk are tested, others with the affliction will inevitably be missed and their babies won't receive the drug therapy that has proven to be so effective. Congress is now considering legislation that will make the AIDS testing of newborns mandatory. The congressional effort to include AIDS in this category deserves support. 
I think that's important: 
A positive test of a child is a sure indication that the mother has the disease. With this information, breastfeeding, which transmits this disease, could be avoided. 
I think it is very important to note that if you had provided information about the existence of the HIV virus to the parent, then they would know to avoid breastfeeding in certain situations. And because some of the babies, as Senator Kennedy has noted, first test positive for HIV and then later remit that indicator spontaneously, those babies shouldn't be breast fed by mothers with risk of additional contamination. 
The article makes another interesting point: 
And finally it is particularly important that the status of children who are placed in foster care be known. The CDC enumerates all these reasons supporting voluntary testing for all pregnant women. In fact, they are of sufficient weight to require the routine testing of all newborns for AIDS. 
The point is this, that testing newborns for AIDS should be attended by being able to take advantage of the appropriate therapies and the appropriate remedial action. 
Arthur J. Ammann, who is the professor of pediatrics at the University of California Medical Center in San Francisco and who was the man who discovered both pediatric AIDS and blood transfusion AIDS, really was distressed about a program of this kind testing blood samples from unidentified children and collecting the epidemiological data but not telling parents whether or not kids have AIDS. 
Dr. Ammann is a noted authority who, incidentally, was invited by the Labor committee to give a briefing just this week. And he put it this way. He indicated that the policies were a violation of the international Nuremberg code. `The failure to inform the guardians of known HIV-infected infants, when treatment is available, violates both international and national codes of ethics.' The quote comes from an August 3, 1995, Wall Street Journal article. 
I think it is important for us to note that there are very serious questions about the kind of testing and the information resulting from the tests and the ethics involved therein. And there may be ways in hindsight to come back and say, `Well, there was value to what was learned and, therefore, it was appropriate for us to do what was done.' But I do not think this adequately answers the questions. It does not really adequately address the question why, when we could have moved toward identification and notification, we simply acceded to the politics of the situation. 
The New York Daily News said that only radical politics explains the separate standard here, in referencing the fact that there are so many other diseases which, if you had that kind of information, would have been made available immediately. 
Another item which I raised earlier about Dr. Satcher was the idea of needle exchanges. The U.S. Congress has expressed itself on needle exchanges. And the American people are, I think, loathe to be participants in a program which would promote needle exchanges.

Mr. ASHCROFT. Thank you, very much. 
Madam President, there has been some considerable discussion today surrounding the ethics of the Centers for Disease Control and the studies that they have conducted regarding the transmission of AIDS from mothers to newborns--those studies having been conducted not here in the United States, but having been conducted in the underdeveloped countries of the world. 
These studies were conducted and have continued to be undertaken under the auspices of the Centers for Disease Control, under their authority and during the time which Dr. Satcher has had responsibility for the Centers for Disease Control. 
It is troublesome to me that a number of these studies have not really provided the same kind of guarantee in terms of the care which would be accorded to individuals if those individuals participating in the study were in the United States. 
Basically what I am saying is that the studies were conducted in such a way that they would probably be unacceptable in the United States of America. 
A disregard for individuals who participate in clinical trials or medical studies is, unfortunately, something that we have had problems with before. Not long ago, the United States apologized to a number of individuals who are part of what was called the Tuskegee experiment because the participants in the study had simply been left without treatment as doctors watched the progression of the disease. 
I think the Nation's conscience was shocked as a result of the fact those conducting the experiment were interested in scientific data that could be developed by watching people suffer and die. It was troublesome that we would somehow decide we could allow people to have been involved in that kind of experiment. When we discovered the nature of the Tuskegee experiment, the country was shocked and saddened by what had occurred. 
What was even perhaps more shocking is that after we had been through all the problems in assessing the difficulties of Tuskegee, there were revelations about these studies in Africa. The Boston Globe, on the 18th day of May of 1997, published an article entitled `An apology is not enough.' The article stated that `Even as the President laments the Tuskegee experiment, the United States is conducting questionable research in Africa.' This particular article--while it does not purport to say that the African research is similar in every respect to the Tuskegee situation, did point out that there are some real problems with what is being done in Africa. One of the problems is that in Africa individuals who are a part of the study are not given the best known medical help. They are not being accorded medical treatment which would be required by ethical standards. They were given, however, sugar pills or placebos in the face of a virtually always fatal virus. They were given capsules which had no real medicinal value. 
This was so shocking to the medical community and individuals who cared about medical ethics that it found its way into the editorial pages of the Massachusetts Medical Society's journal, the New England Journal of Medicine. The New England Journal of Medicine is the most widely respected medical journal in the world. Virtually no major announcements of medical import are made in the United States without appearing in the New England Journal of Medicine. The New England Journal of Medicine is prudent with regard to what it publishes. The Journal does not publish medical findings just because they have scientific value. It is alert to the dangers of science which would cause people to set aside ethics. 
For instance, in an editorial of the Journal's, the publication states clearly that reports of unethical research will not be published, regardless of their scientific merit. You could have reports that would be very valuable scientifically, but they could be unethical. You could probably learn some things by watching people die without treatment, and that data would be valuable scientifically. As a matter of fact, that is what happened in the Tuskegee setting. But it was clear that kind of experiment was wrong and improper. This medical journal takes a stand against that. It says it refuses to publish reports, even if they are scientifically meritorious, if those reports are the result of unethical research. 
Now, the research which was conducted in Africa was controversial for a couple of reasons. The first point of contention was the use of the placebo, or the sugar pill that doesn't have medicine, as part of the study. The New England Journal of Medicine indicates clearly, `Only when there is no known effective treatment is it ethical to compare a potential new treatment with a placebo.' In other words, if you know that you can do absolutely nothing, there is no known way to cure something, no known way to impair or stop the progress of a disease, then you are allowed to try something and measure it against nothing--which is basically the placebo. But when you know, in fact, that 
there is something that works, it is unethical, according to the New England Journal of Medicine, to use a placebo against some other proposed remedy. 
I think that is the reason the New England Journal of Medicine took exception with the CDC studies, particularly as it related to the Ivory Coast. Prior to the time of these studies it was pretty clear that a regimen had been developed which had been effective in substantial measure in curtailing the transmission of the HIV virus from women to their children. As a matter of fact, the AZT treatment is called the AZT 076 regimen. That regimen has had pretty good results. Normally in newborns, 25 percent of those that are born to mothers with HIV carry the HIV virus themselves. But the studies indicated that if you followed the AZT regimen, the AZT 076 regimen, instead of having 25 percent, or 1 out of every 4 children emerge with the HIV virus, that you could cut it down to 8 percent. So from one-quarter of all the babies, 1 out of every 4 babies, to 1 out of every 12 babies. Now that is a substantial improvement. It is a clear demonstration, accepted by medical authorities, that it is a regimen of treatment that has promise, it is effective, and it is worth doing. 
So when you go to Africa to conduct a study, to do it ethically, according to the New England Journal of Medicine, it would require that individuals in the study compare proposed new treatments not with a placebo, but since there is a known effective treatment, new treatments would have to be compared against the known effective treatment. 
I quote from the New England Journal of Medicine: `Only when there is no known effective treatment is it ethical to compare a potential new treatment with a placebo.' Now, what we have in the studies in Africa is the comparison of a known effective treatment with a placebo. This is not appropriate. Only when there is no known effective treatment is it ethical to compare a potential new treatment with a placebo. 
In reaching this conclusion--this isn't just the opinion of the editorialists at the New England Journal of Medicine. They cite the Declaration of Helsinki of the World Health Organization as providing what is widely regarded as the fundamental guiding principles of research involving human subjects. In research on man, they say, `The interests of science and society should never take precedence over considerations related to the well-being of the subject,' and `In any medical study, every patient, including those of the control group, if any, should be assured of the best proven diagnostic and therapeutic method.' 
It is pretty clear that the best, proven diagnostic and therapeutic method is not the placebo, not the sugar pill. The best, proven therapeutic and diagnostic method is the 076 regimen, which cut the transmission rates from 1 out of every 4 to 1 out of every 12 infants infected with HIV. That is a substantial cut. I think it is always important for us to understand that we are talking about a nearly always fatal virus. We are not talking about a situation where maybe a few more people are threatened. The HIV virus, as it ultimately develops into a condition known as AIDS, is a final and fatal condition. So I don't think it behooves us to take it lightly. As a matter of fact, medical authorities have not taken it lightly. 
I will just point out that even those individuals who were involved in the very discovery of AIDS and the transmission of AIDS in the birth process do not take it lightly. As a matter of fact, studies of intensive treatment of AZT ended in 1994, just as soon as it was shown that the drug sharply reduced HIV transmission to infants. Four years ago, we made it clear that the use of the placebo was over. You would not be doing placebo-based tests any longer, because it had been demonstrated that the drug sharply reduced transmission of the virus from mothers to their babies. That is from the New York Times article, `AIDS Research in Africa; Juggling Risks and Hopes.' 
The Third World studies, however, were in progress in 1995. They continue to be in progress. Apparently, they were ongoing as of late January. Now, the CDC provided funding for the studies on the Ivory Coast. The study was simply designed to determine whether a new course of AZT--a short course, as opposed to the 076 regimen--whether that new short course would have an impact of curtailing the virus in the children born to HIV-infected mothers. As we indicated before, the 076 course cuts transmission of HIV from 25 percent of all infants down to 8 percent of all infants, or approximately a two-thirds reduction. The studies were designed to determine if a smaller dose of AZT would have any impact. 
CDC decided to use a technique known as the placebo controlled study, and it was their methodology of choice. Now it seems to me that we have a clear problem here, and that is that we have an ethical standard for a medical test and trial that says you don't use placebos when there are effective known treatments. You have had a clearly established treatment since 1994, recognized in the United States as a treatment that is effective in reducing the incidence of HIV in new-born infants by two-thirds. 
One of the reasons that the CDC chose to move forward with the placebo-based trials is that the trials are well understood to be very informative scientifically. Those who have come to the floor of the Senate on repeated occasions during the day have talked about how wonderful this was to get this information. I really don't want to get into a big argument about whether or not you can get good scientific data in trials where you let people die because you give them sugar water or sugar pills instead of real medicine. I think it is very likely that you can get good scientific data. I think it is very likely that the outcomes of your tests will be scientifically valid. You can prove that certain kinds of therapies are better than sugar and water. But we are not here just to find out what could be scientifically advantageous. I think it is important that we remind ourselves of that. 
There were scientists who thought they learned a lot from the Tuskegee studies. The mere existence of advantageous or helpful data at the end of a test or the mere facility with which scientific data can be collected doesn't really determine what the standard should be for us. The standard should be that we have our tests conducted in a way that is consistent with the ethical standards and with the requirements that have not only been developed for the United States, but are recognized in the international community. 
Among the guidelines in the international community for tests that are clinical and designed to inform our health care procedures 
is a guideline that says you should never test in a culture what the culture is totally unlikely to be able to implement. In other words, one culture is not allowed to go to another culture that isn't ever going to be able to use the therapy and say, `We are going to use you as guinea pigs, we don't want to endure this on our own.' 
There is another standard that is relevant, whether we are talking about Helsinki or a number of the other codes. We have the Helsinki Declaration; the Nuremberg Protocols; the WHO Guidelines developed in Geneva--a variety of guidelines. Another one of these ethical standards is that you should not test for a therapy in a country that can probably never use it. And you should not test where the cost of using a therapy will make it virtually inaccessible. 
That is one of the reasons that I think individuals want to support what was done by the Centers for Disease Control in this situation. They want to say, well, the 076 regimen is very expensive, therefore, it could not be part of a test to discover a less expensive regimen. It's important to understand that it is the expense of the outcome, the therapy that you are seeking to develop that should define whether or not a country or a society would be able to use it. It's not the expense of conducting the test that is the key issue, but the expense of using the therapy after the test is over. Unless the proponents of these tests want to argue that they were really hoping that sugar pills, which are very cheap, would be the ultimate therapy, they have to say that the ultimate therapy they were proposing is approximately the $50 therapy that CDC was experimenting with, which was the short course, or more confined schedule of administering AZT. That is a $50 dose. The 076 regimen, already proven effective, is an $800 dose. There is a big difference. 
The point I make is that what you are seeking to test in the country is not the $800 dose. That has already been established. That was established in the United States, and it was established in France. What you are seeking to test is not the placebo. We all know that is useless and worthless. You don't even have to be a medical practitioner. That is understood. What you are testing is the $50 dose. And so you have to ask yourself the question, is the $50 dose something that might someday be available and utilized there? If it is, that is the test. It doesn't change the need to treat people humanely in seeking to provide a basis for using that $50 test. 
So what we really have here is a question of whether or not the United States Centers for Disease Control treated individuals in Africa with the same kind of respect that they would have treated individuals in the United States. 
The real question is whether or not they followed the guidelines which require us to treat individuals as distinct and different from the way we would treat, say, laboratory animals where we might disregard their health and safety. 
Of course, the New England Journal of Medicine says when effective treatment exists a placebo may not be used, and it cites the Declaration of Helsinki saying that any medical study of patients, including those of a control group, should be assured of the best proven diagnostic and therapeutic method. 
I don't think there is any other way of saying it. No matter how thin you slice this, it is still baloney. It is clear that the placebo is not the best therapeutic method. It simply cannot be categorized as the best therapeutic method, which is the method, according to the New England Journal of Medicine, that participants in the study are required to have. 
This afternoon I took the time to go through the assurance of protection document entered into by the Ivory Coast and the CDC that lays out the guidelines, principles, and procedures that the parties agree to follow in the research. I believe that in the assurance of protection document mention was made of the Declaration of Helsinki. 
In biomedical research, involving human subjects and international ethical guidelines for them, the protection document states that research must be conducted in accordance with established international standards for protection of human subjects--for example, the Declaration of Helsinki, or CIOMS. Those are examples. But it says we must live in accordance with those established international standards. 
The signature page for the relevant officials says that the research will be conducted in accordance with the established international standards for the protection of human subjects. 
It is kind of interesting that the assurance of protection was not obtained until July of 1997, according to Dr. Satcher's written responses to questions from the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee. We were dealing with these individuals in the Ivory Coast in a way which did not even provide them with a guarantee of the protections included in the Declaration of Helsinki and other relevant international guidelines. We did not see the guarantees until we had articles appearing in major newspapers in the United States that criticized the African studies--articles which compared them to the Tuskegee experiment. 
Dr. Satcher has claimed that the studies complied with all the rules. In the New England Journal of Medicine article with Dr. Harold Varmus of the National Institutes of Health, Dr. Satcher asserts that the NIH and CDC support trials have undergone a rigorous process of ethical review, including not only the participation of the public health and scientific communities in developing countries where the trials are being performed but also the application of the U.S. rules for the protection of human research subjects by relevant institutional review boards. 
Dr. Satcher also relies on World Health Organization guidelines developed in Geneva in 1994 as authority for the studies. He said that the CDC chose to use a placebo controlled study because such an approach has been recommended by a WHO conference of international experts, including those from many developing countries. 
This World Health Organization conference to which Dr. Satcher refers took place in Geneva in June of 1994. Marcia Angell and Michael Grodin of Boston University criticized the conference recommendation, saying that the CDC and the researchers involved developed the recommendations simply to justify their desire to conduct the AZT trials in Third World countries. 
I would like to review some of the international guidelines. It is pretty clear that people around the country and around the world understand that you shouldn't use placebos when there is an effective treatment, particularly if you are conducting a trial that includes victims of deadly viruses. 
Again, I mentioned that Dr. Marcia Angell said in the New England Journal of Medicine that only when there is no known effect or treatment is it applicable to compare a potential new treatment with a placebo. 
The director of Harvard's Human Subjects Committee has stated that use of placebos would be unethical in such cases. The New England Journal of Medicine reports that in 1994 a researcher at the Harvard School of Public Health applied for NIH funding for an equivalency study in Thailand in which three shorter AZT regimens were to be compared with the regimen similar to the 076 regimen. The journal indicates that the NIH study section pressured the researcher and his institution to conduct a placebo trial, which prompted the director of Harvard's Human Subjects Committee to reply in a letter. The conduct of a placebo controlled trial for AZT in pregnant women in Thailand would be unethical and unacceptable since an active controlled trial is feasible. 
So here we have medical authorities resisting efforts by our Government to accept and conduct a trial which is ethically substandard. You have them saying it is unethical; it is unacceptable because there are actively controlled trials that are feasible. Basically this is a reflection for which we can be grateful in the medical community. We don't use sugar pills when we have known capacity for treatment. 
I could go through the guidelines as I did this afternoon. I do not want to do this. The point is the simple ethics of the matter come down to this: If there is a known treatment which is a therapeutic treatment it can make a difference. It is unethical instead of giving patients that treatment to provide them with sugar pills, or with placebos. The known treatment is well established. It is well documented in the medical literature. Its availability makes impossible the use of placebo studies in the United States in this kind of setting, and to echo the statements of many experts, I think it should make it impossible in Africa as well. 
Some of those who have commended the unethical studies overseen by Dr. Satcher in the Centers for Disease Control have indicated that these are poor people and they will never be able to afford the 076 high-dosage, long-schedule regimen of AZT. 
The truth of the matter is this was a study to experiment with lower doses, shorter schedules, and could have been conducted in a manner consistent with medical ethics by using as a control group the 076 regimen. There are medical authorities that will provide testimony to that extent. 
The truth of the matter is that we would not do in the United States what we did in Africa. And I think that is an important point. 
Dr. George Annas, a bioethicist and professor of health law at Boston University, and health law professor Michael Grodin have criticized the AIDS work in Africa not only on the basis of the placebo but they said that these studies with lower ethical standards were imposed on a population that will never receive the fruits of the research. 
It seems to me that there are so many ethical questions surrounding this particular AZT trial that demand answers that we should look carefully at this study. 
One of the answers of individuals who have commended these tests is that `The individuals knew what was happening'--that participants had given their informed consent. 
I will concede that there is virtually always an ironclad, high standard of informed consent that is required for medical trials and experimentation to take place, and virtually every one of the protocols--whether it is the Helsinki Declaration, the Council of International Organizations of Medical Sciences, the Nuremberg Code, or any number of other CDC or Federal regulatory items--they almost all require that participants give their informed consent. Those who would defend these AZT trials seem to want to emphasize that since there was informed consent, we can overlook breaches in the ethics that might have taken place in the design of the studies and in the implementation of the trials. 
First of all, the presence of informed consent does not authorize unethical activity. The mere fact that people would agree to engage in unethical activities and unethical trials with our Government or with agencies of our Government does not mean that our Government can or should do that. We have standards that require a certain respect for human beings and that do not allow our health organizations to treat them as experimental subjects. Whether or not there is consent does not obviate or does not alleviate or does not mitigate the demand of our ethical codes for treating people like human beings and not experimental subjects. 
But there still is a real question about the level of the so-called consent that was given. This afternoon I had the opportunity to refer to an article in the New York Times which talked about a woman who, 5 minutes after she was informed for the first time that she carried the HIV virus, still shaken by the news, was walked through the details of the so-called trials and tests, as well as given general advice about what she should do to help herself and her baby. In less than 5 minutes she was given a quick explanation of what a placebo was. The session was over and this unemployed, illiterate individual had agreed to take the test. Asked what had persuaded her to do so, she said, `The medical care they're promising me.' 
Here is a situation where this is a mockery of informed consent. People who don't even know what a placebo is agreeing to participate in a medical study where they have a 50-50 chance of getting the placebo, a sugar pill. 
The New York Times article talked about another individual. One of the most highly educated women in the test spoke to a reporter. She was a 31-year-old single mother with a degree in law who gave her name only as `X.' She said she had never been made to understand that the medicine being tested, AZT, was already known to stop transmission of the virus during pregnancies. One of the fundamentals of informed consent is helping people understand what kind of therapeutic, known cures or known treatments exist, and she wasn't even told about that. `I am not sure that I understand all this so well,' she said, `but there were some medicines that they said might protect the child, and they wanted to follow the evolution of my pregnancy and the effectiveness of the treatment.' 
People have talked about the situation of following the evolution of the pregnancy and the effectiveness of treatment. We have seen situations where we have followed the evolution of disease and the effectiveness of nontreatment and for half the people in this study we are talking about the effectiveness of nontreatment. There is no evidence in terms of this woman's testimony that she would have gotten real treatment rather than a sugar pill. 
`Pressed further, X, like other mothers, said that she had not been told the results of the tests on her 1-year-old. Asked how she would feel if she learned tomorrow she received a placebo when proven treatment existed, X's tone changed abruptly,' according to the New York times. `I would say quite simply that that was an injustice,' she said. 
Well, it appears to me she has a good understanding of ethics if she does not have a good understanding of medicine. She understands that to provide individuals with a placebo, with a fake pill, and not to tell them that there is a real treatment that is available, would be an injustice. I could not agree more. 
One of the important concepts about medical ethics is that you should only use treatments that host countries could reasonably be expected to use. As I mentioned earlier, those who support the studies say that we could not use the 076 regimen because it was too expensive. We could use the $50 treatments. However, that doesn't comport with their statistics which also state that the average expenditure for health care is $5. If the per capita spending in these countries is often less than $10 per person, as the CDC says, how can these countries afford even the $50 treatment. 
Dr. George Annas, whom I mentioned, from Boston University, was publicly critical of the AIDS studies on the grounds that `they were being carried out with lower standards in a population who will never receive the fruits of the research.' 
These same authors talk about the research being largely unrelated to the potential for treatment in these countries. `No research in developing countries'--and I am quoting again from these same two authors, Dr. George Annas and Michael Grodin of Boston University--`No research in developing countries is ethically justified unless the treatment developed or proven effective will actually be made available to the population. And the best CDC can say about its new AZT regimens, if they work, is that they would be a far more feasible option for the developing world.' 
More feasible, yes, but would they be attainable? No evidence of the fact they would be attainable. I resume quoting. `This is a far cry from assuring that they will actually be made available.' And then they say, `In the absence of such assurance, the African women and their children are being used purely as guinea pigs. They will be subjected to the intrusions and risks of research without any hope, much less any expectation, that they or their communities can ever benefit from the studies.' 
The problem of treating individuals as experimental subjects is a serious problem. It is an ethical problem. And it is one which was so problematic that it caused the New England Journal of Medicine and a variety of other scholars to say that this is unacceptable. 
As we are debating whether or not we have a nomination for a Surgeon General that should be the doctor for America's families, the leader in terms of what America should be and can be, I think the ethics of the research conducted at his specific direction and under his control are important and legitimate concerns. 
I am saddened that Dr. Satcher chose to get involved in experimentation in Africa which would have been unacceptable here, which medical ethicists have indicated could not have been done here, which would have occasioned an outcry from the public and from authorities here, but which he thought could be done in Africa because these individuals have a different standard of living and that local conditions are different than ours. The situation of ethics is not something that relates to the economic standing of people, and it should not be related to a capacity on the part of a nation to transfer experimentation which it would not allow in its own country to be undertaken in another country. 
I believe America deserves the highest and best when it comes to ethics. I believe we deserve a Surgeon General who would criticize rather than implement this kind of anemia in the ethical world. I believe we deserve a Surgeon General who understands that human beings, regardless of their wealth, social station, national origin or citizenship, deserve to be treated as human beings and not as laboratory experiments. I regret that too often in Washington we have come to the place of thinking that if we can get a big value, or if there is a lot of scientific knowledge to be gained, we can disregard ethics--that if the payoff is big enough, and particularly if the price to be paid is not in our own families, that we can look away from the ethics. 
I really don't think that ethics and integrity are divisible. Just like we should be one Nation, indivisible, I think we should have one ethical standard that is indivisible, and I think it should be a high one. I think America deserves better than a Surgeon General who is willing to adjust on a relative scale of values the ethics that relate to those in another setting as compared to individuals who would be here in the United States. It is time for us to demand a Surgeon General who will appeal to the better angels of our nature, not bow to our basest desires. 
As I conclude my remarks, I would indicate the African AZT trials and the ethical problems surrounding them are just one aspect of the serious difficulties I have with this nomination, difficulties that lead me to oppose this nomination. This nominee endorses the practice of partial-birth abortion. This nominee has indicated a willingness to fund studies for the distribution of clean needles to drug addicts. He has indicated a willingness to fund conferences to promote the distribution of clean needles to drug addicts, to put the Government in the business of facilitating the administration of illegal drugs. 
He has reserved, in a technical statement, that he had never provided funding for a Government program to provide clean needles to addicts. But he has provided funding for Government studies and he has provided funding for other programs to promote the distribution of such needles. He has indicated that if he could get the right result from the studies he would be willing to have a program that distributed clean needles. It may be true that clean needles might help some people avoid illness, but frankly I don't know that we should be in the business of assisting individuals in the administration of IV drugs merely because there would be some `health benefit' in a discrete situation where the Government provided a sterile instrument for the administration of illicit substances. 
Individuals have come to this floor also indicating that they don't believe firearms are a disease. As you know, and I think as Senator Craig of Idaho indicated pretty clearly, the Centers for Disease Control has sought to limit or otherwise conduct studies which might be used in seeking to limit the availability or eligibility of people to own firearms in this country because they say that firearms are dangerous to a person's health. Frankly, the provision that guarantees the right of individuals to bear arms in America is the second amendment to the Constitution of the United States and I don't believe that the Bill of Rights is a disease. I think if we have resources that need to be devoted in our culture to the abatement and mitigation of diseases, we ought to deploy those resources to fight diseases and not to try and build a case for depriving Americans of a right guaranteed them by the Bill of Rights. 
In all of these settings the cumulative effect of this candidate, this nominee of the President, shows us that we are not being offered the kind of Surgeon General to lead the American people in ways that I think are appropriate and consistent with the ambitions and aspirations of Americans. For these reasons--in addition to my focus today on the ethical deficiencies of the African AIDS studies--I think this nominee should be defeated. 
Madam President, I yield the floor.

Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the proposed amendment to the United States Constitution to prevent desecration of our great national symbol. In 1995, I was an original co-sponsor of an amendment to the Constitution designed to protect the symbol of our nation and its ideals. When that resolution was defeated narrowly, we vowed that this issue would not go away and it has not. I stand here, again, today to declare the necessity of protecting the Flag of the United States of America and what it represents. 
Thoughout our history, the Flag has held a special place in the minds of Americans. As the appearance of the Flag changed with the addition of stars as the nation grew, its core meaning to the American people remained constant. It represents no particular perspective, political agenda, or religious belief. Instead, it symbolizes an ideal, not just for Americans, but for all those who honor the great American experiment. It represents a shared ideal of freedom. The Flag stands in this chamber and in our court rooms; it is draped over our honored dead; it flies at half-mast to mourn those we wish to respect; and it is the subject of our National Anthem, our National March and our Pledge of Allegiance. As the Chief Justice noted in his dissent in Texas v. Johnson (1989), `[t]he American flag, then, throughout more than 200 years of our history, has come to be the visible symbol embodying our nation * * * Millions and millions of Americans regard it with an almost mystical reverence regardless of what sort of social, political, or philosophical beliefs they may have.' 
There can be little doubt that the people of this country fully support preserving and protecting the American Flag. The people's elected representatives reflected that vast public support by enacting Flag protection statutes at both the State and Federal levels. Regrettably, the Supreme Court thwarted the people's will--and discarded the judgment of state legislatures and the Congress that protecting the Flag is fully consistent with our Constitution--by holding that the American flag is just another piece of cloth for which no minimum of respect may be demanded. As a consequence, that which represents the struggles of those who came before us; which symbolizes the sacrifice of hundreds; and for which many men and women have died cannot be recognized for what it truly is--a national treasure in need of protection. 
Further, the question must be asked, what is the legacy we are leaving our children? At a time when our nation's virtues are too rarely extolled by our national leaders, and national pride is dismissed by many as arrogance, America needs, more than ever, something to celebrate. At a time when our political leaders are embroiled in scandalous allegations, we need a national symbol that is beyond reproach. America needs its Flag untainted, representing more than some flawed agenda, but this extraordinary nation. The Flag, and the freedom for which it stands, has a unique ability to unite us as Americans. Whatever our disagreements, we are united in our respect for the Flag. We should not allow the healing and unifying power of the Flag to become a source of divisiveness. 
The protection that the people seek for the Flag does not threaten the sacred rights afforded by the First Amendment. I sincerely doubt that the Framers intended the First Amendment of the Constitution to prevent state legislatures and Congress from protecting the Flag of the nation for which they shed their blood. At the time of the Supreme Court's decision, the tradition of protecting the Flag was too firmly established to suggest that such laws are inconsistent with our constitutional traditions. Many of the state laws were based on the Uniform Flag Act of 1917. No one at that time, or for 70 years afterwards, felt that these laws ran afoul of the First Amendment. Indeed, the Supreme Court itself upheld a Nebraska statute preventing commercial use of the Flag in 1907 in Halter v. Nebraska. As the Chief Justice stated in his dissent, `I cannot agree that the First Amendment invalidates the Act of Congress, and the laws of 48 of the 50 States which make criminal the public burning of the flag.' 
Nor do I accept the notion that amending the Constitution to overrule the Supreme Court's decision in the specific context of desecration of the Flag will somehow undermine the First Amendment as it is applied in other contexts. This amendment does not create a slippery slope which will lead to the erosion of Americans' right to free speech. The Flag is wholly unique. It has no rightful comparison. An amendment protecting the Flag from desecration will provide no aid or comfort in any future campaigns to restrict speech. Moreover, an amendment banning the desecration of the Flag does not limit the content of any true speech. As Justice Stevens noted in his dissent in Johnson v. Texas, `[t]he concept of `desecration' does not turn on the substance of the message the actor intends to convey, but rather on whether those who view the act will take serious offence.' Likewise, the act of desecrating the Flag does not have any content in and of itself. The act takes meaning and expresses conduct only in the context of the true speech which accompanies the act. And that speech remains unregulated. As the Chief Justice noted, `flag burning is the equivalent of an inarticulate grunt or roar that, it seems fair to say, is most likely to be indulged in not to express any particular idea, but to antagonize others.' 
In sum there is no principle or fear that should stand as an obstacle to our protection of the Flag. It is my earnest hope that by Amending the Constitution to prohibit its desecration, this body will protect the heritage, sacrifice, ideals, freedom and honor that the Flag uniquely represents.

Mr. ASHCROFT. I rise today to state my opposition to the nomination of Ann Aiken to be United States District Judge for the District of Oregon, and to note my support for the other two judges the Senate will consider today. 
My principal basis for opposition to Judge Aiken's nomination is her sentencing decision in State v. Ronny Lee Dye. After finding defendant, 26, guilty of raping a 5-year-old girl, Aiken sentenced defendant to 90 days in jail, rather than substantial prison time, which was also an option under Oregon law. 
As troubling as this sentencing decision is, her explanation of the decision is worse. She has explained that with a jail sentence she could ensure that Dye would receive psychological counseling, but she could not guarantee counseling if he went to prison. I find this type of social engineering from the bench troubling. The focus on what best serves the convicted rapist's needs should not be the basis of a sentencing decision. I doubt that this is the kind of decision the people of Oregon want to leave to judges. 
This decision is not ancient history or a rookie mistake. Judge Aiken made this unjustifiable sentencing decision in 1993, in the middle of her fifth year on the bench. 
Let me be clear about one thing: This is not the worst nominee the President has sent to the Senate. There have been other nominees that pose even greater problems. The Senate will likely consider one in just a few weeks, Judge Frederica Massiah-Jackson of Philadelphia. 
Judge Massiah-Jackson has used the language's worst profanity in open court, she has demonstrated leniency in sentencing and hostility to law enforcement, and in recent weeks, she has drawn the opposition of important local law enforcement officers of the Democratic Party, like Lynne Abraham, the Philadelphia District Attorney. 
Ann Aiken is not as troubling a nominee as Frederica Massiah-Jackson. But that should not be the standard. We need to raise the bar on the President's judicial nominees. America deserves better. The Constitution vests the Senate with the critical responsibility to advise the President with respect to his judicial nominees and in appropriate cases to give its consent. I take that responsibility seriously. 
The President is capable of making quality judicial appointments and, when he does so, he deserves the Senate's consent. The two other nominees we will vote on today--Richard Story (for the Northern District of Georgia) and Barry Silverman (for the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals)--both appear to be well-qualified nominees, and I plan to vote in favor of both. 
However, I will vote against the Aiken nomination. For me, the bottom line is this: As we embark on a congressional session in which we plan to put the emphasis on protecting families and cracking down on violent crime, we should not begin the year by confirming a judge who sentenced a child rapist to 90 days in jail. We can demand more of the President's judicial nominees. The people of this country deserve better.

Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I rise today to encourage my colleagues to join me in congratulating Edith Barcomb of Springfield, MO, who will celebrate her 88th birthday on November 26. Edith is a truly remarkable individual. She has witnessed many of the events that have shaped our Nation into the greatest the world has ever known. The longevity of Edith's life has meant much more, however, to the many relatives and friends whose lives she has touched over the last 88 years. 
Edith's celebration of 88 years of life is a testament to me and all Missourians. Her achievements are significant and deserve to be recognized. I would like to join Edith's many friends and relatives in wishing her health and happiness in the future.

Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I wanted to take a moment to associate myself with the comments of the majority leader from October 21, 1997. Senator Lott has correctly highlighted the FBI's constantly shifting arguments and the Bureau's seemingly relentless attempts to grab more power at the expense of the Constitution, particularly the fourth amendment's protection of privacy and the fifth amendment's guarantee of due process. 
The FBI legislative proposal goes far beyond the Commerce Committee's misguided encryption legislation in further disregarding our Constitution. Instead of working with those who understand that S.909 gives the FBI unprecedented and troubling authority to invade lives, the FBI has attempted to grab even broader authority. The Senate would be foolish to pass S.909. In no way can we even consider the ill-advised FBI approach. The reach of the FBI has now extended so far that the President has taken the other side of the issue and supported a free market approach, according to his public comments delivered abroad. 
I can only conclude that the FBI has introduced its proposal as a ploy to make S.909 look like a reasonable compromise. The only other explanation for the FBI's proposal is that the Bureau will not be satisfied with S.909, but instead will continue to work to erode our Constitutional protections. In fact, the new proposal only draws attention to the many problems of the commerce Committee language. Neither proposal is acceptable. 
The issue of encryption must be revisited in a real and serious way next year, both at the committee level and in the Senate chamber, to examine the many Constitutional implications of the various proposals. I look forward to working with the Majority Leader and other Senators who have expressed interest in encryption legislation. 
I yield the floor. 
Mr. ABRAHAM addressed the Chair.

Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I rise to speak of the need to preserve and protect the intense vital involvement of parents in decisionmaking in local schools all across America. If America is to succeed in the next generation, we have to have the capacity to have the kind of schools that meet the needs of our students. We will have to have the ability to experiment from one school district to another. We will have to have State and local governments that can tailor the programs which they have to meet the demands of their unique settings. 
Sometimes when we think about achievement, sometimes when we think about success, we think it might be necessary to try and impose the so-called `wisdom of Washington' upon the Nation generally. But, I think that temptation ought to quickly fly from us if we would think of what would have happened, for instance, if we decided there needed to be a single uniform type of computer and we had imposed it from Washington saying there would just be one way of doing things. Maybe we would have chosen Apple computers and their way of doing things instead of IBM and their way of doing things. Or maybe we would have chosen a single software company and said that is the only way it could be handled, and we wouldn't have the flourishing and the flowering and the kind of intense opportunity and plurality for the generation of marvelous alternatives that have made America the far and away overwhelming leader in terms of the technology. 
I think whenever we feel that temptation to draw to 
Washington, DC, the decisionmaking and the prerogative of developing for the Nation a single uniform policy which would take the diversity and the creativity out of the system and would cheat America of the vital creativity and opportunity that is expressed when people at the local level are involved, whenever we have that temptation, we should think about how bad it would be in so many areas had we had that kind of policy. 
America's ability to flourish as a success reflects the diversity of this country and the ability of different groups of individuals to approach things differently and to do so successfully. Not only does it provide for us an energy which carries us to excellence, it also means that we don't ever have all of our eggs in a single basket. We have the capacity to meet a variety of challenges. We have innovative and creative thinking. We have the capacity to look at things from different points of view. 
One of the things that the President sought to bring to the United States--and I think his intention was good--was he wanted to improve education, by bringing to us national testing, testing of students on an individual basis all across America with a uniform test promulgated by bureaucrats in Washington, a single test which would, unfortunately, chart the direction of education all across the country. 
When you make a test, you decide that you are testing for something. So if you are going to make up a test that is going to be imposed on the country, you are going to be testing for something and you have to define what you are testing for. 
So the development of a test, although it might not seem to be at first blush, is really the development of a curriculum. If you decide what you are going to test for, you have to decide what you are going to teach. Once you decide what you are going to teach, you have established a national curriculum. 
Oddly enough, even deciding what you are going to teach probably isn't all that is controlled with the development of a test. 
The development of a test probably decides how you are going to teach it, because if you teach English, for instance, with phonics, teach people how letters sound together, and combinations and the like, that is one way of teaching the English language and would be tested differently than teaching the English language with the so-called whole language approach where you just have the recognition of words by rote or memorization. 
So when you have something like a national test proposed, you have to understand that you are talking about uniformity, that you are going to impose a single system all across the country, going to make everybody pretty much the same, you are going to deprive the system of the creativity and the vitality and diversity of what a lot of different folks can do when they are working simultaneously on a problem. 
Second, you are not only going to have uniformity, but you are going to determine from Washington, DC--if you have a uniform test, you are going to have a uniform curriculum. What to teach and how to teach it then becomes a uniform decision by bureaucrats. Because in order to test accurately, you have to know exactly what you are teaching and, of course, what you are teaching for will depend on how you are teaching. 
It troubles me to think that we might take these most fundamental decisions in education and pry them from the prerogative of parents and move them to the educators or bureaucrats of Washington, DC. 
As a matter of fact, the bureaucrats, educational bureaucrats, in Washington, DC, do not have a very good record. The bureaucrats in Washington, DC, run a couple school systems. We know that. 
As a matter of fact, they run the Department of Defense Dependent School System. A year or two ago they tried to put the so-called whole math into that system. The results were devastating. The median percentile computation scores on the Comprehensive Test of Basic Skills taken by more than 37,000 Department of Defense dependent school students, 1 year after the Defense Department introduced whole math, dropped 14 percent for third graders--this is the median percentile score--dropped 20 percent for fourth graders, 20 percent for fifth graders, 17 percent for sixth graders, and 17 percent for seventh graders. One year's implementation of a fad, of the new whole math, devastated the performance of those students. 
I am not sure we want to yield the control of our public schools to the Federal Government so we can have that kind of devastating impact. I sure do not. 
Maybe, if you think the Federal Government does things particularly well, you should look at another school system which the Federal Government runs. It is called the District of Columbia School System, where, I think, we have the highest per capita expenditure on students anywhere in the world, and we have some of the lowest achievement levels. 
What I am trying to say is, we do not need to forfeit to the Federal bureaucracy in Washington, DC, the decisionmaking in education of what to teach and how to teach it, and we need far less to take parents out of the equation. 
Some people might not understand the value of parents in education, but there has been a lot of work in the educational research area about the value of parents in education. A 1980 report in `Psychology in the Schools' shows that family involvement improved Chicago elementary schoolchildren's performance in reading comprehension dramatically. 
One year after initiating a Chicago citywide program aimed at helping parents create academic support conditions in the home, students in grades one through six `intensively exposed to the program' improved .5 to .6 grade equivalents in reading comprehension on the Iowa Test of Basic Skills over students less intensively involved in the program--a 50- to 60-percent better level of improvement when the parents are deeply involved. 
If we are going to take parents out of the equation of what to teach and how to teach and we are going to tell them, do not bother 
to try to get active in your schools, because if things are not working there, you would have to change the whole country in order to change what happens at your schools, and besides, all the decisions are going to be made at sort of a quasi-national school board in Washington, DC, I do not think we are going to get effective parental involvement. That is why I believe that locally controlled schools are the fundamental thing that we ought to pursue. It is not only true for Chicago schoolchildren, it has been proven over and over again in other cities across the Nation in a variety of studies. 
It is important that we have parental involvement. It is important that we have local determination. It is important that we not yield to Washington, DC, the capacity to impose uniform curricula and a uniform teaching methodology all across the country. It would stifle creativity. It would impair achievement in a very, very significant way. 
The Republican agenda for education has not been to centralize education in Washington, DC. Our agenda, as expressed in this legislative session, has been to give local schools block grants. It has been to send them the power to do what they know they need to do. 
I heard Congressman Goodling from the House talk about the President's plan to improve education with just one more test. We already have between three and nine standardized tests every year for every student in the country, according to USA Today. 
Congressman Goodling put it this way: `If you are trying to fatten cattle, they don't get fat by weighing them one more time.' If you are trying to educate students, they don't get smart just by being tested one more time. Students not only have the regular tests of their instructional regime, they also have these three to nine other tests which are taking instructional time. And they are telling us pretty clearly where we are educationally. We know where there is much to achieve, but weighing the cattle one more time, testing the students one more time, will not make them fatter or smarter. 
The truth of the matter is, the solution is to do things like the Republicans have sought to do here, which is to get more capacity into the hands of schools so that it can be devoted to students and teachers, not to the bureaucracy in Washington--a clear contrast. 
The bureaucracy in Washington grows under President Clinton's ability to dictate, through the backdoor of testing, a curriculum and a teaching style in uniformity across America. Under the Republican proposals, instead of having a growing bureaucracy, you take the resource which would otherwise be sapped by the bureaucracy in Washington, and you target it on the schools, you give block grants to local schools. 
Another Republican initiative, the A-plus accounts, gives parents choices. Instead of taking parents out of the equation by saying we are going to have a national school board that no parent could afford to come and talk to and that would impose a uniform regime all across America, the Republican plan is to empower parents, to give parents choice. Let parents invest resources so that they can send their children to the schools that the parents choose and invest those resources absent the kind of onerous tax burdens that parents normally would have on their investments. 
The President's agenda is more programs, more bureaucracies, more of Washington-knows-best. The Republican agenda is a commitment to local schools, local control, local education, the creativity, the pluralism, yes, the diversity and the energy that comes when we have local schools all across America. 
There is an effort being made in this year's appropriations measure to harmonize the kind of demands that are being made by the administration and the items that were passed in the Senate with items that were passed in the House. I think it is fundamentally important that we protect local schools. If we are not willing to stand up to protect the local schools, the prerogative of parents to operate in those schools, to be effective there, to get involved 
meaningfully in the development of curriculum and the development of teaching methodology, I think we will have failed in our duty. 
I intend to do whatever I can, as we close this session--and I mean `whatever I can'--to make sure we arrive at a conclusion which makes it possible for parents to continue to have that kind of beneficial impact. 
At the end of this year the President and his bureaucrats seem to be winning. America's children are losing. The block grants, which would have cut the Washington bureaucracy by sending more funds directly to local school districts, were all but abandoned, and I commend the occupant of the Chair for having that idea, which is one of the best ideas that has been offered to help education in this Congress in decades. 
Scholarships for needy children in the District of Columbia were filibustered to death. Instead of giving parents the power to help their children in education, we lost on that ground. And the President has indicated that, if we succeed on that ground, he will veto it. 
On Tuesday, the Senate voted to kill A-plus accounts to help parents pay for the costs of their children's education. At least the vote was to not allow that to go forward. We could not get cloture. So those who sought to reinforce the position of the President there deprived America of another opportunity for parents to be beneficially involved. 
We have lost on the block grants. We lost on the A-plus accounts. We lost on the scholarships for DC students that would empower parents. 
A final ballot remains over national testing. It is a cause from which I do not intend to waiver. 
I do not think Senators should pack their bags for the recess just yet. There are rights to defend. There are students whose interests are in the balance. I do not think we should sacrifice the next generation's education for a few extra days of rest at the end of this year. I certainly do not intend to do so myself. 
National tests would lead to a national curriculum. I think we can all understand that. The President keeps saying that the national testing system he is proposing would be voluntary. He said these will all be voluntary. Do not worry. No school district would be required to be involved in these tests. 
That is what he said in Washington, DC. That is what he said in his State of the Union Message. That is what he said recently. Perhaps he thought we were not listening carefully when he was speaking in Lansing, MI, on March 10 of this year, 1997. He put it this way:  
I want to create a climate in which no one can say no, in which it's voluntary but you are ashamed if you don't give your kids the chance to do [these tests]. 
Here is a President who says this is to be voluntary, but he says he wants to make it so no one can say no. When the President has the ability to control funding, and when he has the opportunity to give grants and otherwise to make favorable or unfavorable decisions about what happens in schools, I doubt seriously whether there will be a real opportunity for these to be voluntary. 
William Safire recently warned of the dangers of allowing the administration's testing proposal. And I quote William Safire in his editorial from the New York Times op-ed page entitled `Flunk that Test.' He put it this way: 
We're only talking about math and English, say the national standard-bearers, and shucks, it's only voluntary. 
I continue to quote Safire. 
Don't believe that; if the nose of the camel gets under the tent, the hump of a national curriculum, slavish teaching to homogenizing tests, and a black market in answers would surely follow. 
You know, the evils of a national test have long been understood, not just by Republicans, but by Democrats as well, because they have understood that national testing ultimately dictates national curricula. 
Perhaps one of the most eloquent in that respect was Joseph Califano. Joseph Califano was the Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare in the Carter administration. When Joseph Califano was asked about national tests, he warned the American people. He put it this way:  
Any set of test questions that the federal government prescribed should surely be suspect as a first step toward a national curriculum. . . . In its most extreme form, [Joseph Califano went on to warn] national control of curriculum is a form of national control of ideas. 
We could have a long debate about the potential evils of national control of ideas, but it is pretty clear to me that none of us believes that Washington, DC, should control ideas. I think all of us understand that if Washington, DC, controls things, it generally does not do them well. As a matter of fact, what this country has controlled from Washington, DC, has not been exemplary. It has been an example of what to avoid rather than what to embrace. 
When you are talking with individuals about the so-called tests which they would impose, you have to wonder whether Washington's imposition of tests would be something like Washington's attempted imposition of the standards for history, which they tried to develop at the end of the last decade and early in the 1990's. 
The National Endowment for the Humanities sought to develop a set of history standards telling us what we should know and what we should teach. What was interesting to me is that the standards tended to be far more politically correct than they were historically correct. 
When you are thinking about mathematics, I do not think we should think about that which is politically correct or historically correct. We should think about things that are arithmetically correct. 
But here is what happened to the national history standards. The national history standards were more interested in those who were politically correct. 
The standards slighted or ignored many central figures in U.S. history, particularly white males. To name a few, Robert E. Lee was left out, Thomas Edison and the Wright brothers were left out, Paul Revere was left out, so we could have many, many references to the Ku Klux Klan, 
so we could have references to heroes from other continents. 
The truth of the matter is the U.S. Senate understood what was happening there and voted against those standards. I believe that these standards were rejected unanimously in the Senate. George Will attacked the failed history standards as `cranky anti-Americanism.' It didn't surprise the American public. The American public has witnessed the Federal Government go awry, time after time after time on issue after issue after issue. 
The proponents of the proposed national tests have indicated that their interest is in the whole math curriculum. As a matter of fact, when we found out what they were talking about with the whole math curriculum we discovered they were talking about a rejection of computation. Computation is 3 times 6 is 18; 3 times 18 is 54; 4 times 18 is 72. They reject that. One whole math proponent was quoted in the Wall Street Journal as having said we can't ask students to say 6 times 7 is 42, put down the 2, carry the 4. They said that is discriminatory. Most students can't do that, they are too dumb. That is ridiculous. Our students are smarter than that. They are not that dumb. 
As a matter of fact, the only thing that will dumb down American education is if we have low expectations. I have studies that show when you have low expectations you get low performance. Here you have people designing the tests who want to run away from the ability of American students to compute. They want to supply everyone with a calculator so no one has to know the multiplication table and no one has to do things in his or her head. I think such dumbing down of America's educational performance would be inappropriate. 
Most importantly, it is fundamental that we maintain in this great land the ability of moms and dads to be at the focal point of educational policy and development and not bureaucrats in Washington, DC. It is fundamentally important that we maintain local control of education rather than Washington control. 
As we are working our way to see whether or not we can have an appropriations bill that maintains this balance, I want to say to the U.S. Senate that we have an obligation to stay here and work until we do protect the rights and opportunities of the next generation for a decent education by making sure that their parents are in charge, that local school boards and States are in charge, and that we don't forfeit the prerogatives of education policy to bureaucrats in Washington, DC, who would impose a kind of mindless `dumbed down' national curriculum which would fail to have the diversity and creativity and energy --especially the energy--that comes from local involvement that we need. 
I intend to do whatever I can and everything that is possible to make sure that we protect that prerogative. I hope Members of this body and Members of the House will join me in doing so. As we are seeking in these moments to reach an agreement with the White House in this respect, I hope it will be their understanding that a plan to have a uniform stifling environment promulgated from Washington is not a plan for a prosperous America but is a plan which would pull the educational rug out from under the feet of our children and would destroy our capacity to compete in the next generation. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Jerry Hedrick as he retires from 22 years of service to Hoechst Marion Roussel, the largest pharmaceutical company in the State of Missouri. Jerry is known for his expertise in the fields of health care and public policy, and has been a mentor to many persons involved in those fields. 
Jerry began his career in 1975 with the pharmaceutical industry as a consultant when he joined Marion Laboratories, a predecessor company to Marion Merrell Dow Inc. and Hoechst Marion Roussel. Through Jerry's outstanding talents and dedication he has distinguished himself in the pharmaceutical industry as the vice president of government affairs for Hoechst Marion Roussel since August 1995. 
Upon graduation from college, Jerry worked as a teacher, and he continues to work with young people through his volunteering with the Heart of America Council of the Boy Scouts of America and the Dream Factory, an organization dedicated to granting the wishes of very ill children. I commend Jerry for the outstanding service he provides to his community. As our Nation looks increasingly to individuals to become more active in the work of the community, Jerry's commitment provides an example for others to follow. 
Jerry also generously gives his time to the Greater Kansas City Chamber of Commerce, the Midwest Bioethics Center where he is one of the founding trustees, the Advisory Council at Emporia State University, and the American Quarter Horse Association as the Kansas State director. 
I have had the opportunity to work with Jerry on several occasions and have always considered him to be a person of knowledge and insight. His dedication to the advancement of health care in America is truly admirable. 
I urge the Senate to join me in bidding Jerry Hedrick a fond farewell, and wishing him, his wife, Bev, and his daughter, Ginger, the very best as they move on to face new challenges, opportunities, and rewards.

Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, families are the cornerstone of America. The data are undeniable: Individuals from strong families contribute to the society. In an era when nearly half of all couples married today will see their union dissolve into divorce, I believe it is both instructive and important to honor those who have taken the commitment of `till death us do part' seriously, demonstrating successfully the timeless principles of love, honor, and fidelity. These characteristics make our country strong. 
For these important reasons, I rise today to honor Frankie and Harlan Kirk of St. Louis, MO, who on November 15, 1997, will celebrate their 50th wedding anniversary. My wife, Janet, and I look forward to the day we can celebrate a similar milestone. The Kirks' commitment to the principles and values of their marriage deserves to be saluted and recognized.

Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I am pleased to come to the Senate floor today, joined by my friend from our neighboring State of Arkansas, Senator Tim Hutchinson. 
As the 21st century approaches, Senator Hutchinson and I both share a desire to see the United States maintain its position as a world leader--a world leader that emphasizes opportunity and freedom. A strong America abroad preserves the safety of our citizens at home and helps advance the ideals of liberty around the world. 
The United States is involved internationally in very substantial ways, and in some of those settings it is my fear that, instead of exhibiting strong leadership, we have demonstrated that we are incapable of demanding integrity and of requesting that others deal with us honestly. 
We are in the waning moments of a summit meeting between the President of China, Jiang Zemin, and President Clinton. Summit meetings can be very important times. They can provide opportunities for the United States to demonstrate leadership, to demonstrate a commitment to freedom and integrity in international relationships. Or they can do the converse and they can demonstrate that America will not demand integrity, will not demand a commitment to freedom and fair play. Summits can indicate that America does not have the kind of care for the rights of individuals generally around the globe that we would be known for historically in this country. 
When we have summit meetings, we need to advance America's security and economic interests. Summit meetings should be times of structural advance for the United States, when we put in place the kind of framework that will result in our country being stronger--the kind of framework that will preserve our security and advance freedom around the world. 
If statesmanship is not present, summits can become transactional rather than address the critical structural issues in a bilateral relationship. We have seen that during the United States-China summit this week, where the President of the United States has been eager for certain businesses to sell their goods to China, and has, in this particular summit, made it possible for the Chinese to gain access to some of the most important and sensitive nuclear technology in the United States. But the real issues in United States-China relations, however, have been deferred. Critical national security challenges, a staggering trade deficit, and an appalling human rights record in China all took a backseat to business contracts. 
Summits can turn into shallow media events when the critical bilateral issues are ignored. The United States-China summit was worse than just a shallow event. Unfortunately, it was an event which demonstrated that we were willing--in order to acquire certain business contracts--to look past what ought to be clear, structural issues that ought to galvanize our attention. China did not come to the summit to make real concessions on any front, and we responded with accommodation and appeasement. We agreed to have the summit anyway, in spite of the fact that China didn't come to provide genuine progress for the people of China or for the people of the United States. 
Whenever we don't achieve structural change, such as progress in our trading relationships, which would be a reduction in tariffs or nontariff barriers from China; whenever we don't see an improvement in the human rights situation in China so that personal freedom is advanced; whenever we don't have a clear record which demonstrates that China will cease proliferating nuclear and chemical weapons and mass destruction technology--we have lost the ability to advance our nation's fundamental interests and we have traded principle for a few commercial contracts. 
The real opportunity of summitry is the opportunity for structural change--not of transactions alone. It is an opportunity for statesmanship--not just salesmanship. 
I don't think it is wrong for the President of the United States to want to sell our goods abroad. But when we sell our goods and our principles along with them--the kind of commitment we have to freedom, the kind of commitment we have to integrity, the kind of commitment we have to stopping the proliferation of nuclear and chemical weapons around the world--I think the price is too high. 
I think we will have to ask ourselves when we look at the record of this summit, `Has this been an exercise in statesmanship, or has this been an exercise in salesmanship?' If it has just been an exercise in salesmanship, what have we sold? Have we bartered away our credibility, our commitment to freedom and liberty, and our demand for fair and balanced trade? Have we compromised our position when it comes to combating the proliferation of chemical and nuclear weapons? In my judgment, I think we have to ask those questions very, very soberly. 
Did the summit advance America's economic and security interests? Did it put United States-China relations on a firmer footing by addressing the critical issues in our bilateral relationship, or was it centered around accommodation and big-ticket commercial deals? Have we, instead of engaging in statesmanship, just found ourselves engaged in salesmanship and perhaps selling some of the things which we hold most dear in the process? 
My distinguished friend from Arkansas has shared many of these same concerns about our policy towards China. Senator Hutchinson has looked at this situation. He has grasped, I think, what is happening pretty well. 
Senator Hutchinson, is there any indication that the administration's China policy is defending American security, economic, and human rights interest? Or has this been something that simply ended up as being a transactional experience where we sold some goods and apparently were sold a bill of goods in return?

Mr. ASHCROFT. I thank the Senator. 
I have to say in response to the Senator that the contrast between the rights of man in America and the kind of lip service given to freedom by the Chinese leadership could not be more striking. 
When asked about the nature of liberty, Chinese President Jiang said that liberty, in and of itself, is not an absolute, that it is a relative thing. He analogized it to Einstein's theory of relativity. For President Jiang, liberty is something that can grow or shrink depending on the need, or the circumstance of the moment. Freedom might be something to be cherished; it might not. 
In contrast, the United States of America was founded on the concept in our Declaration of Independence that we are endowed by our Creator with inalienable rights. And this means a couple of things. One, that these rights are not relative, they are not adjustable; they are immutable, they are unchangeable--that these are given to us by God. It also suggests to us that they are given to everybody because it is the Creator that gives the right. It is not even governments which give rights. Rights are something that we are given by virtue of being created, and these rights are for the benefit of people all across the globe. 
We have on the one hand a Chinese leader that would have total latitude to adjust rights based on a theory of relativity. That is precisely what is happening in China. Someone being an accessory to Christianity, helping a Christian, finds himself in jail for an indeterminant length of time; someone who not only is not engaged in domestic unrest or criminal activity, but is just assisting other people in their own ability to recognize the existence of a Creator in accordance with their beliefs. In China, accessories to Christianity are criminals. 
That is the extent to which liberty can be withheld or granted in China, and that makes it very difficult to deal with such a goverment. The administration invites the Chinese delegation to the United States and we talk to them about human rights issues. While those officials are here in this country, it is very easy for them to make commitments to human rights in China. Since rights are relative, promises can be made now, but when the delegation returns to Beijing, the commitments take on new meaning. 
The truth of the matter is that I think America has it right about rights, that rights are something granted by the Creator, guarded perhaps by government, sometimes threatened and taken away by government. But rights are something we have because of our creation and our existence. They are not relative. They are not dependent upon whether someone thinks the condition is favorable to the rights of man. These are things which we are born with, we are created with. They are inalienable. They are immutable. 
President Jiang often says the right thing on human rights. Even China's constitution provides for fundamental human rights. China signed the U.N. International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights this week. Signing documents is painless, but if you really believe that rights are relative, that circumstances determine rights, what does the signature mean? It means that the rights will be granted so long as we want them to be granted. 
The 1996 State Department human rights report says, `All public dissent against the party and government was effectively silenced by intimidation, exile, the imposition of prison terms, administrative detention, or house arrest. No dissidents were known to be active at year's end.' 
Now, that is a sobering concept, when our own State Department says, `No dissidents were known to be active at year's end.' That has a very sobering tone. I believe that we ought to demand and expect a better human rights record from the Chinese Government.

Mr. ASHCROFT. I thank the Senator. I see that our time is fast fleeting. I thank the Senator for making the case against China's human rights record. 
There are other points to be made about the inequities in the relationship between the United States and China. Not the least of those is trade. The average tariff that China has on our goods is about 23 percent. The average United States tariff on Chinese goods is about 4 percent. That it is basically a 6-to-1 ratio. And as a result there is a staggering trade deficit with China. The Chinese citizens do not buy nearly as much from us as other countries do. 
The average Chinese buys 10 dollars worth of United States goods every year compared to $1,000 for the Taiwanese, $550 for every South Korean. Our trade deficit with Japan is troubling, but it only grew by 10 percent between 1991 and 1996. The United States trade deficit with China grew by more than 200 percent during that same period. 
But as important as trade and human rights are, there is another important issue: the national security of the United States. China has been the worst proliferator of weapons of mass destruction technology, according to a CIA report. Today's Washington Times headline reads, `Clinton Jiang Reach Nuclear Accord.' This is an accord which is designed to give China the very best of the nuclear information we have in this country, much of it sponsored with taxpayers' dollars as a result of governmentally assisted research. And not far from the `Clinton Jiang Reach Nuclear Accord' headline is, `China Aided Iran in Chemical Arms.' This second article talks about a report from our Government that indicates that China has helped Iran develop a chemical weapons capacity--weapons of mass destruction for the kind of Third World rogue regime that we find in Iran. 
To see these things juxtaposed on the front page of a newspaper sends a chill, and it should, through my spine. To think that we are signing high-level nuclear accords with governments that are helping terrorist states like Iran acquire weapons of mass destruction technology is incomprehensible. 
To have that article right there, the nuclear accord, right beneath the story on China aiding Iran in the development of chemical weapons, is a dramatic illustration of this administration's failing China policy. The CIA report released this past summer said that China was the worst proliferator of weapons of mass destruction technologies in the latter half of 1996. A greater degree of caution is needed in dealing with such governments. 
U.S. credibility was at stake in the nuclear cooperation debate. What kind of leadership are we providing to the rest of the world? Other countries will not take their responsibility to restrain proliferation seriously if the United States enters into nuclear cooperation with the world's worst proliferator of nuclear and chemical weapons technologies. 
I thank the Senator for coming to the floor. If there are other questions or comments, I invite them.

Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I yield myself so much of the 10 minutes I use as I had allocated to me in the unanimous-consent agreement to make an explanation of why I intend to vote against the Interior appropriations bill. 
Mr. President, the House voted on July 10 to cut off funding for the National Endowment for the Arts for fiscal year 1998. It was expected that if we would come to Washington to reduce the size of Government, we would at least stop funding the kind of offensive art that has been the subject of so many disputes that have attended the existence of the National Endowment for the Arts. 
Senator Helms and I offered an amendment to eliminate funding for the NEA, but it did not pass in the Senate. The Senate voted on September 17 to increase the NEA's current $99.5 million budget to $100 million. Then on September 30, the conferees to the Interior appropriations bill provided $98 million for the NEA for fiscal year 1998. 
So the House voted zero; the Senate voted an increase to $100 million; and we have compromised on $98 million. That simply does not reflect the kind of discipline the American people expect at a time when we are taxed at the highest level in history. Americans spend more money in taxes now than ever before in the history of this country on a percentage basis. Congress should not be in the business of subsidizing speech, of saying to one artist, `Your art is good,' and to another artist, by implication, since it did not qualify for the Federal funding, `Your art is bad.' 
I do not believe Congress should be telling people what to like and what not to like. The genius of a democracy is not the values of the central Government imposed on the people. The genius of a democracy is the values of the people imposed on the central Government. 
Congress has no constitutional authority to create or fund the NEA, and in my judgment it is wrong for us to continue to fund it. Although funding for the NEA is small in comparison to the overall budget, elimination of this agency sends the message that Congress is taking seriously its obligation to restrict the Federal Government's actions to the limited role envisioned by the Framers of the Constitution. Nowhere does the Constitution grant any authority that could reasonably be construed to include promotion of the arts. 
This is a time when we have a high demand on our citizens for taxes, and for us to take money to promote the notion of art that someone in Washington thinks is great and to try to impose that on the people through the so-called `governmental seal of approval' is an inappropriate expenditure of public resources. 
I am particularly disappointed because we have a situation where the Congress of the United States could have compromised at least far more substantially to protect the people and did not. The House at zero, the Senate at $100 million, the compromise at $98 million. That is simply an inappropriate way for us to conclude, and for that reason I intend to vote against the National Endowment for the Arts as part of this bill, and I will vote against this bill. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I rise today to address the state of United States-China relations as the summit with Chinese President Jiang Zemin approaches. President Clinton is expected to give a speech this afternoon on United States-China relations, a speech that will, no doubt, continue to defend the administration's policy of so-called `constructive engagement' with China. The policy generally posits that there is no alternative for the United States but to accommodate China in virtually any behavior in hope of establishing a good relationship with Beijing. 
I want to be clear that I certainly do hope that a stable and positive relationship can be established between our two countries, but the administration's China policy of engagement gives little regard to the behavior of China and is putting the prospect of a strong relationship with Beijing at risk. Rather than constructively engage Beijing, this administration's China policy has been advanced at the expense of discarded American principles and lost United States credibility in the international arena. For instance, China has a weapons proliferation record that is unrivaled in the world, distributing weapons of mass destruction in spite of previous nonproliferation commitments. Beijing also maintains trade barriers which continue to block United States goods and United States companies from being involved in the kind of free and open commerce we should have with China. And in the last several years, Beijing has had a human rights record that has resulted in the most intense religious persecution in several decades, and in the silencing of all active political dissidents. 
The latest State Department report on human rights noted that all Chinese political dissidents had been detained and imprisoned. We have to remind ourselves that there are 1.3 billion people in China and to be without any political dissent in a country that large is indeed a troubling matter. 
In spite of these distressing areas in our relationship with China, there is near unanimity in the administration that China must be embraced, that it must be accommodated, that it somehow must be honored. Betraying our country's history of leadership in defense of freedom and a stable international environment is not a way to enhance our relationship with China. 
I believe a strong relationship would be based on mutual respect and trust, but when we constantly compromise, when we constantly accommodate, and when we constantly ignore violations by the Chinese of their responsibilities in the international community and their responsibilities to respect human rights, I believe we don't provide a foundation for a good United States-China relationship. 
Nuclear cooperation with China is one of the issues for discussion during the summit, and it is an issue of particular concern to me. If the President allows nuclear cooperation with China to proceed, it may be the clearest illustration yet of the appeasement-at-any-cost approach in our present United States-China policy. 
The President is considering giving China advanced United States nuclear technology in spite of the fact that a CIA report identified China as the world's worst proliferator of weapons-of-mass-destruction technology. This CIA report is not a stale document. This report indicates that the Chinese have been the worst proliferators of weapons of mass destruction, and this report came out last June. 
The report says:  
During the last half of 1996, China was the most significant supplier of weapons-of-mass-destruction-related goods and technology to foreign countries. The Chinese provided a tremendous variety of assistance to both Iran's and Pakistan's ballistic missile programs. China was also the primary source of nuclear-related equipment and technology to Pakistan and a key supplier to Iran during this reporting period. 
The period the CIA report covers is the last half of 1996. In May 1996, just before the period for the CIA report was to commence, the Chinese made a commitment to stop their proliferation activities. 
In the face of one of their rather notable assurances that they were going to act differently, they continued to persist in their active nuclear technology proliferation and the proliferation of other weapons of mass destruction technologies. Of course, the definition of weapons of mass destruction includes nuclear, chemical and biological weapons. If there is any doubt as to what kind of nuclear-related equipment was provided, the CIA report goes on to state: 
Pakistan was very aggressive in seeking out equipment, material and technology for its nuclear weapons program with China as its principal supplier. 
The administration says China has honored its nonproliferation pledge of May 1996. But let me again make clear that the CIA report covers the last half of 1996, the period after China made its so-called nuclear nonproliferation commitment. How the administration can expect to be a credible actor in the international community by saying that the nonproliferation commitment of May 1996 was honored, when the CIA says that after May, China was the principal supplier to Pakistan of equipment, material and technology for a nuclear weapons program--how the administration can say that is consistent with the nonproliferation commitment is beyond me. 
Since 1985, no President has been able to certify that China's proliferation activities meet the legal requirements that would allow us to start designating them as a nuclear cooperator and to extend to them nuclear exports from the United States. I certainly don't believe China's recent activities warrant such certification now, not in the face of our own Government's report that they were the worst proliferators of components, equipment, and technology 
related to weapons of mass destruction, particularly nuclear weapons of mass destruction. 
I might point out that Ken Adelman, President Reagan's Director of the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency and a key official involved in the formulation of the original 1985 agreement, also does not believe that China's recent activities warrant the certification for nuclear cooperation to proceed. 
China has made several nonproliferation promises in recent weeks to reassure the administration. While these commitments have the potential to improve China's proliferation record, China has made and broken nonproliferation commitments for a decade. I think we should first ask that China at least keep its word for some interval of time rather than blindly accept China's most recent nonproliferation promises even though the previous ones have been broken. 
We all know the potential for this nuclear technology to be used in a variety of settings and ways. I believe China must establish its commitment to nonproliferation in deeds, not just words. Chinese credibility should be established before nuclear-related trade takes place between the United States and China. 
The administration does not want Chinese President Jiang Zemin to return to Beijing emptyhanded. I think that is kind and generous and warm hearted, but I question the need to give China nuclear technology just to make President Jiang happy. 
Have we forgotten the summit itself is a major gift to President Jiang, and why are we so anxious to make concessions to China? I hope the President of the United States understands that at stake in the nuclear cooperation debate is the credibility of the United States in combatting the global spread of weapons of mass destruction. Rather than forcefully address this critical national security threat, our administration apparently is downsizing our counterproliferation apparatus and making life uncomfortable for key personnel who have dedicated their lives to protect our country from the spread of weapons of mass destruction. 
The recent announcement of the retirement of Gordon Oehler from the Central Intelligence Agency is, according to an article in the Washington Post, driven by the administration's disapproval of Mr. Oehler's candor and his honesty in informing Congress of the weapons proliferation activity, not only of China but of other nations. 
Is our administration so infatuated with charming China at any price that we are willing to ignore the facts presented by our intelligence personnel, and when the facts are troublesome to us, that we make these intelligence officers so uncomfortable that they resign? 
Government personnel like Gordon Oehler should be praised and thanked for helping defend our country and keeping Congress informed of rising threats to our national security. 
Mr. President, China potentially has broken every major commitment that it has made concerning the production or proliferation of weapons of mass destruction or the missile delivery systems to deliver such weapons. In light of China's behavior, it is difficult to understand why President Clinton is so eager to accept placebos and questionable promises in exchange for the transfer of valuable and potentially dangerous nuclear technology. The United States needs to be sober and vigilant in dealing with China. 
A stable and truly constructive relationship with Beijing will be established only when our national security interests are defended and when our commitment to the principles of liberty and freedom is preserved. 
There is something substantially different between our commitment to freedom and liberty and what is occurring in China. President Jiang's remarks recently indicate that he does not believe that freedom is for all individuals, that freedom is something that is negotiable. He said, `The theory of relativity worked out by Mr. Einstein which is in the domain of natural science, I believe, can be applied to the political field.' 
We in the United States believe in God-given rights that are not relative, and our policy with regard to China should be a policy which is based on credibility and integrity. Appeasement or engagement without integrity is nothing more than a surrender of American principles.

Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I rise to address the United States-Hong Kong Extradition Treaty, a treaty which I have followed closely in its passage through the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. 
To most Americans, the seemingly nebulous topic of extradition treaties is not particularly important. But let us not be distracted by the complex legal jargon that accompanies this agreement with Hong Kong. Our extradition agreements strike at the very heart of equality before the law, one of our most cherished freedoms in America. Our judicial system seeks to protect the due process right of foreigner and native citizen alike, and our extradition treaties with other nations are based on the premise that any person we transfer to a foreign court system will receive similarly just treatment. 
The extradition treaty with Hong Kong is thus a very important consideration in assessing the future prospects for freedom in the former colony, now under Chinese rule. We need to consider this extradition treaty in light of China's overall behavior toward Hong Kong in recent months. China's actions to undermine democracy in Hong Kong cast doubt on the future of civil liberties in the British colony. China has declared the elected Hong Kong legislature invalid and appointed a hand-picked provisional legislative body. China's appointed chief executive of Hong Kong, Tung Chee-hwa, has announced additional measures to restrict civil liberties in the colony. 
Public protests will have to receive prior approval and could be banned to protect `national security.' Hong Kong political organizations will be required to register with the government and will be prohibited from seeking or receiving funds from overseas organizations. Under China's definition of a Hong Kong political group, international organizations that expose China's human rights abuses also will be banned from receiving critical foreign funding. In light of these troubling steps taken by Beijing, not to mention China's violation of trade agreements, weapons proliferation commitments, and human rights standards, there are few doubts in my mind that China will bend the rules of this extradition treaty we are considering today. 
The extradition treaty contains provisions that supposedly preserve due process and the ability of the United States to refuse extradition requests that are politically motivated. As with all international agreements, however, effective 
enforcement is essential to protect American interests. The strongest treaty language in the world is meaningless without presidential vigilance, a vigilance I find appallingly lacking in the Clinton administration. This administration has failed to confront China consistently on human rights violations, trade barriers, and weapons proliferation. I am concerned that the administration will adopt a similarly lax attitude in the enforcement of this treaty. 
The Clinton administration's defense of Hong Kong in other areas has been weak at best. The White House has been hesitant to meet with political activists from the colony, and Vice President Gore failed to include Hong Kong in the itinerary of his last trip to East Asia. The 6 million people in Hong Kong deserve better treatment from America. The fight to preserve liberty in Hong Kong could be the battle that determines the outcome of the overall campaign to cultivate democracy in China. Hong Kong serves as yet another example of liberty to over 1 billion Chinese, and the effective removal of that example would set back the march of freedom in China. 
In considering this extradition treaty, we need to be honest. We are not signing this treaty with Hong Kong alone, but with Beijing. By doing so, we could be placing our stamp of approval on a court system that will, by all appearances, increasingly be an extension of the Chinese Communist Party. 
The United States has never before signed a treaty to extradite human beings to a totalitarian Communist regime, and I hope this treaty will not turn into the first example of such policy. The United States has been given a great trust as the leader of the free world, and the international commitments we make should reflect our country's commitment to democracy and the rule of law. 
We in America need to realize that the forces of justice and liberty are at work in the Chinese people just as they have been at work with such stunning effect in other nations around the world. When China embraces democracy--just as South Korea, Taiwan, and Japan have done--the rule of law will follow. Until that day arrives, it will be good to say we stood by the Chinese people in their struggle for justice and liberty. Effective enforcement of this extradition treaty will be an important step in ensuring that the example of freedom in Hong Kong is preserved for the benefit of all Chinese.

Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I rise to raise certain issues about the continuing resolution which is before the Senate. It is a plan to continue the operation of Government for the next several weeks while we finish the appropriations process. As you well know and as most of us are keenly aware, there are matters that are still in controversy in the committees which are convened between the House and Senate to try to arrive at a final appropriations measure or a series of final appropriations measures that we could send to the President. 
One of those contentious appropriations measures is the Labor, Health and Human Services and Education appropriations bill. In that appropriations measure are a number of important things that relate to the future of the country. I submit, however, that none are more important than the components of this measure that relate specifically to the education of young Americans. If I were to try to rank the responsibilities of a culture, I would have to rank very close to the top of the list the responsibility to prepare the next generation to be successful and to survive. I suppose survival is more important than success, but the idea that we have to prepare the next generation is a very important idea, and we want to do more than just prepare it for survival. I think we want to prepare it for success. 
The job of preparation has been labeled in a variety of cultures in different ways. I think we expect a lot of the preparation to take place in the homes of America. We expect a lot of parents, and I think we have found that over the course of time we succeed most when we expect a lot of parents and when we get high delivery from parents in terms of what happens to young people. 
Parents are not expected to do it all, however. We have a pretty substantial education system in the country, public education if you will, which is designed to help prepare young people for their lives in the next century. I think the way in which we address those issues related to education is fundamental. It is very, very important. As the father of three children, all of whom went to public schools, I know how important it is, and I am delighted to say they are all doing pretty well now, although my youngest is still in college so we want to make sure he continues that particular practice of preparation. 
Education is among the top priorities of a culture. The preparation of one generation, the development of the skills to survive and succeed in the next generation is a top priority, a top responsibility. That is one of the reasons it demands our focus when the Federal Government starts to expand its participation in or indicate its intention to interfere with education as conducted at the local level. When the President of the United States in his State of the Union Message this year indicated that he wanted to have a Federally developed test, that there would be a test given to every fourth grade and eighth grade student across the country and that that test would be used to measure the success or failure of education systems around the country, I think a lot of us sat up and began to take notice. When there is talk about having a Federal test, a sort of one-size-fits-all test, with a group of bureaucrats in Washington deciding what would be tested and what would not be tested and what teaching techniques would be honored in the test and what teaching techniques would not be honored in the test, you begin to raise questions about this most serious and fundamental part of preparing the next generation to both survive and succeed. 
As a matter of fact, I think there is a role for Government, but I am not sure about a uniformity that comes from Washington, DC, that ignores or displaces the responsibility of parents and local school boards and teachers at the local level. 
In my previous opportunities for public service, I had responsibilities at the State level. I was Governor of the State of Missouri for 8 years, and education was one of our top 
priorities. We wanted to do what we could to make sure that we got the best achievement. After all, we did not necessarily want education for the sake of the education community. The focal point of education is the next generation, and how well it prepares them, and so we want to target student achievement. We want to always be sensitive to what will be the operative set of conditions which will result in the greatest student achievement, because if we can get students to achieve and their preparation is high and their skill levels are strong, they will be survivors and succeeders in the next generation. They will be swimmers and not sinkers, and that is very important. 
One of the things that I had the opportunity to do when I was Governor of my State was to lead the Education Commission of the States. This is a group of officials, legislators, Governors, and school officials from every State in America, and they come together with a view toward finding ways to sort of exchange information. They are able to share about what is working in a particular jurisdiction--it is a clearinghouse. It is a way to say maybe you ought to try this in your locality. Perhaps it would not work there but perhaps it would. What are ways we can improve? 
The information we began to develop, at least I began to be aware of, was that perhaps the single most important operative condition in educational achievement by students is the involvement of parents. How deeply involved in the education progress and product and projects are the parents? If the parents really care, if the community, meaning first the family, which is the fundamental building block of communities, and, second, the teaching community and, third, the larger community, which we think of as our towns or neighborhoods, if all of those institutions assign a very high value to education and are deeply involved in education and feel engaged in the educational experience, wonderful things happen to student levels of achievement. 
I think we could all figure out that would be the case just by using our common sense. But we never leave everything to total common sense when we are considering policy. We like to have surveys and we like to have education studies and control groups and the like. But it is true that when families are deeply involved, when the local culture assigns a very high value to education, when they feel they are engaged, student achievement goes up substantially. 
Let me give you the results of a 1980 report. It was published in `Psychology in the Schools', and it shows that family involvement improved Chicago elementary school children's performance in reading comprehension. Here is the data. One year after initiating a Chicago citywide program aimed at helping parents create academic support conditions in the home--in other words, involving parents in the schools--students in grades 1 through 6 intensively exposed to the program improved .5 to .6 grade equivalents in reading comprehension on the Iowa Test of Basic Skills than students less intensively involved in the program. 
Now, if you really talk about an improvement which is .5 to .6 over the other students, you are talking about a 50 percent better performance or a 60 percent better performance. That means if normal students went up 1 year of study, these students with activated home environments and engaged parents went up 1.5 years to 1.6 years. 
That is a real increase. I think some of our manufacturers, if they had the opportunity to get increases of 5 percent, not 50 percent, or increases of 6 percent, not 60 percent, in their output, they would have a tremendous competitive edge. But here is a study which says that when you actively engage parents, you get massive increases in the productivity in terms of the achievement levels of students. This happened when there was a contract signed by the superintendent, principal, teacher, parents, and student. 
Note the involvement here. The school officials, the principals, the teachers, the parents, and the students. They stipulated that parents would provide a special place for home study, that they would encourage the child by daily discussion, attend to the student's progress in school and compliment the child on such points, and cooperate with the teacher in providing all these things properly. This is real engagement by parents. More than 99 percent of the students in the 41 classes, grades 1 through 6, held such contracts that were signed by all the parties. It is a clear example of the fact that student achievement skyrockets when you have a culture at the local level which is engaged in the development of school improvement policies. This study was from `School-Based Family Socialization and Reading Achievement in the Inner-City,' by H. J. Walberg, R. E. Bole, and H. C. Waxman in `Psychology in the Schools.' 
National surveys also demonstrate this. Listen to this: a national survey reveals that parental involvement is more important in high school achievement than is the parental level of education. 
So what it is really saying is that having smart parents is not important in terms of your educational achievement. Having parents that care about what you are doing and that are involved in the educational process, that is what drives student achievement. 
A 1989 report found that, although parent education level and income are associated with higher achievement in high school, when socioeconomic status is controlled, meaning if you will take socioeconomic status out, only parent involvement during high school had a significant positive impact on achievement. So the real operative condition of student achievement in the high school years--we already talked about the Chicago study which showed in grades 1 through 6 you had a 50 to 60 percent improvement performance--but in the high school years what really makes a difference is whether or not there is parental involvement. 
The report documents that students who enjoyed the most parental involvement, the students who had the most reinforcement, the strongest input from their culture, the ones who had the parents who were most likely to be participants, were most likely to achieve higher educational levels than their counterparts who did not have such involvement. 
It's kind of interesting. They developed a chart there. When parents were highly involved during high school, 80 percent of their students got additional education after high school. You see what this does for students is to energize them. They think, `Education is important. I am going to get it. I am going to be involved in it.' When parents were only moderately involved during their children's high school years, 68 percent of the students went on to studies after high school. When parents were not very involved, only 56 percent continued their education after high school. It makes a big difference. 
These statistics show that students who have lots of involvement by their parents during their high school years were nearly 1 1/2 times as likely to get some postsecondary education or a BS or BA degree, as students whose parents were not very involved. Further, students of highly involved parents are more than three times as likely to obtain a bachelor's degree than their counterparts whose parents were not very involved. This study used data from the 1980 `High School and Beyond' national survey conducted by the National Center for Educational Statistics, particularly focusing on 11,227 seniors who participated in the 1980 `High School and Beyond' survey, and in the 1986 followup documentation. 
What we really have here is a fundamental understanding that when parents are involved in education, when parents are engaged in the educational process, students achieve. What I want to point out is when you have the President of the United States starting to nationalize schools by saying we are going to have a test and we are going to ask that everyone do, in school, what will show well on this test, you begin to say that you are going to test for a particular standard. And you begin to say we are going to make that standard up in Washington--not by parents, not by local school boards, not by interested parties in the community at the local level--but we are going to have a group of bureaucrats in Washington, DC, who are unreachable, uninfluenceable by local parents, who are going to design a test. 
Of course, you know in order to pass a test you have to know basically what the test is wanting and you have to teach what the test wants. Once our schools begin the process of responding to the drummer in Washington, DC, teaching what that drummer wants instead of what is wanted at the local level, what is going to happen to parental involvement? How involved, how engaged, how important are parents going to feel when local school boards are no longer relevant? How successful are our students likely to be when their parents lose interest because no matter what they say they can't affect or change or direct the approach of their educational institutions, their schools? 
I think the strong indication here is that when you start to dislocate parents from the process and put in their place a bureaucracy--one that is thousands of miles away in many instances--you pull the rug out from under student achievement. 
The ultimate objective we are talking about is preparing the next generation to be survivors in the next century; to be succeeders; to be swimmers, not sinkers. And they do that best when their parents and the community is directly involved, has confidence in and is engaged in the education process. The absence of parental participation in that is, I think, a real threat to the success of our students. 
Let me just take you to some more examples. California and Maryland elementary schools achieved strong gains in student performance after implementing partnership programs which emphasize parental involvement. If we say to the parents, `You don't matter, you can't affect curriculum, you can't affect what is being taught, 
we are going to decide all that in a bureaucracy in Washington, you just do as you are told,' how much parental involvement are we going to be able to expect? 
I think people will really respond if they have the opportunity to look carefully and participate in the development of curricula and the way the schools are run. Here is the data from California and Maryland, both of which show strong gains in student performance after implementing what are called partnership programs, which emphasize parental involvement. A 1993 study describes how two elementary schools implemented a partnership program which emphasized two-way communication and mutual support between parents and teachers, enhanced learning both at home and school, and joint decisionmaking between parents and teachers. Students at the Columbia Park School in Prince Georges County, MD, `who once lagged far behind national averages, now perform above the 90th percentile in math, and above the 50th percentile in reading, after implementing the Partnership Program. Here is kind of an interesting thing. There are already ways to find out whether you are doing well, according to national averages. There are all kinds of tests that schools can implement in order to find that out. 
What we are really saying here is that the operative condition is not some set of new computers or new set of reading materials. The operative condition is a culture at the local level which assigns value to education and is engaged and is working to improve education. Instead of students that were below the 50th percentile, they are now operating above the 90th percentile. That is a formula for success instead of failure. That's a formula for survival instead of difficulty in the next century. 
Here is another example, one from the other end of the country. `In its fourth year of the [partnership] program, the Daniel Webster School in Redwood City, CA, shows significant gains in student achievement compared to other schools in the district. Webster students have increased their average California Test of Basic Skills math scores by 19 percentile points.' That means if they were at the 50th percentile before the partnership program, they were at the 69th percentile at the next testing period. They did this by having a situation in which parents were directly and substantially involved. `In language,' the study continues, `most classes improved by at least 10 percentile points. ` 
What I am really trying to say here is that there is a fundamental truth that when local governments and local education officials and parents are working together to determine the curriculum and to energize student involvement and behavior, they produce success rates in school which are literally phenomenal. Remember the first of those rates we talked about in Chicago? That was a 50- to 60-percent improvement over the other group that had not had as much parental involvement in the local program. 
If we take the component of parental energy and parental involvement out of our schools by divorcing from local school boards the opportunities to shape curricula because we have a national test which requires that everyone teach material which will help them survive on the next national test, we will have done a grave injustice to the next generation. An increase in parent involvement leads to significant gains in student academic achievement in virtually every instance. 
Here is one from Mississippi elementary schools. According to a 1993 report of the Quality Education Program, which is designed to increase student success in school by increasing parental involvement, student success was strengthened in seven school districts in Mississippi in 1989. Between the 1988-89 school year, which was before the program was implemented, and the 1990-1991 school year, the 27 participating schools, which serve 16,000 elementary school students, showed a 4.5-percent increase in test scores over control schools. So, just implementing a program for increasing parental involvement resulted in a very important increase in test scores in Mississippi. That program provided, of course, a number of ways to engage parents in the process of being 
involved in schools. 
I think it is a real, serious threat to parental involvement, local control and a community and culture which cares about education when we say we are going to take the fundamental decisions about what is taught and how it is taught out of local hands and we are going to put it into the hands of bureaucrats in Washington, DC, who operate under a third level wing of the U.S. Department of Education, individuals appointed by the Secretary of Education but really accountable to no one. 
Even our U.S. Department of Education stated, in a 1994 report, that `when families are involved in their children's education in positive ways, children achieve grades and test scores, have better attendance at school, complete more homework, and demonstrate more positive attitudes and behavior.' That sounds like the ultimate in what you could want. Here you have children who achieve higher grades and test scores, have better attendance, they complete more homework and they demonstrate more positive attitudes and behavior. How do you get that? You engage parents and the local community in building a culture which reinforces student achievement. 
Sadly, Federal testing takes away local control and parental involvement. Education should be focused at the local level, where parents, teachers, and school boards can have the greatest opportunity to be involved in the development of school curricula and testing. The Federal Government should not impose its will on teachers, parents and school boards about the education of their children. We should not have a dumbed-down national curriculum imposed through the back door of a national test. There are ways to test. There are ways to test at the local level. There are ways to compare local achievement to the performance of individuals in other districts and across the Nation. There are tests which are given across the Nation on a voluntary basis. The Iowa Test of Basic Skills, the Stanford test, and a number of other tests are developed by private agencies. But they don't impose curriculum because they are selected at the option of the schools. 
The hallmark of the education proposals being considered by the Congress, rather than being proposed by the President, is a hallmark of local control and parental involvement. Look at the things that we have been discussing in the U.S. Congress. We have discussed the idea of scholarships for District of Columbia school children, giving parents more choice and more opportunity for assigning their students to schools that are productive and schools that are helpful to their children. That is empowering parents. It is putting parents in the driver's seat instead of the nickel seats. I believe we want parents in those front seats. 
We have proposed education block grants, which send dollars to the classroom instead of the bureaucracy and move decisions from Washington to the local school districts. The Senate of the United States voted not long ago to send the resources to the States, where the money could be invested in classrooms, where the money could be invested in teachers, where the money could be provided to make a real difference rather than to say that the power would be somehow drawn to Washington, DC, or somehow provided to bureaucrats in some part of the Department of Education. 
Here is another thing we are considering, A-plus accounts, that allow parents to save for their children's education and to make choices on spending resources for education. 
Another thing we have been talking about is charter schools, creating innovative schools that are run by parents and teachers, not a bureaucracy. 
We have had an effort moving schools away from bureaucracy towards more parental involvement, more and more active participation, hands-on control and engagement by parents. That is the design of what we have been talking about in the U.S. Congress. Then the President comes along and says no, we need a program where we develop a test nationally. The fact of the matter is, if you test nationally you are going to drive the curriculum nationally. You have to teach to the test, in order to do well on a test. National testing transfers power from parents and schools to Washington. It is exactly the opposite of what we are trying to accomplish in education. 
States, educators, and scholars all stress the importance of local control in education decisions, and many of them stress the dangers of losing such local control. Gov. George Allen of Virginia has developed widely acclaimed Standards of Learning for English, mathematics, science, history and social studies. And he stated the importance of educational reform at the grassroots level:  
If there is one important lesson we have learned during our efforts to set clear, rigorous and measurable academic expectations for children in Virginia's public school system, it is that effective education reform occurs at the grassroots local and State level, not at the federal government level. 
That was in a letter sent to Congressman Goodling on July 29 of this year. 
Here is Theodore Sizer, a liberal critic of the national standards agenda, who acknowledges that who sets the standard and controls the curriculum is crucial. Listen to Ted Sizer, a noted education authority:  
The `who decides' matter is not a trivial one. Serious education engages the minds and hearts of our youngest, most vulnerable, and most impressionable citizens. The state requires that children attend school under penalty of the law, and this unique power carries with it an exceedingly heavy burden on policymakers to be absolutely clear as to `who decides' and why that choice of authority is just. We are dealing here with the fundamental matter of intellectual freedom, the rights of both children and families. 
Who decides? Theodore Sizer asks the question and says it is critical. Very few times would we let someone decide what is done who is not paying the bill, not footing the tab. I mean, we usually say that the person who makes the order gets to select from the menu. 
Local governments and parents and communities pay 92 to 93 percent of all the bills for elementary and secondary education in the United States. The Federal Government pays about 7 percent. In most settings, we would say that the person who is picking up the tab should be able to pull the items off the menu to decide what he is getting. But through the back door of a national test developed by the Federal Government, we are in the position of saying to people, `Yeah, you're going to have to continue with your 93 percent of the cost, but we're going to tell you what you have to teach and how you have to teach it; we're going to tell you we know better than you do, and we'll be able to figure out from a thousand miles away in a conference room in Washington what is better for you and your family and your community than you will.' 
We have kind of gotten the genius of the democracy inverted. The genius of a democracy is not that the Government would impose its values on the citizens, it is that the citizens tell Washington what to do. I think in this instance, the citizens ought to say to Washington, `Wait a second, we are picking up 93 percent of the bill here, we should make the decisions and we can make the decisions and we can make them effectively. To yield to the bureaucrats in Washington, DC, the right to say what is going to be taught and how it is going to be taught in our schools, no thank you.' It would be a disaster. As a matter of fact, it has been known and understood to be a bad idea for a long time. Nearly 30 years ago, education Professor Harold Hand accurately framed the issue when discussing whether the Federal Government should institute a national testing program. 
`The question before us then,' Professor Hand said, `is whether the national interest would be best served by embarking on a national achievement testing program in the public schools at the certain cost of relinquishing the principles of states and local control and of consent as these now apply to the public schools.' 
He points out clearly that there is a certain cost and the cost is giving away your ability to control what is taught and how it is taught. 
This is being asked of the American citizens in spite of the fact we are going to say you still have to pay for it. `Ninety-three percent of the tab is still going to be yours, but we want to make that decision.' 
I don't think there is any question about the fact that national tests will lead to a national curriculum. Acting Deputy Secretary of Education Michael Smith has said: 
To do well on the national tests, curriculum and instruction would have to change. 
So what we have here is an admission by those who are promoting the national test. Their admission is that they would expect to change the curriculum and to change instruction in order for people to do well on the national test. That is one of the reasons I think the Missouri State Teachers Association, made up of 40,000 teachers in the State of Missouri, has stated: 
The mere presence of a federal test would create a de facto federal curriculum as teachers and schools adjust their curriculum to ensure that their students perform well on the tests. 
Here you have it, 40,000 classroom teachers from the State of Missouri saying, `Wait a sec, thanks but no thanks. We don't need a nationally directed curriculum that disengages the community, that disengages the parents, that disengages the local school board, principals and teachers and mandates from Washington what to teach and how to teach it.' 
Test researchers George Madaus and Thomas Kellaghan point out that some advocates for national tests advance the argument that `a common national examination would help create and enforce a common national core curriculum,' and that `national examinations would 
give teachers clear and meaningful standards to strive for and motivate students to work harder by rewarding success and having real consequences for failure.' 
What that really means is, if they are giving them a common national examination and help enforce a common national core curriculum, then the local level is no longer respected. It means that individuals at the local level are no longer meaningful. How long can we expect parents to stay engaged and to be active participants and to endorse and reinforce what their children are doing if the parents are told, `No thanks, we don't care for your input, we'll settle this with a group of folks behind closed doors in a bureaucracy in Washington, DC.'? 
Prof. Harold Hand, speaking on behalf of the Association for Supervision and Curriculum Development in opposition to the development of national tests, said: 
A national testing program is a powerful weapon for the control of both purposes and content of curriculum, no matter where in the nation children are being taught, and so leads to increasing conformity and restriction in curriculum. 
When President Carter was considering a national test proposed by Senator Pell of this body in 1977, here is what Joseph Califano, Carter's Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare, warned--Joseph Califano is not thought to be a person who was some kind of iconoclast, who was more interested or only interested in States rights, but here is what he warned: 
Any set of test questions that the federal government prescribed should surely be suspect as a first step toward a national curriculum. 
That is a substantial statement from a Secretary of Education. He goes on to say, and this is striking: 
In its most extreme form-- 
These are the words of Joseph Califano, President Carter's Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare. He says about a national test: 
In its most extreme form, national control of curriculum is a form of national control of ideas. 
I find that to be a rather striking statement. I don't know whether I would go so far as to say that, but I think it is pretty clear that we want parents and teachers and community members and local school boards to be in charge of what is taught and how it is taught in our local schools, especially when they are being asked to pay 93 cents out of every dollar committed and devoted to schools. I can't imagine saying to the parents, `You don't matter anymore.' I really don't like what that says to children when we tell them, `Really, the kind of decisions about your future are so important we have to relegate them to Government in Washington, DC; we can no longer trust your parents to make those kinds of decisions.' 
I think all of us know we want to say to children in their school system, `Respect your parents; there are things you can learn from your parents, and if your parents are engaged with you in a partnership for learning, your test scores and your achievement will go up and your life will have a higher quality.' 
It puzzles me to think that the President of the United States is suggesting that we should go to a national testing operation which would, as a matter of fact, drive curricula, and begin to take that control away from the local governmental entities and deprive parents of their participation in the development of educational opportunities for their young people. 
There is a fundamental responsibility of our culture to help provide a basis through education for the survival of our children in the next century. If we do that effectively, we will be successful as a culture. But if we destroy the capacity of our young people to do well by nationalizing our schools and pulling the rug out from under those who would otherwise at the local level be able to make good decisions regarding schools and be involved with their children's education, we will have done a disservice to this country, not only in this generation but in the next. 
H.D. Hoover, the director of the Iowa Basic Skills Testing program, has noted:  
There is a whole history of trying to use tests to change curricula, and the record there is not particularly sterling. 
So the point is with the idea of national tests, you drive national curriculum. Curriculum is, of course, the fundamental reason for school. It is what is being taught, and if we drive and we dislocate parents and we take people from the local community out of the situation where they can determine what is taught and how it is taught, we will have impaired the quality of our schools very, very significantly. 
I am not against tests, and I don't want it to be said that I am against tests because I don't think you can really have education unless you test to see whether or not you make progress. 
There was a time, there was a set of fads that came along that said we don't ever test anybody, we just hope they get excited about something and learn it and we don't give grades. You remember that. I unfortunately missed that. I was graded on almost everything I did. 
But while I was teaching in college--and I spent 5 1/2 years as an associate professor, assistant professor--there were some of these fads that came through where students wanted to take things pass-fail; just be really vague about our performance here and don't tell anybody whether we did well or did poorly. 
Frankly, it was a cover for doing poorly. They would never ask that they take a course pass-fail if they thought they were going to do well in it. But, of course, they were going to slide by and, of course, suggest they take this pass-fail. I don't blame them. That makes sense. 
So I am not against testing. I am in favor of testing. I think you can overtest. You can spend all your time testing and do too little teaching. You can spend too much resource in testing and too little in teaching. But in a balanced program of testing and teaching, providing accountability both for teachers and students, and providing accountability to the community, I am in favor of that. 
But if you take that accountability and you impose it from a thousand miles away by a bureaucracy in Washington, DC, and you render powerless the people who are out there on the front lines, and particularly parents and school board members, and you basically have what you would call a national school board, so that they make the decisions in Washington--and the role of the local communities is to put up the money, but Washington decides what will be taught and how it will be taught--I do not think that really provides the energy and the incentive to get the job done well. As a matter of fact, I think it would be a disaster. 
It is kind of interesting. A few years ago we had a rush to impose national standards. I may talk about that a little bit later. People rejected national standards because they were afraid there would be a change in curriculum based on national standards. Well, that is kind of interesting. 
Terrance Paul of the Institute of Academic Excellence, has stated it this way: 
Standards don't cause change. . . . Tests with consequences cause change. 
Of course, some people may say, `Well, the President wants to give this test, but there won't be any consequence.' Well, why give the test? Frankly, we want something from our testing --and testing time is a precious resource--we should use it effectively. We should use it at the local level to test, to see whether or not we are achieving what we want to do at the local level. 
And to take that precious resource and to fill it up with tests from the national level, that you say will not have any consequence, makes little sense. And to use resources--it costs to make tests. 
The President's program, all told, is to be in the $50 to $60 million range to develop tests for reading and mathematics. I think I could develop a test to see if people could add, subtract, and multiply and divide, and if they could read for a little less than that. Be that as it may, I am not one of those that would be on this national testing development group that the President has suggested. 
The important thing is that no one should devise a test for the local community unless the local community asks for it. A local community has a great opportunity to purchase tests and to deploy tests, administer tests that are either developed at the local level or developed by some nationally known, well-reputed testing agency in the United States, like the Iowa Test of Basic 
Skills or some other analogous or similar organization. 
There are a number of States--48 as a matter of fact--that have developed or are developing State standards and State tests. To switch in midcourse from these would have a disruptive impact on those State tests and State standards, because you are going to have to teach to the national test if we have a national test. 
Teaching to that test will pull the rug out from under teaching that is designed to prepare individuals for the tests at the State level by supplanting or superseding State and school district efforts. A national test will undercut their efforts and impose a one-size-fits-all system. 
I have a little story I like to tell about one size fits all, because I think one size fits all is one of the greatest ruses in history. It is a joke. If you were to order pajamas for your family out of a catalog that says, `one size fits all'--and for all five members of mine, if you were to send the same set, I guarantee you that we would rename `one size fits all' to `one size fits none.' 
The value of this country is that we have a lot of different approaches to things. It is a major strength of this country. What would happen, for instance, if we were to take our computer industry--just an industry, for example--and decide that we were going to test all the computers in the same way, that they all had to have the same thing in them, they all have to meet the very same standards? 
We would end up without competition, first of all. And we would end up without improvement because once people learned what the test was going to be, they would teach to that test and everybody would be uniform. We would not want it in industry. And we would not want it in automotives because we know that when people compete and they do what works best for them, we get the kind of energy in the economy and get the energy in our culture that provides for improvement. 
Problems that would result from a national test are a national curriculum or national education standards. The National Assessment of Education Progress' science tests results show how the test can drive curriculum. Here is an article from today's Washington Post. 
Still, Education Secretary Richard W. Riley cautioned that the results may not be as dismal as they first seem. Student scores in science have improved substantially since the early 1980s, he said, and many schools are revamping how they teach the subject. 
He said that revamping it, because of the new science test that the national group put out, that they went down in performance and they went against the trend that they had been going up in. 
So we had a trend during the early 1980's of going up. Now they come out with a new test and they do not do well. And the 
Secretary of Education says, `Well, they'll do better on the new test because they'll start teaching to this test.' 
Well, first of all, if they were doing well on the other tests--or better--I wonder if we want to change and mandate the change through this curriculum or through a curriculum change that is imposed by this test, the National Assessment of Education Progress, the NAEP, test, which was in the paper today. 
The scores were reported yesterday by the National Assessment Governing Board. `Education officials said the latest test results present stark new evidence of a problem in how science is being taught.' They brought out a new test and they found out students did poorly on the new test. So they said: `Well, we have got to change how things are being taught. Too many schools, they contend, still emphasize rote memorization of facts instead of creative exercises that would arouse more curiosity in science and make the subject more relevant to students.' 
This whole endeavor suggests that they intend to shape how things are taught from the education bureaucracy. And they admit that that is the way change will take place. 
In discussing proposed changes to the National Assessment of Education Progress, back in 1991, Madaus and Kellaghan described the danger caused by the momentum of instituting a national test. Here is their quote.  
Current efforts to change the character of [the National Assessment of Educational Progress] carry a clear lesson regarding the future of any national testing system. That is, testing and assessment are technologies. . . . Further, the history of technology shows us that `Once a process of technological development has been set in motion, it proceeds largely by its own momentum irrespective of the intentions of its originators.' 
What it means is you put a test in place, and people have to teach to that test. It develops a momentum of its own. And we are seeing that confessed in today's Washington Post. Students have been going up in their science evaluation, and the National Assessment of Educational Progress program comes in with a new type of science exam that says, `We don't care what you know, we want to find out different things about how creative you might be.' And they all of a sudden say that the science performance falls off because they do not want to know what students have learned, they want to know how curious they are. 
I think it is important for us to do more than develop curiosity in students. It is important for us to develop learning in students. And the previous tests were showing that learning was taking place and the test scores were going up. So they changed the test, redirected the objective from learning to curiosity. And when it shows that they are not as curious as they wanted them to be, they say, `Well, we're just changing the curriculum by keeping and giving this test over and over again, and pretty soon we will have curious students, although they may 
be ignorant of the kinds of facts we would want them to know.' 
This is a serious problem. Experts point out that Great Britain's attempt to provide a national exam `with a wide-achievement span seems to have been unsuccessful, not only in the case of lower-achieving students but is reported . . . to have lowered the standards of the higher-achieving students.' 
These experts, Madaus and Kellaghan, point out that in Great Britain the attempt to provide a national exam with wide achievement span, meaning over broad areas, seems to have been unsuccessful not only in lower-achieving students--meaning that lower-achieving students are not doing better because of the exam--but also it is saw the standards of higher-achieving students go down. 
This is a lose-lose situation. It would be one thing if we were able to pull up the guys at the bottom at the cost of the guys at the top, maybe losing some, but this says that when you have these broad exams in Great Britain, not only do the people at the bottom do worse, the people at the top do worse. 
In assessing the Educate America program in their 1991 report, these same experts dispel the argument that a national test would not lead to a national curriculum: 
Educate America claims that their national test would not result in a national curriculum since it would only delineate what all students should know and what skills they should possess before they complete secondary school but would not prescribe how schools should teach. This assertion is disingenuous [according to the experts]. European schools have national curricula but do not prescribe how schools should teach. Through a tradition of past tests, however, national tests de facto constitute a curriculum and funnel teaching and learning along the fault lines of the test. Two acronyms describe what inevitably happens: WYTFIWYG--what you teach for is what you get--and HYTIHYT--how you test is how you teach. 
If you are going to test for something, that is what you end up teaching. 
These experts indicate that all over the continent of Europe, when you nationalize the testing you nationalize the curriculum. 
Dr. Bert Green, professor of psychology at Johns Hopkins University notes: 
The strategy seems to be to build a test that represents what the students should know, so that teaching to the test becomes teaching the curriculum that is central to student achievement. 
A nationalized curriculum dislocates parents. It sets them out of the operation, along with other members of the local community. They no longer have an influence on the central core of what a school is about, that is, what is taught and how it is taught. And once that is done, I think we make a very serious inroad into the potential for student achievement. 
Lyle V. Jones, a research professor in psychology at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, fears that efforts to recast classroom curricula will focus simply on teaching what will likely produce higher scores on national tests. Let me quote Professor Jones: `The pressures to teach what is being tested are bound to be very large and hard to resist,' he said, `Particularly in schools where the teachers and principals know the results will be published, the focus will be on getting kids to perform well on the test rather than meeting a richer set of standards in mathematics learning.' 
Marc F. Bernstein, superintendent of the Bellmore-Merrick central high school district in Seattle, worries that a national test will lead to a national curriculum. Here is what he said: 
I know that the president has not recommended a national curriculum, only national testing, but educators know all too well that `what is tested will be taught.' 
The point here is the choice. Someone will decide what is tested; someone will decide what is taught; someone will decide how it is taught. Will it be a group of individuals made up of parents, teachers, business people, community officials, who want a local school board to have a sensitivity to what is happening in the local school, and when something goes wrong can try something else, can mediate a problem? Or will it be a group of individuals in Washington, DC, in some conference room in the Department of Education, inaccessible, who do not pay the bill but who will impose a national curriculum that is not correctable at the local level when it flops, when it does not work, when it fails students, when it fails the community but still is enshrined in either the egos or in the minds or in the theories of people 1,000 miles or 2,000 miles away? 
That is the question. It is simple. And I think we do not want to develop some backdoor entry to a national curriculum. These experts, expert after expert that I have been quoting, they say that if you develop the test, you develop the curriculum, you specify the curriculum. 
The superintendent of the Bellmore-Merrick central high school district in Seattle says: 
I know that the president has not recommended a national curriculum, only national testing, but educators know all too well that `what is tested will be taught.' 
President Clinton remarked on May 23, 1997, at an Education Town Hall meeting--these are the words of the President: 
The tests are designed so that if they don't work out so well the first time, you'll know what to do to teach, to improve and lift these standards. 
Let me read that again. This is a quote from the President of the United States. 
The tests are designed so that if they don't work out so well the first time, you'll know what to do to teach, to improve and lift these standards. 
Basically, you will know, says the President, to change your curriculum. You will know how to teach differently. You will know how to remove the opportunity to decide curriculum from the local level and forfeit it to those who make the test in Washington, DC. 
The Association for Childhood Education International notes, `What we are seeing is a growing understanding that teaching to tests increasingly has become the curriculum in many schools.' 
William Mehrens, Michigan State College of Education Professor, has noted that one major concern about standardized achievement tests is that when test scores are used to make important decisions, teachers may teach to the test too directly. Although teaching to the test is not a new concern, today's greater emphasis on teacher accountability can make this practice more likely to occur. 
While basic skills are the most important thing for kids to learn, the proposed national tests contain high-risk educational philosophies and fads. It would be one thing if we thought the test would work or this test would help us get to the basics. I am afraid that they do not hold such promise. 
John Dossey, chairman of the President's math panel to develop the math test, served on the 1989 National Council of Teachers of Mathematics group that criticized American schools' `long-standing preoccupation with computation and other traditional skills.' We have been too long preoccupied with addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. He is saying teaching kids the multiplication tables--whether 12 times 12 is 144 or 15 times 15 is 225, or 6 times 7--demonstrates our `long-standing preoccupation with computation and other traditional skills.' 
I believe that is what we need in our schools. We need to teach young people to be able to multiply, subtract, add, divide. His focus on what advocates call `whole math' would teach our children that the right answer to basic math tables are not as important as an ability to justify incorrect ones, to argue about incorrect ones. The ability to add, subtract, multiply and divide should be replaced, it seems, by calculator skills in students. These are `whole math' individuals, the people who want to start students with calculators so they are never encumbered by the responsibility of learning addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. They can always do it on a calculator. 
The proposed math test is steeped in the new, unproven `whole math' or `fuzzy math' philosophy, deemed by some as `MTV math,' which encourages students to rely on calculators and discourages arithmetic skills and has resulted in a decline in math performance. 
Now, this is the sort of approach to mathematics taken by a group that the President has had working on these exams for quite some time--he has spent millions of dollars in trying to develop this, and we have talked about this previously. The last meeting convened at the Four Seasons Hotel here in Washington, DC. Their approach to mathematics is similar to this `new-new math' or the `fuzzy math' or `MTV math,' depending on how you characterize it. 
This fad was tried, unfortunately, on our Defense Department dependent students. The Defense Department has to operate schools all over the world in order to make it possible for the dependents, the children of people who work in our defense operation around the world, to get an education. Here is what happened when they implemented this program in the Defense Department schools. The median percentile computation scores on the Comprehensive Test of Basic Skills taken by more than 37,000 Department of Defense dependent students one year after the Defense Department introduced whole math dropped 14 percent for third graders, 20 percent for fourth graders, 20 percent for fifth graders, 17 percent for sixth graders--this is not a laughing matter--17 percent for seventh graders and only 8.5 percent for eighth graders. 
Now, that is the whole math, that is the new-new math or the fuzzy math. That is the kind of math that they want to test for in the new national test. It means you will have to be teaching it in order to survive on the test, and if we reorient the curriculum of 
this country across America to the so-called new math or fuzzy math woe be unto our ability in the next century for our young people to be able to make simple calculations. 
These are the folks who say that calculation is not important, we have been too long focused on calculation. I disagree as totally as I could with the statement that we have been too focused on calculation. I think the average parents in America know we have not focused enough on teaching kids to add, subtract, multiply and divide. We have not overdone it. The fact we are in trouble in terms of mathematic or arithmetic literacy in this country indicates we have not focused on computation of skills, not that we have. 
Five hundred mathematicians from around the Nation have written a letter to President Clinton describing the flaws in the proposed math test. They say that the committee members who developed the test relied on the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics standards, which represents only one point of view of math and has raised concerns from mathematicians and professional associations. No. 2 in their concerns, the test failed to test basic computation skills. 
The President said we want to have a national test, and the math teachers, 500 of them, took a look and said, wait a second, these tests fail to test basic computational skills under the assumption that all the students will know these things already. I think that would be a tragedy to try to drive a curriculum, try to test under the assumption everybody knows how to add, subtract, multiply and divide, so you give everybody a calculator in the test. 
One California parent's 11th grade daughter, who was in the whole math curriculum in a local district there, was diagnosed as having second-grade math skills. The mother panicked and got a teacher and began to teach at home what would not be taught in the schools. Parents in Illinois were advised to let their son work with a school counselor--and here is the reason they were told to do so--because `he values correct and complete answers too much.' I think counseling is indicated in a situation like that--but it is not for the student. There should be some counseling that goes on for the so-called educators. 
Lynne Cheney, former chairman of the National Endowment for the Humanities, who, incidentally, tried to develop a national set of history standards and found out how difficult it was and how inappropriate it would be to try to impose the proposed standards on the students, has become an opponent of national standards and national tests. She wrote in the Wall Street Journal not long ago about Steven Leinwand, who sits on the President's math panel. Leinwand had written an essay, explaining why it is `downright dangerous' to teach students things like 6 times 7 is 42, put down the 2 and carry the 4. Simple multiplication. Such instruction sorts people out, Mr. Leinwand writes, `anointing the few' who master these procedures and `casting out the many.' 
Now we have people who are developing the national test who have such a low view of the talent pool in America that they say only a few students can learn 6 times 7 is 42, put down the 2 and carry 4. That kind of low understanding and low evaluation of America's future is not what we need in designing a curriculum through the back door of a national test. It is just that simple. 
Students all over the world have arithmetic literacy. They have the capacity to compute fundamentally. They have the fundamental capacity to do arithmetic, addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. And to say that only a few could do it in the United States and is to undervalue our most important resource--that's the students who will make up the population of this great country. 
I have to say this. If we have very, very low expectations of students, that will drive the levels at which they produce. There are books full of studies that say, if you have low expectations, you get low output; if you have high expectations, you get much better performance. Let's not turn this country over to a group of 
individuals who think that most American students are simply incapable of learning 6 times 7 is 42, put down the 2 and carry the 4. 
I was pleased to have an opportunity to speak with the Senator from West Virginia here earlier this afternoon. Senator Byrd made a speech in June of 1997, a speech on a whole math textbook called Focus on Algebra. After looking at the textbook, he called it `whacko algebra.' We have his entire speech. It is an interesting speech in which he points out some of the real problems we have with this approach. He says:  
A closer look at the current approach to mathematics in our schools reveals something called the `new-new math.' Apparently the concept behind this new-new approach to mathematics is to get kids to enjoy mathematics and hope that `enjoyment' will lead to a better understanding of basic math concepts. Nice thought, but nice thoughts do not always get the job done. Recently Marianne Jennings, a professor at Arizona State University, found that her teenage daughter could not solve a mathematical equation. This was all the more puzzling because her daughter was getting an A in algebra. Curious about the disparity, Jennings took a look at her daughter's Algebra textbook, euphemistically titled `Secondary Math: An Integrated Approach: Focus on Algebra.' . . . After reviewing it, Jennings dubbed it `Rain Forest Algebra.' 
I think the Senator may have been right when he said, `I have to go a step further and call it whacko algebra.' 
If that is the kind of new-new math, if that is the kind of whole math that this national test would impose upon citizens across this country and would literally say to individuals, `This is what we will test, and you will have to take this test and you will be wanting to teach to this test,' I think it is a terrible disservice to the next generation. 
Now, the President has not only indicated he wants to have a mathematics test or a test of arithmetic or skills in that area, he wants to have a reading test. What I fear about tests is that they not only drive what is taught but they drive how it is taught. How you teach reading makes a tremendous difference in terms of your capacity in your life-long endeavor with the written word. Of course, we know that being able to read instructions and being able to read things is far more important than it has ever been in history. One philosophy for teaching reading is what is called the `whole language approach,' which doesn't really focus on phonics. 
One of the real advantages of the English language is that we have letters. There are some languages that do not have letters. They just have pictures. Some of the Oriental languages just have pictures, and the picture, if you have never seen it before, really can't tell you how to pronounce it. It won't tell you what it might mean. It won't give you many clues of how to look it up because it is just a picture. If you don't recognize it, you don't recognize it. 
With English, on the other hand, if you understand it phonetically, you look at it and you know that there are certain sounds that are associated with certain letters and combinations of letters. As you sound words out, it also provides a pretty easy way to look it up because we have the ability to have the dictionary and it is in alphabetical order. There is an order. There is a logic to phonetically understanding the English language. It is the capacity to take the language, a word you have never seen before, sound it out, and deconstruct the word and figure out what it means. 
I think it would be a tremendous disaster if, instead of allowing schools to decide how they want to teach English, if we were to have a test constructed and from that test drive an approach to teaching English, for instance, that ignored phonics. 
Now, I have to say this, and I have said it before, and I guess I will be saying it many times: I don't think we ought to have a national test even if it were one that I thought perfectly represented what ought to be taught. The point I think we have to understand is that parents deserve the right to shape the curriculum and the way it is taught at the local level. When parents have that right and can be involved in it, they are far more likely to be engaged in the educational effort and we go back to our primary understanding that when parents are involved in the education effort, students' achievements skyrocket. The whole purpose of education is not for teachers. It is not for school boards. It is not for parents. The purpose of education is for students. We should be doing those things which drive student achievement and performance, 
and parental involvement in the system drives student achievement and performance. Now, the President of the United States has come before the American people and he has said that the test would be voluntary. He says that these are going to be voluntary. Well, frankly, he wants everybody to pay for the tests. So you have to pay for them whether you would use them or not. I think if he really wanted them voluntary, he would say, if you don't use the test, you could get the money that would be spent if you did use the test to do other things. So a school district that had plenty of tests and knew what its weak points were and how it wanted to advance the interest of its students could spend the money on something worthwhile to them from what they already knew. Most good school districts know where they are weak and where they are strong and they know what they need to do. 
The President said, though, this is going to be a voluntary test, you don't have to worry. Don't worry about a test that drives curriculum all over the country and makes it uniform and monotonous and dumbs down things to a single, low common denominator on the national level, because that won't happen. `This is a voluntary test.' That is the line, that is the statement, that is the oft-repeated sales pitch of the Department of Education. However, it is pretty clear that that is really not their intention. While the President has stated that it will be voluntary, and clearly indicated that in his remarks in the State of the Union message, he went to Michigan on March 10, 1997, just a couple months later, and said, `I want to create a climate in which no one can say no.' 
So much for your voluntary test. The President says he wants the test to be voluntary, but he goes to Michigan and says, `I want to create a climate in which no one can say no, in which it's voluntary but you are ashamed if you don't give your kids the chance to do [these tests].' I really think we need to get an understanding of whether this is voluntary or not. I think when you open the backdoor through national testing to the development of national curriculum and you displace the capacity of parents, teachers, school board members, and community members to develop what they want taught and how they want it taught, and to correct it when mistakes are being made at the local level, displace that with a national system of tests that directs curriculum and say they will be voluntary so there is not a problem, but then you go to Michigan and say you want to create a climate in which no one can say no, I will guarantee you that you properly raise suspicion on the part of the American people. 
When the President of the United States decides what is voluntary and what is not voluntary and he tells you in one instance he wants it to be voluntary, but in another instance `no one can say no,' you have to consider the fact that the President has a lot of power, a lot of resources and a lot of money, a lot of grants, and other things that are available to the President through his department. He can say, oh, that is one of those school districts that decided they didn't need our testing system. You know, that indicates they are not very progressive, so they should not be able to participate in this, that, or the other thing. Or we certainly would not want to favor them with a visit from governmental leadership from the executive branch--or any number of things. The President himself says, `I want to create a climate in which no one can say no.' 
Now, I have heard about choices where no one can say no, and I have heard about people who were so attractive that no one could say no. But I don't think we want to create a situation or a circumstance in education where we have a nationally driven, federally developed test by bureaucrats in Washington, to which no one can say no. William Safire talked about the `nose of the camel under the tent.' He wrote, `We're only talking about math and English, say the national standard-bearers, and shucks, it's only voluntary.' Safire said this: `Don't believe that; if the nose of that camel gets under the tent, the hump of a national curriculum, slavish teaching to the homogenizing tests, and a black market in 
answers would surely follow.' 
It sounds to me like he has listened to what the President said in Michigan. Voluntary? Hardly. It is the nose of the camel, and a nationalized, federalized curriculum--a Federal Government curriculum will follow. If a State chooses to administer the tests, all local educational agencies and parents will not have a choice whether they want to participate. The truth of the matter is that this is the dislocation of parents, school boards, and communities, and it is investing power in Washington, DC, in a new bureaucracy to control curriculum and testing across the country. 
Other Federal `voluntary' plans have ended up becoming mandatory. A Missouri State Teachers Association memo says: `Experience in dealing with federal programs has taught us to be wary. For example, the 55 mph speed limit was voluntary, too--on paper, at any rate. In practice, the speed limit was universally adopted because federal highway funds were contingent upon states' `voluntary' cooperation. The point is that what is voluntary often becomes mandatory when you have federal programs and funds involved.' 
The Department of Education stated in a September 16 memorandum that it is willing to use the leverage of Title I funds to gain acceptance for the proposed national tests--Federal funds linked to the proposed national tests. Voluntary? Hardly. 
The memo says that the Federal agency will accept the national tests as an adequate assessment of the proficiency of Title I/educationally disadvantaged funds. This offer is totally inappropriate. It demonstrates how desperate the Department is to gain acceptance for these flawed Federal tests. Use of the tests is being linked directly with Federal funds. Today, the use of the tests for Title I students is `permitted,' or suggested, perhaps even encouraged. It is only a matter of time before it could be required. 
An October 1990 study from the Ohio Legislative Office for Education Oversight revealed that 173 of the 330 forms, 52 percent of the forms, used by a school district were related to participation in a Federal program, while Federal programs provide less than 5 percent of education funding. 
Here is what we have already. We have a National Government that is intrusive. It is responsible for more than half of the paperwork load that teachers are struggling under, and that school officials are struggling under, which displaces resources that might otherwise go to the classroom. So you have 52 percent of the paperwork at the Federal level and only 5 percent of the funding, according to the 1990 Ohio Legislative Office of Education Oversight. I don't think we need additional invasion by Federal bureaucrats to displace what ought to be done, which can be done, what is being done and can be done far more successfully at the local level with a Federal bureaucracy. 
What happened when we tried this through a Federal bureaucracy in the past? What has been our success at imposing things we thought might be good? It is kind of interesting to look at the so-called `National Standards for United States History,' which were assembled in hopes of providing some sort of standard for history teaching. These standards were funded in 1991 by the National Endowment for the Humanities and the Department of Education for just over $2 million. 
Here is what we got for our $2 million. If you think you want to invite the National Government in a bureaucracy, through a test, to begin to develop a curriculum and to set standards that have to be followed in every district, think about what happened to this effort to develop national standards. The National Standards for United States History do not mention Robert E. Lee, Paul Revere's midnight ride, and did not mention the Wright Brothers or Thomas Edison. Who made the grade with the revisionists, the educationists, the liberals who wanted to rewrite history? Well, Mansa Musa, a 14th century African king, and the Indian chief Speckled Snake had prominent display--but not these others. I 
would not be against adding some people to our history books, but I am against deleting the Wright Brothers and Robert E. Lee. The American Federation of Labor was mentioned nine times, and the KKK was mentioned over a dozen times. It was obviously an attempt to set standards that would make students ashamed of their country instead of giving them an awareness of what their country was all about. 
Lynne Cheney criticized the National Standards for U.S. History, in spite of the fact that she was the chairperson of the National Endowment for the Humanities when the Endowment contributed to the funding for the standards project. She said that the U.S. history standards were politically biased. She cited a participant in the process who said the standards sought to be `politically correct.' What a tragedy that we would take an effort to our classroom that we were trying to make politically correct and impose that instead of the truth to people about our history. Cheney also said that the standards slighted or ignored many central figures in U.S. history, particularly white males. The standards were uncritical in their discussions of other societies. The standards were unduly critical of capitalism. The economic system, which has carried the United States into a position where it is the best place in the world to be poor, not the best place to be rich. You can get richer in some other place, but the poor of America are better off than the rich in many places around the world. But, no, the standards were unduly critical of capitalism, so writes Lynne Cheney, chairman of the National Endowment for Humanities at the time it funded this effort to build standards. In testimony before a subcommittee of the House Economic and Educational Opportunities Committee, she reiterated concerns about the history standards and concluded that national standards were not needed in any subject area, much less any entity to certify or approve them. 
So that is what Lynne Cheney, who had experience with national standards, said when they tried a bureaucracy in Washington to dictate a history standard. She said it was a failure. She spent our money doing it, but she had the courage to stand up and say it ended up with a bunch of politically correct stuff that was inappropriate to use as teaching tools for our children. 
Finally, George Will attacked the failed history standards as `cranky, anti-Americanism.' 
The English/language arts standards were such an ill-considered muddle that even the Clinton Department of Education cut off funding for them after having invested more than $1 million dollars. Over and over again, when there have been national efforts to establish standards, create curriculum, to develop tests, they have to suspend the effort because they get bogged down in politically correct language, they get bogged down in the compromise of politics and end up not speaking to the students' real needs, which is for education. 
Can you imagine a politically driven math test that is not concerned about computing--adding, subtracting, multiplying and dividing--but is concerned about making sure that we don't offend anybody? Frankly, we need to be able to add, subtract, multiply and divide. To say that it doesn't matter whether you get the right number, that if you just get close, sounds a little bit too much like Washington, where people around here mumble `close enough for Government work.' Well, if you are having your appendix taken out or you are having your teeth filled by a dentist, you hope they would not have that attitude toward mathematics or anything else. There are a lot of things that are relative in the world, I suppose. But one thing is not--we ought to be able to say to people that 2 plus 2 equals 4, and 2 plus 3 doesn't. It is hard to say to students that there are any absolutes left in the culture, but at least we ought to be able to say to them there are some absolutes. You can find them, at least, in the mathematics curriculum. 
Well, USA Today reported that according to Boston College's Center for Study of Testing, children are already overtested, taking between three and nine standardized tests a year. The truth of the matter is, States and communities are already testing students. They are keenly aware of the need to improve performance, and to subject students to a national test on top of the testing that is already being done is to basically impose a resource allocation judgment by the Federal Government on the people who are at the State level and at the local level, who know how much testing is appropriate. Can you imagine that the State and local folks have been testing too little purposely for a long time in hopes that there would someday be a Federal test arrive which could take a day of their activities, or 2 days of their activities, and take resources and funding away from the teaching curriculum and add it to the testing curriculum? No, I don't think that is the case. 
I think we have been having teachers and school officials deciding how much testing is appropriate, testing that amount, making sure that they had tests that could compare them to relevant groups. 
We talked at the beginning of my remarks today, and that was some time ago, about school districts that have moved up dramatically compared to the national average. National averages are available today and international averages are available today. As a matter of fact, when we went to the Washington Post to talk about the new science results in the United States, we found out that we fell against international averages. We fell in large measure because we decided we would test for something else instead of testing for the hard science that the international averages are involved with. 
If there is in this proposal for national testing--and obviously it is the one that is now being debated between the House and the Senate in the conference committee--a proposed national body which would develop a national Federal test with the Federal Government directing it through the Department of Education, it is important to note that this is still going to be Government. They may say that it is independent. It is not. It is the National Assessment Governing Board which would continue to get Federal appropriations for all of its activities through the National Center for Education Statistics, an arm of the U.S. Department of Education. This board, although it would have Governors and some local officials on it, would be a limited group of people that would operate in Washington, DC, under the direction and control of the Department of Education. 
The Secretary of Education would still make final decisions on all board appointments. The Assistant Secretary for the Federal Office of Education Research and Improvement would still exert influence as an ex officio member of the National Assessment Governing Board. 
While the House voted overwhelmingly by a vote of 295 to 125 to not allow one cent to go for national testing, the Senate-passed proposal would provide a new assessment governing board which would add a Governor, two industrialists, four members of the public and remove five individuals who are currently members of the board. But it would still operate in the U.S. Department of Education under the National Center for Education Statistics. The Secretary of Education would still make final decisions on all board appointments. The Assistant Secretary would be the person who drove the ship as an ex officio member of the board and as, obviously, a representative of the Department through which all the funding would flow. 
Now, the National Education Standards and Improvement Council, part of Goals 2000, was repealed April 26, 1996, a little over a year and a half ago, over concerns that it would function as a national school board, establishing Federal standards and driving local curriculum. I think it is fair to say that we had good judgment there. We said, wait a second, we don't want something that establishes a national curriculum, that establishes national standards. We saw how bad that was with the history standards. The history standards were repudiated unanimously by the Senate because they were just politically correct items that were revisionist history, designed, as I said, to make students ashamed of the country rather than to inform students about the country. And at the time the National Education Standards and Improvement Council was repealed, because there were concerns it would function as a national school board, it was said on this floor that `it is logical to presume that once a national standard has been set and defined by some group which has received the imprimatur of the Federal Government, you will see that standard is aggressively used as a club to force local curriculums to comply with the national standards * * * it was a mistake to set up the national school board, NESIC.' 
Well, if it was a mistake to set up a national school board under the nomenclature of an education standards and improvement 
council, it is a mistake to establish a national school board under the label of a test development committee. 
It was further said in the Chamber that `the National Education Standards and Improvement Council should never have been proposed in the first place. It was a mistake and we should terminate it right now. The Federal Government does not have a role in this area, and it certainly should not be putting taxpayers' dollars at risk in this area.' 
Well, if that was a mistake in 1996, where they had no authority to propose a national test to be imposed on every student in America to drive curriculum, it is certainly a mistake now. And the number of letters or the identity of the letters which label the federal bureaucracy doesn't change the facts. 
A single national test for students was rejected by the only congressionally authorized body ever to make recommendations on national testing. The National Council on Education Standards and Testing was authorized in 1992 by the Congress, and its final report concluded that `the system assessment must consist of multiple methods of measuring progress, not a single test.' 
Whether you allow test development and implementation through the Department of Education or through the National Assessment Governing Board, the fatal flaw is that we would be allowing the development of a test which would drive curriculum. When you drive curriculum from Washington and you make it impossible for people at the local level to decide what they want taught and how they want it taught and you deprive them of the ability to correct mistakes--if it is not working, they can't change it because it is all driven from the national level--you are forfeiting a great opportunity to make the kind of progress educationally which will make those who follow us survivors and succeeders. 
As I said when I had the opportunity to begin making these remarks, the genius of America is bound up in our ability to hand to the next century, the next generation, a set of opportunities as great as ours. I firmly believe we have that opportunity and we have the responsibility to make sure that the next century is characterized by individuals who are capable. If we decide to spoil that opportunity by ruining our education system with a one-size-fits-all, dumbed-down curriculum that is driven by national, federalized testing that comes as a result of a bureaucratic organization in Washington that could only honestly be labeled as a national school board, we will have failed in our responsibility to protect the future of the young people in this country. 
Some have concluded that the public is demanding what the President says he wants to provide. Nothing could be further from the truth. I seldom cite polls in things that I say because I don't want to be poll driven. I do not want to follow polls around. I want to try to find out what is the right thing to do. Living by polls is like driving down the road looking in the rear view mirror to find out what people thought a little while ago. We need to be driving down the road finding out where we need to be and where we want to go. 
But there are those who say that, well, we can't say to the American people they should not embrace the President's proposal because the American people want the President's proposal. Here is what the Wall Street Journal said about that. This was quite some time ago:  
The Wall Street Journal/NBC national poll found that 81 percent of adults favor President Clinton's initiative, with almost half the public strongly in favor and only 16 percent opposed. 
But when asked whether the federal government should establish a national test--with questions spelling out the pro and con arguments of a standard national accountability vs. ceding too much power to the federal government--the public splits 49 percent to 47 percent, barely in favor. 
This is fewer than half the people. With just one moment of explanation, all of a sudden the so-called 81 percent endorsement crumbles. When the real facts of the proposed federalized national 
test mandated by a group of folks acting as a national school board, in effect, in Washington, DC, reach the American people, they are going to know that is not the recipe for greatness. That is a recipe for disaster. 
I have to say this is a little bit like the health care program that got so much support early on, but the more people knew, the less they liked it. One academic writer whom I will have an opportunity to quote when I speak again at another time says that the worst thing that could happen for the President would be for this plan for testing to be implemented because people would find out the disaster that it would really cause in the event it were implemented. 
Our primary objective must be preparing the next generation educationally for the future, and we cannot pull the rug from beneath the components that make education a success--parental involvement, a strong culture supporting education at home, local control, the ability to change things that are failing, and the ability to adjust at the local level. A national bureaucracy cannot get that done. It is something that we must not embrace. National federalized testing is a concept that must be rejected if we are to save the opportunity for the future for our children. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I rise today to address the disturbing prospect that President Clinton will make the necessary certification to Congress that would permit so-called nuclear cooperation between the United States and China. I really believe we should be honest with each other. This is a political decision, driven by the United States-China October summit rather than the facts of China's weapons proliferation record. 
The prospect of nuclear cooperation with China is perhaps the clearest illustration yet of the trust but don't verify approach behind the administration's China policy. The administration does not want Chinese President Jiang Zemin to return to Beijing emptyhanded. But I question the need to make concessions to China in the first place. 
China has a weapons proliferation record that is unrivaled in the world. Chinese trade barriers continue to block U.S. goods and companies. In the last several years, Beijing has had a human rights record that has resulted in the most intense religious persecution in several decades, and of course it has also resulted in the silencing of all political dissidents in China, according to our State Department reports. 
In spite of such behavior, nuclear cooperation with China could become a reality. Beijing has made a host of nonproliferation promises to acquire United States nuclear technology, and the administration is applauding China's efforts. Sadly, China's promises of all new export controls and assurance that no nuclear technology will be sent to unsafeguarded nuclear facilities will do little to stem China's proliferation activity. 
China has made and broken nuclear nonproliferation commitments for over a decade, and they have broken them with great regularity. Little confidence can be placed in China's new nonproliferation promises until Beijing backs up such commitments with action. Disregarding the issue of whether or not China can be trusted, each of China's nonproliferation commitments is deficient in important areas. 
China's new export controls are untested, and will be administered by agencies with close ties to the China National Nuclear Corporation--that is the organization which has helped Iran prospect for uranium and that is the organization which transferred ring magnets used for uranium enrichment to an unsafeguarded nuclear facility in Pakistan. So we are alleging that we are going to have nonproliferation. Then we are going to put it in the hands of the organization which has been a massive proliferator of nuclear weapons technology and capacity. 
The ring magnet transfer was in apparent violation of United States law, although the Clinton administration did not impose sanctions as a violation of China's commitments--so we had a violation of our law--it was a violation of China's commitments under the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty and our administration refused to impose sanctions. I just don't think we can continue to turn our head away from the violations and then turn our head toward this country and say, well, in spite of all that we'll wink and establish a new level of cooperation. 
With regard to China, China has had great cooperation with Iran on nuclear issues. The administration is allowing China to use nuclear blackmail to obtain United States nuclear technology as it relates to Iran. China will consider forswearing new nuclear cooperation, it says, with Iran, such as the sale of a nuclear reactor and a plant for uranium conversion, if the administration will allow United States-China nuclear cooperation to proceed. They are threatening to proliferate more nuclear weapons and proliferate more nuclear technology if we don't give them additional nuclear information and additional nuclear technology with which they could violate agreements like they have regularly. China's pledge to join the Zangger committee says more about what China is unwilling to do rather than signaling a new commitment to nonproliferation. China has joined the Zangger committee and not the Nuclear Suppliers Group because Zangger members can continue to export nuclear technology to countries which keep some nuclear facilities from international inspection. If they were to pledge to join the Nuclear Suppliers Group that would be a different thing. But the Zangger committee has the loophole necessary to proliferate nuclear technology with the potential of nuclear weaponry to places that don't have international inspection. China is the only nuclear weapons power in the world that has not joined the Nuclear Suppliers Group and they remain unwilling to do so. 
The national security arguments for United States-China nuclear cooperation are far from compelling, and the economic rationale is exaggerated. As the Washington Post notes this morning, United States big business is lobbying hard for nuclear cooperation with China in hopes that this market will boost exports. 
I want United States businesses to benefit from possible export markets, but China is seeking nuclear cooperation with the United States to increase the number of bidders for and to lower the price of Chinese power projects. Once China obtains nuclear technology, they will reverse engineer our products and they will start building those products themselves and be our competitors in other export markets. 
As Dan Horner of the Nuclear Control Institute notes in the Post article this morning, China is only seeking enough technology to develop a domestic production capability. 
The United States should not enter into nuclear cooperation with China until real and observable progress is made in China's nonproliferation record. Before we send our nuclear technology to China, Beijing should cut off all nuclear cooperation with terrorist states, such as Iran. Before we send our nuclear technology to China, Beijing should maintain at least for 1 year an exemplary nonproliferation record for all weapons-of-mass-destruction technology, including technologies other than nuclear--chemical technologies and biological technologies. 
The threat of weapons of mass destruction has become a broader issue than that of nuclear-proliferation technology alone. Chemical weapons, biological weapons and the missile systems to deliver those weapons are all part of the weapons-of-mass-destruction threat. China's improvements in nuclear nonproliferation are questionable at best, but even the administration can't defend China's broader weapons-of-mass-destruction nonproliferation record. 
Even though the administration argues that China has honored its May 1996 pledge not to transfer nuclear material to unsafeguarded nuclear facilities, doubts persist about China's recent nuclear-proliferation activity. A June 1997 CIA report released this year states that:  
During the last half of 1996-- 
After its assurances of May 1996-- 
During the last half of 1996, China was the most significant supplier of [weapons of mass-destruction]-related goods and technology to foreign countries. The Chinese provided a tremendous variety of assistance to both Iran's and Pakistan's ballistic-missile programs. China was also the primary source of nuclear-related equipment and technology to Pakistan, and a key supplier to Iran during this reporting period. 
Clearly, the Chinese record does not develop a sense of confidence in those who observe her objectively, and it certainly does not justify a bill of good health that nuclear cooperation would signify. 
Therefore, I hope the President does not accord to China a standing it does not deserve in a way that would jeopardize our capacity to restrain the proliferation of nuclear technology. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor. 
Mr. BOND addressed the Chair.

Mr. ASHCROFT. Madam President, as I mentioned when I was last on the floor, the campaign finance reform bill we are debating will not produce meaningful political reform. The McCain-Feingold proposal will not lead to reform because it leaves the single greatest obstacle to competitive elections untouched. In fact, it will strengthen the single greatest obstacle to competitive elections. That obstacle is the advantage of incumbency, which is now and always has been the single greatest perk in politics. An incumbent has access to the podium, access to the news media, and the ability to create name identification. Any time you limit political spending, any time you limit what the competitor can generate in terms of information, you strengthen the incumbent. 
I submit that Hershey doesn't need to advertise that it sells chocolate, but a new competitor does. And those who inhabit public office are well-known for the fact that they inhabit it. But new individuals need to have the ability to create that same awareness in the mind of the public. 
Campaign finance legislation that restricts core political speech strengthens incumbents by limiting the ability of challengers to increase their own name recognition and to highlight the incumbents' voting record on issues of concern to the voters. 
So, if you say you cannot spend much money against an incumbent, and your supporters can't talk about his or her voting record, then you can't match the incumbent's advantages of being on C-SPAN in the Senate Chamber, of moving through the news industry with press releases. If Senators want true political reform, the answer is to limit terms, not to limit speech. Let's limit politicians, not the citizens. We should be talking about limiting the tenure of people in public office, not the first amendment rights of the citizens of this country. 
To this end, this afternoon, I have filed an amendment to the pending campaign finance reform legislation that would authorize States to impose term limits on their Senators and Representatives. However, my amendment will not come up for debate or a vote if cloture is invoked on the McCain-Feingold bill. Accordingly, a vote for cloture on McCain-Feingold is a vote against term limits. 
Let me just review for a second why term limits would provide the true reform. Incumbency is the real problem in our system. It is the single greatest perk. Committee assignments and the ability to control committees relates to incumbency, and committee assignments translate into big bucks. The value of incumbency is as strong or stronger, now that we have had modest reforms over the last several years, than it was before. As a matter of fact, when campaigning was wide open 100 years ago the value of incumbency wasn't anything like what it is now. 
Madam President, 94 percent of all Members who seek reelection get reelected, and an individual challenging them, if limited in what he or she can spend, is at a disadvantage. Madam President, 94 percent is 19 out of 20. That means that the only true elections are for open seats. 
Term limits are a tried and tested kind of reform: Forty one Governors, 20 State legislatures and the U.S. President have term limits. It is time that the Congress be term limited as well. 
Term limits mean no more politics as usual. As a matter of fact, studies done by research institutes indicate that we would have had the balanced budget amendment to the Constitution long ago if we had term limits, which would have brought new individuals to Washington who voted the way people do in their first two terms in office instead of voting the way they do after they have spent term 
after term after term here and begin to endorse the bureaucracy and to sanction it and to support it. I believe we should not limit the amount that citizens can spend on politics. We should limit the amount of time politicians can spend in Washington. 
I will ask that individuals vote against cloture on the McCain-Feingold bill so we would have an opportunity to vote on term limits. A vote for cloture on McCain-Feingold will be a vote against term limits. A vote against cloture will at least provide us with the opportunity to bring forward amendments. Those amendments, including my term limits amendment, hold the promise of giving us a real opportunity to amend and to otherwise change the election procedures for the benefit of the people. 
The people deserve honest elections. They first deserve enforcement. So much of what is being talked about these days is the violation of laws in existence. We don't need to proliferate the laws in order to enforce them. But we do need to give opportunity to individuals who are not a part of the system now. That cannot be done by limiting what they can spend to get known or limiting what their supporters can spend to expose the record of those who are in office. But it can be given to them if we decide America has enough talent to allow it to circulate individuals through the Senate and the House, and by term limits, to say that no individual should be a lifetime occupant here, that we should give individuals an opportunity to seek election and that is the kind of campaign reform which will really benefit America. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, families are the cornerstone of America. The data are undeniable: Individuals from strong families contribute to the society. In an era when nearly half of all couples married today will see their union dissolve into divorce, I believe it is both instructive and important to honor those who have taken the commitment of `till death us do part' seriously, demonstrating successfully the timeless principles of love, honor, and fidelity. These characteristics make our country strong. 
For these important reasons, I rise today to honor Jewel and Rudy Rush of Rolla, MO, who on October 19, 1997, will celebrate their 50th wedding anniversary.

Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I rise today to salute a most deserving and life-affirming ministry, the Life Choices Crisis Pregnancy Center in Joplin, Missouri. This ministry began in 1990, and has provided a much-needed service to more than four thousand women and their families. Thanks to a strong commitment and dedication to life, they have saved at least 160 babies from abortion. 
Many of the services are aimed specifically at young people. One example is a program that encourages abstinence and uses trained counselors who provide information and support for teens and their parents through the Center's 24-hour help line. Additionally, the Center provides free confidential counseling, basic medical services, and lifestyle assessments at its newly constructed facility. 
America needs more organizations which, like Life Choices Crisis Pregnancy Center, encourage communities to help their own, rather than rely on government-funded programs for assistance. I ask that you join with me today in recognizing not only the achievements of this center, but also the compassionate individuals who give of themselves so selflessly, helping others in their time of need.

 Mr. ASHCROFT. I would like to make a statement regarding the transfer of FUSRAP to the Army Corps of Engineers. 
Mr. President, yesterday I cast a vote in favor of the Energy and Water Development Appropriations Conference Report for FY 1998 with hesitation. Missouri has a major FUSRAP site in St. Louis which contains nuclear contamination from the Manhattan project and other hazardous waste. For 15 years we have worked with the Department of Energy to clean up this site. During such time I have expressed concern over the delays but in just the past 2 weeks we have come to the point where DOE has begun preliminary cleanup efforts. Given this recent progress, the news of the FUSRAP program's transfer out of DOE has, quite understandably, caused a great deal of distress in the St. Louis community. While I am not questioning the corps' ability to handle the FUSRAP project, concern has been expressed that further delays will be caused by the transfer and undo much of the recent progress. 
With site recommendations already made, feasibility studies concluded, and contracts let, it is encouraging that the corps will honor the preliminary groundwork laid by the St. Louis community. The plan designed by the community further illustrates their ability to continue to administer the program from St. Louis. Further, I was pleased to learn that the cleanup and restoration of contaminated sites falling within the purview of FUSRAP shall be managed and executed by the St. Louis area Civil Works District of the Corps of Engineers, ensuring that the local community will continue to be very involved in designing cleanup plans at the FUSRAP site and effectively maintain community input in the process.

Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I rise today to acknowledge and honor the achievement of Mr. Donald J. Babb of my home State of Missouri. Mr. Babb recently received the Shirley Anne Munroe Leadership Development Award from the American Hospital Association and the Hospital Research and Education Trust. Mr. Babb is the chief executive officer of the Citizens Memorial Hospital and the executive director of Citizens Memorial Health Care Foundation in Bolivar, MO. The national award recognizes leaders in executive management positions in small or rural hospitals who have improved health care delivery to rural areas through innovative and progressive steps. 
Donald has been an instrumental part of the Citizens Memorial Hospital since before its opening in 1982. Under his leadership, the hospital was recognized as one of the `Top Ten Small Rural Hospitals' in the Nation, as determined by the American Hospital Association, and has become a fully integrated health care delivery system. Mr. Babb stated that, `Meeting the needs of the communities we serve has been my No. 1 priority. We have expanded services so that patients have access to quality care for every stage of their lives.' His dedication to the good health of the people in rural southwest Missouri is obvious through his efforts directed toward improving the quality of health care available in this area. 
For the past 17 years, Mr. Babb has dedicated his life to the betterment of his community and the people he serves. His work embodies the spirit of the American dream. Mr. President, I ask that Members of the Senate join me in recognizing and honoring the work and lifetime achievements of Mr. Donald J. Babb.

Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President. This week, the American Tort Reform Association is holding a series of events to mark the National Lawsuit Awareness Week. Since it was founded in 1986, ATRA has played a valuable role in the effort to restore fairness, balance, and predictability to the civil justice system. 
To commerate this week, ATRA is hosting a 5k `Tort Trot' to benefit the Hydrocephalus Research Foundation. Patients who suffer from hydrocephalus--excess fluid on the brain--particularly have been impacted by law suit abuse. Such patients require brain shunts to drain the excess fluid from the brain. While these shunts have saved the nearly 75,000 hydrocephalus patient's lives, they are made out of silicone which is becoming scarce. The silicone supply used by implant manufacturers is threatened by deep pocket liability lawsuits. Rather than take a risk over a product which they did not design or manufacture, some suppliers are exiting the medical device market. 
Congress can fix this problem. We can pass meaningful tort reform to make sure that our system no longer lines the pockets of special interests at the expense of those in need of life-saving medical devices. 
Americans deserve a system of justice, not justice delayed. Those wrongfully injured should have access to a timely remedy from the responsible party. A recent study found cases take about 2 1/2 to 3 years to be resolved, and even longer in appealed cases. In our present--overburdened--system, 50-70 cents of every jury-awarded dollar goes to lawyers and legal costs. 
I want to focus my remarks on reforming the product liability system; however, I also want to mention a case which illustrates the need for overall civil justice reform. This case, coined the `Great New Orleans Train Robbery' by the national media, resulted in a $2.5 billion punitive damages award against a company found to be only 15 percent at fault in an accident that did not result in loss of life, serious injuries, or major property damage. 
On September 9, 1987, a railroad tank car containing butadiene, a volatile compound used in making synthetic rubber, was located in a rail yard in New Orleans on tracks that belong to CSX Corp. Since the fire involved hazardous materials, the officials involved made a determination that the best approach was to let the fire burn itself out. In order to avoid any possible harm to nearby residents, an evacuation of those living near the yard was undertaken. The fire lasted 36 hours. By all accounts, fire officials, and corporate representatives undertook heroic efforts to protect life and property. As a result, and as I said earlier, no deaths or significant injuries were involved, and there was only minimal property damage. 
One year later, the National Transportation Safety Board--the Federal agency charged with investigating transportation accidents--determined that CSX had not caused this accident. In fact, other than providing the track over which the tank car was operated, CSX had no connection to the car. 
The very day of the fire, a group of law firms brought a class action suit against CSX and other companies alleging various kinds of physical and mental anguish. A jury has now decided that the 8,000 plaintiffs should be awarded $3.5 billion in punitive damages. Although CSX was only found to be 15 percent responsible--presumably because they owned the track--its portion of the punitive damage award is $2.5 billion. 
How can it be that a Federal agency determines that a company has no responsibility for an accident, another agency declines to assess any safety violation against that company, and yet, this enormous verdict is awarded? 
The case in New Orleans is but the latest example of why we need to reform the entire civil justice system. We need to place some limits on verdicts. We need to modify the laws regarding joint liability. Finally, we need to provide disincentives for lawyers to sue the deep pocket every time they can.

Mr. ASHCROFT. Commonsense product liability reform is vital to the global competitiveness of American manufacturers and workers. U.S. companies face product liability insurance costs that are 20 to 50 times greater than those of our foreign competitors. Due to these high costs, American many manufacturers spend more on litigation than on research and development and the American consumer is deprived of the highest quality and most innovative product. 
In addition, commonsense reform is vital to the health--in a very real sense--of millions of Americans. In 1993, Jim Vincent, the chairman and CEO of Biogen, indicated to this committee that his company decided not to pursue research into the development of an AIDS vaccine, because of the current U.S. product liability system. In addition, availability of many biomaterials such as silicone, polyester, dacron, and rubber that are used in lifesaving medical implant devices is being threatened by our current product liability system. 
Despite years of effort, the only Federal tort reform we have been able to accomplish has been in the areas of food donations, securities litigation, general aviation aircraft, and individual volunteer liability. The one area of reform that has been, in effect, long enough for us to measure its results is the General Aviation Revitalization Act of 1994, which was signed by President Clinton on August 17, 1994. 
The aviation liability reform bill enacted a statute of repose for general aviation aircraft. In 1994, proponents of the bill said that it would produce jobs. It has. To date, over 9,000 new jobs, good jobs, have been created. Single engine aircraft are being manufactured in American again, and an endangered industry has been revitalized. President Clinton was right to support that bill. Let us bring the results of the General Aviation Revitalization Act of 1994 to the broad segments of our country and industries. 
The principles which we begin this conversation should be based on making the product liability laws in this Nation fair for consumers who purchase defective products while placing the burden on those responsible for putting these products into the stream of commerce. We also should seek to ensure that those who misuse products, or use them while under the influence of drugs or alcohol, do not collect a windfall which becomes a burden for American consumers in the form of increased costs for products--useful products that are no longer available in the market, and the loss of jobs and greater opportunities. 
We should not affect the ability of plaintiffs to sue manufacturers or sellers of medical implants. Rather, we should allow raw materials suppliers to be dismissed from lawsuits if the generic raw material used in the medical device met contract specifications, and if the biomaterial supplier is not classified as either a manufacturer or seller of the implant. 
Strong product liability reform is good for America. It ensures that consumers, injured by a product, will be fairly compensated. It will enhance American innovation, which is the best in the world, by treating responsible entrepreneurs fairly while treating the bad actors harshly and to the full extent of the law. 
As chairman of the Consumer Affairs Subcommittee I am committed and look forward to working with members of this committee, on both sides of the aisle, and with the administration toward ending the 20-year study and painstaking endeavor to provide our Nation with sound and fair Federal product liability law. It took the European community about 6 years to accomplish this goal and create the European Product Liability Directive. Japan enacted its first product liability reform law almost 2 years ago. Our Nation, this Congress, and this administration should pull together and meet the challenge of our foreign competitors and enact fair and balanced product liability law.

Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I thank you for this opportunity to express myself regarding a challenge which faces the United States of America. It is the challenge of making sure that our political system operates to allow the real representatives of the people, representatives who will express the view and the will of the people, to inhabit the positions of responsibility in Government. 
The American people, I think, are convinced that the current political system is flawed, and I believe they are right. But I do not believe that the answer is some sort of broad campaign finance legislation that restricts core political speech; or even that says we will penalize people who are wealthy if they want to spend their own money so only the people who are even more wealthy can pay both the penalty and finance their campaign. I believe the focus should be on enforcing existing laws, not creating new ones. This administration's concerted policy of selling access to the White House and using any and all means to raise money is reprehensible. As a matter of fact, I think it is illegal. And the answer to such law breaking is law enforcement, not law proliferation. 
No doubt the administration's disregard for the law has contributed to public discontent. But at a deeper level, I believe that the sentiment that the system is broken stems from the fact that elected representatives of the people are out of touch with the people on all manner of important issues. I am reminded of Federalist Paper No. 57 in which James Madison emphasized that legislators must be given `a habitual recollection of their dependence on the people.' 
The best way to solve the problems we face, in my judgment, and to provide the much-needed `recollection of [our] dependence on the people,' is not through making it impossible for people to express themselves, not by limiting what people can say, not by calling our opponents special interests. It is, though, by doing something that Americans have found to be a workable solution all across this country, and they have embraced it from the very highest office in the land to the very lowest office in the land. It is the concept of term limits. Term limits will provide true reform. 
I believe that incumbency is the real problem in our system. Incumbency is, and always has been, the single greatest perk in politics. It is the single greatest obstacle to true political reform. It is the way in which people obscure the view of the political universe by inhabiting the podium themselves, and the 
challenger does not have a chance. Committee assignments translate into campaign contributions; bills mean big bucks; and over and over again, no matter how you structure it, no matter what you say about it, the incumbent continues to win. 
People who have been on this floor throughout the debate so far as it relates to the so-called campaign finance reform talked about the fact that sometimes incumbents are outspent, sometimes they are not. But if you look at the data, the data are that in 90 percent of the cases--more than 90 percent of the cases in the Congress--incumbents win. 
The value of incumbency is as strong as ever and, in my judgment, after witnessing what happens when you have campaign reform, you almost inevitably elevate the value of incumbency. 
One of the speakers who spoke not long ago here on the floor indicated he wanted to limit the amount of money that would be spent in a campaign. He would have done so voluntarily. Well, of course. People who have 100 percent name recognition will always want to limit the amount of money that is spent. Hershey's doesn't need to advertise that it sells chocolate. It is the new company that needs to advertise. Kleenex doesn't need to advertise that it sells tissues. It is the new one that does. And the incumbents will always want to put limits on challengers. Because whenever you limit what someone can say about you, and you are an incumbent, you have the only access to the marketplace. You have the only access to the podium. It is no revelation to find that those who inhabit public office want to keep the expenditures down. They don't want competition to be able to talk about what they have done or how they have performed, or to compete with them for a position in the marketplace. They don't want the competition to be able to walk in and say, `We can do a better job.' 
We have watched it over and over again. In the 1996 congressional elections, which were heralded as highly competitive, here is the data: 94 percent of all Members who sought reelection were returned to Washington. Incumbency remains the biggest perk of all. The best way to get reelected is to be elected and then to stay here. And if you have a chance once you are here, vote for campaign reform, which makes it harder and harder for anyone else to challenge your message or the information you send out under your frank on the letter that you don't have to pay postage on, financed by the Government. 
What competition there was, in 1996, came as a result of voluntary departures, not any weakening of the power of incumbency. Term limits, in my judgment, are a tried and tested reform. I happen to be a person upon whom term limits have operated. I was the Governor of my State. It's an awful good job being Governor. If anybody ever offers you the chance to be Governor, take it. I know a number of you in the Senate have previously been Governors. They are such good jobs that people would struggle to keep those jobs. 
Sometimes jobs are so good that people will do illegal things to keep them. I won't cast any specific aspersions, but we saw an awful lot of activity in the national election in 1996, where people were apparently willing to have dealings with some pretty shady characters, even folks from overseas, even overseas governments, in an effort to keep jobs. 
It seems to me one of the things we ought to do is to say to people: These jobs don't belong to you. They belong to the people of this country. We ought to level the playing field, occasionally, and make it possible for people to come in. If we are really interested in offering the opportunity to new individuals and to people who have not traditionally had access to power--for example, minorities and women--we ought to have term limits. Term limits will open the door and we will find out something important about the American people, and it is this: The American people are capable. 
There is kind of a myth around here that the Senate is an exclusive club of 100 people; somehow 100 people who are exclusively endowed with the capacity to run the U.S. Senate and 
our country. It is the idea that we are the only smart ones who could get this job done. That is probably as close to coming to real humor as we get in this body; it is laughable. The American pool of talent is not shallow. It is deep. There are millions of people in this country--yes, there are millions who could do the kind of job that is necessary to run America. That is the virtue of a democracy. The virtue of a democracy isn't that you get a few people at top and you keep them there to impose their will on the country. The virtue of a democracy is that the will of the people is imposed on those who govern. We are not here to impose our will on them. We are here to reflect the will of the people. 
I don't think making sure we can stay here forever and retire here, or be carried out feet first, is what this country is all about. Let's try what has already happened in a number of other settings politically. Mr. President, 41 Governors are subject to term limits. Why? Because the people want a fair system. They want public officials who are reminded constantly of their responsibility to the people--20 State legislatures have term limits, countless State and local officials nationwide; the President, since 1951, has been term limited. As a result, term limits are enormously popular. 
People know they work. This is not a proposed sort of reform about which people know nothing. This is a proposed reform with which people are intimately familiar. They have seen it work in 40-plus States for Governor. They have seen it work in their city councils, they have seen it work in the Presidency of the United States. They think `give someone else a chance' is a good idea, and so do I. 
In Maine, 64 percent of the public voted in favor of term limits. In my home State of Missouri, voters have supported every term limits proposal ever placed on the ballot, by majorities as high as 2 to 1. In California, 63 percent of the people voted for term limits. In Florida, term limits passed by better than a three-fourths majority. Even most incumbents do not win by these margins, and rightly so. Most incumbents don't reflect the will of the people as dramatically as term limits do. Term limits mean no more politics as usual. 
What do I mean by that? It is just this simple. A think tank known as the Cato Institute issued a study that compared the voting behavior of recently elected Members, those who have just come from the people, and compared it with long-serving Members who have been ensconced as incumbents. They concluded that term limits would have made an enormous difference. Here is what it said. The study concluded that, recently elected Members exercise greater fiscal restraint--were more careful with the public's money--and were more responsive to voters. Why am I not surprised? Those findings were confirmed by a study of the National Taxpayers' Union. 
Specifically, the Cato study found that based on the voting patterns of recently elected Members, a term-limited Congress would have defeated the tax increases of both President Bush and President Clinton, and would overwhelmingly have supported the balanced budget amendment to the Constitution. No wonder people want term limits as a way of restoring confidence in government, because it would do what we really need to have done, and that is that we need to make sure that the will of the people is what is reflected here. 
You know, low-cost elections are not the ultimate objective. The ultimate objective is that the will of the people should be the supreme law of this land. Above all else, term limits serve the much-need function of providing legislators with this awareness that they need to have, according to Madison in the Federalist Papers, `a recollection of their dependence on the people.' 
Term limits provide a reminder that the power of legislators comes from the people, and that it is no hardship to return to live as one of the people. As a matter of fact, it would be a condition to be imposed on everyone, were we to embrace term limits. 
Experience has proven that we do not need a professional legislature. It has been a professional Congress, on the other hand, that has brought us such successes as the House bank, the midnight pay raises, and the savings and loan debacle. 
What is wrong with the McCain-Feingold campaign finance reform proposal? I will say this, it will make matters worse by strengthening incumbents. 
The McCain-Feingold proposal, scaled down or not, is an incumbent protection proposal masquerading as reform. This should not come as a surprise to us, because it is certainly no surprise to the American people. Laws written by incumbents in Washington cannot realistically be expected to have any effect other than to entrench the incumbents in Washington. 
The McCain-Feingold proposal does nothing to address the problem of incumbency. Indeed, it makes it worse. The proposal would actually strengthen incumbents by regulating the one route by which challengers can hope to offset the advantages of incumbency, and that is free and open discussion of the issues. No matter how you slice it, McCain-Feingold is a restriction on the ability of people to discuss public issues, some of which could be substantial embarrassments to incumbents. 
I think it is fine to restrict the politicians, but I am not in favor of restricting the people. Perhaps that is the difference between these two proposals. McCain-Feingold would restrict the people in their ability to speak. Term limits would restrict the politicians in their ability to perpetuate themselves in office. 
The trappings of office provide an incumbent with a highly visible lectern. You can get to the podium easily if you are in the Senate or the House, and you can address the voters. The incumbent's voice can be easily amplified from this position of power to drown out all others. Any proposal that limits the ability of challengers and their supporters to present a different vision--whenever you say that the guy on the outside can't speak clearly, can't speak effectively, can't speak loudly, can't compete with the guy on the inside--impoverishes the very foundation of America, which is public debate. You exacerbate the problems that exist within the system that we have, and that is that incumbents are already too strong. They should be limited. 
We limit the President. We limit Governors. We limit members of the houses and senates of many States. We limit city councils. We limit terms in the PTA. We ought to limit terms in the U.S. Congress. Let's put limits on the politicians, not limits on the people. Let's limit the perpetual service of politicians, not the political activity of our citizens. 
Nothing--nothing--is more threatening to an incumbent than an informed individual who votes on the basis of principle rather than on the basis of personality. What good is an incumbent's name recognition with voters who want to focus first and foremost on the issues? And what does the proposal do? This proposal would limit the ability of people to express themselves and spend money to talk about issues. Of course, if it is all just down to name recognition, I bet there are a lot of incumbents who would like a proposal that would just eliminate the ability of people to talk about issues. 
Cutting back on issue advocacy limits the ability of voters to inform themselves and to discuss the issues. Here we have a proposal that is going to cut down on the ability to form groups, to feel free about being involved in those groups, cut down on the ability of people to make contributions to those groups, cut down on the ability of those groups to discuss the issues. 
The McCain-Feingold proposal is not just bad policy, though; it is, in my judgment, unconstitutional. Proponents of campaign finance reform talk in terms of reforming the campaign finance system because they are afraid to say what they are really advocating. What they are really advocating is the banning of political speech. I know everybody gets tired of political speeches, and we all make our jokes about political speech, but there is nothing closer to the heart of liberty itself, there is nothing closer to the core of what it means to be free people than to have free, uninhibited, unbridled capacity in the culture and among its citizens to speak politically. Political speech is noble. It is the opportunity to put feet to freedom, to actually make a difference. 
In a world in which it costs money to reach voters, if you limit spending, you are going to limit the ability of people to 
speak. It is that simple. Oh, we limited spending before, and what did it do? It meant that the nonincumbent had a tough time, and it also meant that people who were very, very wealthy could find their way into the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives. I submit to you that we have our share of very, very wealthy people here. Of course, we know that there is no way ultimately to limit what a person spends out of his or her own pocket because the Constitution has been so interpreted. 
So all we do when we limit everyone else is to say we want the wealthy to have more and more advantage as they singularly and uniquely can approach the podium and be heard in a society which ought to hear the voice of every man and every woman based on merit rather than based on their own personal wealth. 
These proposed limits on speech are flatly unconstitutional. The Supreme Court said as much 20 years ago in Buckley versus Valeo. The text of the first amendment has not changed and cannot be changed in this Chamber. 
The scaled down version of McCain-Feingold still violates the first amendment, in my judgment. The only thing truly scaled down by this new version of the legislation is the people's right to free speech. The people's right is scaled down, their right to speak freely, to express themselves, those on the outside to challenge those of us on the inside. It is compressed. I sometimes wonder why I wouldn't want to stop people from being critical of me. But you know, I think we ought to be above and beyond our own personal interests here. We ought to be talking about the public interests, not the personal or political interests of incumbents. 
Specifically, the law attempts to limit the ability of groups to associate a candidate with his record on issues that matter most to the group. Now wait a second. The law attempts to limit the ability of groups to associate a candidate with his record. I can understand how there would be a lot of folks in this Chamber who would not like for groups of people to know what they have done or to be able to tie a candidate for reelection with his record.

Mr. ASHCROFT. I thank the Senator for his comment. It is a chilling comment to think that the FEC, related to the Congress, could intervene to ask a court to stop someone from criticizing the Congress. It makes you wonder whether or not this is not a bill to transport us all to some regime in some other land. The soil of America would find such activity to be so repugnant that you would think it might cause an earthquake the dimensions of which have never before been understood. 
America stands for something profoundly different. America stands for something. And it says that when you vote for something here, you should have to stand and answer to the people and you shouldn't be protected by an election committee or some campaign finance reform which would keep you from being charged with having voted as you did, which would keep the people from holding you responsible. God forbid the day in America when someone is free to vote here and not be responsible for that vote and can call upon some part of Government to protect himself or herself from having to respond to the people and explain the vote. Such an endeavor, as pointed out by the Senator from Kentucky, is flatly unconstitutional, and it is a shocking outrage to the conscience of freedom-loving Americans. 
Incumbents enjoy the ability to trumpet the favorable aspects of their record through franked mail. They enjoy high name 
recognition. We get to stand on the floor of the Senate, and C-SPAN proclaims our message. We speak it ourselves. And so-called campaign finance reform, is to come in and deprive our competitors from the opportunity to speak their message. I can't believe that a nation based on competition would want to yield the potential for that competition. 
It certainly does not cure the bill's unconstitutionality that it restricts issue advocacy only during the weeks leading up to the election. Those happen to be the weeks that are relevant. The suggestion is that, well, we are going to allow people to do issue advocacy but not right before the election, so we will only forbid it when it really counts. 
The first amendment of the U.S. Constitution is not something to be taken lightly. Free speech, political speech, is not something to be taken lightly, not something to be tampered with, not something to say, `Well, we'll allow you to have free speech so long as it doesn't matter, but when it gets to be important, when it is time for that speech, you lose it.' Well, I see the hands of time are running out and you all are being victimized again by another so-called short Senate speech which is going rather long. 
I want you to know that I do not believe this so-called campaign finance reform is real reform. I believe that this is the kind of thing that would impair our ability to have the kind of political dialog and debate that is fundamental and necessary, and I intend to propose as a substitute to this, term limits, which are a real reform. They have been tried and tested. They are no pig in a poke. 
Since 1961, the Presidency of the United States has been term limited; 41 States across America have term limits for Governors, for State legislators in a number of States, city councils, as I indicated, clubs, PTAs. People know what term limits can do. They know about the need to rotate fresh ideas and people close to the constituency through public office. Term limits provide true reform; campaign finance provides the illusion of reform. 
I plan to offer term limits as a substitute for the McCain-Feingold version of campaign finance reform. I want to force a vote on true political reform, not illusory reform that will be struck down by the courts. 
There is just one clear answer as far I am concerned. The answer is to limit the politicians, not to limit the citizens. Limit terms, not speech. A viable and vigorous political debate in this country is essential to the survival of this democracy. We know we can do with a new set of politicians in office. As a matter of fact, in many offices across this Nation, we have seen that when we rotate people through those offices, we get better service. No wonder people endorse term limits. We should limit politicians, not speech. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Indiana for his having made it possible for me to stand and speak in favor of this very important opportunity to demonstrate what can happen when we offer individuals the chance to have competition, or the chance to have an influence on where our children are educated. 
It is one of the agreed upon successes of the United States of America that our university and college system is second to none. Students from all over the world stream into American colleges and universities, and they come here in spite of the fact that they test very, very well in elementary and secondary systems in their own lands. They come here because there is something special about the collegiate and university level in the United States. 
If I were asked why our collegiate system is tops, I would say, in my judgment, that it is because it is a pluralistic system; that it is diverse. There is no singularity with it. No one is scheduled to go to one school or another. Rather, people have an opportunity to make a selection. And students compete to get into the best schools and the best schools compete for faculty. There is lots of competition in the system. It drives the system forward. It provides a basis for not only education and learning on the part of students but it really develops the energy which provides the basis for research which is expanding the frontiers of knowledge all the time. 
This concept of diversity, this concept of pluralism, this concept of not being forced to be in one setting, this concept of the energy and creativity, spontaneity and quality that comes when an institution knows it has to do its best for its students because those students aren't forced to go there. They are not locked in. They have the opportunity to be involved in educational experiences elsewhere. That is what drives quality. It is what has carried American higher education to the very top of the educational mountain. There is no dispute. There is no challenger. Second place isn't even close. The United States of America is the clear dominant force in higher education because we are pluralistic, because we are diverse, and no one has a monopoly. 
On the contrary, if you are a student and you have one choice and one choice alone, the word `one' and the word `choice' Is an oxymoron; that phrase together. One choice isn't a choice. It is a direction. Students that are locked into a single school don't have the capacity to say I am going to do better, I will go elsewhere. They don't have the capacity to say if you do not shape this place up, I will go elsewhere. They don't have the capacity to energize the system. A parent doesn't have the ability to go into the school and say you must do better. The school says we are the only school. You have one choice. One choice is no choice. 
What we are really offering to individuals who have been locked into a school system which has failed--I think it is time for us to confess, the school system in Washington, DC, is a failure--is a plan to help energize this school system. It will help the public sector. It will help the private sector. But, most importantly, it will help students and parents. 
When I had the privilege of being the Governor of my State, I was chairman of the Education Commission of the States. I followed in that responsibility one William Jefferson Clinton, who presided over the Education Commission of the States 1 year; I the next. 
And one of the things that became apparent in studies conducted from sea to shining sea in this country is that the single most important thing about a student's performance is whether the parents are involved in the education process. How do you get parents involved? You make them meaningful. How can you make parents meaningful in Washington, DC? You can give them the opportunity together with the student to make a choice to go to a school where their needs can be met instead of locking them into a situation where their needs aren't being met and have not been met. And it is a demonstrated fact--the studies tell it, the audits tell it, the school facilities tell it--that the needs aren't being met. 
Unfortunately, our Secretary of Education has come out to oppose this program providing scholarships so that students could move from one school to another and get good training somewhere if they are not getting it where they are. And he indicated he was opposing it because he felt like it was reducing the funding. 
Let me just repeat. This particular measure reduces funding not 1 cent. It adds funding to just introduce the concept of scholarships and to put into the hands of parents and students the ability to say we will go where our needs are met. Will this help the District of Columbia schools? It definitely will because they will understand they are no longer the exclusive provider of whatever it is they want to provide. They will have to start becoming the creative supplier of what it is that students need. Will it help the students? Obviously, it will help the students. It will get their parents involved. It will get them involved. It will meet their needs. And we will establish a model here in the District of Columbia, in the Nation's Capital, which in my judgment would well serve the entire country. 
It is true that pluralism and diversity are the strength of this great land. They have carried our collegiate system and our research universities to the very top in education around the globe. It would be no accident if we were to allow this to happen at the elementary and secondary level. And it could happen if we were to simply embrace the opportunity of letting parents make meaningful choices. One choice is an oxymoron. One choice is no choice at all. It is a trap. It is time to free students and parents to have an opportunity to select schools that can meet their needs and do so without impairing the financial viability and capacity of the District of Columbia school system in the process. 
Mr. President, I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.

Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to prohibit the Federal Government from developing and/or imposing new national individualized tests on students across the country. 
During his State of the Union Address this year, President Clinton announced his intentions to establish national tests for students in fourth grade reading and eighth grade mathematics. Without waiting for congressional authority, the Department of Education surged ahead and began development of uniform national tests, with plans to administer them starting in 1999. In August, the Department announced the award of a $13 million contract for its national testing initiative, and plans to spend an estimated $50.6 million under the contract from fiscal year 1998 through fiscal year 2001, including $12.3 million for fiscal year 1998. 
In response, Representative Bill Goodling, chairman of the Committee on Education and the Workforce, offered an amendment in the House which prohibits the expenditure of fiscal year 1998 funds for a new national testing program. While the Senate failed to consider fully and vote on the Goodling approach during its debate of the Labor-HHS appropriations bill, the House embraced the Goodling amendment, approving it by a resounding vote of 295 to 125. 
The House vote sends a clear and strong signal that Congress should prohibit Federal funds for national testing in education. In fact, the alliance of members from both sides of the political spectrum demonstrates the universal concern that the administration's proposal is besieged by problems. Here are just a few of the many reasons why national tests should be opposed: 
First, education experts such as Dr. Donald J. Senese, former Assistant Secretary for Educational Research and Improvement during the Reagan administration, warn that national testing will lead to a national curriculum. 
Second, Lynne Cheney, former chairperson of the National Endowment for the Humanities, reminds us that Federal efforts to set standards and tests have been disastrous. She points to the politically correct Federal history standards and the English-language arts standards, which were such an ill-considered muddle that even the Clinton Department of Education cut off funding for them after having spent more than $1 million in taxpayer funds. 
Third, the proposed math test is steeped in the new, unproven whole math or fuzzy math philosophy, which encourages students to rely on calculators, discourages basic math skills, and has resulted in declines in math performance. For example, the median percentile computation scores on the Comprehensive Test of Basic Skills taken by more than 37,000 DODDS students one year after the Defense Department introduced whole math dropped 9 points for third graders, 12 for fourth graders, 11 for fifth graders, 10 for sixth graders, 10 for seventh graders, and 4 for eighth graders. 
Finally, Federal testing takes away local control and parental involvement. The Federal Government should not impose its will on school boards, parents, and teachers about the education of their children. Rather, education should be controlled by school boards in local communities, where parents have the greatest opportunity to be involved in the education of their child, by participating in the development of school curriculum and testing. After all, research confirms that parental involvement is the single most important element in educating our children. 
Mr. President, the big losers from national tests will be students, parents, teachers, and local school boards. Once Federal exams are in place, teachers and schools will teach the test. In other words, they will change their classes to fit the Federal tests, in order to get higher scores. Textbooks and instructional materials will follow suit, even in areas that attempt to avoid national tests. As a result, Washington bureaucrats who design the tests will shape local curriculum decisions. National control of curriculum is absolutely unacceptable to me. Once the Federal Government is using tests to shape curriculum, parental control through local school boards will be doomed. 
Who should control local education? I believe our schools should remain under the control of parents, teachers, and school boards, in cooperation with the States. The flawed whole math approach which brought major losses in computation test scores demonstrates the central threat in national control: When the bureaucrats make a mistake, everybody pays, from coast to coast. 
Parents are looking to Congress to protect their right and their ability to shape the education of their children. A national testing system would deprive parents of this vital opportunity. As Members of Congress, we can show our support for education by saying `no' to national testing and `yes' to parental control of their children's learning.

Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I rise today to encourage my colleagues to join me in congratulating Charley L. Byrd of Lentner, MO, who will celebrate his 100th birthday on October 23, 1997. Charley is a truly remarkable individual. He has witnessed many of the events that have shaped our Nation into the greatest the world has ever known. The longevity of Charley's life has meant much more, however, to the many relatives and friends whose lives he has touched over the last 100 years. 
Charley's celebration of 100 years of life is a testament to me and all Missourians. His achievements are significant and deserve to be recognized. I would like to join Charley's many friends and relatives in wishing him health and happiness in the future.

Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, families are the cornerstone of America. The data are undeniable: Individuals from strong families contribute to the society. In an era when nearly half of all couples married today will see their union dissolve into divorce, I believe it is both instructive and important to honor those who have taken the commitment of `till death us do part' seriously, demonstrating successfully the timeless principles of love, honor, and fidelity. These characteristics make our country strong. 
For these important reasons, I rise today to honor Lois and Delmer Johnson of St. Joseph, MO, who on October 12, 1997, will celebrate their 50th wedding anniversary. My wife, Janet, and I look forward to the day we can celebrate a similar milestone. The Johnsons' commitment to the principles and values of their marriage deserves to be saluted and recognized.

Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, thank you very much. 
Mr. President, I am pleased to have this opportunity to address an important issue before the American people. 
It is an issue about the nature of Government, the purpose for Government, what we have Government for and alternative uses of resources of the taxpayers in this country. 
Data this year announced, not by Government itself but by independent studies including the best of the business journals, that the American people this year are paying more in taxes than any other year in the history of this Republic. The gross tax load is gross. 
As a matter of fact, the Second World War, First World War, the Korean war, and the war in Vietnam did not cause us to have to pay the kind of elevated tax rates that we pay today, nor did previous wars of previous centuries. 
The average U.S. citizen now pays the highest tax load, the biggest portion of his or her income that we have ever paid. 
One of the questions that we must face, and which we must answer, is the question of whether or not we should take the hard-earned resources of American citizens, people who get up early, work hard all day, go home late seeking to help their families, whether we should take that resource to spend it on what the Government identifies as art or calls art or wants to encourage as art. 
There will be some who say that this will be a debate about whether or not we support art or do not support art. I think it is important to note that art as an aspect of our culture has flourished since the very beginning of the United States as a nation and prior to that time. 
Since the time we began our culture, from Plymouth Rock forward, we have had an expression of art in the United States--great 
literature, we have had great paintings, we have had tremendous capacity on the part of the American people to express themselves and to communicate noble ideas and high aspirations through our artistic devices. 
But the debate which we are about to embark upon is a debate about whether the Federal Government should subsidize art and should identify in the art community some things for subsidy and some things for special treatment and some things to be singled out for approval while other things have to survive or fall based on their quality in the marketplace. 
So it is with that in mind that I rise to say, in regard to the appropriations bill that is now before the Senate, that we should not spend the resources earned by taxpayers to encourage one artist over another artist, to say that some art is good and other art is bad, and particularly given the record of the National Endowment for the Arts. For the National Endowment for the Arts has a questionable record of fostering artistic expression which has countered the expression of values that most Americans cherish and the values which have provided the basis for the greatness and character of these United States of America. 
The first point that I make is that the arts have plenty of money without the National Endowment for the Arts. 
Let me just point to a set of statistics reflected in this particular chart. This compares NEA spending to private, State, and local arts funding. 
Here you have private funding, the orange portion of the chart; local contributions, the green portion; the State contributions is the purple portion; and the NEA as proposed is the yellow portion. 
It is pretty clear that that withdrawal of this very small portion of funding, 1 percent of the funding, is not going to cause a collapse in the arts. As a matter of fact, there are many individuals who are part of the arts community who feel this is an incentive to the wrong things in art. 
So, first of all, we need to understand that the arts will survive. This is not a death knell for the arts. It is, in some respects, a contaminant to the arts to the extent that we continue to fund artistic endeavors of specific kinds, especially those things which are concededly politically correct or drive the agenda of the National Endowment. That is where the small yellow wedge comes in. 
Just take a look again. Private giving to the arts and cultures and humanities is up. We have had some reduction. We have moved in the right direction. We used to give more to the arts through the National Endowment for the Arts than we do now. As we have had a reduction in the dollars that are spent by Government for art, we have had this substantial increase, especially recently, in private giving to the arts so that the private sector is totally capable of sustaining the arts. 
I just add at this point that the kind of art that sometimes gets funded here is not the art of the great masses. 
I tend not to be an individual who has invested a great deal of my life in the opera. 
Now, the opera gets a subsidy from the National Endowment for the Arts, but by and large, Willie Nelson and Garth Brooks don't. Those of us that drive our pickups to those concerts don't get a subsidy; but the people who drive their Mercedes to the opera get a subsidy. 
Now, it seems to me what is clear here is that the folks who patronize the opera don't deserve a subsidy any more than those of us who enjoy the Ozark opera instead of the other kind of opera--although I don't purport to say I couldn't enjoy both kinds. 
The first point I am making here is that the arts are not in trouble. Second, the arts funding from the Federal Government is 1 percent or so. Third, the private share of contribution to the arts is up dramatically. State and local governments dominate giving to the arts. The Federal Government contributes a low portion of that. 
Employment in the arts in the 1990's is up. So we have a vigorous arts community and it is an arts community which continues to grow. This has been an upward trend at a time when we had a decline in the amount of Federal funding for the arts. If people are interested in more people coming into the arts, they could say that as we have decreased the funding, we have had more people going in. We are not threatening the arts. 
Median household income for artists is up. It exceeds the income for the rest of the labor force. It seems to me we are not threatening the art community or questioning whether the United States is going to have art. 
Art attendance is up in every category, from jazz, classical music, opera, musicals, plays, ballet, art museums. We had more people participating in the arts in 1992 than in 1982. I don't believe that is a trend that will be reversed. These things are a function of the fact that people have leisure time and the people have disposable net income and are not dependent on whether or not we have a National Endowment for the Arts. Artists are increasingly college educated as well. 
Total receipts for performance arts events are up and are approaching the receipts for spectator sports. This gap is narrowing. The arts, indeed, are flourishing in the United States. They are getting closer and closer to matching the same kind of receipts as for spectator sports. 
The point I make is that the arts have an abundance of funding. They don't need to take the resources from families that the families need to spend on themselves. We are now taxed at the highest rate since the onset of this Republic, since we have been in existence. We frequently have both parents in the work force, one to pay for Government, the other to support the family. We have governmental programming that is taking resources, saying we can spend this money better on your family than you can spend it on yourself. My own view is that is not something that we need to support. The arts do not require it, and I believe people are entitled to additional tax relief. 
The second point is whether the arts and the NEA need the money. According to the sponsors, this kind of an appropriation is not an issue. The arts do not need the money. They say what is needed here is sort of--the Federal Government telling people what is good and what is not good in the arts community. They call this the Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval argument. On several occasions individuals have come to the floor of the U.S. Senate here and said whenever the NEA comes in and puts its so-called stamp of approval on items that it somehow makes it possible for those artists to survive because people need the NEA to develop a way of helping people understand what is good art and what is bad art. 
I don't think the NEA has been very good at developing good art. They have some good art, they have some art that is 
atrocious. It is clear to me that whether it has the NEA stamp of approval on it does not make a difference. 
I go back to an earlier example. This is an item of art which the NEA has paid for in the past. It is a poem, or so we are told it is a poem. It was part of an anthology. This was an anthology for which money was paid, hundreds of dollars paid, to support this `L-I-G-H-G-H-T' as a poem in the anthology. Now I suppose you might say most people would not recognize this as great art just looking at these letters. I was not extremely well educated. I went to the public schools, and, frankly, I have to confess I did not see that this was great art when I first saw this. As a matter of fact, I thought it was a misspelling--but it could be great art. 
The argument is if you put the seal of approval on it by the NEA, somehow it will make it possible for everyone to agree it is great art, so if you somehow tack the Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval on it--it has Good Housekeeping and here is the National Endowment for the Arts, a combination of what proponents of this legislation say--the National Endowment symbol becomes the Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval for this, I suppose folks around the country will now recognize this word as great art, that this is great poetry. I hardly think so. 
The truth of the matter is you do not convert art into great art by putting some governmental seal of approval on it. It doesn't change the character of it. As a matter of fact, it doesn't help us at all in many respects. 
One of the individuals that I talked to earlier pointed out to me that in regard to this poem a Congressman called the author of the anthology, the one who had developed the book that included this and for which the Government paid, and asked the developer of the anthology to explain it. The author of the anthology said, `You are from the Midwest. You are culturally deprived, so you would not understand it, anyway,' no use to explain to you why this misspelled word or apparently misspelled word is great art. 
Well, I suppose people could say that we need the NEA so this sort of Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval could convert misspellings into great art and people would know how to invest their money. I hardly think so. I have to make that argument with my tongue in my cheek. I wonder how those who made the argument kept their tongue out of their cheek in that respect? 
The mere fact that something has the National Endowment for the Arts on it--and this particular stamp of approval is there--doesn't make it good art or doesn't make it bad art. The American people are still left to make their own judgments. The Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval doesn't really tell us much, although it does tell us something about the theory of Government that people have. 
Some people think that the American people can't make good judgments about value themselves and they need Government to identify those things which are worthy of their support, and our Government's absence of an identifying seal would be something that is not worthy of your support. I think they have inverted what is important to understand about democracy in that the genius of democracy is not that the Government would identify the great values of the world and impose them on the people. That is the idea of the monarchy, where somebody up high in some remote place would tell everybody what to think and do. The genius of a democracy is just the opposite of that. It is not that someone up high in some remote place tells everybody what to do. It is that the people, together, have a set of values, and instead of having values imposed on them by the Government, the people impose their values on the system. That is the genius of a democracy. The idea that somehow we need the National Endowment for the Arts to impose values on this culture is a bankrupt idea, in my judgment. 
Of course part of the argument that says we need the National Endowment for the Arts is that it identifies where people should 
invest in the arts. You don't have to tell people what they should like and not like, but this helps artists who are fledgling going around and saying you should invest in me as an artist because I have the seal of approval from the National Endowment for the Arts--sort of the idea you could have a central planning agency for the allocation of artistic resources. 
Now, central planning for the allocation of resources is not a novel idea. As a matter of fact, some countries tried it, not just for art. Some countries have tried it for all of their economic endeavors. That is really the definition of communism or socialism, that you have some head of planning in the economy that tells you what is good, bad, where you should invest and where you shouldn't invest as a culture. So you decide to grow this many acres of potatoes, this many acres of corn, and you make this much steel, and it is all planned at the center of things. It is supposed to be a good system, in theory. 
It took about 80 years around the world to figure out what the theory was, but it was a theory of collapse. We only have two fully confessed Communist regimes left in the world now, North Korea--and most of the rest of the world is trying to send them aid so their children don't starve to death--and Cuba, which is teetering on the edge of its own demise. The truth of the matter is central government planning to allocate the resources in the arts community isn't any more effective or any more to be desired than central governmental planning and allocation of resources in the industrial communities, the manufacturing community or the agricultural communities. 
The genius of the marketplace is that it rewards those things which are valuable in the absence of planning in Government, not that it gets signals from Government or some planning agency or some guru in some bureaucracy that says, `This is my beloved artist in whom I am well pleased, put all your money here.' As a matter of fact, some of the things that have been designated as those things to be supported like this poem--this is not the title for the poem, Mr. President, this is the poem. This is it, the whole nine yards. This is it. 
There is a dispute about whether the actual payment was $1,500 or $750. You can do the quick math. It is $107 a letter if it was $750, and $214 a letter if it was $1,500. I make this copy as a bargain to you, and just give you the $107 rate if you think your marketplace would sustain it. Of course, I am not sure whether this is the French version of the poem, the English or the German version of the poem, because I have looked in the dictionaries and I don't find it in the English dictionary, the French dictionary or the German dictionary, but who knows. I know one thing, putting the seal of approval on this would not increase its value to me, and I don't think it does for the culture. 
The truth of the matter is there are other reasons why we shouldn't be wanting to subsidize speech. Those reasons include the fact that the subsidization of speech results in the corruption of the arts. Jan Breslauer of the Los Angeles Times wrote eloquently that the National Endowment for the Arts results in the corrosive effect on the arts, that as a matter of fact that effect on the arts was prompted by the fact that National Endowment rewards politically correct art and art expression. She says, `The Endowment has quietly pursued policies rooted in identity politics.' The National Endowment for the Arts is conducting a political effort, `a kind of separatism that emphasizes racial, sexual and cultural differences above all else.' 
This is art subsidized by Government and specifically designed to separate us one from another based on racial differences, sexual differences and cultural differences. She says these policies have not `excited much controversy, but they have had a profoundly corrosive effect on the American arts.' Here is a clear indication by an art critic that the subsidy of arts, based on political preference, based on subject matter that is designed to divide the American people based on sexual, cultural and racial lines, pulls us apart rather than unifies us, has a corrosive effect on the arts. Not only a corrosive effect on the arts, it has a corrosive effect on the culture. 
I wonder if we ought to spend our resources on something which produces that kind of an impact on the culture? 
Mr. President, there are a number of other reasons and things I would like to say about this. We will have debate on both sides. I know the Senator from California is eager to speak. I want to give her an opportunity. So I sum up by saying there is no crisis in funding for the arts. People of America are taxed at their highest rates in history. 
There is no reason to require that there be a Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval from the Government to try to dignify art that is not art, or to make decent those things which are indecent and unacceptable. Good art will be good art whether or not you label it with an NEA seal. An artistic statement, as a matter of fact, that came before the onset of the NEA, and will survive long after it, is that `A rose is nothing but a rose no matter what you call it, and by any other name, it is still a rose.' 
With that in mind, I think it is time for us to say we have spent more than enough in subsidizing politically correct activities under the guise of promoting the arts. 
I reserve the balance of my time.

Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
I thank the Senator from California for correcting the fact that I am not from Ohio. I didn't want people from Ohio to be too upset. It reminds me of my having been introduced as having been an individual from Missouri but who was born in Illinois. I say, `Yes, both States claim me. Missouri claims I am from Illinois, and Illinois claims I am from Missouri.' 
The truth of the matter is that I would like to address some of the issues which the Senator from California has talked about. 
She mentions the fact of a poem--for which we paid $214 a letter--which was paid for earlier in the history of the National Endowment. She is correct. But it is incorrect to suggest that there are not abuses now that are even more egregious. 
This is one of the more decent egregious abuses of National Endowment money. 
I have excerpts from a book in my hand which very proudly bears the imprint, the so-called good seal of approval, of the National Endowment for the Arts. This book was published in 1996 after all the supposed improvements, after all of these wonderful safeguards to make sure that our money is well spent. I think it is instructive to read just what the authors say about their own book. This isn't some attack upon the book. This is the bragging of the authors. 
I read: 
The blood of the Mugwump clan of Catholic gender-shifting vampires has become infected by decadent words and confused memories. 
It talks about a man trapped inside a body that is always changing from male to female, and dealing with his polysexual sister. 
I asked my staff to just take a couple of pages of the book. And this book was written because the National Endowment for the Arts felt that the American people needed to have this capacity to identify good art so they could invest in it under the `Good Housekeeping' or `good art' seal. I asked them just to get a couple of pages of the book and Xerox them. But I said, `Be sure to mark out the things that would be not suitable to be shown on C-SPAN in the middle of the day.' 
This is what a typical set of pages looks like. This is what the American people are paying for. This isn't something from 30 years ago. This is something from 30 minutes ago. This is something that is current. This is something from 1996. 
No. 1, the so-called reforms have been ineffective. And, if we had an abuse which was at least not obscene--our abuses have not gone uphill. They have gone downhill. 
I have a list of current abusive things funded by the National Endowment for the Arts. I could go through them time after time. I will not bother to give them to you. Hundreds of thousands--hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars wasted in the current selection of grantees. They are not as easy to describe, and they are not as suitable for television as the 30-year-old abuses are. Unfortunately, they are not as easy to use on television. 
The Senator from California pled for honesty and integrity in talking about whether or not we would have any funding--that somehow there is a matching grant program. There is no matching program. We are not talking about matching funds here. We are just talking about other money spent on the arts--most of it in the private sector. And when they have that kind of an expenditure, sure enough, they could say, `For every dollar we have in Federal money we have $12 in private money.' That doesn't mean the private money wouldn't have been spent anyhow. After all, what happened before 1965 when Lyndon Johnson concluded in the Great Society that we had to have funding for the arts? For several hundred years America had great artists, and we weren't devoid of expenditure. We had great museums. We had tremendous collections. We had artists who thrived. We had novelists, and poets. 
So it is pretty clear to me that art is not dependent upon some matching fund system.

Mr. ASHCROFT. In response to that question, I can name at least one who didn't have that kind of grant, who was a poor fellow from a small town in Missouri. His name was Samuel Clemens. He wrote under the name of Mark Twain. He seemed to do pretty well. In the name of artists whose works are arrayed in this Capitol, George Caleb Bingham, who is considered to be the American Rembrandt, who was a Missouri State treasurer, who did not have a public subsidy to do it. We could go through the list. Obviously you could always say there may have been lots more. There may have been some who would have been great artists in the last 25 years but, because they didn't get the seal of approval, weren't able to market as successfully their artwork, now that the arts community has been so oriented to the Federal approval or disapproval. 
It seems to me, how many would be here or how many would be there is not a question that would be very productive in leading us to good policy.

Mr. ASHCROFT. I thank you for raising the extent to which I have read Samuel Clemens' work, Mark Twain. I find him to be an interesting author, and I think some of his works are better than others and some of them are very helpful and some of them moved society in the right direction--I think move us all and inspire us all. 
The point is not whether or not a writer has the ability to write things that might be appropriate in one setting or not appropriate in another setting. The point is, what do you do by way of subsidy and whether the Government decides to endow any particular writer with a special stamp of approval and discriminate in favor of that writer and thereby discriminate against every other writer? Had Samuel Clemens been a writer 100 years ago and had there been the current NEA and had the fellow from down the river in St. Louis gotten the grant and Samuel Clemens been discriminated against and shunned by the arts community because the other guy had gotten the grant, we might never have known about Samuel Clemens. 
The point is, when you start with Government identifying and establishing the value for one artist over another, picking and 
choosing between the levels of free expression, free expression in the free society, pushing people toward politically correct expression, there are risks involved there that might result in stifling other people who are not favored by the Government. So, it seems to me there are equally--it's equally possible that there are great writers who are being stifled by the current system--there are art critics who say there are--just as much as there might have been people in previous years who didn't rise to the level of being able to write because they lacked the Federal subsidy.

Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I yield myself so much time as I might consume. 
I do want to be responsive to some of the comments that were made by those in opposition to this amendment. 
They have suggested over and over again that difficulties are isolated, that they are misrepresented. And I want to bring some sense of authentication to the kinds of things in which I have been involved. 
In talking about the poem `Lighght,' if that is what this poem is, the one-word poem, there was a question about the documentation for the payment of $1,500 for the poem. The documentation we have is from Policy Analysis, August 8, 1990, No. 137, `Subsidies to the Arts: Cultivating Mediocrity,' by Bill Kauffman. And I quote: 
The NEA has been more patronizing than patron to the towns and villages of Middle America. 
So that is interesting to me, and especially in light of the remarks of the Senator from Iowa as if the NEA has been a savior to middle America. 
An example: In 1969, NEA grantee George Plimpton, editor of the American Literary Anthology/2, confounded observers by paying $1,500 for a poem by Aram Saroyan consisting of a single misspelled word, `lighght.' 
That is interesting. We have been through this particular poem. This is the entirety of the poem for which taxpayers paid. I suppose you can say it is a better poem if you put it on a bigger piece of paper so that you have a sense of the calligraphy involved. I will be willing to concede that, although I think the Senator from Iowa says it did not mean much to him anyhow. 
But it is kind of an interesting thing, when an assistant to an Iowa Congressman asked this grantee about the meaning of the poem, here is what the person to whom we gave the Federal funds for the distribution among other authors in the assemblage of this work said. The editor replied, `You are from the Midwest. You are culturally deprived, so you would not understand it anyway.' 
When the representative of the agency that is doling out grants treats American people who ask that kind of question, about whether or not this is an effective expenditure of tax dollars, that way, I do not think that is really such an enriching experience for our culture so that we need to continue that kind of subsidy. 
There has been a persistent stream of suggestions additionally from those in opposition to this amendment that there is no problem in the way the grants are awarded, and that as a matter of fact these are done by independent groups and they do not have any particular slant. That is simply not the way the world looks at it when the world reviews these things. 
From an article by Jan Breslauer, in a special to the Washington Post--and certainly the Washington Post is not some sort of conservative journal. Jan Breslauer is from Los Angeles and I believe is normally a critic for the Los Angeles Times in their arts department. She puts it this way, that the NEA has had a bad impact on art. It has--according to her--`. . . quietly pursued policies rooted in identity politics--a kind of separatism that emphasizes racial, sexual and cultural differences above all else.' 
So in choosing people to assemble anthologies or in choosing publishers to favor or in choosing artists to favor, here is an independent individual who writes for the Los Angeles Times, writing in the Washington Post, and here is what she says about it on March 16, 1997. 
Perhaps this poem that I used as an example is a poem from years gone by. It happens to be a lot cleaner than any of the other examples which are objectionable now. There are a lot of materials that I simply could not bring to the floor in good conscience. I held one up a moment ago that showed what we had to mark out in order to bring it to the floor. 
But she puts it this way, that what has happened here is that the NEA `. . . has quietly pursued policies rooted in identity politics--a kind of separatism that emphasizes racial, sexual and cultural difference above all else.' 
I would expect that to be something that hurts the culture. When the Government spends $100 million to favor people who will emphasize racial, sexual and cultural differences, that is bad for America. My colleague and friend from Iowa can hold up 2 pennies and say this is what it costs. Well, he can show me the line on the appropriations, if he chooses, that says it costs 2 cents, but the truth of the matter is we are debating $100 million in expenditures here, 
$100 million in expenditure that, according to this independent observer, says it emphasizes our racial divisions. We don't need anyone to emphasize the divisions in this country racially, our divisions sexually, or our cultural differences. 
America needs to get beyond our differences. We need to be one nation united. We don't need to be a place where we emphasize these differences. 
She says, `The art world's version of affirmative action, these policies haven't excited much controversy, but they have had a profoundly corrosive effect on the American arts.' Now, here is the real trigger. She states a condition which would make this very serious and adverse to our culture, and then she says, the truth of the matter is this hurts the arts. Then she goes on to say how it hurts the arts, `pigeonholing artists and pressuring them to produce work that satisfies a politically correct agenda rather than their best creative instincts.' 
You have a situation where an independent observer says, all of what the NEA says aside, she says they emphasize things that divide us in race, culture, and sexual matters, and that they pigeonhole artists by getting them to know, if you want a grant from whomever it is that the NEA allows to make these designations, you have to satisfy a politically correct agenda. 
It is interesting to note that there are those who are eager to satisfy a politically correct agenda, and in a list of projects that was favored with funds just this year, $60,000 was given to the American Conservatory Theatre Foundation in San Francisco in order to put on a play by Tony Kushner. Here is what Tony Kushner said about art: Art should be used to `punish Republicans.' I suppose you can say that the funding of his plays is not a problem. You might say that more eagerly if you sat on the other side of the aisle than if you sat here, but frankly, I don't think anybody on any side of the aisle should want a Government subsidy that goes to people who say one of the purposes of art--and especially a subsidy for their art--is to punish any political party. 
I would be ashamed if I were hearing arguments in favor of a subsidy for some sort of literature which was designed to punish Democrats. I disagree with Democrats, but I don't think they are to be punished because they don't agree with me. I don't think we need a subsidy for artists or authors or poets who would punish them or otherwise speak against them. 
I think that is what Jan Breslauer was talking about when she said we are driving artists into a politically correct agenda. If you want to get the grant, you have to say things like the playwright whose plays are being subsidized in San Francisco, that art should be used to `punish Republicans.' 
Incidentally, there is a list of things here of similar sorts of grants, the kinds of things that I don't think any of us would really want to support. 
I should mention that Jan Breslauer, in her special to the Washington Post, of the Los Angeles Times, is not the only art critic who says we have been wasting money on politically correct art. William Craig Rice, from Harvard University, put it this way: `The marketplace, with its potential for democratic engagement and dissemination, is hardly the enemy of the arts. The burgeoning American theater of the 19th century owed nothing to Washington. In fact, any system of selective, expert-dictated Federal support for the arts would have been anathema to the rollicking impresarios of that era.' 
Here you have a poet who says, `Wait a minute, we had great art. We had great poetry. We had great drama. And we had a system of selecting and supporting on a selective basis art during that era. It would have been an anathema, an enemy, a corrosive impact on those who were involved in the art community; creative people expressing, and audiences receiving, without the independence or the confidence to pit their taste against those critics, performers, and artists.' 
The point I am making, is the U.S. Government has no business spending $100 million--you can talk about it being 2 cents if you want; I guess you can talk about it being 2 cents. The truth is $100 million is $100 million. To me that is significant. Most people in my State realize $100 million is significant. 
More important is the fact that Government should not be favoring one kind of speech or one kind of expression over another kind of speech or another kind of expression. We should not be highlighting someone's idea of what is good or what is bad. 
I move to another individual, Hilton Kramer. This was published in the Indianapolis Star, in 1993. Kramer believes that the NEA has `gutted the initiative of private patronage.' He says that private donors lack the confidence of their own taste. Now they `wait to piggyback on NEA certification before they commit.' So they wait to see who the Government says ought to be favored and who the Government says shouldn't be favored, and then the private donors pile on. I think that is inverted. We have distorted the marketplace by putting Government funding into the marketplace. 
Now, back again, to the first question of the Senator from Iowa about the one-word poem. He says we only paid $107 a letter for this poem. I say we paid $214 a letter for this poem based on the article in the Policy Analysis, but let's just reduce the price. I will give it to you cheap, Mr. President, $107 a letter for this poem. Yes, it was 30 years ago, but have the abuses been corrected? Absolutely not. 
I talked about a book, `Blood of Mugwump.' He says it was disavowed by the National Endowment for the Arts. Here is what the National Endowment for the Arts says in its letter to the publisher, massively subsidized in publishing this book: `The progress report which you filed with this agency erroneously included `Blood of Mugwump' as among those volumes partially supported by a grant from the National Endowment for the Arts; this is not the case.' I want to know who knows what book was supported when they got the grant. Would the publisher know? If you were the businessman running the printing press, would you know how you spent the money? Apparently the people who publish the book thought they spent the money that came from the Government on the `Blood of Mugwump' book. 
That is why on the book itself they put the seal of the National Endowment for the Arts. That is what the publisher thinks the money went for. It may be that the National Endowment for the Arts decided they didn't want to claim credit for the book when they saw what they had gotten, although I am puzzled by that, too, because of a letter I have seen from Jane Alexander, the Chairman for the National Endowment for the Arts, to the U.S. House of Representatives some 2 months after disavowing this book. In March they say we don't want to claim credit for `Blood of Mugwump,' and we think you have mistakenly or illegally or inappropriately--in a letter from the general counsel--we think you have mistakenly, illegally, or inappropriately included the fact that you spent the money. 
It looks to me like the author or publisher knew where they spent the money. What do they say about a publisher who does this later on? Here is what Ms. Alexander says about that publisher. She says, `The [American Family Association] also criticized the agency for supporting Fiction Collective 2 (FC-2), a small publisher at the University of Illinois, which has introduced some of our newest minority writers of quality to the American public. Over the years, FC-2 has sustained a commitment to intellectual challenge, and some of America's greatest writers have supported it.' 
She goes on to endorse the publisher. We provide the funding for which the publisher says part of what we got for it was `Blood of Mugwump.' Here is a letter saying you better not say we helped publish `Blood of Mugwump,' and then they endorse the publisher and say what a fine group they are. 
You don't have to read too far between the lines to find out what is going on. 
Incidentally, the `Blood of Mugwump' volume is one which is frankly so repugnant to the values of America--it talks about a clan of Catholic, gender-shifting vampires who get infections, viruses, by reading prayer books. The virus comes in through the eyes. I really cannot imagine this is the kind of thing we want to suggest to the American people, that the way you get the kind of fatal diseases or the way you really get involved in things that are counterproductive is to somehow be involved with religious artifacts or read a prayer book that will get you infected so you start eating your own flesh or the flesh of others. 
I had my staff look at the book and just Xerox a couple pages. I told them I didn't want anything that would offend the conscience of the American people if I showed it on television, to mark out that which should not be shown on Senate TV, and that is what came from the book. It carries the so-called Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval of the National Endowment for the Arts. 
It is kind of interesting, though. Here is another set of individuals who have been careful about their statements, and I think they are appropriate. There have been a lot of suggestions here that this is important or we will not have anybody who is not well to do who can appreciate art or participate in art. I think that is nonsense. 
They talked about Robert Penn Warren having been included in the anthology of poetry. The truth of the matter is Robert Penn Warren wrote his famous `All the King's Men' in 1945, 20 years before the National Endowment for the Arts came into existence. He was a nationally known, world-renowned author. 
The truth of the matter is we have had great individuals who have not received NEA grants. The suggestion that because a few people have succeeded or a number of people have succeeded after they have received a Federal subsidy and that they somehow could not have succeeded without a Federal subsidy, I can't really follow that logic. 
America has been full of good people who have written well and have produced well artistically. I don't think there has been any suggestion they have all been born to rich parents or even predominantly born to wealth. I don't think the ability to express one's self correlates to whether or not you have wealthy parents. It certainly doesn't correlate to whether or not you have been favored with a Federal grant. 
One thing that does correlate is the fact that most Federal grants, or a large portion of them, go to support institutions that the wealthy patronize far more than the poor do. 
I am quoting again from Policy Analysis in an article by Mr. Kauffman, No. 137, `Take art museums, a favorite NEA beneficiary. Eighty-four percent of art museum visitors have attended college; less than a third of the entire population has.' So people who are getting that subsidy are people who are very well educated. He said `Blue-collar workers constitute 47 percent of the workforce but just 7 percent of the art museum audience.' 
So you have basically one-seventh of the art museum audience that is blue collar. 
I am not saying we should not have art museums, but I am saying we ought to be careful, when we talk about subsidies, that we don't suggest to people we are subsidizing things for people who cannot afford them when in fact we are subsidizing programs for people who can very well afford them. 
Robert J. Samuelson, a well-known, outstanding economist and commentator, put it this way, calling subvention of the arts `highbrow pork barrel,' and `an income transfer from middle-class taxpayers to affluent museum goers.' 
Now, I think the point is that to suggest that the National Endowment for the Arts is some way that we somehow open a door for everyone who is poor to become a great artist is simply to misinterpret what is happening here. All too frequently, the National Endowment for the Arts is subsidy for well-to-do individuals to be able to do what they would do anyhow. I believe that our responsibility to tax Americans is not related to providing subsidies for people to do what they can do on their own. Maybe Abraham Lincoln said it better than anybody else, when he said that `The role of Government is to do for people what they cannot do well for themselves.' I think these are things that can be done well. 
There has been some suggestion on the part of those who would oppose this amendment, also, that the existence of good authors who have received help shows that we should have been subsidizing the program. I don't think that proves anything at all. You can have a good baseball player who got some help from the Government; does that mean we should have a program to subsidize baseball? You have to look at what happens in the absence of a subsidy and what happens in the presence of a subsidy. I think if you look at the first 200 years of this Nation's existence, basically where we had no subsidy, the quality of art was very good. As a matter of fact, it may have been better than it is today. 
In many respects, whenever you provide a subsidy, you pay for something that the public would not pay for. Now, usually the public won't pay for things that are not as good. In business, for example, if you have a subsidy for something and it won't exist unless you subsidize it, it means that the market doesn't really believe that it is worth what people would be asked to pay for it and it simply doesn't survive. So that subsidies themselves become a way for picking up things, in many respects, at the bottom end of quality. I won't deny that there may be fledgling artists who may be beginning and might want to try and find somebody to provide them a stake so that they can get started. But people who find their way into other professions don't have a means of getting started in their writing, in their music, and in their paintings. For my music and for my writing, I have never had that kind of subsidy. I have done it on my own. It is not that I resent those who do. But I think it is important for us to understand that when the Government chooses one and denies another, it expresses a special set of values. In my view, that special set of values is something that we ought to be careful about, especially when that special set of values is found in books like `Blood of Mugwump,' where you have people who are sexual deviants and vampires, who involve themselves in cannibalism and other things as a result of their problems, which come to them because they were involved in religious experiences. I think that is an affront. I am not a Catholic. I am grateful for my Catholic friends and for the influence of the Catholic Church in this culture. But if I were, as a Catholic, to look at the book `Blood of Mugwump,' about a Catholic family group of vampires with all this deviance and were to learn that it suggested in the book that many of their problems come as a result of a virus that infects them because they are involved in prayer, I don't know if I would think that was a very appropriate book. I don't think the Government needs to be in the business of approaching this culture of literature and subsidizing this literature, if it is going to pull the spiritual underpinnings of America from beneath us. 
I know there is a dispute about whether this publisher was the one that got the assistance, or whether this specific book got the assistance. The publisher seems to be representing the fact that he used the money to publish this book. The National Endowment for the Arts, having learned that people are distressed about this, now wants to say that the publisher should not have used the money for the book. But then, later on, the Chairman of the National 
Endowment for the Arts indicates that this is one fine publisher and it ought to be credited for what it has done to bring on line exciting new authors who would have novel approaches to the world. Some of those novel approaches would certainly be best left without a Federal subsidy, in my judgment. 
I observe the presence in the Chamber of other individuals, such as the senior Senator from North Carolina. I reserve the balance of my time at this moment and suggest the absence----

Mr. ASHCROFT. I thank the Chair. I thank the Senator from Washington. I believe the 8 minutes that I have remaining will be sufficient for me. 
I want to begin by thanking Senator Helms for his understanding of the fact that subsidized speech, the process of identifying for Americans what they should value and what they should not in terms of ideas, somehow selecting between one author and another, has been a bad concept. It has been a bad concept which turned into a horrible concept as we have literally wasted resources, and it has been a waste of resources from the inception. I provided examples from the 1960's, and I have examples from the 1990's. 
Now, part of the activity on the part of the group that would seek to praise the National Endowment and say that it is just fine is the suggestion that the NEA disavowed involvement in the publication of the `Blood of Mugwump' book. 
In March this year they said to the publisher: You shouldn't have used the money on `Blood of Mugwump.' And this was brought to the floor by the Senator from Iowa as testimony that the National Endowment had nothing to do with the scandalous and literally revolting attack on faith and on persons of spiritual values and upon morality that the `Blood of Mugwump' book represents. And obviously, the National Endowment, having been caught in this indiscretion, feels bad about it and seeks to repudiate it. But the Senator from Iowa did not provide the additional documentation showing that 5 months before that the publisher was submitting a reimbursement form that included `Blood of Mugwump' as part of what was being subsidized.

Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, the situation is simply this. The publisher in the previous year was claiming that it was publishing with the grant the `Blood of Mugwump.' I think the record is clear. It may be that the National Endowment for the Arts doesn't want to say that the money, our money, your money, my money, taxpayers' money was being used for what was obviously revolting or repugnant literature. But the publisher knew what he was using it for and his request for reimbursement submitted to the agency well before, during the previous year indicated that the utilization of the resource was for `Blood of Mugwump.' Nevertheless, the National Endowment for the Arts says that its grant wasn't `Blood of Mugwump.' It was books like this one, `S & M.' Frankly, I could not read a page out of this book that I have seen to the Senate; I could not read it in my home, could not read it anywhere else. It says on the front, `It's funny. It's smart.' It is not, not at all. 
Fellow Members of the Senate, the United States of America has been a culture that's been rich in good art and has been rich in good culture and has attained a level of being a world leader not because of Government sponsorship, not because of Government telling people what's good and what's not good and awarding scholarships or grants to one group and not to another. We attained our level of greatness in the absence of those things and in the presence of a free marketplace, in the presence of freedom for art. 
Less than a month before John Kennedy was assassinated, less than a month before he died, he was asked to speak at Amherst College in Massachusetts to praise American poet Robert Frost. John Kennedy talked about art and about freedom and about how artists need to be free in order to express themselves with integrity and how Government might corrupt that process. 
Now, you have to understand that there was no such thing as the National Endowment for the Arts in the lifetime of John Kennedy, President of the United States, assassinated in 1963. This program, the National Endowment for the Arts, was part of Lyndon Johnson's discontent with America, thinking we could make it a great society by infusing Government money everywhere. And you know what he did to the family; you know what he did with the welfare system, and you are seeing what he did to the arts. 
Here are the words of John F. Kennedy.  
For art establishes the basic human truths which must serve as the touchstones of our judgment. The artist, however faithful to his personal vision of reality, becomes the last champion of the individual mind and sensibility against an intrusive society and an officious State. 
Let me just say that again and see if I can say it more clearly. John Kennedy says that the artist becomes an individual who stands against the intrusive society and the officious State. He sees the artist as a line of defense against statism. He sees it as a bulwark of freedom--John Kennedy. I wonder what he would have thought if the officious State was to be guarded by an artist paid by the State. 
He goes on to say: 
The great artist is thus a solitary figure. He has, as Frost said, `a lover's quarrel with the world.' 
Then John Kennedy is eloquent and insightful. 
In pursuing his perceptions of reality, the artist must often sail against the currents of his time. This is not a popular role. 
Well, against the currents of your time is not what we find is happening with the National Endowment for the Arts. They are directing the current. We have gone over and over the article by Jan Breslauer from the Los Angeles Times which reminds us that they are demanding that artists be politically correct in accordance with what the Government would dictate. 
That is really not rising to the challenge of being against 
the officious State. That is falling into the trap of being a participant of the officious State telling citizens what to believe and how to think. So when John Kennedy was praising Robert Frost, John Kennedy put it this way: 
In pursuing his perceptions of reality, the artist must often sail against the currents of his time. 
Perhaps he might even dare be politically incorrect, but were he to do so, woe be unto his chance of being identified for a grant from the NEA. 
Kennedy spoke in praise of Robert Frost who, without subsidy from the Government, wrote eloquently: 
Two roads diverged in a wood and I, I took the one less traveled by, and that has made all the difference. 
America could have art that was subsidized, controlled by, directed by Government. It can happen. You can look at the art of the Soviet Union of the last 70 years. They had art. They took the artists that weren't acceptable and they banished them. Solzhenitsyn was one of them. We don't manage artists but we identify ones for approval and others for subsidy, and some of those that don't get the subsidy and don't get the approval are individuals that we ought to be looking carefully at and they should not be discriminated against. A Government which discriminates against artists by discriminating in favor of others violates our fundamental responsibility of free speech. And when it promotes morality, it undermines the very foundation and underpinnings of a culture. 
We should defund the National Endowment for the Arts. We should not spend this $100 million of taxpayer resources. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I am aware there are other Members of this body who are going to be coming to the floor to speak on other amendments. However, because of the absence of debate at this moment, I will add additional thoughts to the thoughts I have already expressed regarding the need to cease funding the National Endowment for the Arts. 
I have made my position clear here, and I hope I can add something by way of suggesting that there are a variety of reasons why it is time for us to stop spending the hard-earned resources of taxpayers to theoretically support or engender culture or the arts in this country. 
I find it somewhat amusing for individuals to suggest we need to have a Federal subsidy in order for people to be artistic. For us to come to that conclusion involves us in what is a substantial repudiation of American heritage, culture and art. 
We began as a nation long before the midnight ride of Paul Revere. As a matter of fact, we remember the poem: 
'Twas late in April of '75. 
Hardly a man is still alive 
That can remember that special day and year 
Of the midnight ride of Paul Revere. 
Those who say you have to have subsidies in order to have art or poetry would have to wonder how that poem ever came into existence. Or they might say you have to have a subsidy in order to have quality art. Well, I don't know, but I believe that some of the poems and some of the art and some of the literature of bygone days will stand inspection very well and stand in comparison very well with items that have been produced more recently. 
So I want to say for the first several hundred years of this culture on this continent we managed to muddle through, but I don't think we muddled through it all. We mastered, through creating things that were truly artistic and truly things of value, the kind of art that would speak to people and that they could understand. 
I was interested in noting an article by William Craig Rice, who is a poet and an essayist, who teaches expository writing at Harvard University. As an individual who went to a competing institution, I am not accustomed to citing Harvard University, but you would think if there would be anyone who would be able to have insight about this, it might be someone from Harvard University, and you might expect them to be uniform in their support of the NEA. He lists objections to the NEA. He says that the NEA refused to fund a conservatory in New York City because its students were required to master the human figure in drawing like the old masters did. They could actually draw people and not just put paint on paper. That disqualified the particular institution from participating in the NEA funding. 
He points out that the NEA said that being able to draw people that looked like people would hamper the creativity of artists. 
I wonder whether the NEA has this figured out. I don't believe that people are not creative because they can draw the human figure. I don't think you would want to say that Rembrandt was not a creative individual. I don't think you would want to say Thomas Hart Benton, from my home State, with his ability to capture people at work, people bringing this Nation into existence, people conducting themselves in a way that makes America strong--was not a creative individual. He showed people in the fields, he showed people in the Civil War, he showed people at play, but he showed America as America was and for the strength of it. I don't think being able to do that hampers creativity. 
William Craig Rice, who is a poet and essayist, who teaches expository writing at Harvard, says, `The NEA recently refused 
funding to an art colony on aesthetic and sociopolitical grounds and then made the inclusion of performance artists and installation artists a condition of future funding.' So you start criticizing people because they are the wrong sociopolitical mix. 
Here we have the National Endowment for the Arts taking taxpayers' resources, trying to impose on people some political correctness or sociopolitical correctness, the right kind of mix, in order to satisfy the bureaucracy. These kinds of things--denying funding because they insist that people learn how to draw so that they are recognizable figures, denying funding because there is an inappropriate sociopolitical mix among the artists--sound to me like Government management of what people are thinking and of the kind of people with whom they would associate. It seems to me that is not what we earn money for and pay taxes for: so Government could discriminate against someone because they were not of the right sociopolitical mix. 
Mr. Rice, of Harvard University, further writes that `Nowadays, NEA grants are weighted toward multiculturalism, a political cause.' 
I wonder if, really, we as Americans want to try to foster and advance political causes through a subterfuge which we might label as the National Endowment for the Arts. 
Now, his is not the only voice that has been raised in the arts community against the NEA. His is not the only voice which has alleged that the NEA is really an enemy of the arts, which he does say. He puts it this way: `The marketplace, with its potential for democratic engagement and dissemination, is hardly the enemy of the arts. The burgeoning American theater of the 19th century owed nothing to Washington. In fact, any system of selective, expert-dictated federal support for the arts would have been anathema to the rollicking impresarios of that era.' He says had we had a National Endowment for the Arts a century ago, it would have hurt the arts in America, it would have curtailed, it would have stifled the creativity of individuals in the arts community. 
Responding to a written piece by Robert Storr and Lawrence W. Levine, Rice puts it this way: `What both authors fail to recognize in their own examples is that the NEA actually harms artists and the arts by its methods of selective sponsorship and top-down control.' 
America prides itself on the freedom of expression, free speech, the ability of people to stand and speak their mind, and America has also understood that speech is not merely what you say but it is your ability to communicate. If you want to communicate artistically, in poetry, graphically or pictorially, that is one of the privileges and rights of an American, within certain bounds of decency to protect children and others from obscenity. We say you are entitled to be able to express yourself. We have never thought that the Government should be meddling in the way people express themselves. It should not be subsidizing one person's expression as opposed to another person's expression. 
Here is a good reason for it. Here the author says, `The NEA actually harms artists and the arts by its methods of selective sponsorship and top-down control.' 
We have to measure what is meant by free speech. I don't think we would say that one of the things included in free speech is top-down control. The control of speech is the kind of thing we associate with other cultures. 
Now, we know about what happened in Eastern Europe, we know what used to happen in the Soviet Union, and we abhor what we hear about the control of communication in China. Yet we have an arts bureaucracy which is saying to the arts community, if you want to have the favor of your Government, you have to be willing to participate in a system of selective sponsorship and top-down control. 
To put it additionally, Jan Breslauer, of the Los Angeles Times, in a special to the Washington Post said it this way: The effect on the American art system is `pigeonholing artists and 
pressuring them to produce work that satisfies a politically correct agenda rather than their best creative instincts.' 
You have to understand, it takes me a minute to put this in perspective. Artists might operate at their best creative instincts in one system and they might distort or twist what they would otherwise say in order to satisfy something else in the other. She is saying that the National Endowment for the Arts pigeonholes artists, it gets them to create within a very confining space, a space they didn't create, but a place where they would be put if they wanted to satisfy the bureaucracy. Then it says it pressures them to produce work that is politically correct rather than work that is the best of what they can offer. 
America succeeds when it operates at its highest and best. America fails when it accommodates or induces people to operate at their lowest and least. I think it is tragic that we have in the National Endowment for the Arts what is confessed by the art critic of the Los Angeles Times, the person who spends her endeavors studying art and commenting on art, a situation where artists are pigeonholed and pressured to produce work that satisfies a politically correct agenda rather than producing work that reflects their best creative instincts. I think that is a pretty serious charge. 
I think there are other reasons why the National Endowment for the Arts ought to be zeroed out in funding. It does not spend money well. It is not really something authorized under the Constitution. The founders of this country considered it, they voted on it, they rejected it. Somehow, the elasticity that some people find in the Constitution is supposed to now grow with the document to include something that no one ever voted to ratify as part of the Constitution but somehow it is appropriate now but it was not appropriate back then. 
The National Endowment itself is not an efficient organization. It spends 20 percent of its resources on overhead, so that by sending the money to Washington, DC, we get a 20 percent shrink factor immediately just by including the bureaucracy in that which we are pursuing. 
So my judgment is that we ought to think carefully about saying what the House has said. Let's stop. This thing was never intended as a governmental responsibility by those who constructed this country and founded it and developed the Constitution to limit what we would do. This was not to be within the limits. Let's stop the waste of money. Let's stop the frivolous things that are done. 
I was interested to see one of the projects, and I mentioned this before. This represents a poem funded by the National Endowment for the Arts. This is not the title for the poem, this is the entirety of the poem. I had represented earlier that I think this is the English version of the poem but because this is not a word which I recognize in the English dictionary, it could be some other language version of the poem. This poem cost taxpayers $1,500 to write. So it would be about $214 a letter we paid for this poem. I wonder if this deserves what some Members of this body have called the need for the Federal Government to be placing the Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval on various art projects. 
It is obvious to me that the average American is not smart enough to recognize this as genius and it may take the special imprimatur of the U.S. Government to tell us just how profound this is--whatever it is--and that we should support this because, well, because Government says to support it. 
There are those who came to the floor yesterday who said we need the National Endowment for the Arts not because it is a big part of arts funding--they recognize it is 1 percent or less. The truth of the matter is 99 percent of arts funding comes from other sources. They said we need it because when the National Endowment for the Arts funds something, it tells everybody that it is something good and that by putting that sort of Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval on it, it lets people know to support it as opposed to people being able to make up their own minds. 
I have to concede the argument is partly correct. I don't think the average American would think this is worth $1,500 unless he was told it was by his Government. It may be that, once told by Government that these seven letters are worth $214 apiece, the average American citizen will nod in complete complicity and agreement, 
and say, `Well, Thelma, I never thought of it that way before, but now that the Federal Government has told me of the value of those letters, whatever they mean, I sure hope we get a chance to do that over and over again.' Well, as a matter of fact, they do get a chance to do it over and over again. 
But the truth of the matter is, there is something more profound than the light that I would make of this poem--would I be making light of light poetry? I don't know whether that means light or not. The truth is--and it is a fundamental truth--that the values are not to be ascertained in this culture by Government and then imposed on the people. The genius of America is that the values are to be developed by the people and imposed on the Government. The genius of a democracy is that people have values that they say should be reflected in their Government and not that the Government has values that it imposes upon citizens. 
Similarly, when they said that we need this kind of guidance from Government so that we will know what to support in the marketplace, that smacks of marketplace planning of other economies. You know, communism is the system whereby the government decided what should be produced and what should not be produced. It allocated the resources of the culture. It said, well, we are going to have this many potatoes and airplanes, and we are going to have this many chairs, and we are not going to allow the marketplace to operate. They tried that for 70, 80 years. Cuba is still trying it; so is North Korea, and their people are in serious distress, and we hear the subject of relief over and over again to try to give them something to eat. But in this country, we have all said that the marketplace should determine this, and we don't believe Government should decide how to allocate resources. 
Finally, most of the world has come to that conclusion. The Soviet system tried to manage production based on the values of the central government and say how money ought to be spent, and it collapsed. And when it came down, it wasn't long before the Berlin wall fell, too. Thankfully, the people are free there, and they are rejoicing over their freedom, and the government that was at the center of things no longer tells them what to produce or what not to produce. It is their privilege as free citizens to decide about how things ought to be produced and when and where. The marketplace either rewards them or punishes them. If they don't produce things that are particularly good, they don't sell well. That has a way of suggesting that they should change their minds. 
Here we have the National Endowment for the Arts with the argument or suggestion that it is a good thing to have Government telling people from the center of the Nation what they should or should not reward with their own support. Well, frankly, that is a failed system. I could understand short memories, but it seems to me that while we are continually reminded of the poverty of that system and the abject failure of that system by countries like North Korea and Cuba, we should at least remember long enough to know that we should not be embracing some sort of resource allocation strategy in the United States of America whereby we put a Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval on seven letters that may make some sense somewhere, and say, folks, with our help, you can learn to recognize a real buy in art when we tell you that it is a real buy. 
I appreciate the opportunity to make these remarks. I appreciate the opportunity for the debate to go forward on the National Endowment for the Arts. I think it is time to say to the American people, who are taxed at a higher level than ever before, we believe you work hard for your resources and we should not take your hard-earned dollars and try to tell you what to support and what not to support artistically. We should let you have some of those resources to spend, believing you can spend your resources better on your own family than we can to subsidize what the Government has decided is art. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, thank you very much. 
I rise to address the issue of the National Endowment for the Arts and some of the arguments that have been raised in this debate. 
I think it is important that we debate this issue thoroughly. I think it is important that we have the discussion of as many Members of this body on this issue made as explicitly as is possible for the American people. 
I am not in any rush to judgment or to election on this. To say because the House of Representatives has taken a position that here the Senate should not take a position or that it should merely endorse the position of the Committee on Appropriations I think is to do less than the American people expect of us. 
The American people understand that the issue before us is whether or not arts are to be funded by Government and whether that is a role for Government to play. We must look at the reason why we have Government, the reason why we take money from people that they have earned and they cannot spend on their own families. That is a major issue. And whether or not we are going to take it and then give some of it back to a State where we do not have the ability to control it, or whether we are going to give part of it to the State and we are going to control the rest of it, is another major issue. 
I think we ought to debate these things. So I, frankly, want the Senate to move forward, and I want us to move forward with dispatch and make sure that we do not unduly delay things. But this is an issue worthy of the American people, it is worthy of our understanding. I think there are substantially basic, philosophic items that are of importance here: Does the Government have a responsibility to shape the culture by paying for artistic expression, and by paying for some artistic expression and not paying for other artistic expression? I think that is a very important point. 
I say that it is important to understand that both artists and nonartists are on both sides of this issue. There are people who love the arts so much that they do not want the Government to contaminate the arts. They feel that when the Government gets in the position of starting to say that this art is good and is worthy of being subsidized and this other art over here is not good and is not worthy of being subsidized, they think that is likely to distort the arts and to leave the arts in a situation of impurity, with artists who are seeking not to express themselves but to express what the bureaucrats in Washington or in a State capital would want them to express. 
As a matter of fact, that is exactly the point that Jan Breslauer, the critic from the Los Angeles Times, has written about. Eloquently she states--and as a matter of fact, it is more than an eloquent statement. This is a rather embarrassing indictment of the National Endowment for the Arts. Let her words speak this position as I quote them. And she says--or he says. I do not know whether Jan, J-a-n, is a `he' or `she.' I apologize if there would be any offense in what I have said.  
[T]he endowment has quietly pursued policies rooted in identity politics--a kind of separatism that emphasizes racial, sexual and cultural differences above all else. The art world's version of affirmative action * * *. 
She is describing the way the bureaucracy, known as the National Endowment for the Arts, has operated, that it has emphasized separatism, emphasizing racial, sexual, and cultural differences above all else. 
I think we need to get to an America that emphasizes our identity, the common things we enjoy, the freedom we embrace, not the differences we have. I think the Statue of Liberty has stood there without wincing for a long time. She stood through hurricanes and the tests of time, storms, good times and bad, in war and in peace, but I think she winces a little bit when she thinks about all the people that have come here to pursue common goals of freedom being driven by Government to be separate, to be forced apart. 
Jan Breslauer says, `The Endowment has quietly pursued policies rooted in identity politics,' this idea of separating us into separate identities. I kind of like a single identity for the United States of America. What are the different identities, she says, that are being emphasized by the National Endowment for the Arts? She says that the National Endowment is pushing us into separate racial identities, that it is pushing us into separate sexual and cultural identities. These differences are being elevated, instead of minimized, in the way, she says, the funds are given out from the National Endowment for the Arts. 
Fundamentally, I do not believe that Government should be striving to drive wedges between Americans. Whether it is an arts program or anything else, I think we ought to come to the point where we realize there is only one word that ought to describe us in a way that unites us, and it is `America.' I don't need someone to try and push me into some politics of separatism or some identity politics and provide a basis for separating me from my fellow Americans. I think the great unity of America is so very important. 
I think of the millions of lives lost in the Civil War for unity, so that this would be one Nation united under God with liberty and justice for a few or for this group or that group, with preferences? No, for all. 
The National Endowment for the Arts `has quietly pursued policies rooted in identity politics--a kind of separatism that emphasizes racial, sexual, and cultural differences, above all else.' These are not my words. These are not the words of some individual who is against art. These are words from a critic from the Los Angeles Times. The art world's version of affirmative action, to prefer people on the basis of their group identity rather than to prefer people on the basis of their own merit. The United States of America is a place where individuals should have the ability to succeed or fail based on their own merit. She says the art world's version of affirmative action, and its policies have had a profoundly corrosive effect on American art. 
A corrosive effect--I don't know how you can define that as lifting up the arts or improving the arts. We have heard individuals come to the floor over the last several days and say the reason we need this is because it allows the arts that are sponsored to be shared with the entire culture. Do we want to corrode the arts before we share them? 
I want to mention I believe there are some artistic endeavors here that are supported that are good ones. Sure there are. You are spending $100 million, you will probably have some good ones. The question is, Is this what Government is for, to take the hard-earned money of individuals and say we can spend that money better on art than you can spend it on your family? 
At a time when real wages for individuals for over half the Americans, according to a recent national article in one of our business journals, are lower than they were in 1989, some 8 years ago, do we still believe that we want to take money that people could be spending on their own families and we want to spend it on art that separates us, that emphasizes racial differences, cultural differences, that has a corrosive effect on the arts itself? That is incomprehensible. 
Some people think it is great to have the symphony, it is great to have great art and they think about the great artists of the past, they think about artists from my State whose works are shown in art galleries of this country and have been for hundreds of years. But that is not all that we are talking about here. 
Here is a piece of art that is interesting to me. This art was funded by the National Endowment for the Arts. This is a poem. No, Senators, this is not the title of the poem, this is a poem. This poem, spelled L-I-G-H-G-H-T, I am not sure what it means--maybe light--this poem cost the taxpayers $1,500. This was the subject of a grant. Now, this is the English version of the poem, I have to tell you. This is not the French or the German version. Maybe it is the German version of the poem. Maybe it is not the English version. This is it. This is why we would tax individuals, take money that they earned, working hard on their jobs, and we want to say to the rest of the world, this is what you should be doing. 
I was stunned by the fact that my colleagues came to the floor and said we need this not because the arts need the money. They recognize it is 1 percent of the art funding in the country. As a matter of fact, less than that. But 1 percent of the art funding in the country comes from the Government. But we need it so we can have the Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval, that somehow when Government comes and puts its seal of approval on things like this, it signals to the country that this is what we are supposed to really look up to. 
I am sure getting this poem around to schoolchildren will inspire lots of them to be poets. I don't know whether this is a typographical error or whether this is profoundly insightful, but I don't think it is inspirational. I don't think we have to have the U.S. Government taking tax money from people who get up early and work hard all day and go home late, families with two parents working, one to pay the Government, the other to support the family. I don't think we do that in order to be able to put a Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval on this. 
I want to talk a little bit about this concept that you put a Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval on things by having Government tell people what is good and what is bad. Let me just indicate that one of my colleagues yesterday spoke, and I quote from the Congressional Record of September 15, 1997: 
The National Endowment for the Arts is something like a Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval put on a local effort which allows people who are running that local effort to then go out and do their fundraising and say you see what we have here is really a class operation. It is something worthy of your support, worthy of your private contributions. Look, it's good enough that the National Endowment for the Arts has put their seal of approval on it. 
And the argument is that somehow the American people don't have the intelligence or the judgment or the capacity to know what values they want expressed in their culture. They need someone from the Federal Government to tell them that this is great poetry and that they should buy it or subsidize it. 
I don't believe the genius of a democracy is having the Government tell people what is good or bad. The genius of a democracy is not that the Government informs the people. The genius of a democracy is that the people inform the Government. The genius of a democracy is that the collective wisdom of the people is reflected in what is done in Washington. We have inverted the flow of information here. The people are supposed to be represented in Washington to do the will of the people. The Government is not supposed to be represented by a good seal of approval so that the people can then do the will of Government. The whole idea of a democracy is not that the Government puts its good seal of approval on anything and then the people do it. The ideal of a democracy is that the people express their wisdom to the Government, sending their representatives to achieve the will of the people, not the will of the Government. 
It is kind of amusing to me that we have this information 
flow. We are so conditioned to believing that Washington is the source of wisdom that now we have to tell the people what good poetry is, and stuff like this is good enough for their support or something else is good enough for their support. You would think we would learn that the central government is not the place to direct investment, whether it be in art or whether it be in industry. 
There are different cultures, there are different ways to do government. There are different ways to allocate resources. One way is to have central planning, to have the Government make the decisions, encourage or allocate the resources on its own. That is a way which was tried for a long time. 
Communism was a system which said we will do central planning. We will not trust the marketplace. We will not trust the judgment that people will reach on their own. We will trust the central planners, the superior intellects of Government to make those decisions. We will ask them to decide how many potatoes are grown and how many cars are made and how many TV's are made, and with the superior wisdom of centralized government, we can tell the people how things are and it will all be better. 
I love the joke Ronald Reagan used to tell about the guy going to buy a car. 
The guy said, `You have to wait 10 years for your car but on the 12th day of February, 10 years from now, in the morning, we are going to deliver your car to you.' 
The guy said, `Oh, no, you can't deliver the car on the 12th day of February 10 years from now.' 
The car salesman says, `Why not?' 
He says, `Well, the plumber is coming then.' 
The whole point is planned allocation of resources by central government is a failure, an abject failure. 
Yet we have people come to the floor of the Senate and say people really do not know the good art from the bad art, what to support, what not to support, and they need the Government to come look and be the Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval. We cannot trust the private marketplace, the will of the people, the understanding of the people to allocate the resources that they ought to put or want to put into art. We have to confiscate resources from them and then we have to use those resources as some sort of gold stock. This is what you must support, you ought to support this, this is great. 
Well, if you put the Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval on material that emphasizes, above all else, racial, sexual, and cultural differences, in the words of Jan Breslauer, the art critic, what we have is the Government telling us what is good and telling us that all these things that divide us are good and the things that unite us are not worthy of funding. 
In my judgment, I think we should have learned something. We should have learned that when the Founders of this great country considered this question, they voted overwhelmingly not to have the Federal Government involved in subsidies for the arts. This is not new. This idea came into being in Lyndon Johnson's plan for a Great Society. We know how the governmentalism of the Great Society has been so eminently successful in other areas--such as attempting to deal with poverty. We see there are more children on poverty now than there were when the so-called Great Society began. And in an attempt to deal with situations where there were children being born to parents who would not be parents--there were no families there, really--we have seen that problem exacerbated and intensified rather than assuaged or reduced. Here we have one of the Great Society programs and here is another one that says we know best from Government. 
In the area of the Great Society, as it relates to the welfare program, we have that figured out that the central government should not have a sort of a Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval. We have abandoned the old Federal approach that says there is a way you are going to do this and this is the way, the truth, and I guess it would not be the light, would it? The Federal Government's welfare program, we found out, was a failed program. 
I yield to the Chair, if there is an item that needs to be brought to my attention.

Mr. ASHCROFT. I thank the Chair. It is clear to me that the National Endowment for the Arts takes resources from taxpayers to spend in a way that the Government thinks it can spend better than taxpayers. Even art critics indicate that that taking has not only a bad effect on people, it divides them, seeks to separate them, but it has a corrosive effect on the arts. I believe that having the Government establish values that it tries to impose on people is a denial of the genius of America, which is when the American people impose their values on Government, not when the Government imposes its values on the people. The so-called Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval theory of support for the National Endowment for the Arts reveals the bankruptcy of the concept of Government telling people what they should believe and what they should value. 
I thank the Chair.

Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I want to thank Senator Helms from North Carolina for having participated and spoken in advance about this amendment. This amendment relates to the funding of the National Endowment for the Arts. It's a means whereby arts are subsidized by the Federal Government, where the citizens of this country are asked to participate in funding a variety of things which are designated as art or as worthy of being supported by the Government. I appreciate the leadership of Senator Helms in this matter. I thank him for his outstanding remarks which he has made earlier today. 
On the tomb of English architect Sir Christopher Wren, there is an inscription which reads, `If you would see his monuments, look around you.' Each day I am moved by the beauty of the monuments of this historic city, monuments to Washington, to Jefferson, to Lincoln. They are emblematic of what is great in the art and architecture history of the United States. For years we will stand looking at these monuments as testaments to our faith. Further, they serve to remind us of the central role that artistic and scholarly expression can and should play in our lives. 
It is within this context that we must determine what involvement, if any, the Federal Government should have in the arts. It is my belief that arts and humanities funding is primarily a matter for private and local initiatives. There are, however, some areas that do merit Federal assistance. For example, the Smithsonian plays an important part in transmitting the cultural heritage of Americans from one generation to the next. We appreciate the fact that we can learn about what has happened in America by visiting the Smithsonian Institution museums. I think they are of great value. 
Conversely, a number of federally funded programs, from, one, for instance, labeled `A Theater History of Women Who Dressed as Men,' to projects representing various manifestations of political correctness, are a waste of our taxpayers' resources. 
Begun in 1965 as part of President Lyndon Johnson's Great Society Program, the National Endowment for the Arts was supposed to raise the level of artistic excellence and promote a wide variety of art. The agency's budget reached a high of $176 million just 5 years ago, in 1992, and it is slated to receive $99.5 million in fiscal year 1997. Although the NEA has funded some worthwhile programs around the Nation, it has managed to create an unbroken record of special favors and embarrassments. Year after year, the NEA has doled out money to shock artists who produce obscene, antifamily, antireligious, so-called works. I will not say they are works of art. Nonetheless, President Clinton has continued his efforts to secure tax dollars for the NEA, requesting $136 million for the agency in his proposed funding for fiscal year 1998. 
Since the beginning of my tenure as a U.S. Senator, I have opposed Federal funding for the National Endowment for the Arts. I believe that Congress has no constitutional authority or valid role to play in funding the NEA. For example, during the 104th Congress, I offered, though unsuccessfully, an amendment in the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee to reduce authorization levels for the NEA by 50 percent. 
On July 15 the House passed legislation eliminating, this year, funding for the National Endowment for the Arts. However, on July 22 our Senate colleagues in the Senate Appropriations Committee took a different approach from the House by providing $100.06 million in funding for the NEA for fiscal year 1998. This reversed a trend of declining amounts from 1992, and sends the dollar amounts back up again. I was disappointed by this action. That is why I am here today. I am here today to attempt to persuade my colleagues to end funding for the National Endowment for the Arts. 
There are numbers of reasons why we should end funding for the National Endowment for the Arts. Earlier today, Senator Helms eloquently discussed one of those reasons, that the NEA has consistently funded art that is antifamily, morally objectionable, 
and obscene. There has been much debate on this point, and this debate, I am sure, will continue. I would like now to discuss some of the other reasons why we should stop funding the NEA. 
In a time when we are paying the highest taxes in the history of the United States, why should we continue funding the National Endowment for the Arts? I think our priorities should be to balance the Federal budget as quickly as possible and deliver deep across-the-board tax relief to the American people. Another public gift to the NEA bureaucrats would be a slap in the face of millions of taxpayers who deserve tax relief but were told this year we just don't have enough resources to be able to accord you the relief you deserve. Frankly, that is an inadequate response to individuals while we are funding a variety of art projects which qualify on the basis of their political correctness; art projects which would undermine the very things that parents are trying to teach their children about the values that have made this Nation great. 
Second, Congress should not be in the business of making direct subsidies to free speech. I really question whether it is the proper role of the Federal Government to directly subsidize free speech as we do through the National Endowment for the Arts. 
Government subsidies, even with the best of intentions, are dangerous because they skew the market. They tend to allocate resources to something that would not be or could not be supported on its own. And they skew the market toward whatever the Government grantmakers prefer. It says that we think a certain kind of art is best and we will pay for that kind of art but we won't pay for other kinds of art. It seems to me, to have the Federal Government as a giant art critic, trying to say that one kind of art is superior to another, one kind of speech is superior to another, one set of values is superior to another, is not something that a free nation would want to encourage. 
National Endowment for the Arts grants placed the stamp of official U.S. Government approval on funded art. This gives the Endowment enormous power to dictate what is regarded as art and what is not. Frankly, I believe they have made serious mistakes in the past, suggesting, of things that were nothing more than offensive, obscene material, that they were in fact art. 
The Los Angeles Times critic Jan Breslauer demonstrates that the NEA's subsidization of certain viewpoints poses great problems. The Los Angeles Times critic writes:  
[T]he endowment has quietly pursued qualities rooted in identity politics--a kind of separatism that emphasizes racial, sexual and cultural difference above all else. The art world's version of affirmative action, these policies . . . have had a profoundly corrosive effect on the American arts. . . . 
Here is a critic, accustomed to evaluating art, saying that the National Endowment for the Arts and its subsidies have had a profoundly corrosive effect on the American arts. All too frequently, Government programs, even well-intentioned ones, have a reverse effect, an unintended consequence, an unanticipated impact. And that is what we have here. Critics, understanding, aware, in tune with what is happening in the art world, say that what we are doing with $100 million of taxpayers' money is having a `profoundly corrosive effect on the American arts.' 
Here is how the Los Angeles Times critic says it is happening: 
. . . pigeonholing artists and pressuring them to produce work that satisfies a politically correct agenda rather than their best creative instincts. 
What the critic has really talked about here is that, instead of creating to express himself or herself, the artist ends up trying to create to express or impress Government. 
When you have a sale of what the communication is and a subsidy that reinforces the fact that someone is willing to sell their idea and to distort their idea for purposes of selling it, that is nothing more than a prostitution of the arts. It changes arts from their purity--from purity to pandering. It panders after the bureaucracy and has, according to this well-known critic, `a profoundly corrosive effect on the American arts.' 
Despite Endowment claims that Federal funding permits underprivileged individuals to gain access to the arts, it is important to look at what actually happens. The NEA grants offer little more than a subsidy to the well-to-do. One-fifth of the direct NEA grants go to multimillion-dollar arts organizations, $1 out of every $5 goes to the multimillion-dollar art organizations. 
Harvard University political scientist Edward C. Banfield has noted that the `art public is now, as it has always been, overwhelmingly middle and upper middle class and above average in income--relatively prosperous people who would probably enjoy art about as much in the absence of the subsidies.' The poor and the middle class thus benefit less from public art subsidies than do the museum- and symphony-going upper middle class. 
Economist David Sawers of Great Britain argues that `those who finance the subsidies through taxes are likely to be different from and poorer than those who benefit from the subsidies.' In fact, the $99.5 million that funds the NEA also represents the entire annual tax burden for over 436,000 working-class American families. To say to nearly half a million American families, everything you have as an annual tax burden will be taken and spent to subsidize art, or so-called art, or politically correct expression which has been distorted by the bureaucrats that have demanded that things be politically correct, is an affront to hard-working American families. I think we either ought to spend the money far more wisely or, preferably, we ought to say to those families, we will not tax you so we can demand and elicit from an art community politically correct statements in which they do not necessarily believe but for which they will seek to alter their art in order to get the Federal funding. 
In short, the Government should not pick and choose among different points of view and value systems. Garth Brooks' fans pay their own way, while the NEA canvasses the Nation for politically correct `art' that needs a transfusion from the Treasury. 
If country music folks can spend their own money to enjoy the art they enjoy, I don't know why those who would patronize the ballet or the symphony or would somehow want to induce the support of politically correct art can't support their own version of what they enjoy in the field of art or performance. It is bad public policy to have these direct Federal subsidies of free expression. 
Third, Congress had no constitutional authority to create or fund the NEA. 
Although funding for the NEA is small in comparison to the overall budget, elimination of this agency sends the message that Congress is taking seriously its obligation to restrict the Federal Government's actions to the limited role envisioned by the Framers of the Constitution. Nowhere in the Constitution is there any grant of authority that could reasonably be construed to include promotion of the arts. 
There has been a little debate about this. I would like to point out that during the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia in 1787, delegate Charles Pinckney introduced a motion calling for the Federal Government to subsidize the arts in the United States. Although the Founding Fathers were cultured men who knew firsthand of various European systems for public arts patronage, they overwhelmingly rejected Pinckney's suggestion because of their belief in limited, constitutional government. Accordingly, nowhere in its list of the powers enumerated and delegated to the Federal Government does the Constitution specify a power to subsidize the arts. It was considered and overwhelmingly rejected by the founders. 
Fourth, the arts receive funding from a variety of other sources, and they really don't need the NEA money. The arts in America have traditionally been funded by the private sector. Up until the creation of the National Endowment for the Arts in the mid-1960s, the arts flourished in this country. As a matter of fact, from my perspective, I don't think we have had a superior development of arts in America with Federal subsidies or Federal funding. And, if we can believe the criticism of federally funded art as being art which has been distorted in order to follow the dollars of the Federal bureaucrats, insincere art that comes as a result of an enticement to be politically correct and doesn't really represent the expression of the artist, it can't, by definition, be art which would be as sound in quality as art which would have emanated from the conviction of one to convey what one believed. 
As a matter of fact, if one was to compare the art generated prior to the NEA to art that has come after NEA, I don't think it would be any problem to see we have had great art throughout the history of the United States and worthy art for our consideration and our heritage in the absence of the subsidy of the Federal Government. 
The growth of private sector charitable giving in recent years has rendered the NEA funding relatively insignificant to the arts community. Private funding of the arts has been rising consistently since 1965. It is estimated that individuals alone will donate nearly $1 billion to the arts and humanities this year. That is the estimate of the House Committee on Education and the Workforce, Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations. 
Overall giving to the arts in 1996 totaled almost $10 billion, up from $6.5 billion in 1991, dwarfing the NEA's Federal subsidy. This 40-percent increase in private giving occurred during the same period that the NEA budget was reduced by 40 percent from approximately $170 million to $99.5 million. Thus, as conservatives had predicted, cutting the Federal NEA subsidy coincided with increased private support for the arts and culture. 
Let me make a point here. When the Government tries to elicit politically correct art through the NEA, it distorts what happens in the artistic community. It distorts it in the favor of a few who would gain a majority in Government. When the private marketplace supports art based on the quality of the art, I believe that is a superior way to do it, and I believe it is superior for art. It is a way of promoting the arts through the private sector and the marketplace which doesn't have the pernicious impact of promoting art which is not for art sake or not for communication sake, but is for the purpose of attracting from the bureaucrats a Federal subsidy. 
So not only is it better to have increasing funding coming from the private sector, in terms of providing adequate resources for the arts, but it provides the validity of which and the integrity of which I believe is much more to be desired. 
Let me give you an example. National Endowment for the Arts funding is just a drop in the bucket compared to giving to the arts by private citizens. In 1996, the Metropolitan Opera of New York received a $390,000 grant from the Endowment. That is a Federal subsidy of $390,000. That amounted to less than three-tenths of 1 percent of the opera's annual income of $133 million, and it amounts to less than the ticket revenue of a single sold-out performance. 
State and local governments outspend the NEA, and their funding of the arts has been increasing. The arts are a healthy industry, if you would call it such in this country. Employment and earnings of artists are rising. Art attendance is up in virtually every category, and the educational level of artists is rising, too. Ticket receipts for arts are rising. 
The National Endowment for the Arts is not operating in an efficient and effective manner. Let me just indicate to you we have a lot of waste in this program. There is a lot of overhead. There is a lot of ineffective spending here. The NEA is not subject, for example, to the Chief Financial Officers Act, the Government Corporations Control Act, or other strict accounting standards. The NEA has not been subject to any outside reviews of its management or accounting procedures. And--listen to this--the NEA has an unusually high administrative cost for a Government agency which now approaches 20 percent. 
We talked about whether or not the Endowment's budget would carry funding to common, average people, wage earners. Twenty percent of it goes just to fund the salaries of bureaucrats in Washington, DC, who make the demand that politically correct art be produced by artists who would otherwise paint or otherwise provide other artistic work. 
We earlier learned that 20 percent of the budget goes to multimillion-dollar art agencies. So you have 20 percent that goes to the multimillion-dollar art agencies, another 20 percent that 
goes to the bureaucrats here in Washington, DC, and almost half the budget so far is in categories that clearly aren't going to benefit people, even if the nature of the art produced was valid and had the integrity that art ought to have. Then you have art critics saying that the remaining 60 percent is used to distort what would otherwise be produced in the marketplace. 
The National Endowment for the Arts recently wasted millions of dollars of taxpayers' money on a failed computer upgrade. And according to the NEA's own inspector general, a large percentage of grantees fail to document properly their use of Federal funds. So even when they send money out under the agenda of the bureaucracy and there are requirements there be documentation for the utilization of the funds, the NEA's own enforcement office, the inspector general, says, `Well, a large percentage of the people never really explain adequately how they use the resource.' 
The NEA is not operating in accordance with congressional intent. According to its mission statement, the NEA is to foster the excellence, diversity, and vitality of arts in the United States and to broaden public access to the arts. 
One-third of direct NEA grant funds go to six large cities. One-third of all the funds find their way to New York, Boston, San Francisco, Chicago, Los Angeles, and Washington, DC. The rest of the country is left holding the bag, having made these other locations substantial beneficiaries of the tax resources of America. 
Those six cities really leave much of the country without. One-third of the congressional districts fail to get any direct NEA funding. We have 435 districts. We have a lot of folks. So 140 districts, basically, get nothing. And, there is a large disparity in the amount of funding in districts that do receive funding. One-fifth of the direct NEA grants go to multimillion-dollar arts organizations. I already said that. 
Moreover, the NEA continues to fund objectionable art, continues to do so despite the attempts by Congress to limit such funding. 
I support and I appreciate the arts. Anybody who spent as much time with his mother standing behind him breathing down his neck as he sat on the piano bench and she counted the music and insisted on practicing has developed some appreciation for the arts. I don't play any of them well, but I manage to play three or four instruments. I have had the privilege of cutting a couple records and had a few people record songs I have written myself, but I never expected the Federal Government to come and subsidize what I do. Even the singing Senators don't want a subsidy for what we do. Of course, no one, not even the National Endowment, would construe what we do as art. 
But I support the arts and I know that arts enrich our lives and make us better citizens, arts that are created and developed by individuals on the basis of their own sense of communication and not as a source of chasing Federal funding. 
I believe we are challenged by the creative efforts and the talents of artists. Sometimes art doesn't have to be magnificent in order to be challenging or inspiring. I have seen inspiring art by children. I have seen inspiring art by those who are less fortunate than most of us, by those who are handicapped, because it represented some sincere expression from them as individuals. That art can teach us, it can help us, it can shape us, and it can challenge us. 
No doubt, the abundance and variety of artistic expression in America plays a significant role in shaping our culture. My position in regard to eliminating the NEA should not be interpreted as a repudiation of the arts. It should be interpreted as a means of supporting the arts. 
It must be clear that Congress should act pursuant only to its constitutional authority and not simply when Members of this body believe that it is a good idea for Congress to support something. Amidst all the rhetoric and all of the accusation lies a central salient fact: that the U.S. Government is a profoundly 
poor patron of the arts, it is a poor judge of beauty and it is an even poorer judge of inspiration. If we had at our disposal all the money in the world, it would not change this reality. 
Our resources should not be devoted toward subsidizing one kind of speech or expression over another, toward saying your sense of creativity is superior, your idea is superior to another. Rather, we should allow as many of those resources to remain in the hands of those who have earned them. When we have sought to elicit artistic achievement by governmental subsidy, according to some of the very best critics, we have distorted and profoundly impaired the ability of artists to operate. They have called our impact a corrosive impact on what would otherwise be art of greater integrity. 
With that in mind, I thank Senator Helms for his eloquent statement and his joining me in this amendment which would allow the Senate to join the House in declining to fund the National Endowment for the Arts.  
Mr. BENNETT addressed the Chair.

Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the China Policy Act of 1997. As an original cosponsor of the act, I believe this legislation provides the starting point for a much needed restructuring of United States-China relations. For too long, our approach to China has been one of passivity and appeasement. The Clinton administration seems willing to tolerate virtually any misbehavior--gross violations of human rights, arms deals with terrorist states, a headlong push to develop military capabilities that exceed any conceivable threat, even efforts to smuggle guns into the United States. This is no way to build a stable, peaceful, and constructive relationship. 
Our legislation offers a dramatically different approach. Under this bill, when China violates standards of decency or endangers vital American interests, there will be a response that is swift, predictable, and appropriate. This legislation is an important first step toward a policy that rewards and encourages constructive behavior, and discourages questionable activity. It points the way to a new and better era in United States-China relations. 
The 20th century has been the American century, and if the new century is to bear the same imprint, we must fashion a stable and constructive relationship with the People's Republic of China, which is pushing hard for global superpower status. 
One specific provision I have included in this bill protects the United States from Chinese diversion of sensitive technology from Hong Kong. Hong Kong has abided by international export control regimes and has benefited from preferential access to sensitive U.S. technology--technology that can be used for military purposes. 
My provision simply does the following: if China diverts controlled technology from Hong Kong, or if United States officials are denied the opportunity to conduct post-shipment checks on location and end use of controlled items, then the United States shall apply the stricter export controls to Hong Kong presently applied to the rest of China. In addition, if United States officials are denied an opportunity to conduct a prelicense check on the end use and end user of a controlled item, then the export license for that item shall be denied.

Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Indiana. I rise to indicate my opposition to a national individualized testing system that could lead to a one-size-fits-none curriculum dictated from Washington. Once you let Washington decide what kids should know, it will effectively control what and how they are taught. 
President Clinton's initiative for a federally funded testing system already is headed down this slippery slope--work on the tests is currently underway. Here is what we know about them: 
First, there is the eighth grade math test. Instead of measuring competence in basic computational skills directly, the test under construction would allow students to use calculators at all times. Some local parents, organizations, and States might decide they don't want to be controlled by a curriculum that only has reference to calculators. They might really want their young people to learn how to do mathematics absent calculators. 
Furthermore, the content being tested, which ignores algebra, would not promote higher achievement or hold up to international competition. 
Hundreds of mathematicians, teachers, school board members, parents and others recently signed a letter to President Clinton protesting the failed design of this math exam. 
In testing reading, when you have a national uniform test, one size fits none. The proposed fourth grade reading test is predicated on the same philosophy of reading that drives what is known as whole language instruction. Under this philosophy, it is not as important for children to learn the difference between nouns and verbs as it is for students to analyze an author's feelings 
about what is written. 
If a national test imposes a whole language approach to reading and rejects the phonics approach, what are we saying to parents about the potential for local control if those parents don't have a capacity to say we want our kids to learn reading by using phonics and we want a test that reinforces that kind of learning? Parents at the local level need to be able to decide if they want their fourth graders to learn the basics of the English language, not merely get in touch with an author's feelings. 
I understand that the Nation needs to know where we are academically as a nation. However, we already have a capacity to assess student performance on a national level. Since 1969, the National Assessment of Educational Progress has tested a representative sample of students in 4th, 8th, and 12th grades in reading, U.S. history, geography, math, and science. NAEP has provided the Nation an understanding of overall student performance while allowing decisions on appropriate tests for individual students to be made at the local level. While NAEP allows a measure of student performance by sampling, an individualized testing system threatens local control substantially. 
In my judgment, national uniform individualized testing will ultimately direct curriculum, curriculum which will become nationalized and uniform. This will take from the system the energy of the kind of curriculum that can be developed to suit local needs and will involve parents in education. 
The real test before us today is whether or not the President is willing to trust parents and teachers at the local level to determine what their children should learn. The single most important factor in educational achievement is parental involvement. It is more important than computers, than blackboards, than teacher salaries, than the nature of the school facility. Whether parents are actively engaged means a lot. 
If we nationalize our system of education for elementary and secondary students, we will have made it far less likely that parents will be actively involved. Parents can and should get good information about the progress of their children. That is possible at the State and local level. However, national, individualized tests would seriously threaten parental involvement and control and lead to more Washington intermeddling in our schools. 
I just want to indicate that I think nationalizing the testing process for our schools will drive us to a national curriculum and drive us to national teacher certification. I believe States ought to have the authority to certify teachers and develop a just curriculum, particularly as it relates to trying new methods of teaching. 
Many of America's schools are failing; they are failing to teach our kids how to read, write, and count; they are failing to offer them the skills to compete effectively in the information age; they are failing to teach them what America is and what she represents in the long history of the world. 
Involved parents controlling and directing schools that teach basic academic skills have been, and should always be, the foundation of our educational system. These are the building blocks that made America's schools the envy of the world. They are the standards upon which we must base their return to greatness.

Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I speak today on an issue of great importance to copyright law and to the continued growth of electronic commerce on the Internet. In December 1996, two treaties were adopted by the diplomatic conference of the World Intellectual Property Organization [WIPO] to update international copyright law. These treaties would extend international copyright law into the digital environment, including the Internet. However, these treaties do not provide a comprehensive response to the many copyright issues raised by the flourishing of the Internet and the promise of digital technology. We must endeavor to keep the scales of copyright law balanced, providing important protections to creators of content, while ensuring their widespread distribution. To begin the discussion I am introducing today the Digital Copyright Clarification and Technology Education Act of 1997. 
Any discussion of this issue, even in the most simple terms, raises many important issues. We must foster the growth of the Internet, which provides such great opportunity to our country because it is the most participatory form of mass communication ever developed. It draws people together from all corners of the globe to share and communicate on an unprecedented level, and brings all levels of government closer to the public. The Internet also holds great promise for education. Students--rural, suburban, and urban--are increasingly able to access a wealth of information right at their computer that was previously beyond their reach. 
In addition, the Internet offers significant commercial possibilities. Small businesses can reach out across the globe and conquer the distances between them and potential customers. Individuals can view merchandise and make purchases without leaving home. Hopefully, soon a system will develop to allow individuals to contract electronically with traditional force of law for contracts on paper. However, this potential will never be realized without a system that fairly protects the interests of those who own copyrighted material; those who deliver that material via the Internet; and individual users. The implications here are far-reaching, with impacts that touch individual users, companies, libraries, universities, teachers and students. 
The legislation I am introducing today would accomplish several goals. First, the legislation would clarify the extent of liability for entities who transfer information via the Internet without control of the content. Second, the bill would provide for a rapid response to copyright infringement with the cooperation of the copyright owner and the on-line service to take down the infringing material, helping to curtail piracy. Third, the Act will provide for the use of digital technology in education, research, and library archives, including updating the fair use doctrine for electronic media. Fourth, the legislation provides a standard for liability based on individual conduct, not a standard that constrains the development of new technology. 
We must confirm that the entities who facilitate the operation of the global information infrastructure not be unfairly liable for literally billions of transmissions that individual users send via the Internet or post on the 
World Wide Web every week. We cannot make the Internet too costly to operate. Liability for infringement of copyright should reflect the degree of control that any party had in the determination of the content of the offending message. Those providing the infrastructure that makes the Internet possible should not be held liable for the content of messages to which they have no access. Often, the copyright holders will be best situated to make a determination of whether their copyrighted material is being infringed. 
In addition, two very real considerations in the final outcome are the capabilities and limits of current technology. It is not possible to monitor every communication on the Internet, not even to look at every homepage on the World Wide Web, even if it were desirable. In January 1997, one estimate put the number of Internet hosts at more than 16 million. Each could host multiple homepages, and those individual sites could be composed of multiple individual pages. One individual host, GeoCities, boasts of more than half a million homesteaders, with 5,000 new residents arriving daily. As of May 1997 there were more than 40 million people on the Web, a breathtaking increase from the 1 million in December 1994. To state the facts of the exploding traffic growth in a different way, one major infrastructure provider, of which there are many, reports traffic of 250 terabytes a month--a terabyte is a thousand billion bytes--which translates into almost six billion bytes a minute--for one carrier. More importantly, any wholesale reading of messages would constitute the largest full scale attack on our individual privacy ever undertaken. We are confident that those delivering the mail do not read our sealed letters and we should have that same confidence in our e-mail and other electronic communications. It would be impossible for any carrier to review all of the material; and we cannot create a legal obligation that is technologically impossible to satisfy. Clearly, the potential for copyright infringement is real--as real as the impossibility of requiring a service provider to monitor every communication, including e-mail, homepages, and chat rooms. 
Another important issue is the right of reproduction as specifically related to ephemeral copying. As a message is sent through cyberspace copies of the message are reproduced, in a sense. This is a reality of computer technology. For the most part an entire copy never exists anywhere, except at the points of distribution and receipt. The Internet was designed to send packets, pieces of a message expressed in digital form, a full message is not sent from one point to another. In the process of delivering the message multiple copies of each packet are sent so if a path is blocked path or data lost, the end message can be totally reassembled. Additionally, a full copy may be assembled on the recipient's server, where the message would reside until the recipient pulls down the file, or a copy may be made on a user's hard drive during the simple act of reading a document on-line. Obviously, to make this sort of copy illegal would be a move that flies in the face of the operations of the Internet and would destroy the World Wide Web. We need to make clear the status of these temporary and necessary copies within communications networks. 
The passage of appropriate copyright legislation goes beyond the implications of liability and technical operations. The outcome of this debate will affect educators and students across the country. One important aspect for education is to guarantee that computers can be used in distance learning, in a way that television and video recorders have been used for years. The copyright laws have long recognized the need to ensure that the copyright laws do not stand in the way of the opportunities that the technology promises to provide students in rural areas. Unfortunately, the current law reflects the technology that was current when it was passed, largely video. We need to update these laws to reflect the enormous potential of the digital era. Part of the work in this area may include defining the classroom to reflect that in many instances the classroom is no longer a physical space. 
In addition, the fair use doctrine in the Copyright Act should be amended to make clear that fair use applies regardless of the manner in which the material is distributed. A sound fair use doctrine is critical to continued interoperability of various systems, which in effect allows the Internet to exist and grow. Fair use encourages others to build freely on the ideas and information in a work while guaranteeing the author's 
right to their original expression. Currently, fair use may be made of a work for teaching, commentary, research, scholarship, criticism, and even news reporting. We should not tolerate discriminatory treatment based on a means of distribution or an alternative technology. Fair use in one medium should be fair use in another. 
Finally, we must facilitate the preservation of copyrighted materials by libraries, archives, and universities. These institutions should be able to preserve their works, many of which represent the cultural heritage of the United States, in the best means possible, including digitally. To require that these institutions purchase new copies of existing works, but in digital format, could cost untold billions of dollars. Many works could never be made available digitally as they are no longer available in a format available for purchase. 
Mr. President, we have made an effort to provide access to technology to all students in the last couple of years. In 1996, Congress appropriated $200 million to provide teachers with the training and support needed for access to technology, and to ensure that effective software and on-line resources would be available for use with the curriculum. The fiscal year 1998 budget request from the administration for this program is $425 million, with the House Appropriations Committee approving $460 million. Approving nearly $700 million over 2 years to guarantee that education can be delivered in a digital format, while impeding or denying delivery of digital material by neglecting our copyright law makes no sense. A decision has been made that students must prepare to operate in an on-line world. We must unlock the teaching potential of the Internet and we must now guarantee that the appropriate material is made available, so that our students can receive a full education while taking advantage of the tremendous strides made in technology. 
The Missouri State Librarian recently wrote to me that Missouri's strong distance education programs could flourish or wither, depending on the outcome of this debate. I suspect this is the case in all States with strong distance learning programs to serve rural areas. These programs allow residents in even the most remote areas to have the same access to education as those who live near schools, colleges, or universities. These programs cannot operate as effectively without the assurance that educators can use materials over computer networks. 
Equally important, Mr. President, we must begin a process internationally that is structured to balance the rights of copyright owners with the needs and technological limitations of those who enable the distribution of the electronic information, and with the rights and needs of individual end users. The current treaties and statements are not sufficient, and include some language that could create legal uncertainty. The loose language could lead to law that ignores technical realities, blindly shifts liability and ignores serious issues. The language must be clarified through the enactment of legislation in conjunction with the Senate's ratification of the treaties. 
Moreover, some of the proposed treaty implementation language attempts to attack copyright violations from the position of the technology that may be used, rather than placing the blame on those who are infringing the copyright. We cannot legislate technology. Just 
as we have seen the legislated 56-bit encryption become obsolete so too will any technology frozen in place by legislation. We must end policies of the Government that hinder technology, but, more importantly we must not initiate new policies that express an inherent fear of new technology. 
We must recognize other realities. Scores of software programs are illegally copied on-line, and intellectual piracy is an issue. However, some of this problem relates to the failure of the law, particularly copyright law, to keep up with the swift advance of technology. In a digital environment, hundreds of copies can be made and distributed in the blink of an eye. These copies are reproductions; they are perfect recreations of the original. The speed with which copies can be made makes the traditional ways of enforcing the copyright laws--a court order--obsolete. Copyright laws must evolve to embrace the new medium of digital storage and transmission. Those who provide the content for the Internet need some assurance that their valuable work will not become worthless because piracy. The approach in the Digital Copyright Clarification and Technology Education Act of 1997 requires that service providers cooperate with content providers by taking action after they are notified that illegal material is posted, or being transmitted on their systems. The benefits to copyright holders are notable. A copyright owner will be able to stop the illegal distribution of the material quickly without having to use the courts as a first measure. This approach solves the largest problem for on-line piracy, by providing a quick response to illegal activity which will preserve the value of the material. 
Mr. President, one of the many important values held in this country is the freedom of expression. The United States must continue to be a leader in the preservation of freedom of expression around the world. Many countries are looking to the United States to be a leader on these important issues. We have the opportunity to send a strong message internationally that copyright law must be revised to fit the realities of a digital environment, and that by doing so we can encourage the growth and evolution of the Internet, while protecting all parties involved, with zero tolerance for illegality. 
I look forward to working with all interested parties, service providers, educators, entertainers, authors and others as this issue develops. I welcome the involvement of Senators who may have an interest in this legislation and the opportunity to work together to develop sound policy. 
Mr. President, the administration took a lead role in the copyright debate that took place in an international forum. We must continue this leadership in the Senate, in order to secure the U.S. role not only as a leader in the manufacture of technology and development of content, but also as a leader in fashioning a fair and just approach to the use of digital technology and information.

Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I am pleased to have this opportunity to have updated our appropriations legislation so that the traditional Hyde amendment, which forbids and prohibits the utilization of Federal funds in abortions, could be a part of what we are doing as it relates to HMO's. Government's role is to help people to respond to their highest and best in life. However, I don't believe the highest and best utilization of Federal funding would be to fund the destruction of children in this country. For a long time, the Congress of the United States has agreed that Federal funds would not be used in conducting abortions. 
Yet, as developments transpire in health care, and as we change from one sort of service delivery system to another, old policies might need clarification to make sure that we do not change the prohibition on Federal funding for abortions. Let me explain. 
Twenty-one years ago, Congressman Henry Hyde offered an amendment to the then Labor-HEW bill to ban Federal funding of abortions. Every year since then, Congress has adopted that amendment. While there is substantial disagreement in America over the practice of abortion--very substantial disagreement--there has never been majority support in this body for Federal funding of abortions. As a matter of fact, there has been substantial agreement that we should not force Americans to pay with their Federal tax dollars for elective abortions. 
Many individuals simply feel that as a matter of conscience, they should not be participants in the destruction of unborn lives. I happen to be one of those individuals. 
The opposition to Federal funding for abortion has been so consistent in Congress and in America that normally the Hyde amendment is just included in Labor-HHS appropriations bills and passed with no discussion. In fact, that traditional Hyde amendment is in the bill which we are debating today. However, after 21 years, the language needs to be clarified, and I say `clarified' because we are not expanding it nor weakening it, we are just making its meaning crystal clear. 
To keep up with rapidly changing health care delivery modifications in Medicaid, and to prevent misinterpretations of the life-of-the-mother exception, a technical change to the Hyde amendment is necessary if the amendment is to continue to prevent Federal tax dollars from subsidizing elective abortions. Such a subsidy would be a mandate on the U.S. taxpayers to pay for elective abortions. It would literally be an affront to the American people to take their money and demand that it be used to destroy unborn children. Such a Federal taxpayer subsidy would further sear the American conscience. It would offend the moral sensitivity of a great many Americans. 
The Hyde amendment in its current form may allow such subsidies to occur in today's health care environment. Just as other laws have had to be tweaked to function appropriately with HMO's, so does the Hyde amendment. 
The Medicaid Program has traditionally been a fee-for-service health care delivery system, and the Hyde amendment was written with that kind of system in mind. Under the system, it was relatively easy for the Government to block any utilization of Federal tax resources for subsidizing abortion. 
However, as the Medicaid structure is rapidly changing, many States are experimenting with delivery systems such as managed care, in which Federal funds are used to help pay for premiums for complete benefit packages instead of reimbursing for specific procedures after the fact. 
According to HCFA, 9 percent of Medicaid patients were served in managed care plans in 1991. By 1996, that figure had risen to 40 percent, and it is important to make sure that those health care packages, which are purchased with Federal resources, do not include the destruction of children in elective abortions. The use of Medicaid managed care is expected to continue to increase in the future, and there is a legitimate concern that since the Federal Government no longer receives billings for specific medical services under these managed care contracts, but simply pays for a portion of the overall premium, that some States might allow coverage of abortion on demand with these federally funded contracts. 
For example, under a fee-for-service structure, we would never allow a bill from a provider to be paid for an elective abortion. However, when you are paying for medical services in advance in a lump sum to an organization like an HMO, and in return for that lump sum they are meeting the medical needs of individuals, you don't get individual bills. So there would be no way to make sure that you weren't paying for elective abortions in such a setting, absent the clarifications which we are placing in the law today. 
Federal subsidy of elective abortions has never been the intent of Congress. The amendment which we have adopted today will make sure that we continue to state with clarity that, regardless of the method of payment for Medicaid services, Federal resources are not to be used to destroy the lives of unborn children in elective abortions. 
How will this new change apply in practice? Federal funds are currently used to pay the premium or capitation fees to enroll Medicaid patients in managed care plans. Without any accountability to the Federal Government, those plans could routinely provide abortion alongside other benefits as part of their complete packages. The HMO gets an amount of money. It provides a complete package of health care service. Technically, under this payment structure, the Federal funds are never used to pay for a particular service or a particular abortion, but, in practice, they could be used to subsidize abortions beyond those permitted by the Hyde amendment. To prevent this from happening, today we have updated the Hyde amendment to specify that States may not use Federal money to purchase health care coverage that includes abortion coverage. 
Precedent exists for clarifying such a Federal funding limitation. Congress already considered this indirect funding situation when it gave almost unanimous approval to similar language in the Assisted Suicide Funding Restriction Act which Senator Dorgan and I introduced earlier this year. President Clinton signed this legislation on April 30, so we have an existing law on the books that deals with this issue. The Assisted Suicide Funding Restriction Act stated that no funds could be appropriated for the purpose of paying, directly or indirectly, for health benefit coverage for assisted suicide, euthanasia, or mercy killing. We are using similar health benefits coverage language in this bill. 
In the abortion context itself, we have precedent, in that a similar provision was included in the so-called kid care legislation passed in the reconciliation legislation which the President signed on August 5. Congressional leaders and the administration negotiated this language, which the Senate approved by a vote of 85 to 15. 
Also, similar language on abortion funding was approved by the 104th Congress without controversy as a part of Medicaid revisions in the fiscal year 1996 OBRA bill which the President vetoed for reasons unrelated to this issue. 
It is important to point out that we should not have the wrong incentives in our Medicaid Program, and it is true that it is cheaper to abort a child than it is to care for the mother through the pregnancy and to deliver the child. I would be very leery about having a system where the Federal Government provided an amount of money to an HMO which, having a financial incentive to do the cheaper thing, aborts the child rather than encouraging the mother to have the child and provide for delivery. And similarly, I have serious reservations about the potential for assisted suicide, where the HMO could deliver lethal drugs to a patient and, as a result, reduce the cost of doing business. We want to have incentives to life and incentives to health, especially for HMO's who might otherwise be tempted by financial situations not to encourage individuals to fight the fight for life. 
Whenever the lives of unborn children are destroyed, I believe there is a toll on the American conscience, and I think it is substantial. When Government provides an opportunity for abortion with Federal funds, we certainly find ourselves in a serious situation where the moral fabric of the country would be stretched, if not permanently torn. I am pleased today that the Senate has agreed to say that we should not provide the opportunity for elective abortions to be funded by Federal resources, even in the HMO setting. 
In each such instance where Government is making a judgment, it needs to make a judgment that favors life, that respects the lives of children, that provides for the dignity of the lives of older Americans as well. Any time we unduly disregard and devalue life, we have carved something important out of the American personality. 
If we are to indelibly stamp the next century with American values, the values of opportunity and freedom, as we have in this century, if we are to be a leader in the world, as we have in this century--and there are hundreds of millions of people that are free today around the globe because we have been strong and we have been free and we have been dedicated to freedom--we need all of our resources, we need the moral fabric of America, and we cannot destroy it or unduly sear the conscience of Americans by requiring the payment for elective abortions out of Federal tax dollars. 
I say as well that we need our children. As we look to the next century, America will not survive without our children. Destroying children is contradictory to preparing for the future. 
I believe that the assault on the sanctity of life is a moral crisis and that any use of taxpayer funds to pay for such an assault and perpetuate the destruction of America's children would be disabling to the moral compasses of all Americans. 
When he wrote on slavery in America, Thomas Jefferson, the South's first and greatest President, confronted the great moral issue of his time. Jefferson said of slavery, `I tremble for my country when I reflect that God is just and that his justice cannot sleep forever.' Sometimes I tremble when I reflect on abortion's terrible toll on lives and the siphoning off of our moral indignation and our capacity to prepare for the next century. 
I am pleased the Senate today has taken a very clear step in saying there will be no Federal funding of elective abortions in the Medicaid HMO setting, just as we have for over 20 years provided that there would be no Federal funding for elective abortions in Medicaid fee-for-service programs. 
I thank the Chair, and I thank the managers of the bill.  
Mr. SPECTER addressed the Chair.

Mr. ASHCROFT. I thank the Senator from Pennsylvania for his accommodation in this respect. He is entirely correct; this extends the same protections and the same regime of Federal funding to the HMO setting that we have had in the fee-for-service setting, and it is appropriate that we extend the commitment of the Congress in this respect.

Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, it is an honor to serve the people of Missouri and this great country. One of the privileges I have as a Missouri Senator is to recognize those who have gone above and beyond the call of duty in service to the State of Missouri. For 25 years, Cheryl Huff, of Mexico, MO, has served faithfully the people of Missouri through the Division of Youth Services. 
Within the Missouri Department of Social Services, the Division of Youth Services is the State agency responsible for the care and treatment of youth, committed to its custody by one of Missouri's 45 juvenile courts. This State agency operates treatment programs ranging from nonresidential day treatment centers to secure residential institutions. 
The 1889 establishment of the Training School for Boys in Boonville and the Training School for Girls in Chillicothe marked the foundation of the division of youth services. It was at the Training School for Boys in Boonville, a quarter of a century ago, that Cheryl began her service. She is widely respected by peers for her sound judgement and personal integrity. During her tenure, Cheryl has distinguished herself among her colleagues as an efficient and effective caretaker of Missouri's most precious resource--its children. 
The recognition of Cheryl for her commitment to Missouri's children simply mirrors her dedication to her own family. While the accomplishments of a successful career are important to her, those who know Cheryl would be the first to point out that her career is secondary to her love of family. The lasting legacy of Cheryl's life is apparent in the time, energy, and resources she has invested in her children. She exemplifies the highest commitment to relentless dedication and sacrifice. 
Cheryl, the grateful State of Missouri offers you these simple words of appreciation: Thank you.

Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I send a resolution to the desk concerning recent fighting in the Republic of Congo. Senator Feingold is joining me as an original cosponsor of this resolution, and I greatly appreciate his support in this effort and his help as the Ranking Member on the Subcommittee on African Affairs of the Foreign Relations Committee. 
The Republic of Congo--not to be confused with the neighboring Democratic Republic of Congo, formerly known as Zaire--has been embroiled in domestic unrest since early June when hostilities erupted between the forces of the former military dictator Denis Sassou-Nguesso and troops loyal to the current Congolese leader, President Pascal Lissouba. 
President Lissouba defeated Sassou in national elections in 1992. Recent hostilities between the two leaders pose a threat to the nascent democracy that the Republic of Congo has tried to cultivate over the last 5 years. 
The Republic of Congo has made significant steps to embrace democracy since the late 1980's. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, the people of the Republic of Congo pressed for democratic change in their own country. Their struggle against political repression was rewarded with the convening of a national conference in 1991 and the adoption of a multiparty constitution in 1992. 
The first free national elections were held in 1992. Since that time the Congolese people have endured violent threats to their emerging democracy. Indeed, factional infighting between rival political groups has taken the lives of several thousand people since 1993. 
The most recent outbreak of fighting poses yet another challenge to the people of the Republic of Congo and the liberty they desire for their country. Thankfully, a ceasefire was signed by the warring parties over the weekend of July 12-13, and representatives of President Lissouba and Sassou-Nguesso have been in Libreville, Gabon attempting to negotiate a peace agreement. 
It is my sincere hope that negotiations are constructive and that the Republic of Congo is able to move forward and hold elections previously scheduled for July 27, but now delayed indefinitely. 
We should make it clear to all parties involved in the conflict in the Republic of Congo that the United States condemns violent attempts to overthrow the democratically-elected government of the Republic of Congo. There is too much at stake in Central Africa right now for the United States to remain silent about instability which threatens the peaceful transfer of power in a country struggling to embrace democracy. 
United States foreign policy in Central Africa has failed miserably in restraining the forces of violence which have plagued Rwanda and Burundi, the former Zaire, and now the Republic of Congo. The Clinton administration must address more forcefully the chain of events in Central Africa before the region spirals out of control. A good place to start would be to speak out forcefully in support of democracy in the Republic of Congo and against the violence which threatens the country's stability. 
Mr. President, it is time to take a public stand in support of the fragile democracy in the Republic of Congo, which is why I am submitting this resolution today. I hope at the appropriate time my colleagues will vote to condemn the violence now threatening the prospects for constitutional government and the rule of law in the Republic of Congo.

Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I would like to encourage my colleagues to join me in congratulating Sgt. Gary Hurt as he retires on August 31, 1997, from 28 years of service to the Missouri State Highway Patrol. I add my personal appreciation and best wishes to those of Gary's many friends and colleagues. 
There are few careers more noble than those spent in public service. Gary's 18 years in the Governor's Security Division of the Missouri State Highway Patrol have meant a great deal to the people he has served. I add a special word of thanks to Gary for his dedicated service to me during my two terms as Governor of Missouri. 
During my tenure as Governor, Gary and I traveled from one end of the State to the other, as well as around the country. Gary always represented the State of Missouri and the Missouri Highway Patrol with dignity, integrity, and professionalism. His commitment to detail put me at ease regardless of travel and event circumstances. I am grateful to Gary and I would like to publicly thank him for the outstanding service he graciously provided my family and me while I served as Governor of Missouri. 
I wish Gary and his wife, Carol, much happiness as they begin a new chapter in their lives. May God richly bless them both.

Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, families are the cornerstone of America. The data are undeniable: Individuals from strong families contribute to the society. In an era when nearly half of all couples married today will see their union dissolve into divorce, I believe it is both instructive and important to honor those who have taken the commitment of `till death us do part' seriously, demonstrating successfully the timeless principles of love, honor, and fidelity. These characteristics make our country strong. 
For these important reasons, I rise today to honor Catherine and Martin Suetterlin of St. Louis County, MO, who on September 27, 1997, will celebrate their 50th wedding anniversary. My wife, Janet, and I look forward to the day we can celebrate a similar milestone. The Suetterlins' commitment to the principles and values of their marriage deserves to be saluted and recognized.

Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, last week, my friend Tim Hutchinson, the Senator from Arkansas, took the floor to lend his voice to a growing chorus of disapproval over the state of United States-China relations. I commend him for his actions. While his efforts to pass a sense of the Senate resolution against most favored nation status for China were unsuccessful, his actions were the very essence of what it means to be a leader. He set out to achieve noble aspirations, and then dedicated his energies to achieve those objectives. Leadership is ascertaining noble objectives and working hard, intently and sacrificially. Such efforts push us toward our highest and best. The highest and best to which Senator Hutchinson called us is an end to which we must all aspire. 
Teddy Roosevelt said it this way: 
Far better is it to dare mighty things, to win glorious triumphs, even though checkered by failure, than to take rank with those poor spirits who neither enjoy much nor suffer much because they live in the gray twilight that knows neither victory nor defeat. 
Twenty-two Members of the Senate had the courage to say that the tainted flow of Western currency into China must end, not because the exchange of goods between sovereign nations is injurious, but because we have in China today a ruthless regime that does not deserve unfettered access to United States markets, a regime whose brutal repression at home betrays its intentions abroad. 
America is a place that has cared always for what Thomas Paine called the `rights of man.' The United States has always been a country that gave no quarter to tyranny or tyrants. Teddy Roosevelt put it a bit differently, cautioning that America must not become `an assemblage of well-to-do hucksters who care nothing for what happens beyond.' 
But, Mr. President, does not the vote on the Hutchinson amendment suggest that Teddy Roosevelt's worst fears are being realized? For the message being sent from China today is as unmistakable as it is disturbing. Beijing believes that life is cheap and cheaper still when that life opposes the authoritarian rule of the Communist Party. 
The State Department, in its most recent human rights report, states that `all public dissent against the party and government was effectively silenced' in China. `No dissidents were known to be active at year's end.' Beijing has used imprisonment, exile, and summary execution to quiet the voices of those who cry for freedom. 
China's 1982 Constitution guarantees the freedom of speech, the press, and religious belief. And yet, the hollowness of that document becomes more apparent with every passing day. Chinese authorities routinely resort to torture, the denial of due process, forced confessions, prison labor, and extrajudicial killings to crush Chinese citizens who stand up for liberty and defy Beijing. 
As Nina Shea notes in `The Lion's Den,' China has more Christians in prison because of religious activities than any other nation. This morning's New York Times detailed a State Department report due to be issued today--and I have a copy of it here--which is sharply critical of Beijing's efforts to suppress religious worship. The report, which is entitled, `U.S. Policy in Support of Religious Freedom,' says, `The Government of China has sought to restrict all actual religious practice to government-subsidized religious organizations and registered places of worship.' 
The report goes on to detail the story of four underground Roman Catholic bishops who have been imprisoned or detained. They are not alone. Many other Catholic priests, the Times notes, `have been searched by government agents and their religious articles have been seized.' 
Consider the case of Bishop Su. Hung from the ceiling by his wrists, Su was battered time and again about the head until all but unconscious. He was then placed in a cell filled with water where he was left for days unable to sit or to sleep. His high crime? His treason? A fidelity to God and a desire to exercise that devotion. 
It is true that the official Catholic Church in China is registered with the Government and claims as many as 4 million members. However, the official church does not recognize the authority of the Pope, so all Vatican-affiliated Catholics are viewed by Beijing as unregistered. Moreover, as the State Department report suggests, `Communist Party officials state that party membership and religious belief are incompatible,' placing a serious limitation on believers. 
And who, Mr. President, will denounce the mounting persecutions of Christians in China? The administration has not made a sound. Well, I would respectfully remind them that to sin 
by silence when one should protest makes cowards out of all men. 
America must not trade civil liberty for the false idol of foreign commerce. We must be willing not just to sound historic, but we must pursue policies which are historically sound. We must be willing to condemn religious persecution both in China and around the world. 
The disturbing trends revealed in the State Department report due today are not without precedent. In June 1996, the Far Eastern Economic Review reported that `Chinese police had destroyed at least 15,000 unregistered temples, churches and tombs' in the Zheijang province alone in just 5 months. Those church leaders who dared to resist were tortured, beaten, and killed. 
Is it any wonder then that the future of Hong Kong has been the subject of great concern. At the beginning of this month, all eyes were turned toward the British colony as it reverted to Chinese control. I sincerely hope that our eyes will remain focused there, for constant vigilance is the key to exposing and resisting Chinese encroachment on freedom in the former colony. 
Although China wants Hong Kong to remain a vibrant financial center and serve as an example for unification with Taiwan, Beijing has not hesitated to undermine Hong Kong's political autonomy in spite of its pledge in the 1984 joint declaration to honor one country, two systems. 
China has declared the elected Hong Kong Legislature invalid and has appointed a hand-picked provisional legislative body. China's appointed chief executive of Hong Kong, Tung Chee-hwa, promises that new elections will be held in 1998 but has drawn the electoral districts to limit the influence of Martin Lee's Democratic Party. 
Mr. Tung has recently unveiled new measures to restrict civil liberties in Hong Kong. Public protests will have to receive prior approval and could be banned to protect so-called `national security.' Political organizations will be required to register with the government and prohibited from seeking or receiving funds from overseas sources. Under Tung's definition, international organizations that expose China's human rights abuses will also be banned from receiving foreign funds. 
Unfortunately, the administration's Hong Kong policy has been about self-preservation rather than promoting self-government. Political activist Martin Lee got a hero's welcome on Capitol Hill, but the administration met only reluctantly with Lee. Vice President Gore conveniently forgot Hong Kong on his recent trip to China, and much to the dismay of Martin Lee and other Hong Kong Democrats, Consul General Richard Boucher attended the inaugural ceremony of China's hand-picked legislature--the legislature which replaced the freely elected body that Martin Lee had worked so hard to preserve. 
Mr. President, the preservation of liberty for the 6.3 million people in Hong Kong is about more than the immediate fate of its residents. The battle for civil liberty in Hong Kong could very well be the battle for civil liberty in China. As George Will has written, China has just swallowed `a radioactive isotope' of Western culture in taking over Hong Kong. Hong Kong serves as a shining example of democracy and free market economics, and the effective removal of that model would set back the march of freedom in China. 
In a world that is increasingly open and free, there still exist totalitarian governments which cling to political repression and deny their people the inalienable rights of life, liberty, and property. Beijing claims that the Chinese people are more concerned about social cohesion and domestic order than the growth of civil liberty--that Western democracy is a Western phenomenon and not necessarily applicable to China, that it is somehow foreign to Far Eastern culture. 
But what does Beijing think about the growth of democracy in Taiwan, Japan, and South Korea? How do China's leaders explain away the deaths of perhaps thousands of students who were willing to risk everything for liberty in Tiananmen Square? How does 
Beijing respond to heroes like Wei Jingsheng and Harry Wu who continue to fight against oppression in spite of intimidation, imprisonment, and torture? Troublingly, Beijing cannot answer these questions. Tragically, these are questions that the West is often afraid to ask. 
Mr. President, I look forward to a U.S. foreign policy that calls the community of nations to their highest and best. America for her part must be willing to stand for freedom as she has since her first days. When the Chinese people eventually rid themselves of Beijing's tyrannical leadership and embrace democracy, just as South Korea, Japan, and Taiwan have done before them, let it be said that America stood with them, stood with them and for them in their cause for freedom. 
Despite the troubling revelations of the State Department report and the defeat of the Hutchinson amendment last week, I believe that we must continue to press on. Teddy Roosevelt was right; it is hard to fail but it is worse never to have tried to succeed. The right of man to strive, to seek, to find and not to yield is at the core of what individual liberty and dignity means, and it is at the core of the values we regard highly in America. It is a message of hope and calls this country to its highest and best. It is a message that America must proclaim if the coming century is to be defined by the growth of liberty and not surrendered to those who would stifle freedom. 
China has been abusive to its own citizens and signals an ominous cloud over the Far East, a cloud whose poison could spread well beyond its own borders and taint the opportunity for freedom around the world. China's total disregard for religious liberty, China's contempt for the liberty of individuals in the political system, and China's willingness to require the registration of religious groups whose members would worship God freely without subservience to the government, signals to us the need for America to stand up clearly--not as an enemy to the Chinese but as a friend of those people who seek liberty from tyrants. 
I believe the Chinese people seek liberty and will respond constructively to freedom just as people around the world have wherever the grace of freedom has been made available to them. The United States can no longer suggest that we might cease to be the city on a hill whose light is a beacon for freedom. We have a responsibility to maintain the commitment to freedom that those who began this Nation had, and I submit that it is time for us to signal our commitment to freedom clearly and unmistakably to those who would enter the community of nations. China seeks and wants to enter that community, and the United States must speak clearly to China about the rights of man we have always defended. I think it is time for the United States to have its voice heard and to be a contributor to the cause of liberty and freedom around the globe. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I thank you very much, and I thank the Senator from Arkansas, not only for his courtesy in this matter, but for his leadership in this matter. 
It is apparent, the House of Representatives having voted in favor of most-favored-nation status for China, that anything we do by expressing ourselves in the Senate won't have a real impact in terms of denying that standing to China. But it is essential that we register the displeasure and dissatisfaction of this body with the conduct of China in three basic categories that I believe are an appropriate standard by which we would measure our relationship with a variety of nations. 
The first of those categories is gross trade inequities that China and the United States have. Some have said that most-favored-nation status is just general trading status. As it applies to China, it is most-favored status. We have a wide variety of other countries whose trading relationships with the United States are nearly on a parallel basis of balance. Not so with China. 
Second is that the military buildup in China threatens peace and stability, not only in the Pacific rim but around the world. 
And the third is that human rights abuses in China should be something we mention very clearly and we should express with deep conviction.

Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, no one did more to bring peace and prosperity in our time than our 40th President, Ronald Reagan. President Reagan's economic and foreign policies gave us the longest peacetime expansion in our history and, indeed, did fulfill an ambition of this country to make the world safe again for democracy. But more than that, Ronald Reagan called us to our highest and best; we never spoke with more certainty or sat taller in the saddle than when Ronald Reagan was riding point. 
In his second inaugural address, Reagan spoke of the danger of simple-minded appeasement, of accommodating countries at their lowest and least. `History,' said President Reagan, `teaches us that wars begin when governments believe the price of aggression is cheap.' Having seen the death and destruction of five wars in his lifetime, President Reagan's was a lesson learned at some expense. It was a lesson which he refused to repeat. And from his experience was borne the policy of peace through strength--a strategy that recognized that wishful thinking about our adversaries is a betrayal of our past and a squandering of our freedom. 
But today, the administration seems to have forgotten this costly lesson. It seems driven not by foreign policy so much as by foreign politics, willing to pursue that which sounds historic rather than adopting policies that are historically sound. 
Nowhere is this administration's failed thinking more apparent than in United States policy toward China. As I noted on the floor 2 weeks ago, Beijing has embarked on a military buildup that may soon threaten security interests in Asia, including our own. China already has the world's largest military at 2.9 million and is taking steps to enhance its force projection capabilities, including the acquisition of a blue water navy and a 21st century air force. 
China is not an enemy of the United States. I sincerely hope that Washington and Beijing can develop a forthright and an enduring relationship. For such a relationship to develop, however, security issues must be addressed and fundamental questions about those issues must be answered. 
What does it mean when China engages in a dramatic military buildup aimed at achieving superpower status? What does it mean when China proliferates technology for weapons of mass destruction and signs a $4.5 billion arms deal with the terrorist State of Iran? What does it mean when China fires missiles in the Taiwan Strait and seizes small islands in the South China Sea? For this belligerence suggests a China bent on regional domination. 
While China's official military budget is roughly $8 billion, Beijing effectively conceals military spending through off-budget funding and revenue. Reliable estimates place China's military spending from 4 to 10 times the official budget. Russia alone, has made over $7 billion in arm sales to China since 1990, and hundreds, perhaps thousands, of underemployed Russian nuclear engineers have been hired by China in the last several years. 
Mr. President, the People's Liberation Army of China, has 20,000 companies, business enterprises, that funnel revenue into the military's coffers. These PLA companies are not the kind of competitors we want to welcome to the American market. Companies with ties to the PLA benefit from their special relationship with Beijing and have been involved in criminal activities ranging from smuggling assault weapons onto the streets of San Francisco to stealing defense-related technology. 
So what, then, has this explosion in military spending wrought? First, a missile program that will soon give China the capacity to build hundreds of highly accurate ballistic missiles. Second, short- to medium-range ballistic missiles that will provide Beijing with versatile nonnuclear weapons to target U.S. military personnel in a variety of contingencies if they so desire. 
And, as if this were not enough, China is modernizing its long-range nuclear intercontinental ballistic missiles with mobile ICBM systems and advance reentry technology. Due to the potential of secret underground construction which is said to be available in China, China could have as many as 130 of such missiles with a range of 8,000 miles. China's missile modernization program is accompanied by the buildup of China's Air Force. 
By 2010, China could have over 100 SU-27 and SU-30 aircraft. The SU-27 is comparable to, and may be more advanced in some areas than, the U.S. F-15C Eagle. Russia has been the primary provider of these aircraft and has signed a $2.2 billion coproduction agreement with China to help Beijing develop the domestic capacity to produce these planes. 
China's ultimate goal is to acquire an all-weather Air Force within 5 years. Attack aircraft, precision-guided munitions, airborne early warning and control systems [AWACS], and large transport aircraft are all items on Beijing's wish list. With the help of Russian arms suppliers, China is putting the pieces of this lethal puzzle in place. 
Beijing is also working to develop a blue water navy. Their ambitions are perhaps summed up best by the words of Admiral Liu Huaqing. `The Chinese Navy,' said Admiral Liu, `should exert effective control of the seas within the first island chain. Offshore should not be interpreted as coastal as we used to know it. Offshore is a concept relative to the high seas. It means the vast sea waters within the second island chain.' 
Mr. President, it just so happens that the first island chain China seeks to control encompasses Japan, Taiwan, the Philippines, and some of the most critical shipping lanes in the world. The South China Sea alone accommodates 25 percent of the world's maritime trade and 75 percent of Japan's oil shipments. 
To achieve Admiral Liu's objective, Beijing has purchased Kilo-class submarines and Sovremenny-class missile destroyers from Russia. In addition, the United States Office of Naval Intelligence [ONI] cites a National People's Congress report that China is seeking to build two 48,000-ton aircraft carriers, each with 40 combat aircraft, by the year 2005. 
China's arms buildup would be less disturbing if Beijing were acting to resist aggression by an enemy power. But China faces no grave security threats, leaving us with troubling conclusions about Beijing's real intent. China has historically demonstrated a willingness to settle territorial disputes with force, and greater capacity can only increase the likelihood of belligerence in the future. 
Since WWII, a catalog of China's regional conflicts covers almost her entire periphery. China has invaded Tibet and Vietnam, entered the Korean war, ousted Vietnamese forces from several islands in the South China Sea, fought India twice and Russia once over boundary disputes, and--not to forget the most consistent aspect of China's military adventurism--threatened Taiwan with military exercises and outright invasion of Taiwanese islands close to China's shore. 
China currently has territorial disputes with India, Russia, Japan, Vietnam, and has vied with the Philippines, Vietnam, Taiwan, Brunei, and Malaysia for control of the resource-rich and strategically important South China Sea. To defend its claim, Beijing has already constructed five naval installations in the Paracel Islands and seven installations in the Spratly Island group. 
And what has been the Clinton administration's response to the rising Chinese military threat? Appeasement at every turn. China proliferates missile, nuclear, and chemical weapons technology to rogue regimes like Iran; in fact, China is identified by the CIA as the world's worst proliferator of weapons of mass destruction. And yet, the administration refuses to impose consistently sanctions authorized by U.S. law. 
The China Ocean Shipping Co., better known as COSCO, is implicated in weapons smuggling to the United States and missile transfers to Pakistan, and the President personally assists the city of Long Beach, CA, in leasing the local United States naval harbor to COSCO. 
The China National Nuclear Corp. orchestrates most of the nuclear technology transfers to Pakistan and Iran, and the administration responds by approving Export-Import Bank loans to help this Chinese company complete a nuclear reactor in China. 
These examples reveal an underlying laxity also clearly seen in President Clinton's dismantling of export controls for sensitive technology. President Reagan's formation of the Combat Command [COCOM] helped enforce an international embargo of sensitive technology exports to the Soviet Union and effectively expanded America's technological lead. Unfortunately, having confused short-term profits with long-term security, this administration has undermined our export control framework. 
For example, advanced U.S. aircraft engines have historically been a protected item on the munitions list of goods and services. Sales of Munitions List items are illegal to any country without formal approval from the State Department. In addition, sales of Munitions List items to China were prohibited after the Tiananmen Square crackdown and could only be permitted with a Presidential waiver. 
Instead of openly issuing a waiver for the sale of aircraft engines to China, the Clinton administration quietly took airplane engines off the Munitions List and shifted their control from the Department of State to the Department of Commerce. Licenses for the sale of aircraft engines were quickly issued by then-Secretary Brown, and they continue to this day. 
In addition to aircraft technology, export controls for supercomputers have also been relaxed. As Senator Cochran has argued so compellingly on the floor this week, supercomputers are not extra large versions of a Macintosh or an IBM, but advanced machines that can simulate warfare contingencies and model sophisticated weapons. 
The Bush administration defined supercomputers as machines that could perform 195 MTOPS--million theoretical operations per second. The Clinton administration relaxed export controls by changing this definition to 2,000 MTOPS, a tenfold increase in the capability of noncontrolled supercomputers within 2 years. Shortly thereafter, the Clinton administration raised the threshold to 7,000 MTOPS for export of supercomputers for civilian use. 
In the euphoria of the post-cold war world, the Clinton administration seems to have forgotten that civilian and military distinctions have little use in a Communist State like China where Government control of industry ensures that civilian technology is applied to military ends and where thousands of so-called businesses are literally owned by the military. 
Again, as Senator Cochran has noted, United States companies have used these relaxed regulations to sell 47 supercomputers to China. Dozens more have been indirectly shipped to China via Europe, the Persian Gulf, and East Asia. The Clinton administration cannot account for where many of these computers are located or how 
they are being used. 
As Stephen Bryan, former Deputy Undersecretary of Defense, writes:  
Thanks to * * * the Clinton administration, the Chinese can now conduct tests of nuclear weapons, conventional explosives, and chemical and biological weapons by simulating them on supercomputers. Not only can they now make better weapons of mass destruction, but they can do a lot of the work secretly, thus threatening us with an additional element of surprise. 
For too long we have heard the argument that if the United States does not sell technology to Beijing, China will simply acquire the products from other sources. This contention is as familiar as it is flawed. United States military and dual-use technology is often a generation ahead of its Russian and European counterparts. How can the United States call on other nations to stop transferring dangerous technology when America is giving China some of the most advanced technology in the world? 
A final thought. This week the Government Affairs Committee began investigating an ominous and startling facet of our national security--the security of this Nation's democratic elections. Every American has an interest in investigating the alleged plot of the Beijing government to influence the election of our President and Members of this Congress. Trying to corrupt American elections is shocking, outrageous, and wrong. And, if true, it must be dealt with in a forthright and forceful fashion. 
In the end, it all comes down to leadership. That is what Ronald Reagan gave us throughout the 1980's, and that is what this country is looking for now. Leaders are willing to call this Nation--and nations around the world--to their highest and best, not accommodate them at their lowest and least. 
Continued appeasement can only lead to further belligerence from Beijing. We must not let China slam shut the gate of freedom. We must show the quiet courage and common sense that have marked our foreign policy since America's first days. 
It is time for America to place restrictions on high-technology exports to Beijing by supporting the Cochran-Durbin amendment; time to impose consistently sanctions on China for proliferating weapons of mass destruction; time to restrict United States market access to PLA-front companies; and time to let Beijing know that American security interests in East Asia will not be compromised. So, that 1 day, the long tug of memory might look favorably upon us as we look approvingly on those who fought for freedom in decades passed. 
Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, families are the cornerstone of America. The data are undeniable: Individuals from strong families contribute to the society. In an era when nearly half of all couples married today will see their union dissolve into divorce, I believe it is both instructive and important to honor those who have taken the commitment of `till death us do part' seriously, demonstrating successfully the timeless principles of love, honor, and fidelity. These characteristics make our country strong. 
For these important reasons, I rise today to honor Clarence and Rena Gibson of Independence, Missouri, who on August 7, 1997, will celebrate their 60th wedding anniversary. My wife, Janet, and I look forward to the day we can celebrate a similar milestone. The Gibsons' commitment to the principles and values of their marriage deserves to be saluted and recognized.

Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I would like to add my comments on this important issue. For over 2 years, I have participated in Commerce Committee hearings to learn more about on encryption and the technology issues that it encompasses. Last week, I voted for Senator Burns' substitute and was disappointed when it was not approved by the committee. 
I am concerned about the tone of the discussion at last week's markup. It appeared to me that many on the committee are seeking ways to outlaw the Internet. We are all troubled by any type of child pornography or gambling on the Internet. These are not areas where any member of Congress, any software or hardware vendor, or any member of the general public I know, argues for anything less than the strictest legal provisions. These matters are distasteful and wrong, but even if we eliminated the Internet, we would not eliminate these offensive concerns. 
As I said during the markup, we all know that cameras are used in child pornography, but we don't talk of outlawing photography. And, we also know that rental vehicles are often used in terrorist activities, but we don't make it illegal to rent a car or truck. 
Mr. President, it appears to me that at the most fundamental level, this debate is about the relationship of our citizens to our Government. We all must take steps to insure that the rights of our citizens are not violated. Our citizens should be able to communicate privately, without the Government listening in--that is one of our most basic rights. 
We have to be careful to ensure our law enforcement can have just the necessary amount of access and then only in a manner consistent with our Constitution. 
I am persuaded that a number of the new provisions in the McCain-Kerrey bill are not necessary. 
I believe that many of the provisions will not even succeed at achieving the end they seek. For example, a false choice has been offered indicating that if the U.S. continues to enforce the export policy on encryption that is currently in place, 40 bit and with special permission up to 56-bit, then law enforcement could apprehend terrorists, stop illegal gamblers and arrest pornographers. However, this argument assumes that these criminals cannot find stronger encryption elsewhere than in the United States. As has been shown several times, this assumption is false. Robust encryption is available. Germany, Japan, and the United Kingdom all have companies, such as Siemens, Nippon and Brokat, that have developed and promote 128 bit encryption. Last week even the supporters of the administration's approach, as expressed in the current legislation, admitted that criminals who want the robust encryption can find access and use strong encryption in their current dealings. This issue is a red herring. 
Moreover, the administration announced Wednesday that they will allow the export of 128-bit encryption for bank transaction use involving bank software in an apparent admission of the vulnerability of the 56-bit strength. Also, the administration has continued to tell us during the hearings on encryption and in private meetings with the FBI and NSA, that 128-bit use outside the United States would 
end in terrible consequences, and now 128-bit use outside the U.S. is being advocated. We should remember that the Burns compromise only wanted to export 128-bit with key recovery for trusted parties. The administration now advocates 128-bit length encryption without any key recovery device, a position that goes beyond the Burn's compromise, which they opposed. My point, Mr. President is that this debate must change. We cannot continue to focus on the key length since these standards become obsolete on a daily basis. We need to focus on allowing trustworthy parties to use robust encryption, not necessarily to sell as encryption but to use in their transactions and in the development of software and hardware. 
No nationwide key recovery system, or a new licensing requirement for certificate authorities should be brought to the floor without thorough examination, analysis and understanding. We must further study the impact of these provisions well before this bill is brought to the Senate floor.

Mr. ASHCROFT. Madam President, freedom is, and always has been, the great moving force of American history. It was freedom that inspired patriots to give their lives at Concord and Lexington. Freedom that compelled American Rangers to scale the cliffs at Normandy. And freedom that filled Ronald Reagan's heart in Berlin as he exhorted Mr. Gorbachev to `tear down this wall.' 
Freedom. The essential ingredient of what Reagan called `the American purpose.' At our highest and best, we Americans are believers in the `blessings of liberty,' the idea that `all men are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights.' And these rights are not America's alone, but extend to all those who would seek to know freedom's warm embrace. 
So today, from Stettin in the Baltic to Trieste on the Adriatic, the Iron Curtain has lifted, and a wave of democracy has descended on the globe. The `simple, vivid, peaceable world' of which John Cheever wrote is more a reality today than at any time in our history. 
But evil knows no resting place. The cold war is over. And still how many have yet to taste the fruit of freedom? For there is a regime in the world today that runs against the tide of history; that denies liberty and human dignity to its people; a regime whose brutal repression at home betrays its intentions abroad; a regime that aspires to superpower status. 
I am speaking of Communist China. And I rise today to say, `No more.' No more should we watch as China uses its illegitimate gains to purchase military hardware and weapons of mass destruction. No more should we ignore Beijing's mercantilist trade policies that block U.S. products and destroy American jobs. No more should we accept a playing field for our products that is not level. No more, Mr. President. No more unconditional most-favored-nation status for Communist China. 
My decision to oppose most-favored-nation status was not an easy one. It was reached after countless meetings with foreign policy experts, economists, and the CEO's of major corporations. To the businessmen whose passion for the status quo was surprising, I posed many questions. 
Has China embraced the rule of law, put their regulations and laws in writing, stopped subjecting them to differential application? No. Are her people more free? Well, not really. Is America more secure with China selling weaponry to rogue nations and extending its own influence far beyond appropriate levels into the South China Sea? Tragically, those I questioned could only plead for more time. But time alone cannot heal these wounds. We must say: No more. 
The truth is, America has dedicated over two decades to the policies of engagement, and the results have been far from compelling or convincing. Less than 2 percent of United States exports went to China last year. America sold more goods and services individually to Belgium, 
Brazil, and Singapore than to the People's Republic of China. Meanwhile, the United States took more than 30 percent of China's exports creating a $39.5 billion merchandise trade deficit. This represents a threefold increase since 1990. A 200-percent increase in just 6 years! 
On Friday, more bad news. The Commerce Department reported that our trade gap is widening--fully 41 percent higher in the first 4 months of this year than in 1996. This led the Wall Street Journal to speculate that China will soon have the largest deficit of any United States trading partner, surpassing even Japan. 
If our growing trade deficit has been the source of great attention, the causal factors behind the inequity have gone all but ignored. At their core, they are twofold. The first element is the anti-American, predatory trade practices of the Chinese Government. The second is a United States-China policy that has been an abject failure, a case study in what not to do. A United States policy that has, in truth and reality, made Communist China America's most favored nation. 
American access to the other Asian market is growing every day. The Mongolian Government has aggressively sought United States investment, and soon will allow foreign `stakes in infrastructure' and the purchase of `shares in privatized companies.' In Taiwan, AT&T and GTE have won stakes in cellular telephone licenses that will allow both to provide telecommunications services to the Taiwanese. 
China is the exception, erecting barriers to entry surpassed only by the Great Wall itself. This begs the question: if United States products are good enough for Mongolia, Taiwan, and the other Asian democracies, developing and developed, why are they not good enough for Communist China? And when will we have the courage to say, `No more'? 
Consider China's treatment of information technologies. The United States tariff on cellular phones from China is 1.6 percent. China's tariff? Seven times as high. Chinese telephone answering machines: 1.6 percent. The tariff on United States firms? A whopping 50 percent, over 25 times as high. Chinese-made computers: 2.7 percent. The import tax on Silicon Valley? Almost six times as high. And the list goes on and on and on. 
In March, 39 countries, including Taiwan, Singapore, Malaysia, and South Korea, signed the Information Technology Agreement which will phase out all tariffs on such products as semiconductors, computer hardware, and electronic components by century end. China's concession was nowhere to be found. And yet, we rewarded China's belligerence by providing the same access to our market as we do to those Asian countries that have agreed to welcome our goods. 
Now the administration and the ivory tower academicians like to whine about how misleading the `most-favored-nation' designation is. `If we could only change the name,' they wail, `our China troubles would be over.' But if ever there were a country that deserved the label `most favored nation,' it is Communist China. It is time for America to say, `No more.' 
Unfortunately, rather than sound a clarion trumpet for American goods, the administration has hoisted the flag of defeat. Today, the United States allows China to slap punitively high tariffs on our goods while other countries are trying to treat us equitably. Australia, for instance, has tariffs on United States goods that are roughly equal to America's 4-percent rate. And 
yet, Australia's access to the United States market is no better than China's. 
In fact, the People's Republic of China is deriving more benefits from United States trade than even our closest trading partners. Mexico places tariff rates on American goods that are only 2 percent higher than comparable United States rates. China's tariffs, however, are 19 percent higher. But again, Mexico and China enjoy virtually identical access to the United States market. We are literally inviting China to be involved in our market while China is slamming the door in the face of American business. China is truly `America's most-favored-nation.' 
This stems at least in part from the willingness of the United States to trade with China under a bilateral agreement that was signed in 1979--a time when Jimmy Carter still called the White House home. The agreement predates the commercial availability of information technologies such as cellular phones and portable computers. 
Madam President, this bilateral agreement is the first of a two-tier test that all nonmarket economies must meet if they are to be extended most-favored-nation status. The second deals with the emigration provisions of the Jackson-Vanik amendment. There are currently 15 nonmarket economies, including China, that have technically complied with this two-tier test in order to get MFN status. 
All of the other 14 designees, however, have bilateral agreements that were developed in the 1990's. In fact, every United States trading partner save China has trade agreements that were negotiated in the last 7 years. 
Only China operates with a favorable status of not having to comply with a modern bilateral agreement. Only China enjoys this most favored among most-favored-nations position. It is this decades-old agreement that is failing to safeguard our capacity to deal on a level playing field with the Chinese. It is this agreement that is failing to allow for free and unfettered trade. 
Last Wednesday, Madam President, I asked Undersecretary of State for Economic, Business, and Agricultural Affairs, Stuart Eizenstat, to tell me why the administration has failed to hold the Chinese to the same standards as other most-favored-nation designees by requiring a modern bilateral trade agreement. `This is,' Eizenstat said, `one of the things we are now negotiating.' 
Madam President, `now negotiating?' A bilateral trade agreement is a precursor to the extension of MFN. 
It was one of the basis upon which MFN is extended. It is a core requirement. Why is Congress being asked to renew most-favored-nation status before a modern bilateral trade agreement is in place? Why in the world is Congress being pushed to embrace an agreement that disadvantages U.S. products and ensures a trade imbalance into the foreseeable future? China's preferential status coupled with her discriminatory conduct has improperly made the PRC a nation favored above all others, the most-favored among most-favored nations. 
Perhaps China's past and current transgressions could be overlooked if Beijing's ambitions were more humane. Instead, the hard currency created by China's trade surplus is being used to pursue a massive military modernization program, nothing less than a blue-water navy, long-range aircraft, and precision-guided munitions and missiles. The Russians alone have sold billions of dollars of military technology to the Chinese. And, as Prof. Arthur Waldron notes, this includes `cruise missiles capable of defeating the anti-missile defenses of the U.S. Navy.' 
These force-projection technologies are not about `providing for the common defense.' They are about providing an uncommon capacity to project power--power all across Asia. They will threaten not just the Asian democracies, but also the sailors of the 7th Fleet who call the waters of the South China Sea home. 
I intend to address the emerging threat posed by Beijing's military build-up in the days and weeks ahead. I also plan to speak about an administration 
policy that fails to defend what Thomas Paine called the rights of man, all but ignoring Beijing's cruel campaign of persecution and repression aimed at crushing internal dissent. 
We will never tame the Chinese dragon--no more than we subdued the Soviet bear--with the policies of appeasement. The way to bring China into the community of nations is to talk truthfully and forcefully about the evils found there; challenge China to open her doors to the commerce of the Western world; and maintain an American military superiority that makes peace not only possible but probable. 
And to those who say this debate cannot be won, that the forces amassed against us are too great, I take issue. `Any spot is tenable,' said John Kennedy, `if men--brave men--will make it so.' It is time to turn retreat to advance; to fight for a new China policy steeped in the principles of our old American Republic. Because truly free trade can only exist between free peoples. And the Chinese who watched treachery take hold in Tiananmen Square are most certainly not free. It is time for America to say, `No more.' 
In 1946, Winston Churchill came to America to warn of the Soviet subjugation of Eastern Europe. At the request of President Truman, he chose small Westminster College in Fulton, MO as the site where Britain would pass the baton of Western leadership to `the American democracy.' 
In this most Churchillian of Churchill speeches--made famous by its `iron curtain' coinage--he called America to her highest and best in defense of freedom and the rights of man. And if I might beg the Chair's indulgence, I would like to read a portion of the words he offered that warm and windy Tuesday a half century ago in Fulton, MO, my home State. 
Winston Churchill challenged the United States: 
`The United States,' said Churchill, `stands at this time at the pinnacle of world power. It is a solemn moment for the American democracy. For with this primacy in power is joined an awe-inspiring accountability to the future. As you look around you, you must feel not only the sense of duty done, but also you must feel anxiety lest you fall below the level of achievement. Opportunity is here now, clear and shining * * * To reject it or ignore it or fritter it away will bring us all the long reproaches of the aftertime.' 
Madam President, Churchill's words are America's words. For ours is a passionate belief in human possibility, an abiding devotion to freedom. `Opportunity is here now, clear and shining.' Let us not trade liberty for the false idol of foreign commerce. Let us not allow freedom's song to die on our lips. `For all sad words of tongue and pen, the saddest are these: `It might have been.' 
I yield the floor.

Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I would like to point out a remarkable program that exists in America today--a program that infuses our young people with a sense of purpose, values, principles, and the capacity to get things done. 
This program, called the Leadership Training Institute for Youth, is doing its good work at Southwest Baptist University in Bolivar, MO, this week. 
Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to this organization and its dedicated staffers and participants. It is Missouri's distinct honor to host such an excellent opportunity for our young people. 
The Leadership Training Institute for Youth is a model initiative that, with the help of Scripture and sound guidance, teaches young people the tenets of good leadership and good citizenship. 
Of course, the core training for tomorrow's leaders begins at home, and this organization and its committed staffers build on the lessons that parents teach. 
The Leadership Training Institute for Youth provides young people across the country with opportunity, inspiration, and advantage in our culture. It calls future leaders to their highest and best in the name of a higher power. It offers direction in what is too often a rudderless world. 
The institute demonstrates through lessons and example the value of priorities such as love for God, family, and country. It motivates youth to esteem virtues of honor, morality, compassion, faithfulness, integrity, discipline, and respect for the sanctity of life. 
Therefore, I rise today to express my sincere appreciation to the Leadership Training Institute for Youth. Without such entities, our children might be left to the mercies of today's malls, movies, and televisions. 
Our national heritage and our country's future are too important to be left to today's suspect environments that typically attract our young people. 
The Leadership Training Institute for Youth is a commitment to our young people--a commitment to the future leaders of this great Nation. We need more programs like it.

Mr. ASHCROFT. Thank you, Mr. President, and I thank the Senator from Alabama. 
I, too, am eager to express my appreciation for the reminder and the sobering thoughts expressed by the Senator from Kentucky. Each of us has a sense of loss whenever any of us suffers in our families the kind of challenge that comes when a father is deceased. 
I remember very well my father coming to this Chamber to witness my swearing in as a Senator some 2 1/2 years ago. My father was on his `last legs,' and he died before he made it home. But he had the sense of knowing that I had come here to do and to support things in which both he and I believed. I think that meant a lot to my father. 
I know that at this time, the minority leader, Senator Daschle, is very proud of his father and grateful for his father. I think he can have some sense of assurance that his father was grateful for him and appreciated a son who would devote himself in the national interest to doing what was, in his judgment, best for his country. 
It is in that sense that each of us has the profound privilege of shaping public policy. Perhaps that is as great a privilege as any of us enjoys from the Creator, that He allows us literally to participate in creating the world in which we will live. We are all destined to live in some tomorrows, and our children are destined to live in some tomorrows, and we have a chance to shape those tomorrows. I believe that is what the process of developing plans involves; it is the process of developing legislation to try to build a framework in which our community respects the ability of individuals to reach the potential that God has placed within each of us. 
So it is with that in mind that I think we are compelled to address a significant problem, which is a challenge to America and a threat to our future: The growing problem of violent juvenile crime. 
It is not that we say that although there is a problem, there is nothing we can do about it. We believe that we can remediate this situation. We believe that we can address this challenge, and we believe that we can be successful. We believe, however, that to do so we are going to have to change some things, because the things that we have been doing in the past were designed to address a different category of circumstances, a different character of culture. What we have done in the past is not working today. 
As a matter of fact, what we do will be instructive to the next generation. The way in which we view violent juvenile crime signals to the next generation how we respect life, what we intend in terms of order and responsibility. If we take crime lightly, they will take order lightly, because an infraction of order by way of criminal activity is something we don't care much about. If we take crime seriously and we impose serious consequences and we demand responsibility, the next generation will say order is something to be valued, because when it is interrupted, that order 
is restored as a matter of serious concern. 
The truth of the matter is, perhaps more important than anything we do in any singular sense is the way in which we transmit values from one generation to the next. More important than any other responsibility of a culture is the transmission of values from one generation to the next. I think that as we have assembled our policy relating to juvenile crime, we have been transmitting the wrong values, we have been saying the wrong things, we have been doing the wrong things, unfortunately, because we tended to say juvenile crime is the equivalent of acts of mischief, that it is to be disregarded like shooting paper wads or spitballs in the hall. 
You remember the Charlie Brown rock-and-roll song of the fifties, always doing those kinds of mischief things. We are not talking about mischief in juvenile crime; we are talking about assault and murder, armed robbery and rape. These are the parts of the criminal composite that are escalating; they are not declining. 
At the same time that we have been effective in helping to curb a growth rate in violent adult crime, we are equally alarmed by the evidence that we are not succeeding in reducing juvenile crime. One of the reasons is that our approach to juveniles hasn't been an approach to them as criminals. It has been an approach based on some less-than-accurate understanding of what has really happened. We have thought of it as delinquency; we have thought of it as something less than crime. 
If your wife is raped or if you are assaulted or if your child is murdered, you get a sense that this is not delinquency, it is not mischief. It is crime. I think as we try to send the right signal, as we try to make a commitment for the right kind of posture for our culture in the next generation, we need to say that violent crime committed by juveniles will be taken seriously. 
That is one of the very important things that Senator Sessions has been able to make sure persists as a unifying thread of character through this S. 10 legislation--that violent crime is serious crime and it is not to be taken lightly because someone is less than 16 or less than 17 or less than 18 years of age. A murder is a murder. It involves a death. It involves a tragedy. A rape is the same. And this thread of seriousness is important. 
So when we learn that violent crime arrests among juveniles in 1995 were 12 percent higher than they were in 1991, we know that we have not won the battle. And when we learn that they were 67 percent higher than they were in 1986, we know that the challenge remains for us to do something. 
When you see the raw data, when you see the statistics and the carnage that happens to real families stacking up, you know that you cannot sit idly by. Although the most recent data may reflect some improvement, the problem is really destined only to get worse given the demographics. Those who tell us about the future say, given that the children who were born during the baby boom of the eighties will start to reach the potential ages for the commission of crimes, that we are in for real problems if we don't adjust the way we approach this problem. 
One of the areas that I think needs our attention most radically is the area of juvenile crime records. Because we have thought of juvenile criminal activity as being mischief or inconsequential, we have decided to keep any records of juvenile activities very, very closely guarded. And we have an anomalous situation where we have juveniles who are not treated as criminals even though they have committed crimes like murder, rape, armed robbery, armed assault. 
They are sent into our classrooms, and yet the teacher in the classroom has no capacity of knowing what the student has done. As a matter of fact, frequently, with the mobility that exists in the American culture now, people move from one State to another and they take their children with them, or the children move from one State to another, and their record exists only in one State. 
They go into a school room, they go into a community, and the law enforcement community does not know about the heritage of criminal activity, the history of the individual, the threatening nature, the violent proclivities of an individual. They do not have such information because the juvenile records have not been available. Juvenile records have been sealed, and law enforcement officials and school officials simply have not had access. 
In the few States where they have had some access, that access is limited to students who committed the criminal activity within the State. We all know about the interstate mobility of people in our culture. As a matter of fact, those individuals who get in trouble frequently are the same individuals who are most active in crossing State lines. Our law enforcement officials need better access to juvenile records. 
Our school officials need access. I talked to a teacher who said that individuals were assigned to her classroom who were wearing electronic shackles. You know, that is the new technology where you put a bracelet around someone's foot. It is very durable plastic and cannot be cut off easily. It has a transmitter so law enforcement officials can know the whereabouts of the person wearing the electronic shackle. 
The teacher says that the students are capable of coming into the room and the teacher cannot know what they have done. I would be very, very reluctant as a teacher to see a student with an electronic shackle on his or her ankle reflecting the likelihood that some kind of very serious offense had taken place and still not have any ability to know what that student had done. 
The student comes from another State and has been assigned to a juvenile facility in your State but the record is sealed. You are supposed to turn your back on such a student and write on the board, not knowing whether the student is a rapist or a murderer. I find that to be a very serious challenge to the kind of atmosphere we need in the classrooms. At least I think school officials have a special need. 
I talked to a judge one time who was sentencing an individual for a very, very serious crime and did not have access to the records of this individual, who had lived in another State previous to the crime, and later learned that the individual had been involved in previous homicides. 
I think judges, when they are issuing penalties, need to know what the history of an individual is, what kind of criminal activity has filled the past of that individual--not just the things that have happened since the person turned 18--because some of these individuals, given the violent criminal nature that pervades some components of the juvenile community, have a rap sheet that would extend from here to Cincinnati in terms of detailing violent activity that ought to be before the sentencing authority. 
Juvenile records simply do not survive the juvenile's 18th birthday, and in many situations people start out with a clean slate. I think it is great to allow people to start over again in life. I think that is the marvelous part of what America has meant through the years. We let people get new starts in this country. But I think we have to protect ourselves. We should not say to 
anybody, `You can do anything you want up to the time you are 18, and then you get to wipe it all clean and you'll be considered to be an Eagle Scout until your first offense, and then, even then, the judge won't be able to find what's happened to you.' 
I really believe that inadequate records hamper law enforcement authorities. According to Police Chief David G. Walchak, who is the immediate past president of the International Association of Chiefs of Police, law enforcement is in desperate need of access to juvenile criminal records. The police chief said:  
Current juvenile records (both arrest and adjudication) are inconsistent across [State lines], and are usually unavailable to the various programs' staff who work with youthful offenders. 
It seems to me that if we are going to try to work with young people to have them change what they have done, allowing the juvenile justice system to hide what they have done is not really a way for us to confront the past and to change it. We cannot be clouding it and concealing it if we want to change it. I think to make real change you have to confront what has happened and move forward. 
Chief Walchak also notes: 
If we in [law enforcement] don't know who the youthful offenders are, we can't appropriately intervene. 
Part of our ability to prevent criminal behavior by the individuals is to have the ability to identify people who have had problems in the past. He has put it very clearly. Here is a police chief who wants to do what is right. That is not just to punish crime, but to prevent it, to try to intervene to make sure we do not have these challenges over and over again. We have his hands tied because we have an outdated approach to juvenile records. 
Well, Senate bill 10, which the Senator from Alabama has so appropriately noticed as a bill of monumental change and reconstruction in terms of our capacity to address these challenges, makes some serious reforms that will help us solve these problems. 
The bill would provide incentive grants for States to fingerprint and photograph juveniles who are arrested for or charged with violent crimes and to send those fingerprints and photographs to the FBI and to create and maintain records of juvenile convictions and to share those with criminal courts, law enforcement agencies, and school officials. 
If we really want our schools to do well, we cannot have them operating in the dark as to who is populating the classroom. 
For States to qualify for these funds, States would have to maintain juvenile records that are equivalent to adult records and to make those records available to the FBI, to law enforcement officers of any jurisdiction, to school officials, and to courts for use in sentencing. 
It is the kind of thing that I suppose the average American says, `That's common sense. I wonder why we haven't been doing that.' We ought to do it for people who are committing acts which are felonious in nature and which, if committed by an adult, would result in long-term incarceration. At a minimum, we ought to allow schoolteachers to know if individuals in their classrooms have been involved in that kind of activity. 
The bill will also make records available across State lines. Given the mobility of the American population, it does not make sense to think we can compartmentalize our approach to individuals who are not going to be compartmentalized and should not be. 
Senate bill 10 mandates that States send records to the FBI. It will enable State and Federal authorities to make assessments based on the juvenile's entire record. That is not only in the best interest of the culture and the best interest of the society, but, frankly, it is in the best interest of an accused juvenile. It does not serve anyone's interest to have a judgment rendered on the basis of inadequate data. 
We do not make good decisions when we do not have the facts. 
And courts cannot make good decisions when they do not have the facts. And schools cannot make good decisions when they do not have the facts. The truth is, all we are asking is that the records be made available to individuals so that they make better decisions, and we can do a better job of curtailing a problem that threatens us sorely. This bill would help get that done.

Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, the African nation of Sudan is a cradle and safe haven for the world's most vicious and violent terrorists. It is a country internationally renowned as a training base for terrorist groups. 
The Armed Islamic Group, Hamas, Abu Nidal, Palestinian Islamic Jihad, Hezbollah, and the Islamic Group, all practice car bombing and hostage taking on the sands of Sudan's deserts. 
Sudan also harbors and protects elements of Sheik Omar Abdel Rahman's Jihad network, the terrorist organization that was involved in the bombing of the World Trade Center. 
Furthermore, Sudanese diplomats at the United Nations conspired with Jihad terrorists to bomb the U.N. complex. Sudan also reportedly provided false papers and weapons for assassins who attacked Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak. 
There is no doubt that Sudan is a state sponsor of terrorism, and the State Department is right to classify it as such. 
Along with this classification, the State Department should also enforce strict sanctions on financial transactions with Sudan, as it does with other officially recognized state sponsors of terrorism. Unfortunately, the State Department has taken steps to relax sanctions on financial transactions with Sudan. Congress passed legislation last year, the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act, designed to prohibit all U.S. financial transactions with governments that support international terrorism. 
Unfortunately, the manner in which the State Department implemented the law exempted at least two terrorist states, Sudan and Syria, from this ban. The State Department reads this seemingly clear legislation to prohibit only the financial transactions which might further terrorism in the United States. Transactions which furthered terrorism outside of the United States would be perfectly legal. 
The bureaucrats at the State Department evidently believe that transactions which further terrorism against citizens of foreign countries or terrorism against Americans abroad--such as the Pan Am 103 flight which exploded over Scotland killing 270 people--should not be prohibited 
In our debate over foreign policy and foreign affairs reform, we need to clearly define a consistent antiterrorism policy. The United States should not allow financial transactions with state sponsors of terrorism, regardless of whether those financial transactions enhance terrorism in the United States or abroad. 
Congress clearly intended to outlaw all financial transactions with these rogue nations. Yet for reasons that have never been clearly explained, the administration has chosen to allow U.S. companies to continue to do business with regimes that are intent on killing Americans and terrorizing people around the globe. 
For example, only mounting public concern and increasing congressional pressure prevented this administration from allowing an American petroleum company to participate in a $930 million oil deal with the Sudanese Government. This oil deal would have provided hundreds of millions of dollars to this state sponsor of terrorism, money which could easily have funded attacks on U.S. citizens. 
The State Department's implementation of last year's antiterrorism law leaves a loophole large enough to drive a truck bomb through, a truck bomb similar to the one that killed 19 American military personnel and injured approximately 500 more in Saudi Arabia last year. 
One would expect the State Department to use every tool available to them to curtail and smother terrorism, especially since lives are at stake. The terrorist groups that operate out of Sudan are responsible for hundreds of attacks around the world and the deaths of thousands of people, and yet our State Department 
refuses to use the full scope of the law to aggressively isolate this criminal regime. 
Abu Nidal alone has been responsible for 90 terrorist attacks in 20 countries, killing or injuring almost 900 people. As I mentioned earlier, this terrorist organization uses Sudan as a base of operations. 
I have introduced legislation, Senate bill 873, to close the administration's loophole allowing most financial transactions with terrorist states to proceed. This legislation has been included in section 1605 of the foreign affairs reform bill we are debating today and specifically prohibits all U.S. financial transactions with regimes classified as state sponsors of terrorism, regardless of whether or not the terrorist attack might occur in the United States or abroad. 
There are some exceptions in the provision which allow certain financial transactions to proceed: transactions for humanitarian assistance; traveling journalists; and a national security waiver for classes of financial transactions that are vital to the security interests of the United States. 
As I mentioned earlier, this is unfortunately the second time the Senate has had to consider legislation to prohibit financial transactions with state sponsors of terrorism. If the Clinton administration had chosen to implement this law correctly the first time, all transactions between U.S. citizens and state sponsors of terrorism would already be illegal. 
International terrorism is going to be a topic of discussion at the upcoming G-7 summit this weekend in Denver. The financial resources available to international terrorists will be one area of discussion for G-7 leaders. President Clinton will probably speak very forcibly on this issue. I sincerely hope that he will also direct the State Department to implement the provisions in this legislation which undermine the financial resources of terrorist states. I hope the President interprets this legislation in accordance with congressional intent and limits the ability of American firms to provide financial resources to state sponsors of terrorism. 
State sponsors of terrorism provide critical refuge and support to nefarious organizations committed to killing Americans and citizens of other countries. Business as usual should not proceed with such regimes, and President Clinton should not have to be coaxed into aggressively enforcing U.S. antiterrorism laws to isolate these countries. This provision will diminish the financial resources available to terrorist states for their campaign of violence and hatred, and I urge the President's firm support for this anti-terrorism weapon contained in the foreign affairs reform legislation before the Senate today. 
I thank the Chair and yield the remainder of any time I might have.  
Mr. DURBIN addressed the Chair.

Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I would like to introduce The Prohibition on Financial Transactions with Countries Supporting Terrorism Act of 1997. This legislation will further isolate state sponsors of international terrorism from the community of responsible nations. By prohibiting financial transactions between U.S. persons and such criminal regimes, this bill will also reduce the financial resources available to terrorist states. 
Unfortunately, this is the second time the Senate has had to consider legislation to prohibit financial transactions with state sponsors of terrorism. The Anti-terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act, passed by Congress and signed into law by the President on April 24, 1996, contained a similar provision--section 321--which prohibited financial transactions with state sponsors of terrorism. Unfortunately, the manner in which the State Department implemented section 321 effectively exempted at least two terrorist States, Sudan and Syria, from the ban on financial transactions with United States citizens. 
The Clinton administration seemingly misinterpreted the clear language of section 321 which states that: . . . whoever, being a United States person, knowing or having reasonable cause to know that a country is designated . . . as a country supporting international terrorism, engages in a financial transaction with the government of that country, shall be fined under this title, imprisoned for not more than 10 years, or both. 
Somehow, our Government read such plain language to permit--not prohibit--almost all financial transactions with terrorist states. The only transactions the lawyers down at Foggy Bottom saw fit to prohibit were financial transactions which might further terrorism within the United States. The bureaucrats at the State Department evidently feel that transactions which further terrorism against citizens of foreign countries or Americans abroad--such as Pan Am flight 103--should not be targeted by this law. 
Mr. President, the Congress of the United States has worked extensively in a bipartisan manner to provide the legislative tools needed to defend America and our allies against the rising threat of international terrorism, and I am sorry that the Senate must now revisit this antiterrorism legislation to correct the misguided efforts of this administration to confront and isolate terrorist-supporting nations in an effective manner. 
We no longer live in a cold war world where the threats to our national security are easily identifiable. The fluid and complex international environment we face today demands the highest national security vigilance, the kind of vigilance that appears to be lacking in the Clinton administration. The administration's abysmal performance in enforcing United States laws against the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction by China is now mirrored by the administration's evisceration of Congress' antiterrorism sanctions. This administration finds no inconsistency between President Clinton's claim in an August 1996 speech at George Washington University that America `cannot do business with * * * terrorists who kill * * * innocent civilians,' and the State Department issuing regulations for the Anti-terrorism Act that same month that permit most business transactions with terrorist states to continue. 
Mr. President, terrorism is no longer a far away phenomenon that American only risk when traveling abroad. Terrorist violence that primarily targeted U.S. citizens overseas is now finding its way to American shores, and the most stringent U.S. antiterrorism policy will be essential to protect our citizens. State sponsors of terrorism possess a hatred of global dimensions, and America is one of their primary targets. Our policies must reflect this understanding. 
Mr. President, in the Africa Subcommittee, I have followed closely the global efforts of one particular country on the list of terrorist nations. Since democracy was overthrown by a radical Islamic military coup in 1989, Sudan has quickly joined Iran as the worst of the world's state sponsors of terrorism. Sudan's Government harbors elements of the most violent terrorist organizations in the world: Jihad, the Armed Islamic Group, Hamas, Abu Nidal, Palestinian Islamic Jihad, Hezbollah, and the Islamic Group all run terrorist training camps in Sudan. 
Those groups are responsible for hundreds of terrorist attacks around the world that have killed thousands of innocent people. Abu Nidal alone has been responsible for 90 terrorist attacks in 20 countries which have killed or injured almost 900 people. Jihad is responsible for the assassination of Egyptian President Anwar Sadat and Jihad's leader, Sheikh Omar abdel Rahman, is the ideological ringleader of the terrorists that attacked the World Trade Center and plotted to bomb the United Nations in New York. Another terrorist organization, the Islamic Group, regularly targets westerners in Egypt for attack and claims responsibility for the failed assassination attempt on Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak during his visit to Ethiopia in 1995. In addition to harboring such terrorist organizations, Sudan has also given refuge to some of the most notorious individual terrorists in the world, including Imad Moughniyeh who is believed to be responsible for the 1983 bombing of the United States Marine barracks in Beirut which killed 241 American soldiers. 
Sudan is not simply a favorite training camp for terrorists, Mr. President. The Sudanese Government actively supports this terrorist activity. For instance, Sudan reportedly provided the weapons and travel documentation for the assassins who attacked President Mubarak during his Ethiopia visit. Two Sudanese diplomats at the United Nations in New York conspired to help Jihad terrorists gain access to the U.N. complex in order to bomb the building. 
The conspiracy to bomb the United Nations was just one in a series of terrorist plots to bomb numerous locations around New York, including the Lincoln and Holland Tunnels, the George Washington Bridge, and various U.S. military installations. Five of the twelve defendants convicted in this series of terrorist plots were Sudanese nationals. Thankfully, law enforcement authorities thwarted most of these tragedies before they occurred, but the earlier terrorist attack against the World Trade Center was carried out by the same broader terrorism network in New York and killed six people. Those who bombed the World Trade Center only expressed regret that the twin towers were not toppled as they had planned, a catastrophe that in an instant could have resulted in more American casualties than the entire Vietnam war. 
Sudan's involvement in the conspiracy to wage an urban war of terrorism in New York makes it patently clear why our Government has justifiably designated some nations as state sponsors of terrorism and has imposed upon them the most severe penalties and sanctions provided by United States law. I am grateful that America has been relatively isolated from most of the world's terrorist violence, but just as terrorists have targeted Americans abroad in the past, they are now targeting Americans here at home. International terrorism is one of the great threats to our national security, but unfortunately yet another example of a national security threat this administration is failing to forcefully address. By cutting off the flow of financial resources to these rogue regimes, it will become more difficult for them to seed the globe with their acts of violent cowardice. 
Mr. President, the legislation I am introducing today will effectively prohibit financial transactions with state sponsors of terrorism--regardless of whether the terrorist attack occurs within the United States or abroad. This prohibition is one step in the fight against international terrorism the administration is evidently unwilling to take. 
An analysis of Sudan's involvement in international terrorism gives us an idea of the global designs of terrorist states. Business as usual should not proceed with such regimes, and President Clinton should not have to be coaxed into aggressively enforcing U.S. antiterrorism law to isolate these countries. This legislation will diminish the financial resources available to terrorist states for their campaign of violence and hatred, and I urge the Senate's prompt consideration and passage of this bill.

Mr. ASHCROFT. Thank you, Mr. President. 
Let me take this moment to express my appreciation and give my thanks to the Senator from Georgia, the Senator from Ohio, the Senator from New Mexico, the Senator from Wyoming, and others who have spoken eloquently in behalf of American workers. 
It is easy to say, Well, we are talking about a bill here, a bill before the U.S. Senate. But the truth of the matter is that we are talking about people. We are taking about people and families. We are talking about the fact that people in single-parent homes--obviously 100 percent of the parents--have to be at work. And in multiple-parent homes, two-parent families, the cost of doing business and taxes have really literally driven the second parent into the workplace, and they need to have time. People feel the financial stress, and they feel the family stress. 
All that we really have offered by the administration is that we would give people family and medical leave, which is a way to say that you can have time off without pay if you need to spend time with your family. If you give people time off without pay, that increases the financial stress that they went to work to resolve. 
I have found in my own family that every time I had to take a kid to the doctor that was not when I needed less pay. That was when I needed my full paycheck, because when you had those emergencies there is all of the little dollar costs of those emergencies. 
So I really believe that this opportunity we present to let people sort of develop a bank of time off so that they can take time off with pay later on is very important. 
The comptime part of this bill--which is to say that, if you are asked to work overtime, you can say instead of having time-and-a-half-time overtime pay I would like to have an hour and a half with pay off later on for each hour that I work in overtime. Time off with pay instead of just taking pay as time for the overtime is a way for people to meet these needs. 
It only though goes to people who normally get overtime. What you really find out is that of about close to 60 million workers who work by the hour in America only about a third of them ever get any overtime at all. Most companies say, `Well, we just can't afford to be paying 150 percent of our labor costs. So we don't provide for any overtime.' 
So, if all we did was to address the comptime parts of the labor force, which is the way you can get time and a half off for working an hour of overtime, time and a half off with pay, we would find ourselves limited from a quarter to a third of the work force that we were helping. 
The last time I checked, whether or not your company does overtime, or whether or not you normally get overtime, your kid still gets sick, your kids still get awards, your kids still go to soccer games, and they still need their parents. But, if we just deal with the narrow quadrant of the culture that gets overtime, we are going to ignore two-thirds to three-quarters of the culture, and we really need to do more than that. 
It is important for us to then have what we provided for every Federal employee, and that is the option for flextime. Flextime is the way to schedule work in advance, to work an extra hour in one period so you can take an hour off with pay in another period, or the most popular program for Federal workers. This started in the 1970's. 
So there is not a big problem to work 45 hours 1 week in return for only having worked 35 hours in the next week, and that really results in people taking every other Friday off. Since Friday is a working day, you can do the motor vehicle license stuff, or you can go to the doctors. It is the ability for people to spend time with their families. 
One other point needs to be mentioned, especially in light of the remarks of the Senator from New Mexico about serving working women. Overtime work in this country is concentrated among men. Hourly workers are just about split evenly between women and men. But overtime work is 2-to-1 in favor of men. So for every woman that gets an overtime hour men get two overtime hours. 
So, if we are really going to try to relieve pressure on working women, we do less for women in this bill if we just do the comptime, and if we do not get to the flextime part of the bill. 
I think it couldn't be said more clearly than in USA Today, the lead editorial, `Harried workers need comptime flexibility but unions blocking flexible work rules are favored by employees and employers alike.' 
That is the black letterhead line sort of stuff. 
I already submitted this for the Record. It says those who stand in the way deserve a permanent vacation. I don't know that we want to put them on vacation but send them home. 
The point is we really need to find ways to help workers. This is the way to help people have more time with their families without taking a pay cut and to help people plan. The more pressing the responsibilities are the more valuable planning is. 
It is against the law right now to plan with your employer to work an extra hour this week and take that hour off with pay next week. We shouldn't make it against the law for people to do reasonable things like that. It is against the law right now for your employer to say, `Instead of paying you time and a half time off, I am giving you time and a half off with pay down the road.' It is against the law. 
The Government shouldn't be about the business of making reasonable agreements like that against the law. 
The editors of USA Today have made it clear that they agree that this is something that needs to happen, and that labor unions and their lobbyists here in Washington shouldn't stand between the American people in this capacity to serve their families. 
It is with that in mind that we should continue to work toward the enactment of the Family Friendly Workplace Act. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, families are the cornerstone of America. The data are undeniable: Individuals from strong families contribute to the society. In an era when nearly half of all couples married today will see their union dissolve into divorce, I believe it is both instructive and important to honor those who have taken the commitment of `till death us do part' seriously, demonstrating successfully the timeless principles of love, honor, and fidelity. These characteristics make our country strong. 
For these important reasons, I rise today to honor John and Rosalie Sorensen of Des Plaines, IL, formerly of Howard's Ridge, MO, who on July 12, 1997, will celebrate their 50th wedding anniversary. My wife, Janet, and I look forward to the day we can celebrate a similar milestone. The Sorensens' commitment to the principles and values of their marriage deserves to be saluted and recognized.

Mr. ASHCROFT. I am grateful for this opportunity to speak in behalf of the Family Friendly Workplace Act. Unfortunately, so many statements about it this afternoon do not reflect the act. They may reflect some attacks on the act or what someone has said about the act, but the truth is this act is a totally voluntary way for employees to cooperate with their employers to provide more flextime, more time for people to spend with their families. 
This is not some new potential that has never been tried anywhere. We began in 1978 in the Federal Government to offer these kinds of benefits to Government workers. They have been tried in the governmental setting during the 1970's, all through the 1980's, and now through most of the 1990's. I have been in the Senate for a couple years, almost 3 years now, and I have not had a single Federal worker come to me and say this is a terrible means for abusing workers. When you survey those workers, the General Accounting Office, which surveyed the workers, found out that at a 10-1 ratio those workers said this was a very important way to help them accommodate the needs of their families. 
The Senator from Montana said if Federal Government workers get comptime, so should other workers. Well, Federal Government workers do get comptime and so should other workers. That is what this bill is about. But Federal Government workers get flextime and so should other workers. And that is what this bill is about. 
Now, I appreciate the patience of Senators on this flextime cloture vote. This is not the way we intended for this to unfold. We have made an effort to reach out to those on the other side of the aisle. We have conferred with them about constructing some amendments because they have raised concerns. Now, when they raised concerns, we sort of thought it would be appropriate if they would bring amendments to the floor to address those concerns. As a matter of fact, no amendment from the Democratic side was offered for consideration--no amendment was offered for consideration. 
So in an effort to address the concerns, we developed amendments that would meet those concerns that the Democrats had been raising. As soon as we developed those amendments--and there were a number of Senators, and Senator Grassley has already been mentioned on a bankruptcy amendment, there were two amendments about worker choice between comptime and overtime pay, and also amendments about so-called discrimination so to make sure in spite of the fact that the language that is already in the bill that prohibits an employer from selecting a worker to do overtime work because he is one that would only take one kind of compensation or another, we wanted to prohibit that. We not only wanted to reflect their concerns, we were willing to bring our own amendments. There were probably seven or eight amendments yesterday ready to come to the floor to assuage the concerns raised on the Democratic side of the aisle. And what happened? Instead of addressing this bill, they chose to filibuster this bill and talk about other things. 
I am at a loss, when they talk about the need for two-way cooperation. The Senator from Louisiana comes today. She says she comes to offer amendments and offer thoughts. Well, I got the thoughts part. But we have not had any amendments offered. There has been an opportunity to offer amendments. If you really want to offer amendments, we want them. I stood here on this floor Monday afternoon and pled for people to bring amendments, to come and let us consider them. I stood here yesterday afternoon and pled, `If you have amendments to this bill, please come and bring them. Let us correct any defects.' And did they come? No. 
Yet when we brought amendments to try and address the very problems that they mentioned, they filibustered. They talked about things much as they did today. With the 30 minutes allowed in the bill, the Democrats chose to spend most of the time talking about other things. 
The truth of the matter is we have a tremendous opportunity to extend to the American workers some very important rights and benefits that are enjoyed by the boardroom folks, the salaried folks, the supervisors and managers of America, and all the Government workers of America have either comptime or comptime and flextime. In enactment after enactment on the floor of this 
Congress we have extended those rights both to local government workers, to State government workers, to Federal Government workers, and we have reinforced that, and the President has even extended those rights by Executive order. This morning, while I was at the White House for the signing of the IDEA law, the President pulled me aside and said, `John, there is nothing more important we can do for American families--nothing more important than to provide flexible working arrangements for American families.' We do want to cooperate. My intention to cooperate will not be extinguished no matter what happens today. 
I think what we have here is a filibuster to kill flextime without real debate and without offering real changes. It is a search and destroy mission targeted at killing flextime, flextime that would help the men and women of America accommodate the competing needs of their families and their home place. 
Madam President, 57 Senators who now sit in this body, and Vice President Gore, voted to extend flextime benefits to Federal employees in the last decade and they voted to extend them to State employees and they voted to do it without anywhere near the protections we have put in this bill. The protections simply were not there, and they say that employees cannot make a decision about when they can use their comptime--that simply does not reflect this bill. The bill says that an employee cannot be forced to use his or her comptime at anytime, so the employee makes the decision, and if the employee makes the decision to cash it in, the employee can get the money back. Right now, there are 60 million hourly workers who are waiting for an opportunity to have comptime and flextime benefits. 
I challenge Senators to match their words with deeds and to vote to give millions of Americans the benefits that Federal workers have enjoyed since the 1970's. Today's cloture vote is far more than it may seem. Every vote against cloture is a vote to kill flextime for millions of working American families. 
No one defends current law as adequate to meet the needs of today's family, especially President Clinton. As I mentioned before, this morning President Clinton expressed to me his belief that flexible work arrangements are the most important thing we can do for families. The President wants a bill he can sign. 
I, again, challenge Senators to be serious, start negotiating and stop stalling.

If the comptime accumulated earnings, which might either be paid off at the end of the year as comptime that gets cashed out or might be taken as comptime, as time off--if that is older than 90 days old, under the current law it might not have all the protections in bankruptcy that normal wages would have; is that correct?

<TEXT>
Mr. ASHCROFT. I ask the Senator from Minnesota, Mr. President, if he is aware of the fact that under the bill that the only way you can be working more than 40 hours a week without overtime compensation is to do so as a result of a voluntary agreement similar to the voluntary agreement which is entered into now by Federal employees with their employers, whereby you can schedule a 40-hour week to average over a 2-week period. 
Such agreements, in the Federal system for example, provide the basis for people to work 45 hours in the first week and 35 hours in the second week, and have every other Friday off. And absent that kind of voluntary written agreement scheduled in advance, no one can be asked to work more than 40 hours in a week without being paid overtime. 
As a matter of fact, absent a specific voluntary agreement, all work--all work--is conducted under the bill as if it were conducted without the bill's existence; that only with voluntary agreements is there any change in the way the bill is done. And the voluntary agreement regarding overtime work when it provides for more than 40 hours in 1 week is pursuant to the flexible schedule that is now allowed as a benefit for Federal employees.

<TEXT>
Mr. ASHCROFT. The Senator cites 13,000 cases that were resolved or filed in the last year. It seems to me, that demonstrates that there is an enforcement mechanism in place, and that when there are abuses that are undertaken, either under the current law, which obviously isn't perfect, or else there wouldn't be any abuses, you know, I think that is really a wrong statement because you have abuses even under the best laws. The key is whether you have enforcement. Given the fact that you have enforcement and that you have double penalties under the law that has been proposed so that you double the risk for the employer, given the fact that the law talks about the fact that it shall be against the law to have either direct or indirect coercion or intimidation, 
and given the fact that when you define what coercion is in the bill, you find out that it is to intimidate, threaten, coerce, includes promising to confer or conferring any benefit such as appointment, promotion or compensation, or affecting or threatening to affect any reprisal such as deprivation of appointment, promotion or compensation, don't you think that the measures in the bill provide a safeguard, and that if there are violations they could be pursued just as aggressively under the new framework, which is a framework that is already shared by the Federal Government employees? Could not the enforcement personnel also enforce this kind of law, especially with elevated penalties and the increased description of coercion?

<DOCNO>105-ashcroft-mo-14-19970603</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
Mr. ASHCROFT. May I ask the Senator, does he think the Senators on his side of the aisle intend to offer amendments that we can begin to process providing the kind of relief to the private sector that people in the Government area have in terms of these flex benefits? We have flextime benefits. We have comptime benefits. Flexible time, in particular, is available to governmental employees. In the 1996 survey conducted by the Census Bureau, only 6.6 percent of all hourly paid women, for example, got overtime pay in a typical work period, and if we are only going to deal with comptime, we are dealing with a very, very small number. 
Now, when you talk about Federal Government employees and their ability to have flexible working arrangements, we are talking about a broad population, because flextime applies to those who do not normally get overtime work. Are there any--does the Senator know of any Senators on his side of the aisle who will be offering amendments to get that done?

<DOC>
<DOCNO>105-ashcroft-mo-17-19970603</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
Mr. ASHCROFT. Yes, I do. I will try to phrase this in the form of a question. When the Senator from Minnesota asks whose side am I on, he indicated that 38 percent of the hourly workers, overtime pay workers were women. That really means that 62 percent are men. Almost twice as many men in the equation are overtime workers as are women and that really does not talk about the number of women generally who are workers that rely on overtime or have the chance to get overtime. 
My question is, for the vast majority of workers that do not get overtime at all, and especially for women who are outranked about 2 to 1 by men in terms of the privilege of getting overtime, 
setting all those aside, you are doing something for the people who get overtime, and it is true that your proposal addresses those people and there are two men in that group for every woman in that group. That is what your own statistics basically show. So you are doing something for mostly men who get overtime. But for the people who do not get overtime and still have sick kids and still have families that have trouble and still need to have flexibility in their workplace, what are you proposing for those individuals? And are there going to be amendments to this legislation that propose to do something to give them flexibility?

Mr. ASHCROFT. I ask if the Senator from Minnesota is aware that the law would be enforced as it is written and not as it its characterized in that letter? I do not have any doubt that people could oppose the law as it is represented in that letter that was written by all the labor unions. The letter says that a person who takes comptime forever loses their right to the money. That is just simply wrong. 
The law provides, not only do you have a choice about whether you want comptime, whether you want to be paid time and a half--and that is a clear choice and it is a choice that is to be made without any coercion, indirect or direct, or intimidation indirect or direct, or threatening--but, even after you have made that decision the law provides, not the letter but the law provides you can change your mind and decide to cash out your benefits. So, if you want the money you have the ability to say I am just going to take the money. 
So, my view is I wondered if the Senator were aware of those kinds of things? 
Second, if I could ask a second question, I wonder if the Senator is aware that there have been a group of people come to the floor over the last several hours who have come to me with amendments, some of which are specifically directed toward points of concern raised by the Senator, but that the Senator is unable to consider them as long as the Senator from Minnesota continues to monopolize the floor and to say that no one else will have a chance to work constructively on the bill?

Mr. ASHCROFT. I thank the Senator for yielding for a question with the understanding he retains the floor after the question is asked. 
Both the House and Senate passed the emergency supplemental appropriations bills. Conferees have been appointed by both of the Houses, but the conferees must report out a conference report which must go to the House of Representatives first for passage before ultimately the Senate gets a chance to act on it. 
Now the Senator, by expressing his concern in such a lengthy way--over concern, obviously, for individuals for whom we have great sympathy--the Senator blocks the Senate from doing its business even though the Senate cannot act on the emergency supplemental appropriations bill at this point in time. 
Is the Senator aware of the fact that we are being kept from doing our business which is appropriate for us to do and that it is now impossible for us to act on a matter of greatest concern to him?

Mr. ASHCROFT. Thank you, Mr. President. 
I appreciate the opportunity to return to Senate bill 4. Senate bill 4, as you well know, is the Family Friendly Workplace Act. It was to have been the business of the Senate this 
afternoon. And I do understand the frustration of the individuals from the flood-ravaged States who have been victims of flooding and all. But I find it very difficult to understand why, especially when a conference report is being worked on, we have to insist that the Senate cease serving the Nation while the conference committee serves the people of the flood-ravaged areas. It seems to me that while we can do both, it would be in our best interest so to do. 
And so with all respect to my colleagues who have sought to galvanize the public attention on the need to act here, I want to commend the members of the conference committee who are working to do exactly what they are being called upon to do to provide an opportunity for relief in those areas. 
The Family Friendly Workplace Act is a way that we can help all Americans. We can help all Americans to balance the tension that exists between the workplace and the home place. We can help Americans who find that both parents are having to work in two-parent families. We can make sure that they have the capacity to spend the necessary time with their children that they need to spend. 
So, Mr. President, I think it is important that we get on with the business of trying to provide to hourly-paid workers in this country the same kind of flexible working arrangements which have been available to others for quite some extended period of time. 
As a matter of fact, in 1978, we began according flextime benefits to workers in the Federal Government system. It was done on a pilot project basis so that we could make sure we did not offend the rights of individuals and that we made sure that it was a workable system. For years, we inspected the system, and it was extended to more and more workers. 
In 1985, in the Federal system we made it available to Departments generally if they thought they could use those procedures wisely and if that would be helpful to people in balancing the needs of their families with the needs of the workplace. 
The major components are these. When you work overtime, instead of being paid for overtime, you might want to take time off with pay later on so that you could make up some of the lost time you have with your family. 
Most Americans do not realize it is illegal now for an employer outside of the Federal Government to offer an hourly paid worker time off with pay instead of paying the normal overtime pay. Now, it is, I think, an unjust situation where Government workers have a series of benefits that the private workers do not have. Similarly, Government workers, if they know they will be needing some time for their families can request to work an hour extra one week and take that hour off the next week so they can spend the necessary time with their families. 
Now, there are ways that private workers have the capacity to spend time with their families, and it is under a rubric known as the Family and Medical Leave Act, and that is a Federal law, but it says that under certain narrow conditions if you want to take time off you can take time off but you have to take time off without pay, so if you want your child to go to the doctor or you want to take your child to the doctor you can give notice to your employer that you are going to do that but you take a pay cut in order to do that. 
Now, if you knew you had a doctors' appointment next Tuesday afternoon and you wanted to tell your employer you would like to work an extra 2 hours this week to take the 2 hours off next Tuesday, that is the Federal system, available to Federal employees. You work the 2 hours extra this week, you get your work done, make the arrangements, take the hours off next week and you do not end up with a pay cut but keep your paycheck intact. That is very important. 
I should hasten to add that nothing in this bill would in any way erode, undermine or abolish any of the Family and Medical Leave provisions which are to the benefit of employees across America, but in conjunction with those benefits this would add a new array of potentials. One of the potentials is that you could take time off to be with your family when necessary, with pay, instead of having to go under the Family and Medical Leave Act procedures which require that you take the time off without pay. 
Now, most of us are familiar with the fact that not only do Federal Government workers have comptime and flextime proposals and State government workers have been authorized a very substantial comptime proposal and the boardroom folks have comptime proposals and the supervisors and managers and all the salary people obviously have flexible working arrangements, it is the hourly-paid workers of America who are being treated as second-class citizens. Frankly, they are in a minority. The majority of workers in this country have flexible working arrangements. Hourly paid workers do not. 
I think it is time that the hourly paid workers have that kind of opportunity. That is what Senate bill 4 is all about. I do agree that it is important for us to act with expedition on the supplemental appropriations bill but, in my judgment, it is also important for us when we have the opportunity like we should have had today, especially while this appropriations matter is still in the conference committee, to make progress on meeting the needs of Americans, especially when we are talking about benefits that Government workers have been enjoying in the 1970's, 1980's, and all through the 1990's now. It is time we give the same kind of opportunity to workers in the private sector. It is with that in mind that I say that I look forward to the opportunity of welcoming amendments and proposed improvements to Senate bill 4. 
Now, several hours were spent today in criticism of our proposal, but the fact of the matter is none of the amendments that have been filed have been filed by those who have been criticizing the bill. If, indeed, they want to do something constructively to help workers, I invite Members of the opposition to bring their amendments to the floor and to make their amendments available so they can be filed, so we can vote on those amendments, so we can take action on them, so we can make the improvements. We will upgrade what we really need to do to help the citizens of America who do not have this privilege. 
It is my understanding that the occupant of the Chair might be interested in making some remarks on Senate bill 4. I ask unanimous consent after a quorum call which I will put in place that the occupant of the Chair be recognized to make the remarks, and the conclusion of those remarks be followed by another quorum call, at which time I be recognized again to finish my remarks.

Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I rise to participate in this opportunity to celebrate the service of Strom Thurmond. 
When Abraham Lincoln stood on the battlefield at Gettysburg to memorialize the outstanding service of those who had died there, he put it succinctly: `The world will little note, nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here.' 
I do not suggest by my own remarks here this morning that my remarks are long to be remembered. But the service of Strom Thurmond is unforgettable, and is indelibly marked, not only in the history of the Senate but in the States of this great Nation as a part of the development of the character of the United States of America. 
`A nation reveals itself,' said John Kennedy, `not only by the men it produces but also by the men it honors, the men it remembers.' And so it is fitting that we should honor the service of Strom Thurmond. For long after his time in the Senate has ended--and the new millennium has begun--Strom will be remembered; not just for the elections that he won, but for the principles upon which he stood, the State he helped to transform, the party he helped to build. 
For Strom, winning elections became a habit. From the time he ran his first campaign for Edgefield County superintendent to his most recent reelection, his record of electoral accomplishment is unparalleled in our time. The punditry and political operatives have been left to search for the secret to Strom's success. The answer is really quite simple. At its most basic, it is this: His word is his bond. 
Whether giving up his seat in 1956 to run for reelection without the benefit of incumbency, or switching parties in 1964 to support Barry Goldwater, Strom has been true to himself and to the people he represents. He embodies the very essence of what it means to be a leader, `decid[ing] where he wants to go, figur[ing] out how to get there, and then do[ing] it.' 
But Strom has done more than just win the voters' hearts. He, along with Carroll Campbell, Governor Beasley, Bob Inglis, and others, have helped take a State of low-country planters and usher them into the information age. Today, South Carolina stands as one of America's great success stories, part of the booming South Atlantic seaboard; its factories, office buildings, and airports are at the forefront of the Nation's economic growth. And through it all, Strom has been there. 
Politically, this new South Carolina has also been moving--more than any other southern State--toward the Republican Party. And if ours is a movement of many mansions, then South Carolina is the house that Strom built. Under his watchful eye, the GOP has controlled the governorship since 1986 and wrested four of the State's six House seats from Democratic rule. 
Until Senator Thurmond, most would have scoffed at the suggestion that a Republican could win statewide office. But then Strom joined the GOP, and the impossible became the possible. And so today, there are elephants in the cottonfields, and we have Senator Thurmond to thank more than any other. 
Mr. President, in his lifetime Senator Thurmond has seen tragedy and triumph, known both midnight and high noon. At times, he has been a solitary figure seemingly at odds with the world. More often, however, he has stood for the national interest and the Nation has stood with him. And as South Carolina has flourished, so too, has he grown, coming to see fully the diversity and richness of the American dream. 
His secret is not what he gets, not what he gives, not what he consumes, but how he serves. In the end, what Douglas Southall Freeman said of Robert Lee four decades ago might also be said of Senator Thurmond today. `He [is] one of a small company of great men in whom there is no inconsistency to be explained, no enigma to be solved.' What he appears, he is. Not merely a man of great faith, but a great and faithful friend. 
A final thought. I often hear the pundits and the national press bemoaning what they call an absence of leadership. Where, they ask, are the Thomas Hart Bentons, the Calhouns, and the Clays? Well, let me suggest that they look to the United States Senate; and there, just beyond the camera's eye, you will find them. They go by Helms, Gramm, Moynihan. And perhaps most of all, Strom Thurmond--the Palmetto State's marble man--a `figure lost to flesh and blood and bones, frozen into a legend out of life.' 
I yield the floor.

Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, yesterday's Washington Post reported a decrease in crime nationwide. The Post also reported that Attorney General Reno and President Clinton quickly stepped up to take credit for this news. 
But in this same article James Alan Fox, dean of Northeastern University's college of criminal justice, suggested that the decreasing crime numbers were more a function of demographics. According to Dean Fox, `The aging of a large segment of the population has played a key role in the decline. Adults tend to be less violent than juveniles.' But if crime statistics are, indeed, a function of demographics, then the demographics suggest that the juvenile crime rates will continue to rise. As Dean Fox indicated, the juvenile population will grow over the next decade. 
The available numbers confirm that the rate of violent juvenile crimes is increasing. The Washington Post also mentioned that between 1985 and 1995, the number of murders committed by juveniles increased 145 percent. And criminologist suggest that the baby boom of the 1980's will bring tidalwave of vicious violent youth onto our streets. 
Mr. President, today, I am introducing legislation to protect our children from people who would lead them astray and from those who are dangerous in our midst. 
The dangerous environment in which our children live today dictates that we make several fundamental changes in the way we treat dangerous, violent juveniles and those people--juveniles and adults, alike--who lure our children into drugs and gangs. We must come down harder on juveniles who commit serious violent crimes--incarcerating them and trying them as adults--and we must improve our recordkeeping capability for these dangerous juveniles so that courts, police officers, and schools know when they have a potential killer in their midst. Furthermore, we must punish severely those adults who seek to corrupt our kids by luring them into gangs, drugs, and a life of crime. 
This bill, the Protect Children from Violence Act, will update our current juvenile justice laws to reflect the new vicious nature of today's teen criminals. 
The act has several components, but first and foremost it would require Federal prosecutors and States, in order to qualify for $750 million in new incentive grants, to try as adults those juveniles 14 and older who commit serious violent offenses, such as rape or murder. There is nothing juvenile about these crimes, and the perpetrators must be treated and tried as adults. 
Some of the laws on the books inadvertently pervert the direction of the law enforcement system, offering more protections to the perpetrators, than to the public. This must cease. Strengthening our juvenile justice laws is the first line of defense in protecting the public and providing greater protection for innocent children than for violent criminals. 
In order to do this, we must also ensure that our law enforcement officials, courts and schools have clear lines of communications and access to the records of violent juvenile offenders. This bill does this by requiring the fingerprinting and photographing 
of juveniles found guilty of crimes that would be felonies if committed by an adult. The bill would also ensure that those records are made available to Federal and State law enforcement officials and school officials, so they will know who they are dealing with when they confront a dangerous juvenile offender. 
Typically, State statutes seal juvenile criminal records and expunge those records when the juvenile reaches age 18. Today's young criminal predators understand that when they reach their 18th birthday, they can begin their second career as adult criminals with an unblemished record. The time has come to discard anachronistic idea that crimes committed by juveniles must be kept confidential, no matter how heinous the crime. 
Our law enforcement agencies, courts, and school officials need improved access to juvenile records so that they have the tools to deal with the exponential increase in the severity and frequency of juvenile crimes. 
For too long, law enforcement officers have operated in the dark. Our police departments need to have access to the prior juvenile criminal records of individuals to assist them in criminal investigations and apprehension. 
According to Police Chief David G. Walchak, who is immediate past president of the International Association of Chiefs of Police, law enforcement officials are in desperate need of access to juvenile criminal records. The police chief has said, `Current juvenile records--both arrest and adjudication--are inconsistent across the States, and are usually unavailable to the various programs' staff who work with youthful offenders.' 
Chief Walchak also notes that `If we [in law enforcement] don't know who the youthful offenders are, we can't appropriately intervene.' 
Chief Walchak is not the only one saying this. Law enforcement officers in my home State have told me that when they arrest juveniles they have no idea with whom they are dealing because the records are kept confidential. 
School officials, as well as courts and law enforcement officials, need access to juvenile criminal records to assist them in providing for the best interests of all students and preventing more tragedies. 
The decline in school safety across the country can be attributed to a significant degree to laws that put the protection of dangerous students ahead of protecting the innocent--those that go to school to learn, not to rape, maim, and murder. 
While visiting with school officials in Sikeston, MO, a teacher told me how one of her students came to school wearing an electronic monitoring ankle bracelet. Can you imagine being that teacher and having to turn around--back to the class--to write on the chalk board not knowing whether that student was a rapist, or even a murderer? 
School officials need access to juvenile criminal records so that they can keep a close eye on potentially dangerous predators and take preventive measures. Judicial and law enforcement authorities need this information because it is vital to the protection of public safety. 
In addition to requiring that Federal and State prosecutors try violent juvenile offenders as adults and increasing recordkeeping and sharing capability, this bill also 
enhances the Federal criminal penalties for those adults who seek to lure juveniles into criminal activity or drug use. 
For example, any adult who distributes drugs to a minor, traffics in drugs in or near a school, or uses minors to distribute drugs would face a minimum 3-year jail sentence--as compared to the 1-year minimum under current law. 
This bill also doubles the maximum jail time and fines for adults who use minors in crimes of violence. The second time the adult hides behind the juvenile status of a child by using him to commit a crime, the adult faces a tripling of the maximum sentence, and fine. 
Furthermore, the Protect Children from Violence Act elevates a Federal crime the recruiting of minors to participate in gang activity. Under this legislation, those gangsters who lure our children into gangs will face a Federal prosecutor and a Federal penitentiary. 
A 1993 survey reported an estimated 4,881 gangs with 249,324 gang members in the United States. Those figures are disturbing enough. But a second study, conducted just 2 years later, found that the number of gangs had increased more than fourfold, with 23,388 gangs claiming over 650,000 members. We need legislation to stem this rising tide. 
Let me quickly recap the highlights of this legislation. In order to qualify for incentive grants, States would be required to try juveniles as adults if they commit certain violent crimes such as rape and murder. States also would have to fingerprint and keep records on juveniles who commit crimes that would be felonies if committed by adults, and States must allow public access to juvenile criminal records of repeat juvenile offenders. These same provisions would apply to Federal law enforcement officials. To protect our children from adults who prey on them, this bill doubles and triples the jail time for those convicted of using a juvenile to commit a violent crime or to distribute drugs. Anyone caught dealing drugs to minors or near a school will face three times the penalty under current law. 
This bill is a reasonable and prudent response to the threat that violent youths, and the adults that lead them into life of crime, pose to our children. The moneys authorized will be used to deter and incarcerate violent juvenile criminals, not just to provide for more midnight basketball and prevention programs--the situation, and our future, demands more that that. We need to take into account the needs of the innocent children--not sacrifice their protection in the name of privacy of violent juvenile perpetrators.

Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I am pleased to have the opportunity to stand and speak on behalf of the Family Friendly Workplace Act. It is a way of helping people resolve tensions that exist between the home place and the workplace. Most American families encounter two basic tensions. One is the tension that is financial, that drives both adults in the family, if there are two adults in the family, into the workplace; certainly if there is only one adult in the family, that one adult has tremendous pressure to be in the workplace. The other pressure which exists for most American families is the social pressure that comes when you have all of the adults in the family in the workplace. You have tension between the workplace and the home place. 
How in the world are we going to be able to meet the needs of the home, when people are not at home when they are needed the most--particularly when there are times when their presence is very, very important. For example, when someone is getting an award, or when someone needs to speak to the counselor or with a teacher at school, or when someone needs to go to the doctor. Most families understand that when you have this kind of a need you should have the opportunity to be away from work. If both adults in the family are involved in the workplace it makes it very tough to do. 
There are times when certain conditions will justify the use of what is known as family and medical leave. The Family and Medical Leave Act was passed by the U.S. Congress and it allows people to take time off without pay. But I have found in my family, and I am sure most Americans have found as well that when you take your child to the doctor, that is not a time when you can go without pay. That is a time when you actually need all the resources you can get. To put people in the position of having to take a pay cut in order to go see the teacher about a problem at school or to watch the student get an award at school or to be able to take a child to the doctor--to ask a parent to take a pay cut in a setting like that is to make a parent make a choice that we should not be asking a parent to make. 
Fortunately, there already exists in this culture a clear model of a system that can work, that works effectively and works very well. It is in the Federal Government. Legally, all Federal employees have the ability to have what is called flexible working arrangements. They can take time off with pay later if they have earned that time off by working more hours earlier. They can arrange their schedule to work a couple hours extra one week and take a couple hours off the next week. As a matter of fact, Federal workers have the ability to take advantage of the scheduling option which allows them to work 45 hours one week, 35 hours the next week. That way they have every other Friday off. Of course, that is really a tremendous boon to people who need to be able to do things during the normal working hours, whether it is to go to the motor vehicle registration place to get the car plates renewed or to take a child to a doctor or go see a child get an award or confer with a teacher at the high school--those kinds of days that can be scheduled flexibly for Federal employees have worked well to solve problems for Federal employees. 
Unfortunately, what is standard operating procedure for people who work for the Federal Government turns out to be outright 
illegal for people in the private setting. Let me give an example. If you work for a Federal agency and you want to go see your daughter get an award on Monday afternoon next week you can say to the boss this Friday, `I would like to work a couple extra hours and then I can take off early next Monday.' Now, your boss can let you work 2 hours this week and you can take the 2 hours off next week, that is fine, you can see your daughter get the award. For a private employer to do that is violating the law. It is against the law for a private employer to be able to cooperate with his or her employee in such a setting. 
Now that really shocks most of us to think it is against the law for an employer to help an employee in that respect, but it is the truth. Similarly, if the private employer says if you would really like every other Friday off we will let you work 5 days at 9 hours a day, that would be 45 hours one week, and then the next week you only have to work 35 hours and you can do that by working 4 days, take the fifth day off the second week, that private employer, to pay a person the standard wages for doing that, is in violation of the law. Now you might add, `Gee, this is astounding. That should not be against the law.' It is against the law in the private sector. It is not against the law for Federal Government employees. 
What is interesting is when you talk to Federal Government employees, they endorse this system overwhelmingly. The General Accounting Office, which is the Office which makes assessments about how well Government is functioning and what works and what does not work--too often they find out what does not work--they made a study of this particular proposal and the way this works in the Federal Government. It was amazing that at a 10-to-1 ratio, Federal Government employees said this is something that really helps, this is something we like. This is something we want. This works. Not only did the employees say it was something that helped, that they wanted, that worked, the employees also were found by the General Accounting Office to be more productive, their morale was higher, and, obviously, those are the kinds of things we would like to extend all across our economy. 
Now, private, hourly paid workers in America are deprived of these benefits. It is just that simple. It is against the law. People say, how in the world did we get a law that would make it against the law for an employee and an employer to cooperate in this way? Well, back in the 1930's on the heel of the Great Depression, when only 2 out of every 12 mothers of school-age children were in the work force, a law was created that set up the Fair Labor Standards Act. This act gave some important protections to American workers. However, it also made these kinds of adjustments, this kind of workplace flexibility illegal. The world is so different now than it was then, it is almost impossible to imagine. Instead of 2 out of 12 mothers of school-age children being in the workplace, it is 9 out of 12 mothers of school-age children being in the workplace. So we flipped the statistics totally but we are still operating with the same approach--not totally operating that way. We changed it for Government workers. 
Of course, Government workers are not the only people that have flexible schedules. The people in the boardrooms have flexible schedules. The boss never seems to have trouble with his salary if he takes time off to play golf, let alone to see a child at school. People on salary, the managers and the supervisors--as a matter of fact, the majority of American citizens--have flexible scheduling. It is estimated about 66 million people have flexible scheduling and only 59 million who are the hourly paid working people of America do not have the ability for flexible schedule. It is no wonder that the Pugh Foundation said that 81 percent of the working mothers said, `We need flexible working arrangements for the private sector.' Obviously, that would be a great help to them. 
It would be a great help, they believed, because they think that is what would help them. When you look at Federal workers who have had this plan--now, for well into the 1970's--the 1980's 
and the 1990's, they say at a 10 to 1 ratio, `This is the best thing since sliced bread. This is something that is very important to us.' 
So, we are talking about a proposal which would extend to workers and working families the capacity to harmonize these competing demands between the workplace on the one hand and the home place on the other hand. I might add that I believe we are going to continue to have lots of people working outside the home in America. As a matter of fact, I do not know that America could be very competitive in the world economy if we did not. These two-parent families where both parents are working outside the home and the single-parent family where the only parent is working outside of the home are part of the muscle and fiber of the American economy. We cannot do without them. The truth of the matter is we need to find ways to help them harmonize the competing demands. They need more time and more flexibility. 
What is interesting about the Federal system is that it allows you to earn your time off by earning a little bit at one time and taking it off at another time. These flexible working arrangements give workers the ability to take time off without having to take a pay cut. Now the family and medical leave provisions are good, they are fine, they are part of the law right now, but if you take time off under the family and medical leave provisions you lose pay, and when you lose pay that way it is not only not good for you, it is not good for the country. 
Let me just talk to you about what happens in the family and medical leave situations where they have taken time off. Now, the family and medical leave Commission stated that the method that hourly employees used to recover lost wages when taking family and medical leave is that 28.1 percent borrowed money. So, families had to go in debt to meet their needs. And 10.4 percent, 1 out of every 10 hourly workers who took time off under family and medical leave had to go on welfare because of the money they lost. 41.9 percent, almost 42 percent, 4 out of every 10 people, deferred paying their bills. Now, most Americans do not like not paying their bills. People would rather have the flexibility of keeping their payments on time and on schedule. It is cheaper when it comes to the interest you are paying, finance charges, and the like. Yet we put people in a situation where 41 percent put off paying their bills, over 10 percent went on welfare, and another nearly 30 percent had to borrow money. I think it is far preferable to be in a situation where we allow people to have the flexibility of taking time off with pay instead of taking time off without pay. 
Now, there seems to be some developing consensus about the idea that there should be some capacity for comptime. Comptime is one of the items in this bill. It merely is the right to say to your employer, `I would rather be given some time off with pay later on than be paid for overtime.' We know that the law requires that you be paid for overtime at time and a half. This bill would allow a person to say, `I would like to take time and a half off with pay later on, instead of being paid time and a half for the overtime.' People are shocked to learn it is against the law now to say I would like to have some time off later on instead of being paid time and a half now--time off with pay later on. 
Interestingly enough, the comptime part of this bill only addresses a pretty narrow group of American citizens because the number of people who get regular overtime in our culture is pretty low. As a matter of fact, in the 1996 Current Population Survey, women who work on an hourly basis--and there are 28.9 million women who are paid on an hourly basis in this country--only 4.5 percent of them said they get overtime work in a typical work period. Even if you multiply that by five times, say you get up to 20 percent, you are dealing only with one out of every five women in the work force who would qualify for using comptime as a way of assuaging some of these tensions.  
Since this system is a voluntary system for both employers and employees, it is very easy to say that we will just move ourselves beyond comptime--not to say it is not valuable, that it wouldn't be important, that it wouldn't be wonderful to have. But if we give ourselves the capacity for flexible working arrangements, where especially people could schedule over a 2-week period instead of a 1-week period to average out the 40-hour week, indeed, people do have some of these benefits who are not traditionally the recipients of overtime. 
Another thing that stuns me is the fact that most of the people who get overtime are men. Overtime typically focuses on industries that are male dominated. There are about two men getting overtime for every woman that is getting overtime. So even if you are talking about the fact that overall, on balance, you might be entitled to a third of all the hourly workers who get some type of regular overtime, or enough of it to make a difference to help compensate meeting the demands of their family and the home place and the workplace, one-third really is really not addressing the problem of what we ought to address. We need to address this problem in a way which is comprehensive. 
So having flexible working arrangements for the entire population, and not just focusing the opportunity to assuage attention on those individuals who are regularly recipients of the opportunity for overtime, is very important. That is why the flextime part of this bill is important. If we really want this bill to address the needs of women, of which only 4.5 percent get overtime in any typical workweek, according to the 1996 Current Population Survey, we really ought to make sure that we do more than just have comptime legislation, that we have flextime legislation as well. 
President Clinton and many Democrat Senators have voiced support for flextime, the central idea within the Family Friendly Workplace Act. Polls show that the vast majority of Americans favor flexible work schedules. They want legislation that would give them parity with Federal Government workers. 
Incidentally, comptime is available to every State local government worker. The Federal law makes it available as well. 
People would like to have legislation that would give them the opportunity to choose scheduling options that would help their families. 
Penn and Schoen, the President's own pollsters, have reported that 75 percent of America wants the choice of comptime. 
Last month's Money magazine published a poll revealing that 64 percent of the public overall, and 68 percent of the women, would occasionally prefer time off in lieu of overtime if they have a choice. 
Nothing in this bill would make someone forever choose that it had to be one way or another. You could maintain the opportunity to have overtime pay most of the time when you had overtime, but you could on occasion say, `I would really prefer to take this time and a half off later than to have the time and a half in pay.' 
From the remarks we hear from the Democrats, I think they say they want the same thing. I believe they do have an appreciation for the need of workers in this setting. 
If this is really the case, if everybody wants flextime, some have specific difficulties with this bill, I hope that Senators would come down and offer amendments. We are at a point where we need to begin to work out, fine tune, and develop a bill which will result in the workers of this country having the benefits which all of us believe they need and want. 
According to all the accounts I have heard, people want this bill on both sides of the aisle. The President has been heralding the benefits of flextime for the last 2 years. In his State of the Union Address, as part of his campaign, and as recently as the last several weeks, he spoke very favorably, saying that flexible working arrangements are very important. Mrs. Clinton has made statements on national television over and over again. 
Now we have a situation where we have gridlock in the Nation's 
Capital. I think it is time for us to break that impasse. I think it is time to work out this measure. It is time for individuals who say they have objections to the bill to come to the floor and offer those kinds of compromises that would adjust the bill so as to make it acceptable. 
We want a bill. The Democrats have said they want a bill. I think it is time to work together and to work out Senators' concerns here on the Senate floor in the process in which the Senate is best served to undertake, and where the Senate works at its best, it works to the benefit of the American people. 
So let's work together and hammer out our concerns on the Senate floor. If Senators dislike specific provisions or language in the bill, I say come down and offer your suggestions, your amendments. Let's make sure that we don't allow this bill to be one which fails to move because none of us is willing to consider change. Let's try to say that since we all want this, let's move it forward, place it before the Senate, and ask the Senate to act in its wisdom on proposals and amendments so that the will of the Senate might work out the will of the people. 
This particular opportunity we have is a good one. It is one which I believe can really benefit the working people of this country and will help us as a nation as we move into the next century. 
If the studies of the GAO were correct, and 10-to-1 people think that this is a good system when they have had a chance to live under it, and the morale goes up and the productivity goes up, this is a policy that is a win-win situation and should be extended to all workers. It is a policy change which should be considered high on the agenda of the Senate, not on one party or the other, but high on the agenda of the American people and should, therefore, be high on the agenda of the Senate. 
Let's work together. Let's come to the floor. Let's make proposals for amendments. Let's work out our differences so that we can respond to the President, who said he wants to have a measure that addresses this issue, and let's find a way to do it in a way which will benefit the people of this country.

Mr. ASHCROFT. If you mean for the question to be totally rhetorical, I would not. But I believe there are reasons in the bill which indicate that such coercion would not exist. First, I do not think it is automatic that it costs an employer less to have an employee to accept comptime and have to maintain books for the compensatory time and also have the cash available for an employee to be paid the compensatory time at the worker's option. 
If you look at the bill on page 15, it says, `Prohibition of Coercion,' and it says, `shall not directly or indirectly intimidate, threaten, coerce or attempt to do so,' and again on page 39, `an employer shall not directly or indirectly intimidate, threaten, coerce or attempt to do so.'

Mr. ASHCROFT. This defines intimidation, and it says it includes `promising to confer or conferring any benefit such as appointment,' which means to appoint the person to do the overtime, or promotion, or compensation, to give a person a benefit, which the overtime is clearly a benefit. That is the whole thrust of your argument. 
If you do that, your discrimination qualifies as intimidation under the definition on page 40. But maybe we can clarify this with an amendment. That is one of the reasons I have said I would welcome Members to come to the floor.

Mr. ASHCROFT. I am happy to try to work together with our staffs to see if we can meet a mutual understanding of language. It is not my intent to draft a measure that would allow the employer to withhold the benefit of additional overtime or opportunities from an individual based upon their commitment to take either comptime as opposed to paid time or paid time as opposed to comptime. The decision should be neutral.

Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, we may or may not be able to have the cloture motion filed this afternoon. But to make a difference in terms of working out some of these measures, I would be pleased to see the cloture motion held over until Tuesday so that the cloture vote could be held until Thursday. 
I think it is important for us to get together and work on this measure. It is important for us to understand that we agree that families need more time. I believe we have an agreement that we want workers to have a real choice and a choice that is meaningful to workers. 
That is one of the reasons we put the second level of choice into the bill. We allow a worker to choose to say, `I would like to have this as comptime instead of overtime pay.' But we put a 
second choice into the bill that says any time after the worker has said that they want it as comptime and not as pay later, the worker can say, `I change my mind. I will take that as pay.' That is to avoid any potential coercion or abuse. 
But the idea that an employer might say we are only going to let overtime go to people who will choose compensatory time, or even to say we are only going to let overtime go to employees who are going to choose to be paid because they don't want to mess with the hassle of keeping the overtime--if the employer wants to participate at all, the employer shouldn't be able to intimidate the employee's choice in this matter. 
One of the things that I think I would like to point out that the Senator from Massachusetts has raised is that he wants this to be something that helps families. He talks about the need to help families. But the kinds of items that they are proposing that deal only with comp time and don't deal with flexible working arrangements like the Federal employees have or don't deal with anything like the Federal employees have, maybe we will address the needs of at best maybe a third of the employees. I think we are forgetting the data from the 1996 current population survey, which indicated that only 4.5 percent--that is one out of every 25 women--who work by the hour have overtime in a typical workweek. That means, yes, in a typical work period and in a week's time. But say you get four times or five times that 4.5 percent that get it over the course of time so that they would be able to build up some comptime, they are still talking about 20 percent of the women in the culture who are working in those hourly jobs. 
If you have 28.8 million women working in hourly jobs and you are only going to help 5 to 6 million of them, we have not done much in this bill. We need to address the problems that inure to the families of all of the workers, not just the ones that get regular overtime. The men are in a little bit better shape in our culture. They get more of the overtime than the women do. There are about two men getting overtime for every woman getting overtime. 
But if we do nothing more than pass the comptime part of this bill, we are going to leave behind too many men and too many women. We need to have flexible working arrangements on a broader level to meet the needs of the families, the families with children, that do not have regular overtime. They get sick. Children in families that do not have regular overtime get awards--they have parent-teacher conferences. 
Of course, in one respect it is important to say that, if you have comptime or flextime under this bill, you don't even have to have children to benefit. If you want to go fishing and your boss can agree that it does not unduly disrupt the business' purposes, you can swap the time off, and especially if you schedule to take every other Friday off. 
The Senator from Massachusetts talked about the fact that there are certain ways in which flexible benefits can inure under the current situation. He says that only a tiny fraction of the employers provide flexible work schedules. That is because they are unworkable. It is a simple matter of fact. 
The flexibility outside of S. 4 is limited to arranging 40 hours of work in a 7-day period. Exchanging hours from week to week is not permitted, even if the employee requests such an arrangement. For example, an employee who wants to work 45 hours in one week in exchange for only working 35 in another in order to attend a child's soccer game or to take the child to a doctor or to go fishing makes the employer agree to pay 5 hours of overtime for the longer workweek. Most employers can't do that. 
Sally Larson, a human resource professional at TRW, tesified before the Employment and Job Training Subcommittee that her company instituted a program where hourly workers would take every other Friday off. She also stated it took a team of lawyers a year to change over their payroll systems and to make sure that the program complied with Federal law. 
Most hourly workers aren't working in settings like that where 
they work for an employer who can have a team of lawyers that go through that kind of enterprise. Small businesses--or any business, for that matter--should not have to hire a team of lawyers in order to cooperate. 
The point is that current law is unworkable. It is obviously not in broad utilization. It doesn't happen. We need something better. 
The fact is that the system which we are promoting, the system which we are offering to the American public, is not an untried system. It is a system that has been place in the Federal Government since 1978. Through the last years of the 1970's, all through the decade of the 1980's, now well through the 1990's, we have had the system in place. 
I have been in the Senate now going on 3 years. I have yet to have a single Federal employee come and complain to me about this system. There is no bill pending in the U.S. Congress that would change this system. This is a benefit. It is a clear, unmistakable benefit. It is something that workers use. They subscribed to the flexible working arrangements benefits so aggressively early on that it has provided some difficulty in getting people to work on Friday. It has taken cooperation and some scheduling. But that has happened. 
There is much talk about the fact of the suggestion that we are without protections in this bill. But the bill which I have proposed for private industry has many protections which are not included in the bill which relates to the public. What I find amusing is that many of the people who are most aggressive in their opposition to this bill for private industry were sponsors of the bill which does not have the protections for people who work for the Government. 
Look at this. 
`Workers can be required to participate in compensatory time as a condition of employment.' This goes to the comptime bill for State and local workers. `Can be required to participate.' Under my bill it is strictly voluntary, and cannot be required. 
The very sponsors of the bill which are complaining, saying there is not enough volunteer choice here, cosponsored the bill for State and local employees which allows them to be required to participate as a condition of employment. Under the State and local law, which was sponsored by the same opponents of the bill currently, `management can decide whether a worker must use comp time.' Not so. `Workers cannot be coerced into using their comp time. Penalties are doubled for direct or indirect coercion' under our bill. 
It is important that people have choice. If someone were to try to coerce a worker into using comptime, the worker would have to do but one thing: Say, `I want the money,' because we allow for that second choice. Until you actually use comptime under S. 4, you have the right to cash that time in at any time. 
So you want the money? Just say you want the money. This is a structural opportunity. This structural capacity to take the money mitigates against coercion. 
`Comptime is paid in cash only when a worker leaves the job.' Under Senate 1570, Public Law 99-150, you have to quit if you are a State government employee in order to get your pay in cash. We didn't think that was enough protection. We thought that workers ought to have a different protection than that. `Comptime must be cashed out on the request of the employee,' and `must be cashed out at the end of the year.'  
I just raise these issues as a means of saying that our effort is to make this measure one which will provide a basis upon which people can spend time with their families, can arrange their work schedules, can meet these competing demands of the workplace and the home place. And we have sought to place not only legal inhibitors to coercion in the bill, we have also sought to put structural things in the bill--the right of the worker to cash out, just to say I want the money; I am entitled to it; give me the time-and-a-half, I want to take my money instead of leaving the hours in the bank. That right is there all the time. It never is extinguished. 
The only way the right of the worker--there are two ways the right of the worker to get that money out is extinguished. Two ways. The first is if the worker takes time off with pay. You would not expect to take time off with pay and get paid time and a half for overtime. You cannot have your cake and eat it. 
The second way you do not have a right to cash out your employment is if you are going to get cashed out at the end of every year. At the end of every year the employer must give out the money. He cannot carry it over as comptime. So if the worker cannot be forced to take it as comptime and at the end of the year the employer must give it out as cash, then the employer does not have any real incentive to try to get people to work without, by saying they will take comptime instead of paying them overtime. A business is going to have to hold the cash ready to pay it out at the end of the year, hold it ready to pay it out at the employee's request, at any time the worker says I have decided I want the money instead of cash. 
As I said to the Senator from Massachusetts, Mr. President, I hope we will be able to work to provide further assurance that we do not intend for employers to be able to coerce or intimidate. This is a measure which I think would really affect people where they live. I have been getting lots of letters from people around the country. This one says:  
I'm writing this letter in regard to S. 4, the Family Friendly Workplace Act. I ask that you support the bill as I think it would be of great benefit to all the citizens of this country. Time and again parents relate to me-- 
And this comes from a public school principal-- parents relate to me that they cannot come to school for conferences or other meetings because they have to work. This bill would seem to allow some flexibility in the workplace. 
The principal knows the value of parents being able to come and participate in the child's education. 
She also goes on to say: 
I'm also the child of an elderly parent who needs constant care. Many of my baby boomer friends are in the same situation of caring for parents. A family friendly workplace would relieve some of the worry and frustration of this situation. Thank you for your time. 
Here is a letter from a 25-year-old single mother of twin 2-year-old daughters--A 25-year-old single mother of twin 2-year-old daughters. Now, this is the definition of having your hands full. 
Recently I heard of your Family Friendly Workplace Act. My employer, located in Carthage, MO, does not allow a flexible work schedule or overtime. My understanding of this act is that I would be able to have flexibility in my work schedule, giving me the opportunity to make up work hours lost because of illness in the family and doctor appointments. 
She is right there. The employer would have the option of doing that. 
As a 25-year-old single mother of twin 2-year-old daughters, the Family Friendly Workplace Act would be extremely beneficial to my situation. 
Listen to her situation. 
My children were born with a congenital heart disease and they need to attend checkup appointments on a 3-month basis with a cardiologist. These appointments have to allow a full day since our specialist is in Springfield, MO, and especially because both of my children attend the appointments. Also, since my children have a heart disease, they need special attention if they are ill. As a single mother, it's very difficult to lose any days financially. 
Let me read that again. 
As a single mother, it is very difficult to lose any days financially. 
Let me interrupt this letter for a moment. Now, you might say, well, this woman can take time from Family and Medical Leave. I think she could qualify for the serious medical problems that Family and Medical Leave may cover. But Family and Medical Leave makes you take the time off without pay. So here is this single mother, with twin 2-year-old daughters with congenital heart disease, having to make regular doctor appointments and having to take a pay cut in order to take her kids to the doctor, and she says: 
My understanding of this act is that I will be able to have the flexibility in my work schedule giving me the opportunity to make up work hours lost because of illness in the family and doctor appointments. 
I can understand her desire to make those things up. 
As a single mother-- 
She goes on to say-- it's very difficult to lose any days financially. The opportunity to make up lost workdays would be incredibly helpful. The Family Friendly Workplace Act would give me the opportunity to take time off from work without the loss of pay because of those days my children are ill or need to attend a doctor's appointment. 
Thank you for taking time to read my letter and your consideration of the many working parents who would appreciate such an act. Please go forward with the Family Friendly Workplace Act. 
Absent the Family Friendly Workplace Act, people like that have to take family and medical leave, which is time off without pay. 
Now, before the current occupant of the Chair came in, I went to the Report of the Commission on Family and Medical Leave. The Commission report stated in order to make up for the pay cuts that people have to endure because they are not allowed to make up their salaries, they are not allowed to bank flextime and they are not allowed to have banked comptime--here is how they make up for those losses--28 percent have to borrow money; over 10 percent went on welfare when they took family and medical leave; 42 percent put off paying bills. 
Do you know what putting off paying your bills does for you? It increases your payments. The interest goes up. You are paying for a longer period of time. And it just occurs to me that we should not put people in the position of having to take a pay cut in order to be a good mom or dad in America. We should have a situation where we can give people the option of working some time in advance and then using that time, or when they have overtime required of them, putting that time in a bank so they can take time and a half off at some later date. It seems to me that makes a lot of sense. 
Now, I do not understand how it is that those who oppose this bill say this is a bill for a pay cut. This is not a pay cut. This is a way for you to work time in advance so that when you need to take time off later, you do not have to have a pay cut. You do not have to take Family and Medical Leave time, which is unpaid leave. You can take flextime off or comptime off, or you could just cash in your flextime or comptime and have the money that you had earned earlier there to sustain you when you would be gone. 
So the suggestion that this is a bill which provides for pay cuts I think ignores the real facts of life. The real fact of life is that when you have your 25-year-old mother, single mother of twins going to the doctor under Family and Medical Leave, she takes a pay cut. And that pay cut is never restored. But if she had the 
ability to have flexible working arrangements, that would be a pay cut which she would not have to endure. 
I believe we do have a lot of agreement here. We agree that American families need the opportunity for flexible working arrangements. S. 4 provides the potential of flexible working arrangements to all the workers in the culture. 
Because the suggestions from the other side only address people who traditionally work overtime, you are only talking about a third of the people in the culture there. I think we ought to find a way to help all Americans balance the needs that they have between their families and the workplace, and we ought to look very carefully at the data from the 1996 Current Population Survey which indicates that only 4.5 percent, 4.5 percent of the private sector working working women report getting regular overtime. Even if you multiply it 4 or 5 times, get it up to 20 percent, get it up to 25 percent, multiply it by seven times or eight times, get it up to 32 percent, you are still ignoring two-thirds of the individuals in that population. 
I think it is time for us to provide a way to accommodate the needs of families that respects all of the families in the United States of America and does so without requiring them to take a pay cut, because, in my judgment, we should not be asking people to take pay cuts. We should be providing people with ways that they can sustain their income and sustain their families in the same situation.

Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, first of all, I thank my colleague from Massachusetts for engaging in this debate. I think it is important to do that, to refine what we are talking about, to learn what works and what won't work and learn where we might need to modify what we are doing. I am eager to have amendments offered by those individuals who want to change this proposal, and I think we will be getting to that very shortly, and I am grateful. 
I just point out that he indicated that the situation with the mother of twin 2-year-old daughters would be covered under the Democratic proposal. Her company doesn't provide for overtime. Her company just doesn't ask people to work overtime, and the Democratic proposal simply doesn't address the needs of the vast majority of individuals in the country who don't get overtime. I think we need to do that. There are lots of companies who just don't do it. They can't afford for their labor costs to go up by 50 percent by having overtime, so they hire enough workers, schedule enough people, pay enough benefits. 
But this young mother says, `My company doesn't schedule overtime.' So the only way for her to have the capacity to develop the ability to serve her daughters without taking a pay cut would be if we had some kind of flextime proposal similar to the one offered in the U.S. Government to Federal employees. It has worked well here. As a matter of fact, 10 to 1 the workers say it is very, very good. The General Accounting Office, which assesses whether things work or don't work in the Federal Government, indicate because people have the kind of flexibility they need, these workers in the Federal Government are more productive and their morale is better. I think that would be the same kind of thing in which private employers would want to engage. They would want to help their workers be more productive, have better morale, and extend to them the same kind of benefits that are available to Federal employees. 
You may just say all the various things you want to say about this, but there are a couple key facts. It is totally voluntary, and not only do you have your first choice, but you have your second choice. If you choose to bank some hours and then you choose to cash them in later, you can cash them in. So your first choice is whether or not to put hours in the bank instead of taking the pay. But any time later, before you take the hours off, you can cash them in. That is choice No. 2. This isn't a plan that is just characterized by choice, this is a plan characterized by choice squared. This is two choices, and I believe in this case two choices are better than one because they provide insurance. 
Second, it is a plan which would give people an opportunity to take time off without taking a pay cut, and that is something that we need. It is a plan that would deal with all the work force in the country, not just the few who regularly get, or with some frequency get, overtime pay. In my judgment, those are very important components, and I think given the fact there is substantial agreement about the needs--and I don't think anybody will come to us and really say the needs are focused only on people who get overtime in their work--it is pretty clear that people who don't get overtime, their kids have problems, they have the needs for the parent-teacher conferences, just like other folks, and I think it is time now to work together. 
I hope the amendments will begin to be brought to the floor, and we will vote on these amendments. I am not in favor of curtailing the amount of time available to this bill. I think we ought to run this through the series of proposals, and the Senator has been kind enough to mention a number of them, that apparently will be coming forth. Frankly, we are going to be working this evening and into the day tomorrow to try and make sure if there are misunderstandings or clarifications that can be the basis for agreements, that we will provide those. I thank the Chair.

Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I rise today with an open mind, for I have not yet decided how to vote on the budget resolution before the Senate. I understand and I appreciate that we should not let the perfect become the enemy of the good. If I forget that, the leadership and the Senator from New Mexico will be quick to remind me, I am sure. 
Having been a Governor, I understand that budgeting requires choices, choices that will not satisfy everyone but should benefit everyone. Like Senator Bond, who served as Missouri Governor before me, I balanced eight budgets in our State of Missouri, working with our State legislature. The economic results were a strong, growing economy, more jobs, low taxes, and the Nation's highest bond ratings. We developed a record of which we could be proud in balancing the budgets. We developed a rainy day fund, several hundred million dollars in the cashflow operating reserve. 
But the State law that we had equipped us with the necessary tools to balance our budget. We had a constitutional provision and requirement that we balance the budget. We had the line-item veto. We had the requirement and the power to balance our budgets and then the tools to enforce our agreements. We worked with good people who had good intentions, and we reached good agreements. But we also had a good process to ensure that our agreements were kept. 
I have only been in the Senate for a relatively short period of time, but it seems to me there is no shortage of good people with good intentions here in Washington. What disturbs me is that here in Washington we do not have good processes in place to ensure that the budget agreements we make 1 year will be kept the next year. Particularly, we lack the right kind of mechanical structural devices in Government to make sure that the budget agreements we make in one year, like 1997, would be kept in the year 2002. 
You can believe in and trust the people who reach disagreement in good faith, and I do believe in them and I trust in them. But the history of failed budget agreements and the continuous deficit spending without enforcement measures makes a mockery of good people and it makes a mockery of good intentions. We need more than good intentions and good people. We need good guarantees. We need strong enforcement provisions. We need the limits contained in the agreement to make sure that the agreement is not broken. 
We have heard a lot on the floor of Senate that if you do this to the budget, it will be a deal-breaker. Well, I want to make sure that we add some enforcement so that we have a deal-keeper. I hope that there will not be folks anywhere in this Chamber who say that because you have an enforcer of this agreement that it is a deal-breaker. It would be awfully difficult to hear people argue that anything that forces us to keep the agreement breaks the agreement. I think what we have here is the need for a deal-keeper and a deal-keeper cannot be a deal-breaker. 
Most of the people who are involved in the debate might not be in office 5 years from now. The President certainly will not. So if we expect to balance the budget, we need a principled process, we need the structure of protection to be added to this agreement. We should not trust the next generation's future to a handshake agreement between people who will not even be around when the real crunch time comes. That would be the triumph of hope over experience. 
For me, a balanced budget in the year 2002 is worth voting for, but good intentions are not enough to be worth voting for and good intentions alone will simply not protect us until we get there. The budget resolution which we have before the Senate today claims to reach balance by the year 2002. The American people will furnish every single dollar that is taxed and spent under this budget deal. I believe they are entitled to the very strongest possible guarantees, guarantees that promises made under this deal today will be promises kept tomorrow. People outside the Washington Beltway have a healthy skepticism of promises to stay on course for a balanced budget. 
The amendment which I have introduced and which I am introducing with those other Senators whose names have already been recited enforces the assurances that the leadership is promising under this plan. It does not change the bipartisan agreement between the President and the constitutional leadership. It simply adds additional enforcement mechanisms to ensure that the Nation actually reaches balancing its budget by the year 2002. 
Now, if we are truly committed to balancing the budget, we must have adequate enforcement mechanisms. This amendment ensures that any legislation, any legislation would be out of order if it caused total outlays to exceed total receipts for the year 2002, or any fiscal year thereafter, unless three-fifths of the whole number of each House provide for a specific excess of outlays over receipts by a rollcall vote. Under this amendment, any legislation would be out of order if it caused an increase in the public debt above the levels in the fiscal year 1998 budget resolution for fiscal year 1998 through 2002, remaining at the 2002 level thereafter unless three-fifths 
of the Members of each House provided for such by rollcall vote. Under this amendment, any legislation would be out of order if it caused an increase in revenues unless approved by a majority of the whole number of each House by a rollcall vote. That is the requirement for an absolute majority in the event of any increase in taxes. 
Now, over the past 30 years Congress has not been very good at exercising self-control in budgetary matters. We need these enforcement tools to lock in our commitments to the American people to balance the budget by the year 2002. Senators should recognize these concepts which I have just mentioned. The fact that it would be out of order to increase the debt above the levels in the agreement, it would be out of order to have outlays that exceeded our income, it would be out of order to have tax increases without the whole of a majority of each whole House in a rollcall vote, because these are the very provisions, these are the very provisions which we all voted for, which 66 Members of this Senate voted for in the balanced budget amendment to the Constitution debate. 
I say to the 66 Members who voted in favor of this, this should be the structure we work in perpetuity, as long as this Nation exists. If it was good enough to put in the Constitution as long as America would exist, it ought to be good enough to put into this budget agreement for the next 5 years. It is that simple. 
Deficit spending has wrested power from the people it has deposited here in Washington. We have inverted the Framers' will. They expected us not to spend the money of the next generation. This approach is to do one thing, and one thing alone, and it is to curtail the deficit. It is to put enforcement and teeth into this agreement. It is to hold this agreement in place during the next 5 years. It is not to add spending to this agreement or take spending out of this agreement. It is simply to make this agreement an honest agreement for the people of the United States of America. 
Our ability to spend the money of the next generation is one of the skills we have refined to a very high level, and it is a skill we ought to curtail and guard against. This amendment would guard against it. 
We have tried time and time again to deal with the dilemma of recurring debt. We have not been able to deal with it. We simply have not been able to summon the discipline. Well, I say put the discipline in this agreement. We should make part of this agreement the kind of guarantee that will make sure we keep our word. Put `deal-keeper' into this agreement. Stop talking about deal-breakers. Make this a deal-keeper. 
Chronic overspending does not simply result when one group decides that it will try and stop it. We have to have the right structure in place, and the amendment which I have offered today is the right structure for doing that. 
This budget agreement suggests that Congress will balance the budget by the year 2002. We must have the enforcement provisions necessary to ensure that this goal is actually reached to place the very provisions in this agreement, the very provisions which were voted for overwhelmingly by this Senate when it sought to pass the balanced budget amendment to the Constitution. 
Sixty-six Members voted for those items. That makes good sense. 
Incidentally, for those who didn't vote in favor of the balanced budget amendment, the rest voted against it and almost universally said give us a chance to vote for this as a statute. 
We don't need to tamper with the Constitution. Here is that chance. This is a chance to say, `Yes. We agree that statutorily the very conditions which were so favorably received in the balanced budget amendment proposal are available as statutory law here.' I believe this is an addition to the budget agreement, which won't be a deal breaker but which would be a budget agreement keeper. 
If the Senators believe that this budget deal will lead us to a balanced budget by the year 2002, then they shouldn't fear adequate enforcement provisions that will make this a certainty. The American people are rightly skeptical that this deal will lead to a balanced budget. Firm enforcement would go a long way to assure the American people of Congress' resolve to do the right thing and to keep its promise to balance the budget. 
As I mentioned, 66 Senators voted to abide by the enforcement provisions in this amendment when they voted for the balanced budget constitutional amount. 
I hope that they will join in support of these very items which would provide an assurance that the conditions of this agreement would indeed be met. 
Senator Inhofe and I have combined forces on another amendment. I wanted to thank him for his cooperation in getting that done. 
I yield the remaining time to Senator Inhofe.

Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, much has been said about different amendments, alleging that they were deal breakers. This is a deal keeper. This is a set of enforcement provisions which would limit the amount of debt that we could have each year to the amount that is specified in the budget agreement. This is basically the balanced budget amendment in statutory form, conformed to the balanced budget agreement. Those individuals who voted in favor of a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution were willing to put this kind of discipline into our culture for life. I think we ought to be willing to put it into this agreement for the next 5 years. 
This is not a deal breaker. This is a deal keeper, and the American people deserve to have the discipline of knowing that the debt will not exceed the limits specified. 
The debt will not exceed the numbers of debt which are provided for in the agreement. This is just a way to provide discipline and enforcement of the agreement, as written.

Mr. ASHCROFT. It seems to me that what you have proposed is giving the President everything he asked for when he asked for it last year, before he saw this potential of a bigger pie. Certainly he knows how to ask largely and how to ask to meet the need. He certainly has no reticence about asking. With the additional potential for resources, when people earn more and develop more for this country, we ought to let the people have some of what they earn instead of saying, we will take that and spend it on Government, even if it means we have to adjust our--it occurs to me they are having to adjust their ambition bigger and bigger. The harder and harder the American people work, the idea is, the more the Government can spend as a result of it.

I want to thank the Senator. I thank him for yielding for this point of clarification. 
I find very appealing the idea that we would let the American people, when they earn more, keep more. Families would rather spend it on themselves rather than send it here in hopes that something would happen with it here that might benefit their families. 
I commend the Senator.

Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I rise to speak about a topic which is going to be voted on here in the U.S. Senate tomorrow, the topic of partial-birth abortion. This is an issue which I think is understandable by virtually every American who has given it any consideration. They understand this is a brutal technique which inflicts pain and is the kind of thing which would shock the conscience of most Americans not only as it relates to unborn children, but if it were, as a matter of fact, a procedure used even on animals. 
Mr. President, about 2 weeks ago, a Rhode Island jury found a mother guilty of second-degree murder in the death of her newborn daughter. The State medical examiner, according to a May 9 article in the Providence Journal-Bulletin, testified that the little girl died from a single blow to the back of the head that left a laceration on her scalp and an inch-long skull fracture. The umbilical cord and the placenta were still attached to the child. 
Now, ironically, this Rhode Island woman who had been found guilty of second-degree murder, if she had, prior to giving birth, allowed a physician to perform a procedure very similar to what she did, a procedure called partial-birth abortion, there would have been no criminal action involved. The baby would have been there, the blow to the head would have been similar, the umbilical cord would still have been attached, the placenta would still have been there, but because the baby would have been only partially born, it would have been entirely legal. 
This kind of tension that exists in the law between charging and convicting a mother of second-degree murder and authorizing a physician to conduct what is called a partial-birth abortion makes no sense to the American people. 
Let me take a few moments today to talk about the lessons we teach when we as a culture allow such tensions to persist. When we come down here to the floor and we argue before the cameras, the Nation is affected on a level of which we too often take little notice. People look, people listen, people understand. 
Right now we are debating a violent medical procedure that, in my judgment, should be a clear-cut wrong. People understand that. However, the high emotion of the abortion debate seems to blur the vision of many of us who are in the U.S. Congress. We are so caught up in arguing about the definition of technicalities that we are in danger of slipping into absurdities ourselves, absurdities that are exemplified by the charge and conviction of the woman in Rhode Island. 
The stakes are high here, as we are talking, in no uncertain terms, about the value of human life. It seems so clear that all of us should vote to ban the direct killing of a fully formed, often viable, human being. Yet because the child is 80 percent born, somehow we have allowed the killing of that child to be legal. 
Now the partisan political rhetoric we expend here and the attempts to turn this vote into abstract public policy are setting an example in our society and in the world that bring into question our Nation's status as a moral leader. How can we lecture or threaten China on its human rights abuses when we stand up and argue that human beings should be brutally butchered in a procedure that is rarely, if ever, medically necessary? 
How can we question the practice of child slavery in foreign nations when our own Nation's lawmakers cast cavalier votes to torture our own infants? 
Let me be clear, though. Our position as a world leader does not trouble me as much as the positions we put our youth in when we refuse to provide moral guidance. 
What are we teaching our own children? What are we saying to them about the value of life? What are we saying to them when we suggest that a technicality provides the difference between destroying a life, committing murder, and merely having an abortion? 
What values are we teaching when we vote that the difference between a partial-birth abortion and a homicide is a mere 3 inches? 
If the physician took forceps or scissors to collapse the baby's skull outside the mother's body, he or she would be charged with murder. 
Yet, if the skull is collapsed when the baby's head is still partially in the birth canal, the homicide becomes a legal procedure. 
What values are we teaching when lawmakers show more concern for animals or the environment than for human life? Let's look at two pieces of legislation that demonstrate the absurdity of our present value system.

Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, families in America are facing a challenge raising children--especially since in most cases --if there are two parents, they both are in the workplace. Certainly for single parents being in the workplace makes raising children even more difficult. For these single parents, if their children have to go to the doctor--they take them. If their children are having trouble at school or get sick during the day, the single parent does not have anyone else to rely on. 
The single parent must take care of the problem themselves. As difficult as that may be, if that single parent is a salaried worker, she can work with her employer to arrange her work schedule to accommodate these needs. However, if that single parent is an hourly worker, she must find a way to meet her child's needs and work all of the required hours during a 7-day period or lose part of her pay. 
Demographics have changed significantly since the passage of our major employment laws. In 1938, when the Fair Labor Standards Act was enacted, only 2 out of 12 mothers with school-age children were in the workplace. Today only 3 out of 12 mothers of school-age children are not in the workplace--obviously, the statistics have taken a real flip. People have gone into the workplace in order to tackle the incredible tax burden and the cost of living. It has been said that in some families, in most families, one parent works to pay the Government and the other parent works to provide for the family. 
It is very difficult for families to make ends meet unless you have both parents working to provide financial resources for the family. Therefore, we have a high level of involvement of the parents of America in the workplace--this stresses our families. Regardless of why we have this kind of stress in our lives, it exists. It is real as any other societal problem that we are dealing with today. We need a solution. 
Parents need to be available to their children to go to award ceremonies, to see them play soccer or football, and to confer with the teacher. Parents need to be able to care for a sick child or a child that becomes sick or ill at school without worrying that they will have to miss time away from work--and the income that goes with it. 
We have proposed and will continue to debate--and I think we will enact--what is called the Family Friendly Workplace Act. It is a way of saying to parents you should be able to make agreements with your employer about flexible working arrangements, that you should be able to save up some time off that comes when you work overtime. Instead of being paid time-and-one-half, if you want to--at your option and at your request--you should be able to take time-and-one-half in time off with pay. You can use that time later so that when the need arises you will be able to meet the needs of your family. 
Those who have been opposed to providing this option for America's workers have their own solution to the problem--they think that providing the American worker with more unpaid leave will somehow help already financially strapped workers. They want to expand Family and Medical Leave to allow for 24 hours of unpaid leave to attend a child's event. 
I think the Family Friendly Workplace Act is a superior option. This would allow you--at your option--instead of being paid time-and-one-half for overtime to take time-and-one-half with 
pay some other time to meet the needs of your family. The Family Friendly Workplace Act does not say to the moms and dads of America, in order to be a good mom and dad, you have to take a pay cut. It says if you can work something out with your employer to put some time-and-one-half hours in the bank and take time off later, you still will be paid for them because you have hours in the bank. 
There is more social tension, there is more financial tension, and we need to have the flexibility for families to spend more time with each other to resolve those tensions. It is simply true that moms and dads in America should not have to take a pay cut in order to be good parents. 
Experience has shown us that pilot programs--or experiments--help us understand whether a program should be permanently authorized or more broadly adopted. It will tell us whether there are bugs in it that need to be worked out or whether it is a program that will work well and can succeed. 
The Family Friendly Workplace Act is modeled off of one such pilot program. Since 1978, Federal Government workers have been able to work flexible work schedules as provided for in the Federal Employees Flexible and Compressed Work Schedules Act. That is, we have had flexible working arrangements. We have had compensatory time off for overtime that has been used at the option of the worker. I believe it has been a model that we can follow to provide for American laborers who work by the hour. 
As a matter of fact, in 1994 in an Executive order, President Clinton directed more broad use of these flexible scheduling programs throughout the Federal Government. So what we have here is a system which is working for Federal employees that should be allowed for the men and women of America who work by the hour. 
I should just take a moment to indicate that all the people who are salaried workers have flextime potentials--the people in the board rooms, the presidents and the owners of the companies, the supervisors and managers generally. As a matter of fact, the great majority of workers in the country, especially when you put in governmental workers, have comptime and flextime options, but the average hourly worker in America does not. It is time to give the hourly workers, the laboring people what the great majority of workers have and that is flexible working arrangements. 
Now, one of the things that opponents of this bill constantly say is that this proposal destroys the 40-hour week, that it somehow would force people to work overtime without pay. Nothing is further from the truth. Taking compensatory time off in the bill is totally--completely--voluntary. The Family Friendly Workplace Act provides for new, voluntary choices for workers. Section 3 provides, under compensatory time off, that it is voluntary participation. It says, No employee may be required to receive compensatory time in lieu of monetary compensation. 
That basically says no one can be required, instead of taking time-and-one-half pay, to take time-and-one-half off later with pay. It is a system that says we want to give workers the choice. As a matter of fact, so committed are we to choice, even if you decided you wanted to take compensatory time off when you work the overtime hours but later change your mind, the bill says you have an absolute right to get paid the cash. 
Comptime provides some flexibility for those workers who get paid overtime. However, many workers never earn overtime compensation. The biweekly work programs and flexible credit hour programs provide flexibility for those workers. Participation in these programs also are completely voluntary. `No employee may be required to participate in a program described in this section.' This is all voluntary. Those who say there are not employee choices in this matter simply have not read this legislation. 
There are protections for workers to make sure that voluntary means voluntary. The protections that are involved in this bill for workers exceed those protections that are involved in the Federal law for State and local government workers. `Section (d). Prohibition of Coercion. An employer shall not directly or indirectly intimidate, threaten or coerce, or attempt to intimidate, threaten or coerce any employee.' And `the penalties for abuse are doubled in the current law.' 
We have taken great steps here to make sure that this is totally voluntary and that any coercion, direct or indirect, is impermissible and would be punished substantially with higher penalties than we have under current law. 
As a matter of fact, the situation we are recommending in the Family Friendly Workplace Act has far more guarantees and protections for workers than are currently involved in the law for State and local government workers. The Federal law allowing State and local government workers to have comptime says that workers can be required to be involved in comptime as a condition of employment. That is not so under the law we are proposing for private workers. It is strictly voluntary. It cannot be required. It is up to the worker. No worker can be required to participate. 
Under the law which now applies to State and local government workers, management can decide when a worker must use comptime. Under the Family Friendly Workplace Act, workers cannot be coerced into using their comptime. Penalties would be doubled for any direct or indirect coercion. There is another significant difference. There is no cash-out provision under the system for State and local government workers, comptime only is paid in cash when the employee is either terminated or quits. In other words, if a State or local government worker wants to get his overtime in cash, you can only get the cash out of the system when you leave your job. You have to quit your job to get your money. 
Under the Family Friendly Workplace Act, you do not have to quit to get your money. Any time you change your mind, comptime must be cashed out on request. It must be cashed out at the end of each year. So that the Family Friendly Workplace Act is totally voluntary--and there are these structural guarantees--with doubled penalties. These arrangements are strictly voluntary. They cannot be required, they cannot be coerced, penalties are doubled, and comptime must be cashed out on request. This is a system which basically allows workers to make choices. It allows them to make meaningful choices. These are choices about spending time with their families. 
We have talked about just one of these choices--the choice that relates to comptime which you get when you work overtime. But the truth of the matter is, many American workers seldom if ever get overtime. As a matter of fact, in 1996, our census data indicates that only 4.5 percent of working women in the private sector get regular overtime. 
If we were just to leave this bill at the comptime level and not do anything about flexible working arrangements, we would not be providing much relief to women who work by the hour and never get overtime so they could take comptime instead of time-and-one-half in pay. In order to meet the real needs of American workers--the broad workforce--we need to have the kind of breadth of options in the program that is in the program for Federal workers. Federal workers have more than just comptime as an option for flexibility. They have the potential for flexible working arrangements so individuals who never get overtime still have the ability to have flexible working arrangements and spend time with their families. 
If only 4.5 percent of the 28.9 million women who work by the hour in this country--if only 4.5 of percent of them get overtime--really, if we only do comptime, we are not going to help the vast majority of the women. We have to give the private sector workers the same range of options that exist for the Federal employees. And that includes flextime arrangements; the ability to schedule work flexibly and the ability 1 week to work an hour extra so the next week you can take an hour off. 
Right now, it is shocking, but our legal framework makes it illegal for an employer to say to you, I'll let you work an extra hour on Friday so you can take an hour off on Monday. Most Americans are shocked by that. They also are shocked by the fact that it is not illegal for a Government employee to do it, but it is illegal for an average citizen to do it. They know it is not illegal for the boss to do it or for the boardroom guys to do it or 
the managers or the supervisors to do it. They know it is not illegal for the salaried people to do it. They ought to have some reservations about a system that has sort of second-class citizenship for hourly paid persons and it is illegal for them to work an extra hour on Friday and take an hour off on Monday, even when their employer agrees with it. We need to stop that illegality. 
The point is simply this. Since very few working women who work by the hour get overtime, very few will benefit from a comptime only option. We need to provide a framework for these women to have the ability to be with their families, and we have to have flextime in order to get that done. 
Mr. President, this is a great opportunity for us to say to American families, We are with you. We are not against you. This is a great opportunity for us to say to the working people of the country, You deserve the same chance for flexibility that the Federal Government employees have. You deserve the same chance to be with your children that the salaried workers have--the managers, the supervisors, and CEO's or the company Presidents. As a matter of fact, they are a minority of workers who do not have these options. We understand that. Hourly workers are a minority of workers in this country when compared to the Government and the salaried and other workers. But they should not be treated as second-class citizens. 
The soccer game is just as important to the hourly worker's child as it is to the boss' child. It is just as important to go to the school doctor to confer about your child's health if you are an hourly worker as it is if you are a Federal Government employee. It is just as important for your family to operate as a family, to be able to shape the values and to provide the framing, the development of the next generation if you are an hourly worker as if you are paid in some other way. The Family Friendly Workplace Act is simply a means of getting that done. 
It is a means we have designed with protections that are strong. The protections are superior to the protections that are there for State/local government workers. I am a little bit befuddled because the individuals who argue most aggressively against providing this for hourly private sector workers across this country sponsored the legislation for State and local government workers. Not only did they sponsor the legislation for the State and local government workers, but that legislation --that they cosponsored--has fewer protections than does the legislation we are proposing for private workers. Yet those who sponsored the fewer protections for State and local government workers are criticizing the proposal in the private sector because they say enough protections do not exist in the measure. That is difficult to understand. Those individuals, I think, should reevaluate their position. 
When organized labor leaders of this country oppose laboring people getting the opportunity to spend time with their families and flexible working arrangements, we ought to ask them to come to the table to help us, to help us assure an opportunity for America's working people, not stand aside and hurt us and criticize a system which is far superior to the one that has been endorsed and for which they negotiate when they are representing State and local government workers. 
Mr. President, the opportunity to pass flexible working arrangements to help parents be better parents, to have more time to spend with their families, to be able to take the time off with pay by using compensatory time and flexible working arrangements is what the future of America will be all about. Those who suggest we have to have more unpaid leave so parents will have to choose between taking a pay cut and helping their child are on the wrong track. People are not working because they can afford to take a pay cut. They are working because they need the money, and we should never ask them to sacrifice their child in order to make more money or to sacrifice the money they need to help their child in order to spend time with their child. 
The last time I checked, when my children had to go to the dentist and I needed to take them there, that is not the time I could do with less money. That's the time I needed more money, when there was a crisis, when I needed to go to school to see what was happening with my child, take the child to the doctor or to the dentist. I didn't want to take a pay cut. I didn't want to have my salary reduced. Of course I wouldn't. I am a Member of the Senate, I am a Government employee. I have flexible working arrangements. But I do know this, for us to say to the working people of America: When you have a special need in your family, you should take a pay cut and you should take leave without pay, we are asking them to jump out of the frying pan into the fire. 
As a matter of fact, family and medical leave has been the occasion for a lot of people to find themselves in real financial distress. When the Commission on Family and Medical Leave met, it found that over 10 percent of all people who took that unpaid leave to meet the needs of their family had to go on welfare because of the loss of salary. Wouldn't it have been better to have flexible working arrangements and some comptime in the bank so you could do that? Ten percent went on welfare, over 40 percent said they had to defer the payment of bills. They just had to stop paying their bills. About 20 percent said they had to borrow money. We have a great opportunity to say to families, `If you work together, cooperate with your employer in a framework of solid protections in a voluntary system, you will be able to be better parents and you will not have to take a pay cut to do it.' 
I call upon my colleagues to enact this legislation as a matter of great service to the people of the United States. 
Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Will the Senator clarify for me, now, under family and medical leave, what kind of time off is that and do you get paid when you take that time off?

Mr. ASHCROFT. So their proposal is, if you want to take time off with your family, you have to take a pay cut to do it?

Mr. ASHCROFT. The Senator from Georgia started to make the point, though, that is also important, which is this flextime and comptime opportunity isn't just for specific things with your family. If you wanted to take this time off once you have earned it--

Mr. ASHCROFT. The Senator pointed out that the Federal Government workers have had this full range of options now for almost 20 years. Has the Senator from Georgia had a lot of Federal Government workers streaming into his office to say, `Please, take us out from under this system, it's a problem to us'?

Mr. ASHCROFT. All the corporate presidents, all the salaried workers, and the Government workers have comp or flextime, but the hourly workers, who are a minority of the workers in this country; less than half of the workers, do not have this. The other folks all have it. 
I thank the Senator for coming to the floor to talk about this.

Mr. ASHCROFT. I thank the Senator from Georgia for his contribution to this debate and his insight. In fact, the insight which is most valuable is that families have the capacity intellectually, and ought to have the capacity legally, to make decisions about their own family and not to have Government trying, from 1,000 miles away, to tell you whether or not you should be able to do something or not with your kids or whether or not you should be able to take time off to meet your own personal needs.

Mr. ASHCROFT. I thank the Chair. 
Madam President, I want to talk about benefits that people enjoy as workers in America, benefits which are enjoyed by Federal workers, benefits which are enjoyed by State workers, benefits which are enjoyed by executives, by supervisors, by managers, benefits which are enjoyed by all salaried workers, but benefits which do not inure to the advantage of individuals who work by the hour. 
There are about 59 million people in this country who work by the hour; 28.9 million women who work by the hour. These are the individuals who do not have the flexibility to adjust their schedules. They do not have the capacity to say, `I'm going to take Friday morning off and work a little extra Monday afternoon.' They do not have the ability to say, `I need to quickly take a few minutes away here. I need to go to the school and pick up my child who needs to be taken to the doctor's office.' They do not have that capacity. 
The majority of Americans do have that benefit. Far more, millions more, people have that benefit than those who do not. But the hourly paid workers do not. 
If you work for the Federal Government, you can schedule your workweek to get an extra day off every other week while keeping a full paycheck. If you took Friday off every other week in the same way and you are not in the Federal Government, you are going to find yourself short on cash. If you are an hourly worker in the private sector, you just cannot do it; you do not have that benefit. 
If you work for the Federal Government, you can choose compensatory time; in other words, take time off with pay later on instead of being paid time and a half when you have been asked to work overtime. You do not have that choice, you cannot make that choice if you are an hourly worker in the private sector. It is against the law for your employer to say to you, `Well, if you'd really rather have time and a half off later with pay instead of taking paid time and a half for your overtime now, I'll do that for you.' Then the employer is in violation, the employer suffers the penalty, the heavy hand of law enforcement, and the Government comes down on him if he does that. 
It simply is something that cannot be done for people in the hourly category in the private sector. The boardroom, yes. If the boardroom boys want to go play golf, they want to have Friday off, they have flexibility. The salaried workers have the flexibility. Government workers have that kind of flexibility. But private, hourly paid employees, whether they be men or women, they do not have it. It is not fair. 
If you work for the Federal Government, you can bank hours 1 week, you can work a couple hours extra this week in order to take a couple hours off next week. That sounds reasonable. It is something that people could do to adjust to the needs of their families. 
If there is an awards assembly at the school, if there are PTA conferences, if you need to get your driver's license 
renewed, you have to retake the test, or just have to have your eyes checked and you have to do it during the hours when government offices are open, the department of motor vehicles, you need to do that, if you are a Government worker, you can put a couple hours in comptime this week and take the time off next week. Or, of course, if you are a manager or boardroom executive or a salaried worker, that is something that can be done. 
But your employer cannot trade 2 hours this week for 2 hours next week if you are an hourly worker. That is a benefit that people in the governmental system enjoy. It is a benefit to be able to bank some hours this week and take them off next week. It is a benefit to be able to use time off and take compensatory time off with pay instead of being paid the time-and-a-half overtime, take compensatory time and a half off without losing pay. 
It is a benefit to be able to schedule your workweek so that you can take Friday off every other week the way Federal employees can. These are benefits which belong to the majority of the members of the work force in our culture which do not belong to hourly workers. 
What S. 4 is all about is providing an opportunity for hourly workers to have some of the same benefits that have been available to individuals in other quadrants of the culture. Private-sector workers have fewer benefits than Government workers. 
I think a lot of folks, when they have worked in the private sector--certainly I knew that--they work just as hard. Private-sector families need moms and dads just as much as public-sector families do. Private-sector kids play soccer. Private-sector kids get in trouble and need the folks to show up at the school to get them out of trouble and help straighten them out. My mom came to school occasionally when I did not want her to, but it helped me, and I am glad she was able to. Private-sector workers need the benefit of being able to do those kinds of things. 
Now, I do not understand how Senators can be for flextime and comptime for public-sector workers and not be for flextime and comptime for private-sector workers. S. 4 is just trying to give to people in the private sector the same benefit that these Senators have provided for their public-sector employees--the same choices. 
I have not had a single Government worker come to me and say, `Wow, these choices are terrible. I wish we didn't have choices like flexible scheduling. I sure wish I didn't have the capacity to bank an hour this week and take it off next week. I really wish I didn't have the opportunity to schedule so that I had every other Friday off. And, man, I hate this concept of being able myself to choose whether I wanted the money from overtime work or I wanted to take time and a half off with pay at some other time.' 
I have been here now for--well, I am in my third year, and have not had the first Federal worker knock on my door and say, `It's terrible to have this kind of flexibility,' and I don't think I ever will. As a matter of fact, when people were interviewed in the system by the General Accounting Office, at a 10-to-1 ratio they said this was the best thing since sliced bread. This is what people need. This is a way for people to accommodate the demands of their families. 
Incidentally, people all need to take time off. Everybody knows there are going to be demands that will require you to take some time off. The question is, are you going to be able to be paid for it? You know, most of the time when you have to take time off to be with your family, that is when you need the money. 
Folks on the other side of the aisle say we should have more family and medical leave. That is leave without pay. I ask a simple question to my colleagues, and it should be easy--this is what we call a `no brainer'--when you take your kid to the doctor, do you need more money or less money than if you are not taking your kid to the doctor? 
In my experience, if I have to take my child to the doctor or to the dentist, I have a need for additional resources, not fewer resources. If all I get offered by Government is a plan that says you can take a pay cut if you want to take your kid to the doctor--wait a second, it relieves the tension I feel within me, I do need to be able to take my child to the doctor, but if I have to take a pay cut to do it, how am I going to pay the doctor? 
We have a system that is in place where the benefits are available to the Federal worker, the benefits are available to the boardroom, the benefits are available to those who are salaried workers. We include this kind of flexibility, not taking pay cuts, but a capacity to meet the needs of your family without having your paycheck docked. I think it ought to be available to private workers. 
You know, not one that I know of of the employees of the Federal Government have come to me or any other Senator saying `It's a terrible system. We ought to abandon it.' There are 56 Senators who are still in the U.S. Senate who supported flexible 
scheduling benefits for Federal workers, and they are refusing to give these benefits to the millions of sales clerks, secretaries, factory workers, the kind of hourly individuals, mechanics across our country. We have a lot of folks here in this Senate who gave it to the Government workers. 
Now, not all the 56 are refusing. I should not say that. If I did, I misspoke and I need to be corrected, because there are a number of Senators on this side of the aisle who voted for that and who have said, yes, it was good for Government, and it would be good for the people in the private sector to have these choices. It is totally voluntary at the option of the worker and cannot be done unless it is also voluntary by the employer; otherwise, the same system stays in place that is in place right now. 
But when employers and employees can agree, we ought to have these benefits for the people in the private sector just like this benefit is available to people in the public sector. There are 56 Senators still in this body who voted to give it to people in the public sector. 
How can you be for bigger benefits for Federal workers, but fewer benefits for the people who work by the hour and who pay our salaries when they pay their taxes? It seems to me to be an irony which is strange indeed that we would say to those who pay our salaries, who hire us to represent them in this town to do what they need to have done--and we make second-class citizens of those whom we represent and those who pay us to be here. It is inconceivable. 
Some people say, well, we need to protect the workers. We have built protections into this. Those who are saying that we need to protect the workers in the private sector, let us find out what kind of protections they put in when they voted for the workers to have this flexibility in the public sector. It is kind of interesting. 
In the public sector, workers can be required to participate as a condition of employment. Participation is strictly voluntary, it cannot be required in comptime under our bill. 
They say we have to protect the private-sector workers. They did not demand that protection when they issued this whole set of opportunities for public-sector people. 
They say we have to protect workers from management. Did they say that when they put the public-sector program in place? Management can decide when a worker must use comptime. What we have put in our bill, workers cannot be coerced into using their comptime. Penalties are doubled for direct or indirect coercion. 
It is hard for me to understand how people could say we need tougher penalties than this when they invented this program for the public sector and they authorized management to make the decision. 
Here is another benefit. 
Comptime paid in cash only when the worker leaves the job in the public sector. What have we done for private-sector workers to try to protect them? Comptime must be cashed out any time it is requested by the worker; must be cashed out at the end of the year if it has not been used. 
Was that something that they felt was an important protection when they voted for the system in the public sector? Comptime paid in cash only when the worker leaves the job. The worker had to quit if he wanted the money. 
I think what we have here is a clear situation where we need to give private-sector workers the same benefits which people in the public sector have been enjoying. I agree that we want to have them protected. But as Shakespeare, I think, said in one of the plays, `I think he doth protest too much.' 
They are asking for a full range of protections saying, `I can't do that in the private sector because you don't have private-sector protections.' Well, we have big enough protections in every case for the private worker in this bill than they demanded when they passed this for the public sector in the bill which now controls the public-sector effort. 
It is pretty clear to me S. 4 would give private hourly workers real choices. They are real choices with protections. They are protections which are much stronger than anything that was written into the bill by those Senators who wrote in the public sector framework. 
It is high time we stop having an approach which tries to discriminate against the private hourly workers. It is high time we said that the benefits that have been available in the public sector should be available to those in the private sector who work by the hour. The benefits that have been available to the vast majority of American workers, public sector, salaried workers, the boardroom folks, the managers, and the supervisors, those benefits need to be available to the individuals who, as a matter of fact, work by the hour in this country. 
We should give them the opportunity to choose a set of benefits that have not been rejected when available to the private-sector workers. They have been embraced by public-sector workers. 
We are for protecting workers. Senator Kennedy has argued our bill does not protect workers. Senator Kennedy was a cosponsor of the public-sector bill. He was a conferee on the committee, and it did not provide the protections in the public sector which we have in the private sector. It did not give workers the same kind of choices. I think it is time for us to say, `Let's be reasonable,' and understand for private- and public-sector workers we have to provide the capacity for people to meet the needs of their families if we want America to be successful in the next century. 
This debate can be talked about as if it is a debate about theory, about law, and about benefits. In fact, this is a debate about people. This is a debate about families. Are we going to give people the capacity to have families that are as successful as possible? 
Let me just talk to you about a young woman named Kim Buchanan, from St. Louis, MO, a crisis clinician at the Meritz Behavioral Care facility in St. Louis, MO. Her husband is a Federal employee at the veterans hospital in St. Louis. Her husband enjoys the benefits of flextime. They have a son who is 3 years old. Like many American families, Kim Buchanan and her husband, Rocky, both work full time. Kim just landed a new job which requires her to work on shift hours through the week. She must also work weekends. She now needs to find a new day care provider for her children while she tries to keep up with her new work schedule. Fortunately, the Buchanans are getting some help from Rocky's new employer, the Federal Government. Yes, what the Federal Government provides is flexible working arrangements. He is allowed to work flexible schedules in order to keep up with some of the family's activities. That means Rocky can work a few more hours one week in order to take some time off, with pay, at a later date. 
Now, here is a statement that Kim Buchanan made:  
Rocky will pick up our son on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. Those are the days I'm going to have him in day care. Rocky has flextime at his job. I would like to see that everyone has it. I don't work for the Federal Government, and it would be nice to have that kind of flexibility especially when you have children. It would be really nice to have that kind of flexibility instead of putting one parent in the bind. 
I think Kim is right. Kim has a pretty dramatic situation. Her husband works for the Federal Government and is privileged to have flexible work arrangements. She works in private industry and it is illegal for her employer to cooperate with her. I wonder what her children think? Daddy works for the Government and gets special privileges, and Mommy works for the private sector and it is illegal for the private sector to help families the way the public sector does. 
Virtually everything we do has some function of being a teacher and teaching us. I do not know what we are teaching kids when we tell them that it is illegal and wrong for private businesses to help families the way the Government does by giving flexible work arrangements. When you have Kim and her husband, Rocky, and one can be flexible and have good arrangements and offer choices because he works for the Government, and Kim, who works for the private sector, would be in violation of the law to participate in such a plan, it just does not make a lot of sense. 
Let me talk about another individual. Here is Leslie Langford, a secretary in Massachusetts. Her husband is a printer. They have a son who is about to have his first birthday and a daughter who is 5 years old. 
Listen to what Leslie says: 
I've been an hourly employee for the past 14 years. As a full-time employee and a mother of two young children, including an 11-month-old, time is one of the most valuable commodities in my life, and I can't afford to waste any of it. Like many of you, I find it a challenge to juggle the needs of my employer and my family. Luckily I work for a boss in a company that makes this great balancing act a little easier to manage; I strongly support the Family Friendly Workplace Act. This legislation would give millions of workers the flexibility to be with their families when they are needed most. Family friendly legislation such as this is not only desperately needed but long overdue in this country to benefit working parents and their children. 
I am sure if you were to ask Leslie Langford if she thought Government workers should have a range of benefits that private workers did not have, that there could be rules for Government workers that said it was OK to have choices about flextime and comptime, and to spend time with your family for Government workers, but it would be illegal to do that for the private sector, I suspect Leslie would say, how can that be? And the entirety of this country is saying how can that be? Why can we not allow hourly-paid workers in the private sector, who are a minority of the workers in this country, why can we not allow them some of the benefits enjoyed by public-sector workers and many of the salaried private workers across the country? 
Here is an interesting letter that came to my office from a 25-year-old single mother of twin 2-year-old daughters. Listen to this letter from a single mother of twin 2-year-old daughters. She says, 
Recently I heard of your Family Friendly Workplace Act. My employer does not allow a flexible work schedule or overtime. My understanding of this act is that I will be able to have flexibility in my work schedule giving me the opportunity to make up work hours lost because of illness in the family and doctor appointments. 
Now her employer cannot offer flexible work schedules and overtime like we have in the public sector. It is illegal. That is not a hit on her employer, it is just that we said this benefit that you might want to be able to share with your employers--you cannot do that. 
She goes on to say: 
As a 25-year-old single mother of twin 2-year-old daughters--[she has her hands full]--the Family Friendly Workplace Act would be extremely beneficial to my situation. My children were born with a congenital heart disease and they need to attend checkup appointments on a 3-month basis, with a cardiologist. These appointments have to allow a full day, since our specialist is in Springfield, MO, and especially because both of my children attend the appointments. Also, since my children have a heart disease they need special attention if they are ill. 
As a single mother, it is very difficult to lose any days financially. [I bet it is] The opportunity to make up any lost work days would be incredibly helpful. The Family Friendly Workplace Act would give me the opportunity to take time off from work, without the loss of pay because of those days my children are ill or need to attend a doctor's appointment. 
Thank you for taking the time to read my letter and your consideration of the many working parents who would appreciate such an act. Please go forward with the Family Friendly Workplace Act. 
`Please go forward.' I think that means don't filibuster. I think it means get to a vote on this act. I think it means share the same benefits with those of us in the private sector who are needed desperately by our families as you already allow for people who work for the Federal Government, the boardroom already enjoys, as salaried employees already enjoy, as the majority of workers in America already enjoy, please address the needs of those of us who are in the minority here, the hourly-paid workers in the private sector. 
Madam President, we have a great opportunity to serve the 
people of this country, to let them make choices. We have developed a framework for that choice, which is a solid framework that protects the worker. It protects the worker far more profoundly than the workers who are protected in the public system, and there are no complaints in the public system, virtually no complaints. I do not know if the Presiding Officer has ever had a Federal worker rush in and say, `This is a terrible system which gives us flextime--abolish.' I doubt, seriously, if that has been the case. 
We have built more protections into this bill for the private sector than there are for the public sector, and the 56 Senators in this body, including many on the other side of the aisle, and the lead opponent on the other side of aisle against this measure is the Senator from Massachusetts. He was a cosponsor of the measure which provided benefits to public-sector workers and a cosponsor of that measure which does not provide nearly the same protections for workers. I think it is time for us to confess that if benefits are available to the public sector they ought to be available in the private sector. 
My grandfather used to say `God is no respecter of persons.' People are the same, they have the same challenges. Public-sector workers have families and they need to be able to spend time with their families and they can with the special law that we have for them. Salaried workers need to, and the law allows that. The boardroom boys need to do that for whatever they need to do when they leave early. But salaried workers and boardroom folks and Government workers are special citizens compared to hourly workers. I think just as God is no respecter of persons, we should not be a respecter of persons that says one category of American workers has the freedom to help their family, and for others it is illegal. I think that ought to cause us all to cringe, and I think the ones that ought to be cringing the most are the ones that have provided it, voted to provide it, even without protections to the public sector who are saying now we cannot provide that to the private sector until we make it so cumbersome it would not work. 
Madam President, we have a great opportunity to help the families of America help each other. The success of this Nation is not going to be determined by what happens in Washington, DC. The success of this Nation will be determined around the kitchen table in American homes. That is where values are built. That is where we develop the kind of character that really determines the future of a country. We have to do what we can to make the homes as strong as possible, and we cannot have a group of American workers that are--they are a minority of the workers. It is clear the majority already have flexible work arrangements. We cannot have the 59 million American workers say, `Your home is not important enough. You could not make this decision. You are not bright enough.' The truth of the matter is they deserve the opportunity to have flexible working arrangements to choose compensatory time off instead of overtime if they want it, and then to change their mind if they want and to ask for the money instead. 
I think the great opportunity we have is something we can capitalize on next week. I look forward to voting on it at that time. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, last Friday, we had the privilege of beginning our discussion of the Family Friendly Workplace Act. During that debate, the Senator from Massachusetts asked an important question of the sponsors of S. 4. He put the question this way: Who's side are you on? 
I want to answer that question very clearly: We are on the side of the workers of this great nation. We are on the side of giving American workers the capacity to be better fathers and mothers, sons and daughters. We are on the side of providing a framework so workers can adequately balance the competing demands of work and family. We are on the side of giving the 59.2 million private sector hourly workers the ability to work flexible work schedules that already are enjoyed by the 66 million American workers who enjoy flexible working arrangements. 
Who's for flextime? I think it is an important question that has been asked. A Penn and Schoen survey reports that 75 percent of the public supports the choice of comptime; 64 percent of the public prefers time off to more pay, given the choice. They want to have the choice to take time off instead of receiving more pay. 
Federal workers now have the same flextime arrangements that are offered in this legislation; 74 percent say that it boosts their morale; 72 percent have more time with their families. 
It is time to provide this same benefit we provide in Government to people in the private sector. Working Woman and Working Mother magazines both endorse this particular proposal of flextime, because they believe that it is essential that we have more capacity to accommodate the competing demands of flexible working arrangements and our families. 
We are on the side of working women who have said that flexibility is what they need to meet the competing demands of work and family. We are for women who, in the Department of Labor's working women count report to the President stated that, `The No. 1 issue women want to bring to the attention of the President is the difficulty of balancing work and family obligations.' 
As I mentioned, Working Mother magazine says it supports this legislation. Working Woman magazine also supports this legislation--in its approval of this bill--the editors said that we should give women what they want and not what Congress thinks they need. 
Why should we want to give flexible work arrangements to these workers? What does it mean for their families? What does it mean for their lives? The workers enjoying the benefits can tell you. The executives in the boardroom can tell you how important it is to be able to accommodate their family needs through flexible scheduling. The salaried workers of America--supervisors, managers, stockbrokers, bankers, and lawyers can tell you how flexible working arrangements give them opportunities to leave work early when needed to watch their child play in a ball game or go talk to a parent-teacher conference, or take care of personal business that cannot be done on the weekend. 
Of course, Federal workers, and many State and local government workers, who have comptime can tell you what the benefit of being able to go home to be with their sick child instead of worrying about that child. Congress recognized the benefit of flexible work arrangements and passed the Federal Employees Flexible and Compressed Work Schedules Act almost 20 years ago. This act allowed Federal Government employees to enjoy flexible work schedules, which still are illegal for the rest of America's private sector hourly workers. That disparity between what we have provided as an opportunity for Federal workers and which we make illegal for people in the private sector is a disparity which the people of America are uncomfortable with, and they expect us to change. 
The Federal Employees Flexible and Compressed Work Schedules Act allows hourly workers to work an extra hour one week in order to work 1 hour less the following week, something that is illegal now. It allows Federal Government employees paid by the hour to work on biweekly schedules, at their option. This allows a worker to work 5 days one week, 4 days the next, and have every other Friday off. 
When surveyed about the program among the workers who have it in the Federal Government, it is interesting that Federal workers, on a 10-to-1 basis--actually, better than 10-to-1 basis--stated they like the program and they wanted it to continue. No wonder. Today, almost 20 years after giving this benefit to workers in the Federal Government, it is still illegal for private sector employers to cooperate with their employees in the same respect. 
As far back as 1945, the Congress of the United States recognized that some times, when employees work overtime, they would rather have some extra time off rather than the money. Congress recognized that no matter how much money you get for overtime, you cannot replace the time you need with your family, so they amended the Federal Employees Pay Act to allow Federal Government employees the choice between being compensated for overtime work and being able to take time off with pay. In 1985, Congress gave the same choice to State and local government employees, in terms of comp-time opportunities. These workers can take time off with pay at a later date, instead of being paid cash for time-and-a-half overtime. 
Congress acknowledged that sometimes time is more valuable than money and that Congress is not in a place to make that decision for every worker. However, right now Congress is making that decision for private sector hourly workers. Congress is making that decision because there is no option, under the law, for employees to choose to take time off later over monetary compensation. 
Now, the squeeze on people for time has never been more 
dramatic than it is at this time. Yet some Members of Congress continue to fight giving the same option of flexible scheduling to private sector employees that we have given to Federal government employees. They fight giving compensatory time off options to private sector workers even though they supported such measures for State and local government employees just 12 short years ago. 
The Family Friendly Workplace Act would give all hourly workers this same opportunity to make such choices. 
Now, President Clinton recognized the benefits of flexible work schedules himself when he directed the use of flexible work arrangements for executive branch employees. On July 11, 1994, he said:  
Broad use of flexible working arrangements to enable Federal employees to better balance their work and family responsibilities can increase employee effectiveness and job satisfaction while decreasing turnover rates and absenteeism. 
It sounds like the President was endorsing the concept. I agree with his statement. I urge him to be on the side of the rest of the workers, not just the Government workers of America. I urge him to join us in saying that all hourly paid workers in America should have this opportunity to cooperate with their employers to work for comptime off instead of paid overtime when they prefer comptime off. 
It is important to note that this legislation would impose taking time off on no one, and anyone, even if they made a choice to take time off, could later convert that to paid time merely by saying so. The bill provides that second choice. 
I think it is important for us to say whose side are we on. I think we are on the side of the private sector, hourly workers in this country. Everyone agrees that flexible work arrangements have been good for Federal employees, for salaried workers, for State and local workers in terms of comptime provisions. Every study that has ever been done on the subject concludes that these arrangements are beneficial to workers. 
So why is that group of hard-working Americans, the laborers of this Nation who work on an hourly basis--the store clerks, the mechanics, the factory workers, the clerical workers, baggage handlers, gas station attendants--why are they denied the opportunities for this benefit? Could it be that the Congress has the arrogance to decide that no worker could make such a choice for himself, that these workers are incapable? 
I believe that is outrageous. We should no longer say, `You cannot make this decision, we must make it for you.' We should say to these workers, you have the same capacity and right to cooperate with your employer to make decisions about time off and about flexible working arrangements and about scheduling as do the Federal workers and workers at State and local governmental entities. 
That is whose side we are on. Everyone in the culture, other than hourly workers, now has a real shot at flexible working arrangements and compensatory time. The boardroom has it. When the boss goes to play golf on Friday afternoons, he knows of the value of flextime. It is high time, if the boss is capable of doing that, he should at least be able to cooperate with employees who need to spend time with their family to provide such opportunities for hourly workers, as well. 
So I ask the opponents of this legislation, whose side are you on? Are you on the side of working women who sit at their desk worrying about a sick child because they cannot afford to take time off from work without pay, while their salaried coworkers leave for their sons' soccer games? Are you on the side of working men who pack their lunch every day and go to work only to go home to look at pictures of their child's award assembly, pictures which show that the business executives were proudly at the side of their children while his child accepts the award? 
Are you on the side of Christine Kordendorfer who wanted the option of occasionally taking her overtime compensation in the form of time off rather than pay to care for her growing family and take care of her health in the last stages of her pregnancy? Are you on the side of Arlyce Robinson who came in to testify that she wants 
to take some time off as a result of flextime, so she can participate in her four grandchildren's extracurricular activities? Or are you on the side of the special interests? Are you on the side of the organizations designed to represent the interests of America's workers, who just this Sunday began running ads opposed to this legislation? 
Let me just say I was stunned when those organizations, which purport to be helping American workers, began running television ads against this legislation. The television ads were replete with misrepresentation. Here is the text of the ad: `Big business is moving to gut a law protecting our right to overtime pay. If they win, employers could pay workers with time off instead of money.' That is simply false, that the employer would have a unilateral right. As a matter of fact, it takes a request by the employee in order for that to happen. They say that the choice will be up to employers. They say that there are no real safeguards to keep employers from pressuring workers to accept time off or to telling them when to take the time off. 
The fact of the matter is the bill itself contains safeguards that are substantial. The bill provides that there can be no coercion, either direct coercion or indirect coercion. I will read from the bill, line 14 on page 15: `An employer that provides compensatory time off under paragraph 2 to an employee shall not directly or indirectly intimidate, threaten, coerce or attempt to intimidate, threaten or coerce any employee for the purpose of,' and then it goes on, `including interfering with the rights of the employee to use accrued compensatory time off in accordance with this law, or requiring, threatening or coercing them in terms of requiring the employee to use compensatory time off.' When you go to the definition provided in the law about intimidation and coercion, either direct or indirect, you find out that relates to conferring a benefit or denying a benefit. 
Now the Senator from Massachusetts has repeatedly said employers would be free to offer benefits like overtime work and extra pay, which he categorizes as a benefit to those who would choose one form or another of compensation. The bill itself unmistakably challenges the charges levied in the AFL-CIO spots against this matter. 
This ad says, `You could work up to 40 additional hours in a week before qualifying for overtime.' Up to 40 additional hours in a week before qualifying for overtime, suggesting that an employer could make an employee work an 80-hour week. That is a total falsehood. To do that, to say that, knowing this bill does not provide that, is to lie. 
It is important for us to know that the real provisions of this bill outlaw specifically direct and indirect coercion. They outlaw intimidation. They outlaw the promise of a benefit, or the conference of a benefit to an individual to shape or to otherwise distort the decisionmaking that is voluntary, and it is supposed to be voluntary and guaranteed to be voluntary under this bill. 
I think it is shameful that the AFL-CIO would seek to impair the ability of hourly workers in this country to have the benefit. It is the same kind of flexibility that workers at the salaried level, at the boardroom, at the management level, at the supervisory level, have long had. It is sad--twisted, that these ads began running on Mother's Day. Frankly, the best Mother's Day present we could have given to the United States of America would have been flexible working arrangements that would have made possible mothers spending more time with their families, fathers spending more time with their families, fathers and mothers spending more time with each other and their children. On the day set aside to recognize the valuable contributions that mothers make in our society, the labor lobby was beginning a campaign opposing this bill rather than embracing a change that would enhance the lives of mothers across this great land. 
Rather than supporting public policy to make workers' lives easier, the labor lobby found out that the Members on the other side of the aisle recognize how important it is to give American workers these options. The labor lobby realized that Congress is going to work together to ensure America's families a brighter future, so the labor lobby interests in Washington took money, paid out of the pockets of hard-working Americans--it is from the very workers who would benefit from these scheduling options--yet they are spending the worker's money on ads opposing this legislation. These ads are a lie. These ads were strategically targeted to those Members on the other side of the aisle who have expressed an interest in working with us on this issue. 
When I first introduced this legislation back in 1995, the labor lobby ran similar ads in my State. However, the ads backfired as their lies were exposed. As concerned constituents called my office, they found out the truth about the legislation. Many of them told me not to listen to the voice of the opposition coming from the labor lobby. They told me that, as workers, they were interested in this kind of flexibility. They told me that these scheduling options would enhance their lives. They recognized the fact that the labor lobby should be leading this fight, leading the charge to help get workers more scheduling options. In fact, these constituents resented the fact that the labor lobby in Washington had abandoned their traditional promoting of workers' interests. 
Knowing that some of this body's strongest opponents of this bill supported these flexible scheduling options for Federal Government workers makes me wonder whose side they are on. Knowing that just 12 years ago these same opponents not only supported comptime options for State and local government employees, but cosponsored the legislation, I wonder whose drum they are marching to now. Is it the drumbeat of the American worker who needs to have the opportunity for flexible scheduling? Or is it the cadence that is being called by the labor union leaders in Washington? I wonder whose side they are on when there are much greater protections in this bill than the bills they have supported in the past. 
This bill is replete with protections for workers that are not included in the bill that is providing the same framework of options for Federal employees. Under the legislation giving State and local government workers comptime options, cosponsored by the opponents, comptime can be made a condition of employment. It can't be a condition of employment here. There is no protection of a worker against coercion. Under this legislation coercion or even attempted coercion would be a violation of the law. We have rules against coercion and intimidation. State and local government agencies can force the employee to use their comptime when it is convenient for the agency, even though that practice has been successfully challenged in some courts. That is the provision they allowed in the bill they passed for State and local governments. We have protections against that happening in this bill. 
Last but not least, in the bill that they sponsored and passed for State and local government authorities, there were absolutely no cash-out provisions for the workers. The bill that is before us allows a worker who has said, `I will take my time in comptime,' any time prior to taking the time off with pay, later on, can say, `No, I would like the money, the time and a half overtime. I will be working to gain additional hours later.' So the worker has a choice in the first instance to say, yes, I would like to have some comptime or not and work time and a half--that is the worker's choice. It can't be imposed on him, by the terms of the legislation, with a stiff penalty. 
A second choice is an option of the worker. At any time prior to taking the time off, the worker can say, `I changed my mind. I would like to have the money.' That is not an option under legislation cosponsored by opponents of this bill. That is not a protection that was included by those who sponsored the measure for State and local governments. They didn't have that protection there. We have it here. Further, there is another protection. At the end of every year, these hours have to be cashed out if they are not taken in this bill. Were those protections in the items sponsored by those who oppose this bill for State and local workers? Not on your life. They are demanding a much higher standard here because they are marching to the beat of a different drum. 
I submit to you that it is important to know whose side we are on in this legislation. I say it is time that we be on the side of American workers and their families. For a long enough time we have been on the side of those individuals whose effort is made in Government. For the last 20 years, we have had these kinds of 
flexible arrangements. Federal Government workers enjoy using them at a 10-to-1 rate. They say these schedules improve their morale and give workers more time to spend with their families. Last week, they interviewed working mothers in the United States of America, and 81 percent of them said flexible working arrangements would be very important. Yes, that is whose side are we on? 
Now, those who oppose this call this a `paycheck reduction act.' I don't know how they can call this the paycheck reduction act with a straight face, because there answer it to create more unpaid leave. They say we should not do this, we should expand family and medical leave. Family and medical leave is nothing more than the right to take time off without pay. Here we have a flexible working arrangement proposal which would give people the right to take time off with pay. I think the American people want to have time off with pay. So who's side are we on? 
Let's go to the statistics from the Family and Medical Leave Commission report. The Family and Medical Leave Commission report says what happens when people take time off without pay--which is really the way you reduce your paycheck, by taking time off without pay. Here is what happens: Twenty-eight percent of all the people who took time off had to make ends meet by borrowing money. This is from the report of the Commission on Family and Medical Leave. Senator Dodd chaired this Commission. The Commission reported that 28.1 percent had to borrow money; 10.4 percent of the people who took time off under family and medical leave went on welfare in order to accommodate the reduction in pay; 41.9 percent said they had to put off paying bills. The opponents of this legislation are just offering more additional leave without pay, so that another 40, 41, or 42 percent of the people have to go without paying their bills, or another 10.5 percent will have to go on welfare, or close to 30 percent will have to go out and borrow money. 
Whose side are we on? How can you call this the paycheck reduction act, which would provide individuals the opportunity to take time off without taking the pay cut? They could use comptime or take time off by using flextime. It just is beyond me to think that we would reject this opportunity for Americans to spend time with their families. It is beyond me that we would reject this opportunity to give Americans time to accommodate their needs outside the workplace by taking comptime off or using flextime and still get paid for it only to have the other side allege that this is a paycheck reduction act. I cannot believe that after calling this bill the paycheck reduction act, that they can claim the real solution to this problem is to put more people in the position where, according to the Family and Medical Leave Commission, 28.1 percent of them had to borrow money, 10.4 percent had to go on welfare, and 41.9 percent had to say to creditors, `I am not going to be able to pay you.' This isn't what Americans want. No wonder 75 out of 100 people in this culture say we really want more flexible working arrangements. 
Now, I just add that nothing in this measure impairs the ability of anyone to take time off under family and medical leave. That time is still available. This doesn't abolish family and medical leave. Every single hour of family and medical leave that exists--if a person prefers to take time off with a pay cut, they will be able to use that and there will be times when they may have to. This is a different set of options. 
This bill doesn't say we will no longer have family and medical leave. It is not incompatible with it. It doesn't outlaw it. People will be able to, if they need or want to, say, `Because I meet the conditions of the Family and Medical Leave Act, I am going to take time off.' That is appropriate. We want workers to have that choice and to add to workers another range of choices. It doesn't in any way impair their ability to choose time off under family and medical leave. That is still there. This is merely a way to say to them, if you don't find that comfortable, if you are tired of having to go on welfare and put off bills or borrow money in order to take time off under family and medical leave--you might want to try another way of doing it. Instead of being paid 
time and a half sometime when you have overtime to work, you would put it in a comp time bank, so later on, when you needed time off to be with a sick child or to go get your car license renewed and stand in that silly line at the department of motor vehicles during working hours when you normally can't do that, you could do it and you don't have to take a pay cut. 
The truth of the matter is, this is not the paycheck reduction act at all. This is the way to take time off with pay. The American people believe, I think, a lot of things and, given the amount of misinformation, I guess that is expected. But they will not believe that compensatory time off is taking a pay cut. If you earn time and a half as a result of working some overtime and you are going to take time off the next week and still get paid for it, that means you get time off without a pay cut, not that you get time off with a pay cut. So I think it is important for us to understand that. 
The Senator from Massachusetts thinks that there are tremendous opportunities for abuse, in the event we would average the work week over 80 hours instead of 40 hours and only at the option of the worker--only with the approval of the worker. He talks about the potential abuse of an employer choosing one person as opposed to another person for overtime. Yet, he lauds the current system. I guess his point is that if they want somebody to work overtime on Monday, they can say, `Who will work it tonight and take a couple hours off on Friday afternoon?' He thinks that is OK as long as it is done within 1 week. But over a 2-week period it is somehow a great threat. Employers would be abusive in a 2-week stretch, but not in a 40-hour stretch. 
Get serious. The truth of the matter is that we ought to understand that, where there are abuses, we ought to have strict, tough enforcement, and I think we can agree on that. We have doubled the penalty for abuses under this law. But to make it illegal for an individual to take an hour off on Friday and make it up the next Monday is inappropriate and should be changed. For the life of me, I can't believe that we should persist in that respect. We have seen how this works. We have watched it work in State and local government and in the Federal Government. We haven't been overrun by a series of complaints. We certainly haven't been inundated by a demand to change the bill. It has been in place for 19 years now and is working very well. You would think if this is the kind of thing that was abusive, we would at least have some people talking about it. 
I should emphasize, and I want to make very clear to those who would be watching, that nothing in this law mandates any worker to take time off instead of being paid time and a half for overtime. Everything in this law provides penalties for an employer who would coerce a worker into doing so. Nothing in this law provides any mandate that a worker would have to build up a bank of flextime hours. A lot of workers might like to do that. In the event they needed time off, they would not have to take a pay cut in order to get it. 
Flexible working arrangements are enjoyed by the managers, by those in the boardroom, by supervisors, Presidents, CEO's, and corporate treasurers. As a matter of fact, 66 million workers have flexible working arrangements. Only 59 million hourly paid individuals don't. It is time for us to accord to these individuals the same option of working together with their employers so they can accommodate the needs of their families and work at their jobs. It should be unnecessary to take a pay cut to be a good mom or dad in America. Flexible working arrangements would make it possible for people to meet the needs of their families without taking a pay cut.

Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I join with other Senators today in calling for the immediate release of Chinese dissident Wei Jingsheng. Wei Jingsheng exemplifies China's best aspirations for democracy, and his imprisonment exemplifies the worst of the Communist cadre that stands in the way of freedom for a nation of over one billion people. Wei's imprisonment is only one story in the broader tragedy of brutal political repression that has silenced all voices of dissent in China. In a world that is increasingly open to the benefits of freedom and the potential of free markets, the great hope is that the growth of capitalism in China will undermine Beijing's tyranny. The growth of free markets alone, however, will never replace individual acts of courage and conviction by people who defy China's Communist leadership. People willing to spend their lives for the freedom of their countrymen are mankind's true heroes. 
Mr. President, Wei Jingsheng was first imprisoned in 1979 after criticizing the Government's suppression of the Democracy Wall movement in China. Since that time, he has spent all but 6 months of the last 18 years in prison. Inside China's prison system, Wei has been a constant target for harassment and reeducation by China's prison guards. Wei has fought the daily battle to maintain his integrity, the strength of his principles, and the conviction of his beliefs. After 14 years in prison, Wei was released in 1993 and promptly began condemning the Government's horrific record of political repression. He was imprisoned again for his courage and remains in a Chinese prison today suffering from a life-threatening heart condition. 
Wei's love for his country is most clearly seen in the personal sacrifice associated with his forthright and constant stand against political tyranny. The Clinton administration could learn a lesson from Mr. Wei. In the long run, honesty is the best policy, and a forthright discussion of the atrocities being committed by Beijing will do more for a stable United States-China relationship than repeated acts of appeasement. True constructive engagement means that China is required to honor the trading agreements it signs, to avoid proliferating weapons of mass destruction, and to respect international norms for human rights. We in America need to realize what Wei recognized long ago--that the forces of justice and liberty are at work in the Chinese people just as they have been at work with such stunning effect in other nations around the world. 
In the battle between liberty and tyranny in China, I am placing my wager on the side of freedom. As Ronald Reagan said, `Democracy is not a fragile flower. Still, it needs cultivating. If the rest of this century is to witness the gradual growth of freedom and democratic ideals, we must take actions to assist the campaign for democracy.' 
Mr. President, we must ask ourselves if we are taking those actions to cultivate the flower of liberty in China. Has our commitment to human rights and civil liberties been constant? Have we defended international norms against weapons proliferation that the free people of the world have embraced for their mutual protection? One need only look at the record of political repression in China and China's arming of Iran to see that the Clinton administration is failing to press our concern for international human rights and protect our own long-term national security interests. 
American foreign policy needs to return to its most enduring and noble aspect: our willingness as a nation to sacrifice in order to help other peoples achieve the individual liberties we enjoy. When the Chinese people eventually rid themselves of tyrannical leadership and establish a democracy--and they will just as the South Koreans, the Japanese, and the Taiwanese have done before them--I hope they will be able to say that America stood by them in their darkest hours. For the Chinese people, the torch lit in Tiananmen Square is flickering. The American people want to stand by the Chinese. The Clinton administration has been less clear. The administration can stand up for America and the Chinese people by insisting that Wei Jingsheng be released.

Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate Father Thomas J. Duggan as he celebrates 50 years as a priest. I want to commend him for the outstanding service he provides to the Catholic Church in the central Missouri area. 
This historic occasion commemorates Father Duggan's labor both now and in days past. His 50 years of dedication have served many important missions: From caring for young World War II victims in the Manchester-Liverpool area of England to serving, since 1960, the diocese of Jefferson City. The high standards he has been able to maintain are a tribute to his faithfulness. As our Nation looks increasingly for moral guidance in this period of moral decay, his example provides a standard for others to follow. 
I wish Father Duggan a memorable celebration as he renews his commitment to the redemptive mission of Christ. May God bless his ministry with many more years of celebrations.

Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, families are the cornerstone of America. The data are undeniable: Individuals from strong families contribute to the society. In an era when nearly half of all couples married today will see their union dissolve into divorce, I believe it is both instructive and important to honor those who have taken the commitment of `till death us do part' seriously, demonstrating successfully the timeless principles of love, honor, and fidelity. These characteristics make our country strong. 
For these important reasons, I rise today to honor the children of Morris and Ida Miller, who will celebrate together 200 years of marriage: 
Son--Dennis and Marcella Miller, married June 7, 1946; Daughter--Eileen and Bill Keehr, married April 8, 1947; Daughter--Melda and Merwin Miller, married July 3, 1947; Son--Loren and Miriam Miller of Bois D'Arc, Missouri, married September 1, 1947. 
My wife, Janet, and I look forward to the day we can celebrate a similar milestone. These families' commitment to the principles and values of their marriage deserves to be saluted and recognized.

Mr. ASHCROFT. On behalf of the majority leader, I announce that this morning the Senate will turn to the consideration of S. 4, the Family Friendly Workplace Act. It is also hoped that the Senate will be able to return to S. 717, the IDEA, Individuals With Disabilities Education Act, legislation and complete action on that bill today. As always, all Members will be notified as to when to anticipate any rollcall votes on either of these two matters. In addition, the Senate may also consider any other legislative or executive items that can be cleared for action. I remind all Members that the Senate will be in recess from 12:30 to 2:15 for the weekly policy luncheons to meet. 
I thank my colleagues for their attention.

Mr. ASHCROFT. Thank you, Madam President. I congratulate the majority leader, Senator Lott, for helping bring this matter to a place where it can be debated and where this reform in the IDEA law can, in fact, be implemented. 
I want to thank a number of individuals who worked on this: Senator Jeffords, Senator Harkin, a wide variety of others; my colleague from the State of Missouri, Senator Bond has been active in working to make sure we had the right components. 
I am grateful that the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act Amendments of 1997, S. 717, is before us, and that we will have a chance to vote on it. I believe its passage would result in a substantial improvement in the ability to deal with disruptive individuals. The committee chairman was speaking about that just a few moments ago. Last year, I objected to the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, commonly known as IDEA, passing into law because I believed there were problems regarding discipline and discipline records of students that needed to be remedied. We worked those out at the close of the session last year in some rather arduous negotiations. 
This year I continued to work with the IDEA working group to get improvements in this regard that will make it possible for us to have safer school districts, safer school rooms, and safer environments in which students can learn and teachers can teach. 
Schools need to provide a safe learning environment. Fear is not an emotion that is consistent with a learning environment. We need, regardless of whether a student was disabled or not, to be able to have appropriate disciplinary measures that would enable us to have learning environments which would be effective. 
One of the problems that really had troubled me about our previous situation and will trouble me until it is corrected by this reform or some other, is the problem that discipline records frequently did not transfer with students from one school to the next. When a student arrives at a new campus without the discipline record, the following results can be disastrous. 
There is a case in Missouri where those results were fatal. 
My own interest in this particular area of the law was occasioned by an outrageous incident which I think shocked the conscience of virtually everyone who was aware of it. Two years ago, in my home State of Missouri, a 15-year-old young woman was at her high school. She had gone to the girl's restroom when a student with a learning disability and behavior disorder followed her into the restroom, and that was the beginning of a series of events which eventually led to her losing her life, after other unspeakable things were done. 
This incident occurred on the disabled student's second day at the school where the incident occurred. He had been transferred from another school in accordance with IDEA procedures, but when this incident occurred the officials at the school where the assault took place say they were not aware of the prior disciplinary history. 
The chronology of events leading up to this horrific incident are very troubling. 
In September 1994, the disabled student was enrolled as a ninth grade student at one high school. 
In October 1994, the disabled student exhibited uncooperative behavior in class. He was the prime suspect of vandalism in the classroom. He was suspected of urinating on objects in the classroom. 
Later that same month, the 15-year-old student was suspended pending a psychological evaluation by the district psychologist after being found in the girl's restroom. This is obviously not behavior which was unrelated to what eventually happened. 
You go through a wide variety of other chronological events which finally find the student being transferred to another school, the school at which the death of the young woman occurred, at his hands and in another restroom. But the school officials did not have the information of the previous disciplinary incidents as a part of the transfer. 
I felt it essential--I felt it would be totally inappropriate for us to allow a so-called reform to go into effect and allow students to precede their disciplinary records. The incident in Missouri demonstrates dramatically that if you precede your record by as much as 2 days it may be long enough for another student to lose his or her life. 
When the officials at the second school said that they did not know about the disabled student's disciplinary past, they were pointing to a tremendous, gaping hole in the framework for safety that we ought to provide in IDEA legislation. 
Together with Senator Bond's and Senator Harkin's help, we have been able to address this concern. I want to thank them both and the committee chairman. I am grateful. To me, it seems that this is not the kind of thing that ought to divide us; this is the kind of thing that ought to unite us. 
Whenever any of the child's records are transmitted to another school, the student's discipline record and the individual education program must be included in the transmission, so that school officials and teachers will know. They will know the past 
disciplinary records of a disabled student on his first day in the school. They will know in time to take corrective action. They will know in time to do what they can. 
This will not make all of our schools perfectly safe, but it will elevate our capacity to do what we can do and ought to do by giving us timely information. 
Moreover, when the school or school district reports a crime to law enforcement or juvenile justice authorities, copies of the student's disciplinary records must be transmitted for consideration to that authority. 
In those circumstances where the public agency initiates disciplinary procedures against a student, the agency must ensure that the disciplinary records of the child with a disability are transmitted for consideration by the person or persons making the final determination. 
We have had a disconnect between our schools and our justice system. Frankly, it is time, when serious, dangerous behavior that literally threatens the life and safety of other individuals, we do not have an artificial barrier that keeps the education agencies from talking to the criminal justice agencies or the juvenile justice agencies. This law now provides that school officials may report incidents to proper authorities. 
Not long ago, in Tennessee, a student with a disability kicked a water pipe in the school lavatory until it burst, resulting in $1,000 worth of water damage. 
When the school officials filed the petition against the child, a hearing officer ordered the school district to dismiss its juvenile court petition, a decision which was upheld by the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals. The court faulted the school for not holding a multidisciplinary meeting before initiating a juvenile court petition. 
I think it is clear that if students commit crimes that are worthy of prosecution, the school should be able to file or cause to be filed a case against the students. The practical effect of the court's ruling is that schools as a matter of law cannot unilaterally refer disabled students to juvenile court for committing acts of violence unless the student consents to such referrals. So prior to filing the case, you would have to get the consent of the parents of the disabled child or a court order. Otherwise, it would not happen. It is important that we say to students: Your disabilities will not be a license for you to violate the law or threaten the health and safety and security of others. 
This bill moves toward abolishing a double standard for individuals who claim disabilities as a shield for potentially life threatening behavior. 
Regular education students are subject to a range of disciplinary actions. Disabled students, on the other hand, even those who are violent or seriously disruptive, can stay put at their current educational environment, even if the actions are criminal. This is a double standard, and has been, and it is wrong. While we want to protect disabled students from discrimination, we also have a duty to protect other children from harm. 
Senate bill 717 now gives greater flexibility to school officials to remove dangerous students from the current school. If the child carries a weapon to school or to a school function or if the child knowingly possesses or uses illegal drugs, the bill allows school officials to move the child to an alternative interim setting for the same amount of time that a regular education student would be subject to discipline, but not for more than 45 days. 
Moving away from this double standard which had existed is a step in the right direction on the part of this bill. 
A trend developed recently under the bill, the law which we now have--which needs the reform which this bill would provide --that students would not be known as `disabled' or even claim disability until after they had committed some serious wrong; and 
after they had committed some serious wrong, to avoid penalties, they would shout: Well, I'm disabled in one way or another, either that I don't read well or that I have a kind of nervousness or even some kind of other subjective claim of disability. 
This measure, for which I am grateful, basically provides remedies that are fundamental to improving the environment for learning in the school. 
It requires that the student's disciplinary records accompany the student's individualized education program when the student transfers to another school, so no student goes to a new school without the officials at the school learning about their prior discipline history, a major achievement. 
Second, it holds children with violent or other bad behavior to the same disciplinary standards of other students when the behavior is unrelated to their disabilities. You cannot claim you are a slow reader and, as a result of being a slow reader, you have the right to assault another student. That simply will not cut it anymore. 
Third, it will allow school officials to report crimes committed by disabled students to police and juvenile authorities before meeting with the Individualized Education Program team, a special team that agrees on an education program for disabled students. 
It seems to me, especially since that committee is composed of individuals like family members of the student and others who would not allow the crime to be reported, that we need to give schools clear authority to make the communication with law enforcement officials when even disabled students have committed what is clearly a criminal activity. 
I opposed the bill last year because it did not have these safeguards. 
I want to commend the committee chairman, Senator Jeffords. I want to commend Bill Frist, the Senator from Tennessee, who has worked so hard on this. I want to thank my colleague Senator Bond, and Senator Harkin from our neighboring State of Iowa, for their work in this respect. 
I believe the bill is a substantial improvement, and when it is enacted, the young people of the United States will be safer. We have not sacrificed the rights of students with disabilities to be educated, but we have enhanced the capacity of students generally to get the kind of education they deserve. 
I thank the Chair.

Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, it is a delight to be able to come here on the day following Mother's Day to talk about the very best present for Mother's Day that the U.S. Senate could possibly give to the families of America. 
I am talking about the need for families to be able to spend time together, and that need is reflected in the fact that families are composed differently than they used to be, that instead of having just one family member earning the living for the family, many family members work. As we have an increase in the number of family members that are in the work force, it becomes more and more important for us to have the capacity for those family members to adjust and arrange their schedules in ways that allow for the right kind of time that parents can spend with their children. 
This is extremely important, because I think all of us know that the success of America depends far more on America's families and what happens there than depends on America's Government. The job of Government is to make it possible for families to do the job of families. And when people in families can do their jobs well, the jobs of those of us in Government will be much easier. 
Who among us really does not think that the crime problem is in many respects a family problem? Who among us does not really understand that the welfare problem is really in many respects a family problem? Who among us does not understand that if we would really have and maximize and increase and enhance the capacity of families to work together as families that we would not elevate substantially the way in which we live in the United States? 
That is why the Family Friendly Workplace Act, Senate bill 4, S. 4, is on the top of our agenda. That is why it is one of our priority measures. That is why we debated the bill substantially in the last several weeks. That is why on Friday we spent time talking about S. 4. And that is why S. 4 will be the topic of our debate tomorrow morning when we return to the bill. 
It is an understanding that we need strong families and that the workplace competes with the home place. We need to make sure that the laws of this country do not keep people from spending the kind of high-quality time they need to spend with each other and their children. 
It is a really big problem for families, now that two breadwinners are in the average family. But think of how much more important flexible working arrangements are when there is only one adult in the family? To be able to trade an hour on Friday afternoon or work an extra hour on Friday so you can take an hour off on Monday to see your child get an award at the school or to watch your daughter play in a soccer game or your son play in a football game in the afternoon during working times normally is a tremendous asset if we could just give people that kind of flexibility. And, you know, so many more of our children's activities are now in the afternoons. 
Arlyce Robinson, one of the individuals who testified 
before our committee, said she had four grandchildren and many of their activities are now scheduled, in the Washington, DC, area, in the afternoon because it is much safer to have activities during daylight hours. She cannot see them. She wants to see them. She wants to support them. She wants to reinforce their positive behavior. She needs to be able to have the flexible working arrangements to do it. 
The family has changed. This chart shows just how things have almost totally flipped. Back in 1938, when we developed our labor laws--1938--only 2 out of every dozen--only 2 out of 12--women with school-aged children were working outside the home. Now only three such women are inside the home. So that instead of having two outside the home, we have nine outside the home. So we have had a real change. This has been a sea change. And the stresses that have come to families have really been substantial. 
Let us take a look at how times have changed. Only 2 out of 12 women worked outside the home with school-aged children; today, 9 out of 12 women with school-aged children work outside the home. 
Families are stressed. A recent poll taken in the week before Mother's Day: 91 percent of the mothers said flexible working arrangements would be very important to them. They understand, basically, on a close to 10-to-1 ratio, how important it would be. 
Interestingly enough, Federal workers have flextime. Federal workers, the ratio of their response to a study conducted about flextime in the Federal Government, at a 10-to-1 rate, they said this is a good thing. Federal workers have had this since 1978. 
As a matter of fact, it is the hourly workers of America that do not have this. The guys in the walnut boardroom, you know, the guys who take time off to play golf on Friday afternoon, they have flexible working arrangements, believe me. They do not get their pay docked every time they need to do something or want to do something. Neither does the president, the CEO, the treasurer or the manager or the supervisor. They are salaried employees, and all salaried employees have flexibility in this country. 
Of course, all of the Government workers, even the Government workers for the Federal Government who work by the hour, they have flextime and flexible working arrangements. 
State government workers all have comptime, as was granted to them by the U.S. Congress, the ability to say instead of taking overtime pay, when we want to, we should have the option to take some time off. 
We have left the hard-working, laboring people of the United States as a group of second-class citizens who do not have the capacity for flextime and comptime. They ought to have it. They are in a minority. They are the only ones left. And, frankly, it is not fair, because they have the responsibilities of being at home. Their families are stressed, just like other families are stressed. Federal workers already have it. It is time that the stressed families of hourly paid workers have it as well. 
We enacted laws making it illegal to add an hour to one week in return for taking an hour off the next week in 1938. The Fair Labor Standards Act was a great step forward for protecting workers. However, that protection now has become a real hindrance. As a matter of fact, it has been more difficult in recent times for families to meet their own needs. They are endorsing the idea of flexibility in work schedules in overwhelming numbers. 
Now, there are some things that we do in order to give people the ability to accommodate their families. We have, for most hourly workers, this ability to take what is called family and medical leave. That came from the Family and Medical Leave Act, referred to as FMLA. It is the ability to take time off for a sick child, but you have to do that without pay, so that when you take time off you have a pay cut. 
Now, most people find that to be very discomforting. They are working and taking time away from their families because they need the money to support their families. They have a lot of tension financially which drives them into the work force. That elevates the tension socially. And yet in order to accommodate this social tension, when your family has a need, the current law says you have to take a pay cut. That means you help resolve one tension but you increase another tension. It is like jumping out of the proverbial frying pan into the fire. 
What flextime, what the Family Friendly Workplace Act would do, basically it would say if you worked a few extra hours from time to time that you and your employer agreed on, you could put those in a bank, in an account of hours, so that if you needed to take time off you would not have to have your paycheck cut for taking time off. If your child gets sick, you can say, `OK, I have an hour in the savings bank,' and instead of being stressed financially by helping your child, you can take the time off without taking a pay cut. I think when we have an opportunity to do that, we ought to make that available. Someone might say, well, that is pretty risky, tampering with the laws of the 1930's. The truth of the matter is we would not impose this on anyone. We would give people this opportunity to ask for this and to choose this. 
Second, if you put the hours in the bank and later decided you wanted the money under the law, you could ask for the money and the employer would have to give you the money. 
Third, Federal employees have had this for the last 19 years. We know how this system works. It works extremely well to meet the needs of families. When interviewed by the General Accounting Office--which is not a political arm of Government; it is a bunch of accountants--they said, `How do you like this?' At a rate of better than 10 to 1, the Federal employees said, `This is great, the best thing since sliced bread. This works.' It is something that the boardroom folks have, the boss has, the managers have it, the supervisors have, all the Government workers in Federal Government have, all the State workers have comptime provisions in their legal framework, but it is against the law to give hourly working people that kind of benefit. That is a law that, really, is against the hourly working people, not for them. We need to make sure we have the right safeguards in the law to make sure employers do not abuse that. We have done that. We have doubled the penalties for normal overtime violations so that if there are coercive activities--either direct or indirect--as specified in the bill, then serious penalties are occasioned. 
I believe this bill, which we will be back discussing and debating, will be the official agenda of the Senate. We will be on the bill tomorrow morning. It is a bill in favor of the American people. It is a bill that is in favor of the 59 million hourly wage people in the country. We have about 130 million employees in the country, and a majority of them, the vast majority of them, have the capacity for flextime. It is that hourly wage group that does not. It is time they had the same kind of flexibility. Their families are just as important to the future of America as the families of the boardroom folks are, as the families of the managers, the owners, as families of Government workers. It is time we allowed them to do that. 
I believe we will provide a bill that the President will want to sign. The President of the United States campaigned on flextime. He understands this need. Mrs. Clinton has spoken clearly on the need for flextime and the importance of having time with children. The President mentioned it in his State of the Union Message, specifically calling for flextime, the ability to have flexible working arrangements and schedules. The President, when he found that there was a narrow niche, a narrow sliver, a small group of Federal employees that did not have it when he took the Office of President, he extended it by Executive order. So there is no question in my mind that he really knows the value, the Clinton family understands the need of other families in this situation. Although the President does know that the only organized opposition, really, the only opposition to this whole proposal, has been through labor leaders of organized labor. I do not say organized labor generally, because so many working people want this. If you talk to the working mothers, it is almost a 10 to 1 ratio in favor 
of this. I believe we will have an opportunity to send to the President of the United States a bill which he will want to sign. 
My question is whether or not somehow his sense of indebtedness to the labor leaders in Washington, DC, organized labor leaders, will in some measure inhibit his capacity to sign something that would be good for the American people. I hope it will not. He should understand, and I think he does, there are 28.9 million hourly paid working women in America. They need the relief of flexible working arrangements so they can spend time with their families, as well as accommodate the demand of the workplace. 
I close with this point. One of the reasons we have prosperity in America, the standard of living we enjoy, is so many women are working and doing such a great job. I do not think there is a culture anywhere in the world that can match the United States in terms of the contribution that working women make to the way we live and the way we want to live, the way we aspire to live. We need these women to be productive and contributors to the marketplace as we are competing against the rest of the world, but while we need them, we owe them, and we owe them the opportunity to spend time with their family. That could be achieved if we had a reasonable approach to directing work arrangements and allowing them to make choices. 
Never in this bill is there an opportunity for an employer to impose upon a worker the requirement to work in return for time off, instead of working in return for pay. Whenever a person says, `I would like to work for comptime,' that means they will be able to take time off and still get pay, and if they decide they want to take time off and still get pay and before they take the time off they change their mind and they want the time-and-a-half pay, they get the time-and-a-half pay. This is a measure that is designed to give workers choice and to give them the opportunity to do what we need for them to do the most, which is to be the kind of parents they ought to be. 
It is not like the Family and Medical Leave Act, which says when you take time off it is without pay. This is the capacity of Americans to be good parents and not take a pay cut. We should not, as a Government, say to people that in order to be a good parent you have to take a pay cut. We should develop a capacity for flexible working arrangements in this country which allows parents to be what they need to be and what we need them to be, and that is good parents, and to do so in the context of providing for their families. 
I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. ASHCROFT. Thank you, Mr. President. 
I am pleased we have had the opportunity to begin the debate on the Family Friendly Workplace Act. The Senator from Massachusetts has referred to this act as a hoax, and indicated that it would not be in the best interest of workers. Frankly, it is troublesome to me to find that kind of disconnect with what is happening to workers, because I have letters from people who are having a tough time making time for their families and making time for their jobs. These workers want us to address this important issue. Particularly, mothers--who are in the work force in increasingly high numbers--need to have flexibility so in order to meet the needs of their families, financially by being in the workplace, and emotionally by being able to spend time with their families. 
There are a couple--as a matter of fact, there are a whole series of things that the Senator from Massachusetts stated which are substantially inaccuracies as it relates to the bill. 
The suggestion, for instance there is no employee choice. This bill is predicated upon employee choice. There is no ability of any employer to impose anything on any employee contained in this bill. The provisions of this bill are available only--only and exclusively--when the employee agrees. If the employer so much as suggests that the employee work overtime--the employee would be entitled to overtime compensation at one-and-one-half times the employees regular rate of pay. Any time the employer goes to an employee and asks for additional time beyond the 40-hour week it is automatically overtime. 
The difference in this bill is that the employee would have the chance to say, `You know, I would like to take time-and-a-half sometime instead of being paid overtime for this work because I'm having such a tough time spending enough time with my family.' That is employee choice. 
The Senator went through a long and rather arduous explanation about how that was not employee choice. The truth of the matter is, if the employee--at any time after the employee has opted for compensatory time--if the employee decides, `well, I think I want the money instead, the second level of employee choice arises.' That is, the choice to change his or her mind. 
Employees are not just endowed with the choice originally to ask for compensatory time. If an agreement has been reached that compensatory time will be allowed, then a second option comes to the employee, the option to say, `Well, I don't think I really wanted to take the time off after all. Give me the money.' You still have the money. 
This suggestion that there are no employee choices in this bill is simply not borne out by the bill itself. 
For instance, if the employer asks that the extra time be worked, if there is extra time that comes as a result of a request by the employer, or if the request is initiated by the employer, it is automatically overtime. 
One interesting case that came up really stunned me. During the winter of 1996, the Washington, DC area had a big, heavy snowstorm. A woman named Arlyce Robinson spoke before the Labor and Human Resources and testified that she was called on a Friday morning and told not to come to work due to the heavy snowfall. Therefore, Arlyce, along with all of her coworkers missed 1 day of work and suffered a 20-percent decrease in her salary. She and a couple hundred other people at her plant wanted to have that money. They needed the money--their fuel bills were going up because of the severe winter. They wanted, during the following week, to add 1 hour and 40 minutes a day to their work schedule so they could make up for the Friday missed. The current laws make it illegal for the employer to allow them to work that extra hour and 40 minutes on each of the days the next week in order to make up for the time lost on Friday. 
The Senator from Massachusetts is correct, these people are the poorest of the people that are working by the hour. They are suffering financial stress. If the employer is willing to let them work additional hours to make that up, what does the law say? The law says it is illegal, we cannot allow that to happen. Our bill would allow the employer to let that happen, allow the employer to say you can make up time or you can make up time in advance. You can bank flexible hours in order to ameliorate these stresses--these stresses that attend the work of the most needy of the workers. 
The Senator from Massachusetts kept asking the rhetorical question, who are we for? I tell you who we are for; we are for the working people here. Guess who already has flextime? The guys in the boardroom already have flextime. The guys with the paneled offices already have flextime. They never have to worry if they need to take time off to watch their son or daughter get an award at the high school. 
When Arlyce Robinson came to talk to us about this bill, she said she needed to have time off during the day occasionally to attend those responsibilities of her four grandchildren. She said, `More and more, the extracurricular activities are in the daytime because it is safer for people to go to extracurricular activities in the daytime, safer for the kids if they are scheduled in the day,' and she wanted to see one of her grandchildren play in sports or do other things. 
The guys in the boardroom with the walnut-paneled walls can take the time off. The supervisors paid on salary can take the time off. The folks who work for the Federal Government have flextime already. We have flextime for far more people than those who do not. There are about 79 million people in this country who are eligible for flextime while the people at the bottom end of the ladder--people who need to be able to spend time with their kids--who are trying to make ends meet, families where both parents have to be in the work force in order to have enough money to make ends meet. This group who does not have access to flexible work arrangments includes a large number of the most stressed people in this culture--the single parents who must spend the time working, they are the ones who desperately need flexible schedules. 
Whose side are we on? I tell you whose side we are on. We are not on the side of the guys who already have it. Sure, we are glad that Federal workers have flextime. If you interview the Federal workers, they tell you how well it works. Federal workers interviewed by the General Accounting Office--this is not a polling firm going out to get one result or another. The chairman of the committee, who has been so good in pushing this bill forward, knows the General Accounting Office is a governmental agency that just wants to get to the facts and the truth. They 
interviewed the hourly workers at the Federal Government who have basically the same components of this plan. What do they say? Mr. President, by a 10-to-1 ratio they say, `This is great. We like this. We want this.' That is whose side we are on. 
The Senator from Massachusetts suggests that the 40-hour work week is abolished. I do not know how you can read this bill and come to the conclusion that the 40-hour week is abolished. Everything in this bill is voluntary. Anyone who does not want to agree--and it takes the agreement of both the employer and the employee--cannot be forced to working such schedules. 
The single most popular program for Federal workers, the 2.9 million Federal workers in the country that enjoy this provision, is the ability to take a weekday off every other week so every other Friday or every other Monday is off. 
That means if they need to take a child to a doctor or schedule things, if they want to go fishing, hunting, or take a day of vacation with their children, it is something they can do. It is something they can do on their own without taking a pay cut. 
This does not empower employers to demand it. It empowers workers, if they can cooperate with their employers, to get it. No employer can mandate any provision in this bill. It is that simple. If the employer is not cooperating to give people time off the way they would otherwise want the time off, what is the choice of the worker? The worker can immediately say, `Give me the money.' This bill allows the worker to cash in any of the banked benefits or compensatory time benefits at any time. 
In case someone is worried--we do not want anything that would not protect the worker. We have gone to great lengths, we have doubled the penalties for abuses under the bill. We have said that at any time the employee wants the money instead of the time, they can automatically call for it. We have said that at the end of the year if the time has not been taken, give them the money. In every respect, any time this is not working, the current law prevails, the money is paid at regular overtime rates, individuals fall back to the normal 40-hour week. This is a voluntary measure. 
Some strange suggestion was made that because this was not exactly like family and medical leave, it did not have merit. I would like to ask those who would make that argument, like the Senator from Massachusetts, whether he believe that this abolishes family and medical leave? Every benefit that is available to people under family and medical leave will continue to be available to them. After this is enacted, after this is signed by the President, people will still have family and medical leave, so that all of the obligations available to them under that setting and in that situation still will be available to them. This is simply an additional way for people to accommodate the needs of their families. 
I do not think we would be getting the kind of letters we are; I do not think we would have Working Women's magazine, Working Mother magazine say, `Get this done.' I do not think newspapers like the New York Times, the Chicago Tribune would be endorsing this proposal. I do not think we would have people asking us to do something if family and medical leave were all that people wanted. This bill does not repeal or adjust or otherwise diminish family and medical leave. It simply says there are flexibilities that workers need in addition to that. 
There are differences between this and family and medical leave, and one of those differences is something that hard working Americans will really appreciate. The biggest single difference between this measure and family and medical leave is that family and medical leave has people taking time off without pay. I think most people would rather try to plan their schedules and develop the capacity to make up for things in advance so they did not have to take a pay cut every time they wanted to take some time off. I think that the people of the United States of America really want to be good moms and dads without taking a pay cut, because in a very strange way, whenever you take the pay cut, you impair your ability to be the kind of parent you want to be. Most people have 
both spouses working so they can meet the financial needs of their families. If meeting the needs of your family for time means you have less capacity to meet the need of your family for finances, it creates undue stress. This is a stress reduction matter. I am surprised that the Senator would indicate that somehow this competes with family and medical leave. This adds to the options of American workers. 
Sure, they are different. There are different standards for this iteration or that iteration. The primary difference is that this does not require you to take a pay cut to take time off. Family and medical leave simply requires you to take a pay cut to take time off. 
It is appropriate we will be getting this bill to the floor. We will have the full range of debate on it. It is important we be engaged on this matter. I think it is important we understand that workers need something more than what we already have. Workers are feeling this tension. 
I look at today's Washington Times, and it contains an article that said `Moms of Today Don't Think They Are Doing As Good As Our Own Moms, Poll Says.' I think we all sense the stresses of modern day life. It recounts a study that says a substantial number of moms today just feel that `We really have a lot of juggling to do and unfortunately * * * our children suffer because of what we have to do * * * to maintain a living.' `We are doing a worse job than our mothers did.' Well, I think mothers are doing a valiant job, but people are feeling the pressure. 
The study also found more than half the mothers who worked full time were burdened with time pressures and trying to balance motherhood with other aspects of their lives. `Some of the pressures cited by mothers include trying to be in three places at once, making sure they get everything done without being stressed out and having enough time for themselves.'

Mr. ASHCROFT. This sensitivity is not just felt in polls. It is felt in the lives of real individuals. With this Mother's Day weekend in view, I will take you through the life of a mother who came to testify on this bill. Her job was incredible. People talk about overtime work. As far as I am concerned, there is not a mother in the United States of America who does not work overtime. I have observed only two mothers very closely, my own mother, and my wife, who is the mother of our three kids, and working overtime is an understatement. I am sure the chairman would agree. It is work all the time. I think it is important to provide some flexibility. 
Let me give a little schedule out of the life of Christine Korzendorfer, an executive assistant in a TRW's northern Virginia office, is one of the individuals who came to talk about the need for flexible working arrangements. This is Christine's picture here. 
She gets up at 5:30 in the morning and gets herself together by showering and dressing. About 6:30, she gets up her 2-year-old son, Ryan, to give him breakfast, yogurt and bananas. 
Those were the days, I remember them, and I am sure the Senator from Vermont remembers them. It is one thing to coax a child to eat, but if the child decides he is not going to eat, it can ruin your whole day. You better be well protected or poorly dressed. You are at the child's mercy if he decides not to eat. 
At 6:30 you put the yogurt and bananas together, feed the toddler, and you may have to bathe the toddler. I know Christine says she bathes the kid before he goes to bed at night, but sometimes a 2-year-old has to be bathed again in the morning. 
Then the 14-year-old in the household wakes up. So then from 7 to 7:15--after getting up at 5:30, a 6:30 feeding, getting up the 2-year-old and helping the 14-year-old get things together. At 7 or 7:15 in the morning, strap Ryan into the baby seat of the van and drive to the day care center. Of course, you have to leave your 14-year-old, at that point, with the right instructions and asking for the personal discipline on her part to get ready to go to junior high. Christine gets to the day care center and has to partly undress the kid she just dressed a short time ago. He is anxious about leaving his mom. Christine has to start distracting him, showing him something or another that might capture his attention, quiet him as much as possible before kissing him goodbye and sneaking out. And sometimes the sneak doesn't work. We have all been there, where the child clings. We have all had the scratches on the back of our necks or on our faces from a child who simply doesn't want to be left. Then, from 7:15 from 8 a.m. Christine drives to work. At work, she immediately is thrust into the day, sifting through, organizing. 
For Christine, an easy workday is from 8 to 4. She loves her job. Her coworkers really are another family to her. She works hard to keep them doing what they need to do, and she works hard to keep from being burned out. She eats lunch on the job, with ordered-in food from a fast-food chain. At 3:30, her daughter, Jennifer, the 14-year-old, gets home from school before Christine even leaves work. So she tries to get a call from her daughter. She would like to be home, but she cannot be, so she is sort of making up. The stress is there, but she is at least checking by phone. On the easy day, she drives home between 4 and 5 o'clock, picks up Ryan, straps him back into the seat. Sometimes--very often--she has to work overtime, but when she doesn't, she arrives home at 5 o'clock. Everybody wants a snack right off the bat. They are too impatient to wait for dinner. The snacks come first and then the dinner begins. Her husband plays with Ryan in the yard; dinner is at 6. Then Ryan wants to go back outside and play while mom is cleaning up the kitchen. Christine bathes Ryan, maybe, for a second time during the day, and everybody tries to go to bed in time to get up again at 5:30 in the morning. 
All the errands are run on the weekends, which really makes it tough because, in that setting, the time we would normally have for repose, relaxation, and recovery is spent grocery shopping, clothes shopping, running around. The one thing that interrupts the schedule is when the junior high student needs the assistance of a parent with homework, and it often means that a couple extra hours are injected. 
According to Christine, her daughter Jennifer had to have oral surgery a couple of weeks ago. Christine had to take unpaid leave on Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday afternoon to take care of Jennifer at home. And because Christine has a lot of overtime--we have said that her short days are the 8 to 4 days--and she would very much like to have been able to spend comptime or flextime for those 3 days. However, since those options are not available, Christine had to take a 3-day pay cut for her to be the kind of mother she wants to be. This is one very conscientious woman. I might add that Christine and her husband now are expecting their third child. So this pressure is not likely to be abated. During her testimony before the Labor and Human Resources Committee's Employment and Training Subcommittee hearing, Christine asked the members to hurry up and pass the legislation so she could bank some comptime to use at the end of her current pregnancy. Mr. President, if we hurry, we might just make it. 
The point I want to make is that, as we approach this Sunday when we honor mothers who don't work just overtime, they work all the time, we have a responsibility to do what we can to give them at least the category of flexibility that the majority of workers in our culture enjoy. The boardroom enjoys flextime options; the managers enjoy flextime--the ones not paid by the hour, and most of them are not--Government workers enjoy flextime and comptime, and, frankly, it is time for the working mothers of America 
to enjoy a comptime option. 
Harvard economist Juliet Schor has chronicled the crazy schedules that Americans are put through in a 1992 book called `The Overworked American.' She found that between 1969 and 1987, men worked an average of 98 more hours per year at the end of the period than they did at the beginning of the period. Here is the staggering statistic: during that same period--between 1969 and 1987--the average woman worked 305 more hours at the end of the period per year than she did at the beginning of the year. 
Not only are we working more, but the demands that we have for our families are not less; they may be more. There are more threatening influences on our families, I believe, in today's culture than there have been in the past. The need for direct parental involvement is something I believe the Senator from Massachusetts and I can agree to. I think kids do respond to direct parental involvement. He cited the fact that children actually recover faster from illness when there is more time with parents. I can agree to that. We need to provide a way for parents to do that, and we should not ask them to take a pay cut in order to be able to spend more time with their children, whether it is recovering from an illness or whether it is something else. Again, 305 additional hours, on the average, women at work in 1987 than there was in 1969. 
Working mothers are stressed. Millions of moms wake up at 6, or earlier, in the morning to hustle their kids out of bed, make breakfast and lunch before sending the kids to the bus or dropping them off at day care. After the hectic morning hours, they show up for work ready to meet the demands of the day. We enjoy a great standard of living, a high level of productivity in the United States of America. There are lots of reasons for it, but one of the primary reasons we have the standard of living we do is that women work in the marriage. When the Fair Labor Standards Act went into effect in the 1930's, only one out of six mothers of school-aged children was in the work force. But today, about 75 percent--or 9 out of 12--of the mothers of school-aged children are in the work force. There is a benefit to the culture in that. We have a high standard of living. As a nation, we are competitive and productive. To think that somehow we can ignore the needs of the people who are the source of that productivity and competitive standing is just to have our heads in the stand. 
After 8 or 9 hours of work, women pick up the kids from some practice, or a babysitter, and go home to make dinner, sometimes with the assistance of the family, sometimes not. Often, each person in the family has a different shift, and that makes the schedule even more hectic. But there is a real challenge here. I think it is very important. The study indicates that, in addition to the 40-plus hours a week a working mom puts in on the job, the average mother adds about 25 to 45 additional hours at home. That is not just overtime, that is where we talk about the fact that women are working all the time. 
You know the problems that can exist often in the middle of a school day: a school nurse calls to announce a child is ill and needs to be picked up. Under today's labor law, a mother who takes Friday afternoon off to take her flu-stricken son home can't make up that time on the following Monday. She must suffer a pay loss for those hours. We want to correct that. She can't go to a `bank' of pre-work time and say, I have 3 or 4 hours in reserve so that I won't have to have my pay disrupted; I can go and I don't have to choose between my paycheck and my child. No one wants to do that. No one would choose their paycheck. We don't want to put people under that stress. They could just go to an account that they would have for flexible working arrangements or compensatory time, and employers who understand the value of workers are eager to cooperate with workers to help them meet the needs of their families. 
The Senator from Massachusetts made a number of remarks that, in my judgment, suggest that employers aren't eager to help employees resolve these difficulties. I think that may have been 
the case at some time in history. But there are many, many employers who are very eager to help their employees do well with both their families and on the job. As a matter of fact, Working Women magazine features the 100 best companies each year, and companies compete for this. They say, `You should work for us because we have this kind of willingness to work with you, and we should be partners in an enterprise that isn't just a business enterprise, but the enterprise of helping you be successful.' 
Well, I believe that our ability to add to the arsenal of things that can help people meet the needs of their families and the workplace is a tremendous responsibility, and we should take that responsibility seriously and we should address it. To suggest that to have flexible working arrangements means that we can't have or won't have the family and medical leave opportunity is simply wrong. To suggest that if these new arrangements aren't identical to family and medical leave, they are bad, is to ignore the fact that family and medical leave can meet one category of demand, and flexible working arrangements can meet another category of demand. And to ignore the fact that the category of need exists for flexible working arrangements is to ignore the thousands of workers that have contacted us, and to ignore the experience of people in the public sector and salaried workers and people in the boardroom who have been using flexible work approaches for a long time. 
I am very grateful to the chairman of the Labor Committee, the Senator from Vermont, and to the chairman of the subcommittee, the Senator from Ohio, for their excellent work in this respect. I look forward to the debate. 
This is not a pay reduction bill. I kind of get the idea that those who oppose this bill know that it is not, because this is a way for people to take time off without taking the pay cut. I kind of get the idea that those who oppose this bill feel like a good offense must be their best defense because, frankly, to suggest that this is a pay cut bill is to misrepresent it in terms of the thing that makes it most strong, and that is this is the ability of people to meet the needs of their families, without sacrificing their pay in order to do so. 
It is with that in mind that I look forward to the debate next week and to the ultimate passage of this measure by the U.S. Senate. It, indeed, would be the very single best Mother's Day gift that this Government could extend to the people of America. 
I yield the floor.  
Mr. HUTCHINSON addressed the Chair.

Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I am proud to join with the Senators Domenici and Wyden in introducing the Juvenile Crime Control and Community Protection Act of 1997 to reform the juvenile justice system in order to protect the public and hold juvenile offenders accountable for their actions. 
In 1994, juvenile courts handled an estimated 120,200 drug offense cases, a jump of 82 percent from 1991. Violent crime arrests among juveniles in 1995 was 12 percent higher than the level in 1991 and 67 percent above the level in 1986. 
This year, Mr. President, it seems as though incidents of juvenile violence are occurring every day and everywhere. 
In Alton, IL, two teens were gunned down--one shot twice in the face and the other shot once in the back of the head when he turned to flee--by a 15-year-old of East St. Louis who had driven 30 miles to carry out the shooting. 
In Dayton, KY, a 15-year-old killed her 5-month-old son. She was given the maximum sentence--30 days of detention. 
In Montgomery County, MD, a 14-year-old girl along with three adults were arrested for two bank robberies in Silver Spring. 
In Boston, MA, three schoolgirls--two 14-year-olds and one 15-year-old--were charged with putting knives to the throat or stomach of classmates and stealing their gold jewelry and lunch money. 
As these incidents demonstrate, the perpetrators of violence and their victims are getting younger. Similarly, gang activity is getting worse in our inner cities, suburbs, and rural communities. A 1995 nationwide survey of law enforcement agencies reported a total of 23,388 gangs, and 664,906 gang members in their jurisdiction. In comparison, a 1993 survey showed an estimated 4,881 gangs with 249,324 gang members in the United States. 
The need for juvenile justice reform is clear, especially in light of the fact that probation was the sentence handed out for 56 percent of the 1992 juvenile court cases in which the juvenile was adjudicated delinquent whether the offense was a felony or misdemeanor in nature. 
Mr. President, this bill takes substantial steps toward addressing the problems of violent juvenile offenders and the prevalence of youth gangs. The Federal Government would assist State and local efforts in dealing with the epidemic of juvenile crime by helping target the most violent and problematic offenders. 
Mr. President, the Juvenile Crime Control and Community Protection Act of 1997 would provide $1.5 billion over 5 years in incentive grants to encourage and assist States in reforming their juvenile justice systems. 
States are encouraged to revise their laws to reflect three much-needed reforms. First, juveniles age 14 or older who commit serious violent crimes--such as murder, forcible rape, aggravated assault, or serious drug offenses--should be tried as the adult criminals they are. By making sure that the punishment fits the seriousness of the crime, this proposal would deter juveniles who currently believe that the law cannot touch them. 
Second, the States are encouraged to ensure that records of juveniles under age 15, who are found to be delinquent regarding serious violent crimes and serious drug offenses, are maintained and made available to law enforcement agencies, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation, prosecutors, adult criminal courts, and appropriate school officials. 
Finally, the States are encouraged to establish graduated sanctions for juvenile offenders, ensuring a sanction for every delinquent or criminal act and that the sanctions increase in severity based on the nature of the act. The sanctions should also escalate with each subsequent delinquent or criminal act, and should include mandatory restitution to victims, longer sentences of confinement, or mandatory participation in community service. 
For States that enact such reforms, additional grant funds would be made available to implement at least 5 of 18 accountability-based practices including: record-keeping for juvenile criminals age 14 or older who commit offenses equivalent to an adult felony; increasing victims' rights concerning information about the conviction, sentencing, imprisonment, and release of their juvenile attackers; mandatory restitution to victims of juvenile crimes; public access to juvenile court proceedings; parental responsibility laws; zero tolerance for deadbeat juvenile parents; implementation of a Serious Habitual Offenders Comprehensive Action Program [SHOCAP]--a comprehensive and cooperative information and case management process for police, prosecutors, schools, probation departments, corrections facilities, and social and community aftercare services; establishment of community-wide partnerships involving county, municipal government, school districts, and others to administrator a unified approach to juvenile delinquency; antitruancy initiatives; alternative schooling for juvenile offenders or juveniles who are expelled or suspended from school for disciplinary reasons; tougher penalties for criminal street gang crimes; and the establishment of penalties for juvenile offenders who use a firearm during a violent crime or a drug felony. 
The bill would provide $200 million in formula grants, a $130 million increase over the FY1997 level for each fiscal year, FY1998 through FY2002. Under current law, states and localities must comply with several mandates to be eligible for these funds. For example, states must currently ensure that (1) no status offender may be held in secure detention or confinement; (2) juveniles cannot be held in jails and law enforcement lockup in which adults may be detained or confined for any period of time; and (3) complete sight and sound separation of juvenile offenders from adult offenders in secure facilities. 
These mandates are costly and burdensome on state and local law enforcement efforts. For example, in February of this year, I visited with law enforcement and juvenile justice officials in Kirksville, MO, a rural community in Northeast Missouri, who told me about a problem that is all too common for rural communities. A deputy juvenile officer said that local law enforcement officers were able to apprehend four Missouri 15-year-olds who had brutally murdered a Iowa farm wife in October of 1994, and were even able to secure confessions to the murder. However, the Kirksville police could not detain the murderers because the Federal law prohibits juveniles from being held in jails in which adults may be detained and Kirksville did not have secure detention facilities. 
As a result, the teens had to be detained in other Missouri facilities. Two of the teen had to be transported to Boone County, MO--100 miles from Kirksville--while the other two teens had to be taken to Union, MO, more than 200 miles away. 
The legislation introduced today would eliminate this absolute jail and lockup prohibition. If enacted, the Kirksvilles of our country would no longer have to bear additional costs in trying to find a completely separate facility in order to detain violent juvenile offenders. 
A thorough reform of juvenile justice systems must also include participation by our charitable and faith-based organizations. Government needs to rebuild civil society by fostering a partnership with charitable and faith-based organizations to promote civic virtues and individual responsibility. 
Govenrment needs to look beyond its bureaucratic, one-size-fits-all programs and give assistance to those groups toiling daily in our communities, often publicly unnoticed and virtually unaided by Government. 
For example, Teen challenge, which is headquartered in Missouri, receives little or no local, State, or Federal government financial assistance. Teen Challenge is a nonprofit, faith-based organization that works with youth, adults and families. Teen challenge has 16 adolescent programs in several states, including Florida, Indiana, and New Mexico. 
Most of the juveniles in the program has drug or alcohol problems. A large number of the adolescents have been physically or sexually abused. Almost all of them had a major problem with rebelling against authority, according to a 1992 survey of Indianapolis Teen Challenge. Thirteen percent were court-ordered placements. This same study indicated that 70 percent of the graduates were abstaining from illegal drug use. 
Mr. President, this bill would amend the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act to allow states to conduct with, or make grants to, private, charitable and faith-based organizations to provide programs for at-risk and delinquent juveniles. 
Charitable and faith-based organizations have a proven track record of transforming shattered lives by addressing the deeper needs of people, by instilling hope and values which help change behavior and attitudes. Under this bill states would be allowed to enroll these organizations as full-fledged participants in caring for and supporting juveniles who are less fortunate. 
The bill also proposes reforms to the federal criminal justice system consistent with those it encourages those states to adopt. The legislation strengthens the federal law by requiring the adult prosecution of any juvenile age 14 or older who is alleged to have committed murder, attempted murder, robbery while armed with a dangerous or deadly weapon, assault or battery while armed with a dangerous weapon, forcible rape or a serious drug offense. Repeat juvenile offenders would also be subject to transfer to adult court, if they have 2 previous adjudications for offenses that would amount to a felony if committed by an adult. 
Juvenile criminals found delinquent in U.S. district courts of violent crimes would be fingerprinted and photographed, and then the fingerprints and photograph are sent to the FBI to be made available to the same extent as that of adult felons to law enforcement agencies, school officials, and courts for sentencing purposes. 
In addition, the bill would clearly express the intent of Congress with regard to special education students who commit criminal acts at school or school-related events. Earlier this year, the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals, in Morgan v. Chris L., upheld the ruling of a district court that the Knox County Tennessee Public School violated the procedural requirements of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) by in essence filing criminal charges against a student with a disability. IDEA provides grants to states and creates special due process procedures for children with disabilities. 
In this case, a student diagnosed as suffering from attention deficit hyperactivity disorder kicked a water pipe in the school lavatory until it burst--a crime against property--resulting in about $1,000 water damage. The Knox County School District filed a petition in juvenile court against the child. The disabled student's father filed for a due process hearing under the IDEA to review the filing of the petition in juvenile court by the school. The hearing officer ordered the school district to seek dismissal of its juvenile court petition and that decision by the hearing officer was upheld by the Federal District Court and the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals. 
The Court of Appeals concluded that under `IDEA's procedural safeguards, the school system must adopt its own plan and institute a [multi-disciplinary] team meeting before initiating a juvenile court petition.' The problem with the circuit court's holding is that the special due process procedures for disabled students take several months, and sometimes a year, to complete. The practical effect of the ruling is that schools, as a matter of law, cannot unilaterally file charges against disabled students unless students' parents consent to such referrals. Schools must keep a student in school--potentially endangering others--and wait until the completion of the due process procedures required by IDEA. 
In addition to Tennessee, other States--such as Georgia, Ohio, Minnesota, Illinois, Michigan, Rhode Island, and New Hampshire--allow individuals, including school officials who witness students committing crimes at school, to file petitions in juvenile courts against the students. School officials should not be required to exhaust the IDEA's significant due process procedures before filing criminal juvenile petitions against students with disabilities. 
The ramifications of the sixth circuit's ruling have been immediate and troubling for school districts. Citing the ruling of the Chris L holding as authority, a Knox County, TN chancellor recently set aside the juvenile conviction of a high school special education student--because he is deaf in his right ear--who brought a butterfly knife to school. The chancellor court based its decision on the fact that the school had failed to convene a multidisciplinary team before referring the student with a disability to the juvenile court. The chancellor, when asked about his ruling, reportedly said, `There's a serious question to whether or not a student under this IDEA program can be charged at all.' 
The bill we are introducing today would make it clear to the Tennessee chancellor and other courts that students with disabilities who commit criminal acts on school property are not shielded from immediate referral to juvenile court or law enforcement authorities under IDEA's special due process procedures. We must restore the capacity of schools to create secure environments where all students can learn and achieve their highest potential. 
Mr. President, this bill would assist State and local governments in increasing public safety by holding juvenile criminals accountable for their serious and violent crimes, by encouraging accountability through the imposition of meaningful sanctions for delinquent acts, and by improving the extent, accuracy, availability, and usefulness of juvenile criminal records and public accessibility to juvenile court proceedings. 
In short, Mr. President, enactment of the Juvenile Crime Control and Community Protection Act of 1997 would be a significant step in the right direction toward addressing America's juvenile crime problem.

Mr. ASHCROFT. Thank you, Mr. President. I am particularly grateful for the statement of the Senator from Idaho, and for the measure of the Senator from Georgia. 
When you try to define America, you can't define America by looking at people and from outward appearance. We are not all of one race or one ethnic origin. We represent every possible assemblage from around the world. We have come here. What we have, together, is not ethnicity nor religious background. It is not racial. What we have is a common commitment to community, a common commitment to what it is America is. It goes beyond politics. It goes beyond where we go to church. It goes beyond where the ancestors on our family tree came from. It simply goes to the heart of how we feel about each other. 
No other nation on the face of the Earth has been so characterized by the idea of caring. Look at the great service organizations around the world, such as the Lions Club, which has a specific interest in protecting vision and making sure that people can see. The idea has been exported to the world from the United States of America. Look at the Rotary Club. Rotary clubs literally go around the globe. They have come from the United States of America where we look at the four-way test of rotary, which talks about the betterment of all concerned, which looks at the other side of the coin, which always asks about someone else.  
Look at the Kiwanis Club, the slogan of which is `We Build.' It has been exported to nation after nation. It has been embraced by cultures all around the globe, but it is something that started in the United States of America. It is something that is so universal and so important to the fabric, to the very tapestry that defines what this Nation is that it crosses party lines just like that. 
You have four Presidents of the United States joining together, Republicans and Democrats, in the Presidents' summit on voluntarism, and you have a person who in most societies would be considered to be an individual who knows how to deploy military resources and how to fight and how to hate and how to kill but an American whose heart really is in how to help, Gen. Colin Powell. He is heading up the entire focus again on voluntarism. It is something that is the character of this country. It is what makes us community. Frankly, it is richer than cultures that rely on Government and entitlement for all the things that are done. It is not universal in the world. In lots of places people think that charitable things are wrong, that it should be done by Government, so no one ever owes anyone else. 
Well, in America we do not owe each other. We love each other. And the idea of voluntarism is a way that we can extend to each other and build the chords of community that bind us together. The poets from overseas have said it well: Never send to know for whom the bell tolls; it tolls for you. 
That is why I have been involved in all kinds of charitable endeavors. I remember even when I was Governor of my home State, when a child was lost close to the State capital 20 or 30 miles away, I walked through the woods during the night with hundreds of other individuals to find the child. We were all kinds of people from all kinds of political persuasion, from all kinds of backgrounds, yet there we were walking through the woods at night. I remember in the great floods that afflicted Missouri, I filled sandbags next to people I did not know but people whom I loved because I cared for the communities, and I knew that if there were ever a flood at my place, they would be there with a shovel and their children with them, as mine were with me, filling sandbags. 
That is what America is about. We would not want to do anything to destroy the capacity of Americans to help each other, to love one another, to participate in community activities, charitable activities where we reach out to one another. How many times did dads, when I was a boy, haul me to the ball game? My father traveled a lot. My father was an itinerant, in some respects, minister at some times during his life and then traveled extensively when he was involved in education, raising money for the college. But you know, there was always some dad from the area who took me to the game. 
I will never forget Charles Wilcox. One time after a dusty, hot baseball practice, he took the whole team to the root beer stand, and he walked up to the window and said the most generous thing I have ever heard in my entire life. It almost knocked me over as a boy. He said to the fellow inside the root beer stand, `This is my team. Fill em up.' It had never happened to me before and perhaps has not happened to me since. I think soda pop is pretty commonplace these days, but back in the 1950's, when someone walked up to the root beer stand and said, `Fill em up,' it was a big thing. 
I do not want the Charlie Wilcoxes of this world not to be able to do that anymore. I do not want them so afraid that when they coach the Little League team, they are going to have to put on their family the risk of financial ruin. We have seen the cases, the shear lunacy of cases where the coach is sued because the youngster was moved from shortstop to left field and got hurt when a fly ball hit him in left field. His mom had said he was a born shortstop. Who is going to be the coach if you can get sued when you move someone to left field? 
We have seen the ridiculous cases where the youngster insists on sliding in headfirst and then injures himself and the coach is 
sued because the youngster slides headfirst instead of feet first, in spite of the fact that the youngster has seen all the big leaguers doing it time after time after time. But if that coach is going to lose his home, if his children cannot go to college because he is generous enough to care for someone else, we will certainly have cheated a lot of young people out of a lot of helping hands. 
When I was at the summit this last weekend in Philadelphia, each of these Presidents called upon me personally. No, they did not come up to talk to me, but they spoke to me, they spoke to my heart. They said America needs again to have a revival of individuals who are willing to care for each other. I thought to myself, we need to make sure as Members of the Congress that we do what is necessary to make that possible. I think of the Scout volunteers on the west coast who allowed the boys to play touch football. When I was a Scout, we would never settle for touch football, but these must have been very good leaders, interested in the safety of the youngsters. But one got injured and he ended up with a $7 million judgment against two of the volunteers. The appellate courts reduced it to $4 million. I cannot imagine that was much of a consolation to those Scout volunteers. 
Most people do not want to have to choose between helping the community and protecting their family. No one really will ever say I will help someone else if I have to sacrifice my family, because we have a very strong commitment to our families in America. It is a cornerstone of what we are. But a similar cornerstone of this house we call the United States of America is helping each other, and we should not put these cornerstones at odds. We should not say to people, in order to help someone else, you have to put your family at risk. That is what we have done with a tort system that has awarded judgments like $4 million against Scout leaders, that has awarded judgments against a Little League coach who moved someone from shortstop to left field. 
Let us get serious. The Presidents, past and present, know what America is about. It is in the hearts of Americans across this country. We want to make it possible for people again to extend themselves in a voluntary way without putting their families at risk. That is the long and the short of what we want to do. 
I think it is entirely inappropriate for some in this Chamber to stand against us, for those whose President has called us to a summit on voluntarism to say no, we are not going to allow any discussion of that in the Senate, we are not even going to proceed to the bill; we do not want you to have a chance to vote on it. That is what this filibuster by the Democratic Members of this body is achieving right now. It is keeping us from voting on this bill. This is not the bill itself we are talking about. We are talking about the motion to proceed. This is technical gobbledygook of the Senate. But in order to consider a bill, you have to succeed in passing a motion to proceed to the bill, and we are being filibustered on the motion. It is time for all Americans to again enlist in this great enterprise of community which we call America and help each other, and it is time for the Senate, Members of the Congress, to build a framework where we do not ask people to choose between protecting their family and helping other people. We have to say we will make sure your family is protected if you are kind enough and loving enough and caring enough to extend a helping hand, a hand of care, compassion, and love to those in your community. 
I have been told we are on the bill now. I am glad to know that we are on the bill. Yesterday we were on a filibuster to the motion to proceed, and I appreciate the correction. I apologize to Members of this body on the other side of the aisle. I would not impair or impugn their motive here. I am glad to be on the bill. I think with that in mind we ought to make sure we all vote in favor of this. This is an outstanding piece of legislation which will stop the irrationality of asking people to choose between protecting their family and helping their neighbor. The history of this country is that we have not only protected our family; we have 
enriched our families by helping our neighbors because we have been taught one of the most important values of life, that is, that we are not alone, that we live together in community. 
I thank the Chair.

Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to join us in moving to consideration of S. 4, the Family Friendly Workplace Act. It is an act which would help us accommodate the needs of families by recognizing that there are competing stresses. Most families feel two important stresses in their lives: One, the need to be with their families and to do for their families what their families require; the other is to provide resources, financial resources, for the family. These two stresses have put us in a unique condition, in terms of the way families operate. In the 1930's, when we enacted the Fair Labor Standards Act, it was clear that very few families found both parents as wage earners. As a matter of fact, in the 1930's, only one out of every six women with school-aged children worked outside the home. 
We have seen these two stresses--the requirement to spend time with our family and the requirement to provide financial resources in order to support our family--drive both parents in many situations into the workplace so there is this tension that exists in the workplace. It is a tension that relates to how we accommodate our families at the same time we provide the financial resources for our families. That being the case, the sponsors of S. 4 sought to find a way that we could say to families: We understand how important it is to you to get the financial resources to support your children. We understand how much you need to spend time with your children. Finally, we want to say to American families that we understand how important it is that you spend time with your children without sacrificing the financial resources that your family needs. The solution--we thought it best to provide a way for people to be able to work flexible work schedules. 
This is not a way for people to take a pay cut or to lose resources. We already have the Family and Medical Leave Act, which allows people to take a pay cut in order to meet a family emergency. But public policy in this country should not require American workers to take a pay cut in order to be a good mom or dad in this country. Most people have the understanding that they want to be able to both meet the financial needs of their family and meet the social needs that are attendant to being a mom or dad. 
That is what this bill would do. 
This bill would simply allow flexible work schedules to be arranged, when the employee and the employer agree--when there is agreement on both parties--it cannot be a coerced agreement. The bill provides specifically, that if there is coercion--either direct or indirect coercion--that there are enhanced, heightened, and substantial penalties involved. Therefore, when there is a voluntary agreement between the employer and employee, the employee in overtime situations can opt to take time-and-a-half off instead of getting time-and-a-half pay. And, where there is an employee who does not get overtime work regularly, and that happens to be most of the hourly workers in the country--the vast majority of citizens do not get overtime work. In those settings, where an employee never has an opportunity to earn overtime compensation, there should be an opportunity for people to say to the boss, `If I work an extra hour this week, calling that flextime, can I take an hour off next week when my son or daughter is going to get an award at the high school and I need to take an extended lunch hour? Can I take some time off next week if I need to go take a group of kids to the soccer game? I will work the hour this week.' 
Americans really are not aware that that is against the law for hourly workers right now. For an employer to trade with an employee an hour in 1 week, and say you can make it up in the next week, if the hour in the next week puts the person over 40 hours--it simply is illegal to make that up on an hour-for-hour basis. If you want to take the hour off this week and make it up next week, it is now a responsibility of the employer to make it up at a time-and-a-half basis. So you have to pay time and a half. Most employers cannot afford that, so they do not have that kind of flexible working arrangement. It is pretty clear to me that most Americans would like to have the opportunity to swap an hour, sometimes, one week for an hour the next week. Under this bill, if the employer asked, suggested, or even hinted that he wanted an employee to work over 40 hours in a week, the employee would be entitled to overtime pay. In order to bank hours on an hour-for-hour basis, the employee `initiate and request' the ability to work the additional hour. 
So, there are a number of components of this bill, all of which are designed to relieve the stress of working families, all of which are designed to give Americans more time with their families. These provisions are designed to do it without forcing you to take the time off without pay. The real challenge we have in our culture is to continue to sustain our families financially but also to continue to sustain our families in their abilities to do the kinds of things they need to do together. What is important to note is that, in addition to the overtime provision, which can be compensated at time and a half, there is also the flextime provision of the bill which attends to workers who are not normally able to get overtime work. 
The Census Bureau collects data on a regular basis. Out of their data they collected in 1996, the data revealed that only 4 percent of working women who work on an hourly basis reported that they get regular overtime pay. It would be fine for those women if they could take that overtime and convert it to time-and-a-half off. But let's be serious. If we were only going to address the stresses and tensions that exist in the families of that 4 percent of the work force, we are not really going to do much to improve the lives of very many people. We need to be able to address this tension and this stress that exists in the work force generally. That is why it is important to offer the flex-time parts of this bill, which allow a person to say, `I will work an extra hour this week in return if the boss will let me take that hour off next week, or vice versa.' 
Those are the kinds of provisions that have been available in the public sector for the last 20 years. In 1978, sponsored by Congresswoman Ferraro, of New York, and Congresswoman Schroeder, of Colorado, we enacted the law in the Federal system which provided for flexibility in employment for Federal workers. The same 
provisions, which we now are offering before the Senate, ought to be extended to workers around the country in the private sector. What is interesting is that the system has worked so well at the Federal and local level. As a matter of fact, the General Accounting Office wanted to see what the impact of having these kind of work rules was on governmental performance, on morale of workers. When the General Accounting Office surveyed the workers they found out that workers approved or expressed their appreciation for this kind of working arrangement at a 10-to-1 ratio. So, for every 1 worker here who said, `I am not enthusiastic about this, I do not really care for it,' 10 workers said they approved it. 
Frankly, you cannot get that 10-to-1 ratio of workers to agree that today is Thursday afternoon. That is an overwhelming endorsement. That is a clear statement by workers, the workers themselves--union workers, nonunion workers--that this system works. 
One of the features that is allowed in the Federal Government system that would be allowed and available in the private sector under this bill would be the ability of workers and their employers, upon the agreement and voluntary--voluntary consent of both parties, to schedule work over a 2-week period to average 40 hours a week. This was extremely popular in the Federal Government, because it allowed people to work 9 days in the 2-week period instead of 10 days in the 2-week period. Working 9 days in the 2-week period really meant that workers had every other Friday off, so they would work 8 days at 9 hours a day for 72 hours and then the ninth day they would work 8 hours. That took them to 80 hours. Then, with that in mind, having worked 80 hours in the 2-week period, 45 hours in the first 5 days and 35 hours in the next 4 days, those 2 weeks together constituted 80 hours. And each second week, Friday would be off. 
The opportunity is apparent, here, in terms of the ability to spend time with your children; the ability to tend to things that can only be done during business hours. This is one of the reasons, when Federal employees are asked about the program, they endorse it overwhelmingly. It is one of the reasons why unions in the Federal arena insist on these provisions, these capacities, these flexibilities. It is one of the reasons why individuals in the work force ought to really have this opportunity in the private sector. 
Having worked flawlessly for the last 20 years, increased productivity, built morale, and been endorsed by workers overwhelmingly, it is time for us to say to the work force generally: This is something you should have. Federal workers have it. It is time that ordinary workers in the private sector have it. I should not say `ordinary' because I do not want to suggest that the other workers are extraordinary. The point is, salaried workers have had flexibility for a long time. The boardroom has had flexibility for a long time. The guys who run the company never seem to have difficulty in being able to take time off to see their kids get an award, or even to play a game, or a round of golf, or perhaps link up with some of their friends at a predetermined time for a fishing trip or outing, or to even be volunteers, when it is necessary, to help their communities. 
But the hourly individuals are the ones who have faced that challenge. Of course, the people who have felt the squeeze the most, I think, are the moms who have gone into the work force since the 1930's. There are 28.8 million working women who work by the hour in this country and it is time for us to say to them: You should be entitled to some of the same flexibility that people in the boardroom or at the head of the company or the salaried workers of America have had. It is time for us to say to them you should be entitled to some of the same opportunities to work with your family as the people who work for the Federal Government have had. It is time for us to say to them it would be appropriate for you to have the same capacity to volunteer and to help your children in their athletic activities, or academic activities, or extracurricular activities, as the people who work for State and local governments have had. 
It is time to give the average worker in the United States of America, that individual who has served, working hard on an hourly basis, these same benefits that have been enjoyed by individuals who have worked on a salaried basis and have worked for the U.S. Government, for State governments, or for local governments. 
Some individuals have indicated that perhaps it is enough for us to just address the issue of comptime. I would just suggest, because comptime is available only to workers who work overtime regularly, that we ought to think carefully about limiting the flexible working arrangements that we think ought to be available to American workers to those who are normally endowed with the right to work overtime. 
Overtime is not the prerogative of most American workers. Estimates run as high as a third of the workers get regular overtime. The census clearly indicated only 4 percent of the hourly workers who were women in 1996 said they got regular overtime. 
What if you would triple that number from 4 percent to, say, 12 percent? You would still only have one woman working by the hour out of eight who received regular overtime. If we are going to provide flexibility to only one out of eight women, it seems to me we have missed the boat; or only two out of eight men, because twice as many men work in jobs that get overtime as women do. 
If you take the universe of people who get overtime work, it is a 2-to-1 population in favor of men who have worked in the jobs that historically get overtime. 
I do not think it is appropriate for us to try to limit what we do to individuals who have had the good fortune to find themselves in jobs where they would traditionally get overtime, especially when that means that it would only result in maybe one out of eight women in the work force working by the hour, having the flexible options, having the capacity to have an adjustable schedule the way people do in the boardroom, the way people do in State government, the way people do in the Federal Government. 
I think it is time for us to say to America generally, `We understand it's tough to balance the competing demands of the homeplace and the workplace. We understand that when you take time off, you don't want to lose money doing so, because you wouldn't be working in the first place if you could afford to lose money by taking time off.' 
We need to say, `We understand you don't want to take a pay cut to be a good mom or dad.' 
We need to say, `We understand that you want to be a volunteer and you will need to have flexible working arrangements from time to time.' 
We want to build a framework that says to them, `If, indeed, those are your aspirations, here is the way you can accomplish them. At least you and your employer can together agree voluntarily that these kinds of things can be done.' 
I emphasize the word `voluntarily,' because that is the way the bill would work. If there is coercion, either direct or indirect coercion, the bill provides for elevated, extraordinarily high penalties. It says, `If you are going to coerce workers, beware, you are going to have a doubling of the penalties you previously had in overtime settings.' 
Second, in order to provide a further incentive for employers, who are offering compensatory time off options, to not only allow employees to take the time when they need it but also to not see it as a cost savings, the bill provides that if an employee has chosen a comptime option, if at any time the employee changes their mind, the employee only has to say `Nope, I've changed my mind. I would like to have the money back instead of the time and a half off.' 
So, if someone had originally said, `I'll take time and a half off,' thinking that would please the employer in some way, they can reverse that decision. In addition, if he believed he needed to accept the comptime, in lieu of financial compensation, it would be coercion and double current penalties could be assessed. 
As an ultimate backup to make sure we don't have any abuse of the workers here, we have a situation built right into the structure of the bill so that at the end of the year, all the time and a half that is there as comptime is automatically paid as time and a half and at time-and-a-half rates. 
So what we have here is a clear voluntary situation. You do not have any incentives for any employer to distort the voluntarism. You have employers who really understand that, if they can help employees be good parents, they are going to be better employees and, together, with a happier employer and happier employee, people are going to be able to meet the needs of their family without taking pay cuts. That it is a win-win situation. 
That is what we targeted. We built protections into the bill and structurally designed the bill, so that compensatory time can be converted quickly and efficiently. It is automatically converted if it is not used by the end of the year and we have provided elevated penalties in the event that there is a problem with any coercion, direct or indirect. 
I might add as well, in the event the employer and employee in this measure do not agree to take time off as compensatory time, if there is no agreement on it, we fall back under the 1930's Fair Labor Standards Act. In other words, nothing is done to deprive any worker who wants to live under the terms and conditions of the law as it now exists from working under those conditions. 
What we really have is an ability of the worker and the employer to choose to be more flexible and, if either one is dissatisfied, that choice is reflected in the continuation of the status quo: The 40-hour week continues to be in existence; the required payment of overtime at time and a half payment instead of time and a half off continues in existence. So the ultimate security for any worker is that the worker can choose to operate in the same framework of legal protection that worker has at this very time. 
This is an attempt to say to the work force, `We know that you are stressed. We know that the demands of your house and the demands of your job are competing, and when they collide, if possible, we would like to give you the option of being able to work it out with your employer and to work it out in a framework of protections that are likely to result in your being able to succeed.' 
We are doing this, not with some program we have dreamed up, not with some novel, untested, untried set of opportunities. We are doing this with a program that has been in existence now since 1978, almost 20 years, in the Federal Government. We are doing this by proposing for the private sector the kind of flexible working arrangements which have been available in the public sector and which workers in the public sector have endorsed at a 10-to-1 ratio, which workers in the public sector, be they union workers or nonunion workers, are eager to continue, and when contracts are negotiated, there is an insistence that these kinds of provisions continue to be available. 
I might just add one other thing about the President and his involvement. The President, in his campaign, called for `flexible work arrangements' for citizens. He used that very language. He used that language again in his State of the Union Message. He talked about `flexible working arrangements.' When the President of the United States, President Clinton, came into office, he noticed that there was a small group of executive branch workers who didn't have the privileges that were accorded to the rest of the Government workers regarding flexible working arrangements and compensatory time. When the President made that observation, he did the right thing. The President said to the rest of the workers, `I'm going to extend the benefits of these kinds of working relationships by Executive order to you as Federal workers, because these are the kinds of things which will help you do a good job, they will help us get good work, and they will help you resolve the tension between your family and your workplace.' 
What was good for the President of the United States in his campaign, what he remarked on favorably in his remarks to the Congress, what he indicated was appropriate by way of Executive order, is good for the American people. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I thank you for this opportunity to spend a few more minutes helping those watching understand exactly what significant opportunities we are talking about with the Family Friendly Workplace Act. It is our effort to try to give to people who are on hourly working arrangements the ability to develop flexible working schedules--to do it in the same way as has been possible for Federal workers so situated for the last--well, during the 1970's, 1980's and into this decade of the 1990's. 
The attempt to offer the ability to work flexible schedules is a result of people feeling the stress of the job that tugs them away from their families. In order to understand the true nature of workers' stress and the benefit they would gain from flexible work schedules, I would like to read some letters that have been sent to our office. Here is a letter that says: 
Dear Senator Ashcroft. I'm a 29-year-old working mother. I have a 2-year-old daughter and am pregnant and due in November. I recently heard about your Family Friendly Workplace Act. Under current law where I work does not allow me to have a flexible work schedule. They are not allowed by the law to let us work less than 40 hours one week and then more than 40 hours the next. In my current condition, I need to be able to take off for doctors' appointments. Due to the fact that I have a complication in my pregnancy, I have more appointments than average. If I was able to take off more one week and work more the next, it would be very helpful to me and other mothers in Missouri. 
That is perfectly stated. Here is another letter: 
My 2-year-old daughter is healthy but there are some days she needs extra attention and some days that she is sick. Some days she is just 2. 
Meaning the terrible 2's, I suppose. 
If I was able to take time I need for some mornings and to make it up at lunch or the next week, it would make my life much easier. 
Here is another letter: 
It's been a struggle for me to be able to arrange for doctor appointments, be home when my child is ill and my three children are always sick at different times. Or when my babysitter has been unable to take my children because of illness. Not all of us have spouses or family members who can fill in for us or when we need to be there for our children. My husband works out of town on many occasions and is unable always to be around when needed. 
Working parents are not asking for special favors, just a way to be able to meet the demands of both our jobs and families. The Family Friendly Workplace Act would help solve the problem of inflexibility in the workplace. Being able to arrange biweekly work schedules would be very helpful in meeting the needs of our families. I would be able to take the time off for doctors' appointments or to leave a couple hours early one day if the babysitter calls to tell me my child has a fever. Being able to make that time up the next week would certainly take off a lot of the pressure and the stress of taking these last few hours of leave time or potentially being on leave without pay. 
Here is an individual working because they need the money. When a little crisis arises, because flextime is not available, 
they have to leave the office without pay. She goes on to say: 
The option of taking compensatory time in lieu of monetary compensation would also be very valuable to working parents who just need the time off. 
Here is another. 
Presently I enjoy flexible schedules. The extra day off [I have] during the week allows me to spend one-on-one quality time with my 5-year old daughter. She will start kindergarten this fall, which makes these girls-only days especially meaningful for both of us. Additionally, I can schedule many doctors' appointments as well as other appointments for me and my children on this day off. This allows me to save my accrued sick or vacation leave for a time when I really need the sick leave or can take a well planned family vacation. 
As a supervisor, I currently have the flexibility in my schedule from week to week. However, my staff are not given the same opportunity, although many of them would be able to utilize and benefit from it. 
Kind of interesting to me. Here is the supervisor that has the flex capacity, says that the staff ought to have the same thing. This is really the crux of what we are talking about in this bill. 
My staff are not given this same opportunity although many of them would be able to utilize and benefit from it. 
She says: 
I am reluctant to exercise this advantage, however, of mine because it seems unfair to me that I have something that my employees do not. I understand that this bill would require that this opportunity be afforded to all employees, not just those in management or supervisory positions. 
Here is another letter from a constituent: 
Time with my children is very important and, unfortunately, working outside the home is important, too. My children will only be young once, and missing parts of their development is a very important part that I can never replace. I would like to better balance my family life and my work life. And I think the Family Friendly Workplace Act is an excellent opportunity for working parents. 
Here is a letter from a schoolteacher: 
I ask that you support the bill as I think it would be a great benefit to all citizens in this country. As an educator, I feel that this would allow parents time to be in school with their children. Time and time again, parents relate to me that they cannot come to school for conferences or other meetings because they have to work. This bill would allow some flexibility in the workplace. 
Another letter. I think this letter is very interesting. This writer used to be a Federal employee and is now working in the private sector. The individual writes: 
I have worked in the Federal Government with a flexible schedule based on 80 hours and enjoyed it.' 
That means you work an average of 80 hours over 2 weeks. 
Now that I have left the Federal work force, I have questioned why this same opportunity is not available to me in the private sector. As an American, this disappoints me greatly. The Government does not have enough confidence in me to allow me to make a decision to not take overtime pay if I exceed 40 hours a week. By pretending to protect me, they have hurt me. My company cannot pay me overtime, so I cannot take time off next week. I would like to see the same benefits that Federal workers have, be offered to the private sector. 
Another example is the vacation time, 
the writer goes on to say: 
What I receive in industry isn't near that what the Federal Government provides. Three-day weekends were great while they lasted--even 4-day weekends allowed the family to get away for a short trip, which is about all we can ever afford anyhow, and I still have discretionary time for kids, doctor visits, and other needs. 
Here is a letter from a schoolteacher: 
As an elementary teacher I feel parents need to have time off to help in their child's classroom and attend conferences. The children have the real benefit of this bill, if it passes, because they will know that their parents really do care about them and their progress in school. 
We will have an opportunity to debate and discuss this matter fully. I thank the majority leader, Trent Lott, for allowing us to have this time this afternoon to bring this bill forward. It is pretty clear that the supplemental appropriations will take precedence over this bill when we reconvene next week and that budget matters will have priority and be the subject of our deliberations. But, because this measure was the next measure to come up after those come before us, the majority leader let us have a start on this important issue this afternoon. 
I look forward to the time when these other measures--which are very important and require our attention--will have been settled and we can get back to this all-important issue of allowing workers to have the flexibility to spend time with their families. It is as important as ever to allow workers in the private sector who are paid hourly wages to have the same benefits that Federal Government workers have had since 1978. 
So I thank the majority leader for giving us the opportunity to begin this bill now. It will be necessary for us to bring the bill down so we can proceed to other matters. I close by thanking my good friends who have helped in this measure. Perhaps the most responsible for the significant progress we have made is Senator DeWine of Ohio, in whose subcommittee this bill was heard and whose leadership has resulted in it being one of the first pieces of major legislation brought to the floor during this session of the Congress. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, May 1 is a special day in the United States of America. It has been designated and observed as a national day of prayer. Citizens across the country--having recognized that those of us in positions of responsibility need the kind of wisdom to allow us to make good decisions--have today been observing this National Day of Prayer in our behalf. I rise to thank them. 
Abraham Lincoln, in the midst of the crisis that perhaps did more to threaten this country and at the same time, more to unify it than any other crisis in history, continued to have a strong commitment and dedication to the concept of prayer when he called upon the Nation to reserve a time for repentance, for introspection, and for prayer. 
This Nation has survived great challenges--yet still faces great challenges. I believe that its success in the face of challenge in large measure is due to the fact that people have prayed. 
A couple thousand years ago, when the Apostle Paul was writing a letter to his friend Timothy, he advised Timothy to say, `Pray for each other and pray especially for those who are in authority that we may lead quiet and peaceable lives in all Godliness and honesty.' 
I think that was good advice 2,000 years ago, and it is good advice today. 
I rise today, as we close this day in the U.S. Senate, to say to those Americans who have been a part of this observance, referred to as the `National Day of Prayer,' thank you for your prayers and, as a matter of fact, I think all America owes a debt of gratitude to those who have carried the well-being and welfare of this country to God in prayer on a regular basis. It is with that in mind that I believe the National Day of Prayer is a strong symbol that we have prayer all year--on a continuing basis so that we might do things that advance the very cause for which I think God sent his Son to the world--that we might live life and live it more abundantly. That is the true position of Government, that we would create conditions under which people could live and live in greater abundance and greater freedom. 
So I take this moment to reflect upon those who have cared enough to pray for us and to extend to them my appreciation for what they have done in our behalf. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. ASHCROFT. I am deeply grateful for this opportunity to respond to the final point of the Senator from Georgia, who has pointed out that we need volunteers among the most needy and among the most deprived individuals in our culture, and those most needy and deprived individuals are the riskiest people to help. 
I cite this article which I hold in my hand on civil justice: `A Thousand Points of Fright?'--f-r-i-g-h-t, not l-i-g-h-t. It is a scholarly work by David Webber. He writes that `lawsuit fears are dampening the enthusiasm of volunteers.' And he says, `And the White House is beginning to take notice,' which is constructive. I commend the White House. I commend the President for mobilizing the Presidents, to have the Presidents' summit on voluntarism. 
But one of the interesting things that the governmental relations director for the National PTA says is that `we are just more conscious than ever before of litigious possibilities. The bad thing has been the chilling effect on activities we can sponsor, especially for high-risk kids--kids with handicaps--and child care programs.' 
What he has basically said is exactly what the Senator from Georgia was speaking of; that in the highest risk situations we have a chilling effect not only on volunteers but on programs, where you begin to see the withdrawals of programs, the programs 
that do not go into effect, the programs that do not exist, opportunities that are never capitalized on because of this sort of chill that comes from the litigious, as he calls it, possibilities. 
I must admit that frequently these possibilities do not result in a lawsuit with a verdict against the volunteer, but if you work as a volunteer and you are sued, it could cost you $10,000 just to defend the suit--$10,000. And, of course, you could have a judgment against you just as the Boy Scout leader from the Cascade Pacific Council had a verdict of $4 million against him, because you let the boys play touch football, or the Little League coach who, because he shifted the player from shortstop to left field, gets a judgment against him. I mean these volunteers obviously are going to think about what happens to their family. How can my kids go to school? I would love to help the world, but I have to protect my family. 
That would be a response you would have to commend in individuals, and yet it is not something we want in America. We do not want to have to choose between helping the world or protecting our families. We want to be able to say to a volunteer, you can do both. The genius of America is that we do not have to be selfish in order to protect our families. 
The genius of America is that we have always been able to help each other, while we have protected our families. 
The kinds of lawsuits that we have seen are just incredible. A 14-year-old boy was sliding into home plate head first when he collided with the catcher. The catcher had blocked the plate as instructed. Catchers are always instructed to block the plate. In the rules of baseball, it is the only position where you are entitled to stand in front of the plate without the ball. But the catcher had blocked the plate and, unfortunately, there was a neck injury. Although plaintiff came to the league sliding head first, and that was the way he liked to play baseball, the volunteer coaches were found negligent for not being able to adjust the way the child slided--slid. I sound like Dizzy Dean, who used to say `slud into second.' But volunteer coaches were held negligent for not instructing the player on proper sliding techniques and failing to warn of the danger created by sliding into home plate head first. Of course, the player obviously watched major league player after major league player, role models all--and they should be, many of them great folks--sliding in head first. 
I wonder about asking people to volunteer to coach these children, so many of them without dads in their own homes, so many of them at-risk kids, doing their best to provide them enthusiasm for their sport, and restraints so as to protect themselves. And, when there is an injury, having that kind of lawsuit. So many of our volunteers are around sports--you wonder about the kind of lawsuits that surround sports. 
Here is one that really stunned me. It was a part-time official who was asked to officiate in a crucial Big Ten basketball game. At the last second he called a foul that gave one of the teams a victory. He called them like he saw them. It switched the victory. A souvenir company that had anticipated the victory by the other team sued the official, challenging his call with a $175,000 negligence suit claiming he had wrongfully harmed the souvenir company's ability to sell their souvenirs. The official won the lawsuit. So let us just lay that to rest, the official won the lawsuit. But only after a 2-year court battle that went all the way to the Iowa Supreme Court. 
Do you know what it takes, in terms of resources, to take a court battle to the supreme court of one of our States? I mean, it takes more than it takes to send a kid to college. It takes more than it takes to have family vacations. It takes more than it takes for some families to buy a home. It certainly takes more than it takes even for the wealthiest families, almost, to have a downpayment on a home. We ask people to volunteer in these kinds of settings. It seems to me we ought to have some protection for them. 
Here is another one that caught my eye. I should not say `caught my eye,' because this is about a person who was hit in the eye, a catcher in a softball game. He was playing without a mask. The umpire had a mask. The catcher got hit in the eye. He sued the umpire because the umpire had not given him his mask. The catcher walked away with a $24,000 settlement. 
We are asking people to volunteer. I think the President is doing the right thing. There is absolutely no question in my mind that he is calling America to greatness, a greatness that reflects the character of the fact that we care for each other. That is what America is all about. It is what sent de Tocqueville back to France, 150 years ago, exclaiming about the virtue of America. He said it was not to be found in the corridors of the bureaucracy or the Halls of the Congress. He said it was to be found in the people. He said America is great because America is good. 
We want the goodness of America to be reflected again in this country. We want the capacity of people to identify with each other, to love each other--literally love each other enough to say I am not just content to work with my own kids, I am going to work with the kids in the neighborhood and some kids who are not as fortunate as mine. Maybe they are kids who have lost their mom or dad, for one reason or another. That kind of tragedy has touched 
my family and it has touched most of the people in this country, and we want the loving character of American citizens to be available and we do not want it to be inhibited. We do not want it to be so you cannot volunteer. 
I think about those women in Evanston, IL, who wanted to set up the home for battered women. They could not get insurance because of the litigation potential. All the insurance companies said you have to operate for 3 years without insurance before we can determine whether or not we will insure you. So nobody could risk their own family in order to help other people. They did not want their own homes to be taken in order to provide a home for someone else. So we end up not having that extension of compassion in our culture. 
I do not think there is any President who has more successfully said to the people in this country, `I feel your pain.' He says it with sincerity, and I believe he does. He has a great capacity to empathize. And he has called this country to feel it, to feel the opportunity and respond to the opportunity to help one another. And we have a great opportunity to say we are going to take a big roadblock out of the way. 
I started out by referring to this article, `A Thousand Points of Fright?', saying the most difficult to help are the riskiest to help. And they need help badly. We have this barrier standing in the way. We have gone through examples. I guess we could tell stories about these lawsuits until the cows came home--at least that's a phrase my aunt used to use--but the truth of the matter is, this is important. It was important enough for the four previous Presidents of the United States to join the current President of the United States and one of the greatest military heroes of our age, to join the whole effort and to galvanize public opinion to try to say we need volunteers. 
It is a little bit confounding, to think there are those in this body who want to stop us from considering--who do not even want us to have a chance to debate and vote on an issue like giving volunteers this kind of break. 
I do not know how anybody could say we want to make sure that a person who volunteers has the potential to be sued and harassed. I notice that a former Attorney General of the United States, Dick Thornburgh, wrote an opinion piece for one of our major newspapers. He said: `If you are sued, the average cost to defend yourself--' in a case not involving a car, car cases cost a lot of money, usually--`is $7,500.' There isn't anybody who can afford that and that is the average cost. That includes the cases that are dismissed. 
I think it is time for us to say we want more volunteers, we want to cooperate with the President, we want America to be what America has the character to be. It is time for us to respond to the people. We need to respond to the people by inviting them to have the kind of caring compassion reflected in voluntarism. It is the least we can do to pull the roadblocks out of their way and make a clear path for Americans to care for each other. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. ASHCROFT. I am pleased to have this opportunity to address this problem. It is a problem that challenges the capacity of individuals in our culture to share with each other and to help one another. The fact that there are proposals that relate to this, in addition to this proposal, from a wide variety of perspectives, demonstrates that this is not an effort to address something that is not a problem. 
Let me just give you a couple of examples of how this problem has manifested itself and what are the effects. First of all, I will give you some of the general effects. The Gallup organization conducted a survey entitled: `The Liability Crisis and the Use of Volunteers of Nonprofit Associations.' What did the Gallup organization find? Approximately 1 in 10 nonprofit organizations has experienced the resignation of a volunteer due to liability concerns. One in six volunteers was reported to have 
withheld services due to a fear of exposure to liability suits. 
Now, the question is, do we need more volunteers in our culture or do we need less? Our current system is stopping 18 percent of volunteers from doing some volunteer activity and resulting in 10 percent of the organizations having people resign from their boards of directors. 
I might also indicate that mention has been made that some of the States have provided some protection for volunteers. I find it ironic that about half of all the States which provide protection do so only for the guy on the board of directors or the person at the top of the organization setting policy. The person who is the silk stocking guy in the boardroom gets protected, but the fellow out there on the field, the Little League coach, is the guy against whom the big judgment is rendered. 
Our question has to be, are we going to tie the hands of the person who is actually going to deliver the help while we provide some cocoon of protection to the fellow in the boardroom? Or are we going to say to the average citizen, you can afford to get involved in your community without putting your house on the line, without jeopardizing your children's college education. You can afford to help the Little League because we are not going to make it so that you will be sued when someone does not catch a fly ball. You might laugh and say, wait a second, getting sued because a child doesn't catch a fly ball? I wish it were not so true. 
Let me refer you to a 1982 case, and this is one of the first cases that started the run of liability cases against volunteers. In Runnemede, NJ, a Little League coach volunteer was sued because he repositioned his Little League shortstop to the outfield, and in the outfield the Little League shortstop misjudged a fly ball and sustained an eye injury. 
A suit was filed on the allegation that the 10-year-old youngster was `a born shortstop' but not an outfielder, and the courts found the volunteer coach negligent. Over the next 5 years, liability rates for Little League baseball in that area went up 10 times--1,000 percent. 
Here is another example. We are talking about real people, real folks who get up in the morning early, work hard all day, sometimes take time off their jobs to go out and volunteer to help the kids of America, some of the kids without moms or dads or who do not have time to help children, kids who need positive role models, and here is what we do to them. A boy in a scouting unit with the Boy Scouts of the Cascade Pacific Council--a national problem, Runnemede, NJ, on the one side of the country, Cascade Pacific Council on the other side. A Boy Scout suffers a paralyzing injury while playing in a touch football game. I remember being a Boy Scout. Touch football was as mild as the supervisors could possibly make it. We wanted to play tackle football or flag football, but touch football was a part of the curriculum we had to play. 
A boy gets injured. What in the world happens when the volunteers are found personally liable for $7 million? What would a $7 million judgment do to your capacity to send your kids to college if you were the volunteer? What would it do to your capacity to have the kind of life you wanted? We are not making it difficult for volunteers; in many instances, we are saying to them, you cannot volunteer. 
Frankly, this is not something any of us intend. This is not a partisan issue. This is an issue of compassion. It is an issue about the character of America. When Alexis de Tocqueville came to America--and they are having a wonderful series on de Tocqueville on C-SPAN; they are following his steps that he took across America 150 years ago--he talked about the greatness of this country, and he said greatness in America is not governmental. Greatness is not a matter of the law of this country. It is a matter of the people of this country. America is great because the people are good. But that was at a time when there was such a thing known as charitable immunity, when charities were simply held totally immune, so that if people were going to charities to get help, they got what help they could, and if a mistake was made or an injury, that is the way it was. 
Now, we are not asking that it be restored to that condition. But we are saying that, when a volunteer, someone who is giving of her time or of his time, when they are giving that time generously and they are trying to help the Boy Scouts, they should not end up with a $7 million judgment. 
I should add a correction. In that case, the judgment was reduced to $4 million by the courts. That would have been a great comfort to me and my family. We would not come any closer to paying a $4 million judgment than we would a $7 million judgment. The system, though, rewards those who try to help the youngsters with that kind of legal liability. The system is broken in that respect. If we want America to be great, it will be not because we have a governmental program that will fix everything. But we, at least, need to release the energy available in the American culture that comes from volunteers. 
I indicate, as well, that the bill, which is being filibustered by the other side, is not a bill that relieves organizations of all their responsibility. This is a bill that relieves the volunteer of responsibility for economic damages that are suffered by individuals who are injured through simple negligence. Economic damages still can be recovered against the organization, but the fellow who works all day and works hard to keep his family together and sometimes takes a little time away from his family to help the rest of the world should not find himself looking down the barrel of a $4 million judgment because he has been a good Scout leader. And unfortunately that has happened too frequently. 
Here is another example. From the Richmond Times-Dispatch, November 4, 1995. A Red Cross volunteer in Virginia `was driving a woman to a medical facility for routine care.' I have volunteered for the Red Cross, done Meals on Wheels and things like that. `The Red Cross-owned car was involved in a collision and the passenger was injured. She later died from causes unrelated to the crash. But the administrator of the woman's estate sought judgment against the volunteer and alleged that he negligently operated the vehicle.' 
We should not have people being hauled into court on things like that. The fact is that these volunteers are being asked to defend themselves. 
Here is an interesting fact from the Washington Times, a May 2, 1995, article. 
`A Legal System That Fails the Test of Charity,' was the headline. `A Washington, DC, area Girl Scout council reports that it must sell 87,000 boxes of Girl Scout cookies each year just to pay for liability insurance.' The first 87,000 boxes of cookies do not provide any help to any girls, do not provide any assistance, do not provide any of the reinforcement that these kids, without many of the benefits that you and I enjoyed as children, need. The first 87,000 boxes of cookies have to go to carry the liability insurance. 
`We have no diving boards at our camps,' the executive director said. `We will never own horses. And, many local schools will no longer provide meeting space for our volunteers,' because of the liability crisis as it relates to volunteers. 
Here is an interesting item from the Washington Times, May 1995. `A Legal System That Fails the Test of Charity,' again.  
The Junior League in Evanston, IL, discovered a few years ago that, to set up a shelter for battered women, they would have had to go without liability insurance for three years. No directors would serve under these conditions, and the plans for the shelter were shelved. 
We need people to drive people to the hospital for the Red Cross. We need the Junior League to help sponsor shelters for battered women. We need Boy Scout volunteers that will not operate under the threat of $4 million judgments against them and the assets of their families. We need Little League volunteers who have the ability to ask the kid to play left field instead of shortstop, in spite of the claims of the child's parents that the 
child is a born shortstop and not an outfielder. 
We simply have to create an environment in this country where we do not rely on the Government for everything. And, in that context, we have to free up the energy of the goodness of the American people and not ask them to operate under the threat of judgments that would deprive them of their homes, their families' well-being, and their capacity to send their children to college. 
Americans are sacrificial people. They are willing to give you the proverbial shirts off their backs. But we should not make it a situation where, if they give you the shirt and you do not like the shirt, you can sue them and take their house and deprive their kids of an opportunity to go to college. That is too much. It is too much to ask of these generous volunteers. And our system of Government simply needs to provide a little protection, a framework in which people can operate in decency and can beneficially extend themselves, one to another. The idea that somehow America is automatically good and the Government can handle all this stuff is a bankrupt concept. We understood that in the debate last year over welfare reform. We saw the kind of miserable response that has come from this culture to welfare. We were intensifying problems. The problem was growing rather than slowing. 
If anything is going to help us recover, it will be our understanding that we can help each other. But we will have a hard time helping each other if we make it a condition of volunteering that you put your family's well-being on the line and you look down the barrel of that $4 million cannon every time you want to go and help a few Boy Scouts. That is why I think it is so important to have a discussion of these issues and to act on these issues. It is high time we do so. It is a matter in discussion in this country and has been a matter of public debate. This is not a surprise. 
There are bills on the issue of voluntarism in both the House and Senate. Frankly, S. 543, Senator Coverdell's legislation, is outstanding legislation designed to relieve the volunteer of liability. This bill does not relieve organizations of liability for economic damages. I find it troublesome to have it suggested that this bill is designed in some way to relieve the Ku Klux Klan from consequences against the organization for criminal acts, or acts that would somehow disparage the civil rights or dignity of Americans. It is simply not so. 
I wonder if there are not any good arguments against this legislation when the only arguments that come up against it are arguments which do not hold water and which are designed to go to the most base emotions within us. 
When we are talking about making it possible for Americans to help other Americans, it is particularly troublesome that in order to disrupt this discussion we try to talk about Americans hating other Americans. We should be careful never to do anything to promote hate. It would be a terrible thing if we allowed those who suggested that we were doing that to impair our ability to provide a framework in which people could promote love and care and concern. One of the real values of volunteer activity is what it communicates. When you get something from the Government you do it because you are entitled to it, so you take it. But when you get something from your neighbor you know that he or she cares for you and loves you. And that mutual sense of concern is what builds community. It is what binds us together; it is not what tears us apart. We are talking about providing a context for people to demonstrate a sense of community. 
Two hundred years ago John Donne said it as eloquently as anyone has ever said it in his sonnet, on the fact that no man is an island. He said, `No man is an island.' He started out saying we are all in this thing together. We are not by ourselves. And he ends his sonnet: 
. . . never send to know for whom the bell tolls; it tolls for thee. 
And, in America, we have that sense. It is unique to America. 
It is what makes America what she is and what she will be in the future. And it is not that we want to try to promote organizations that would teach us to hate one another. This bill is designed and crafted and drafted to promote opportunities for people who want to demonstrate that they care for each other and respect one another. 
The hyperlitigious nature of our civil justice system is creating a barrier, though, between the desire of Americans to help others and their ability to do so. It is empirically established. The data is there: The resignations from the boards of directors; the reluctance of volunteers to do what they wanted to volunteer to do; one out of six volunteers say they withhold services; the absence of programs that can no longer be offered; the program for battered women in Evanston that the Junior League wanted to have. You do not have diving boards at the camp. You do not have horses at the camp. 
We must free this energy in America, this impetus that says I love you and I care for you and I would like to be active in helping you but I cannot afford to risk everything I own and have, and my children's education, to do so. I would like for that desire to be fostered and lifted up, and we ought to fan that ember of hope for America and we should not douse it. 
So I believe we need the Volunteer Protection Act of 1997. I am proud to join as a cosponsor of this legislation. It will reinstate reason. It will reinstate rationality. It will reinstate certainty and fairness in a judicial system with regard to voluntarism. And I am grateful for that. The Volunteer Protection Act of 1997 covers nonprofit organizations which are defined as those organizations having a 501(c)(3) status, or nonprofit entities that are organized and conducted for public benefit and operated primarily for charitable, civic, educational, religious, welfare, or health purposes. And, if any organization is involved in criminal activity, any protection for the volunteer in that endeavor is gone. 
The volunteers are relieved of liability for simple acts of negligence, but it does not relieve the volunteer organization from liability for economic damages. This bill establishes a standard for punitive damages so there could not be outrageous levels of damages without high standards of proof. And it eliminates joint and several liability for noneconomic damages. Economic damages are those that you actually have in a monetary sense: The hospital bills, the lost wages and the like. In those settings, there is no limitation on the ability of an injured individual to go against the organization. 
This bill does say that the volunteer should not be held responsible unless she engages in criminal activity or acted in a willful and wanton way. And if that is the case, the volunteer is not protected at all, because we are not interested in protecting willful or wanton activity or criminal activity. We are trying to allow people to say to their communities and to their fellow citizens that we care enough to love you and to share ourselves with you but we do not think we ought to have to risk the entirety of our family or the well-being of our family to do so. 
With that in mind, I am pleased to support this legislation. I think, when the President of the United States asks us to engage in volunteering, he calls us to the very best that is in us. He calls us to the character of America, to rekindle a spirit of community which could be lost. He needs to call us, though, in a context which makes our response reasonable and possible. Simply, we are trying to develop a framework for reasonable participation by volunteers, protecting them and their families from a litigious system which has found Scout leaders saddled with $4 million judgments because of a touch football game; which has found a Little League coach staring down the barrel of judgments because he shifted a boy from shortstop to left field; which has found people in court because they were good enough to drive a sick citizen in their community to the hospital. 
I do not think that is the kind of community in which we want to live. We want to live in a place that puts reasonable limits on 
the exposure and risk to people who are actually giving of themselves so they can afford to extend their charity to others without destroying the future of their own families. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. ASHCROFT. I want to thank the Senator from Alabama for his outstanding remarks, and I appreciate his support of the measure, particularly in light of his experience. I commend him for his involvement in this important concept to help promote volunteering and to help foster and encourage the better impulses we have to help each other. That is what this bill is about. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I commend the Senator from Pennsylvania and the Senator from Georgia for talking about very important things that relate to the way in which we will operate as a nation, whether we sink or swim, whether we survive or succumb in the next century. I do not think Washington is the answer to the problems of this country. I don't think it is Wall Street. I think it is Main Street. It is how we respond to issues as people, what the character of America is. 
I believe we have the right character in this country. It is historically understood; it has been recognized by people around the world. Other countries don't solve problems the way Americans do, and, frankly, they don't solve them as well as we do. They reserve to Government, to the heavy hand of bureaucracy, so many things that we just like to roll up our sleeves and attend to ourselves. 
We have to be careful that our system of resolving disputes does not impair our capacity to release the energy and the creativity of the problem-solving nature of the American people. 
Over the last 30 or 40 or 50 years, we have seen a constant creep of Government and of rules about dispute resolution that has made it harder and harder for individual citizens to be involved in doing good, which is really the character of this great country. 
Alexis de Tocqueville, whose ride through America 150 years ago is being celebrated by C-SPAN this year--as a matter of fact, they are duplicating it--put it this way: America was great because her people were good. It wasn't because we had the corridors of the bureaucracy in Washington well populated, or it wasn't because the Congress was a particularly strong or effective body. It was because people were good. He talked about the fact that people formed associations and formed groups and alliances for almost every purpose in this country because free people, when they see a need, meet the need. That is what we want America to be. 
We have had so many problems recently where we found that our system for litigation has made it hard for people to solve problems. As a matter of fact, the Gallup organization conducted a poll in which it found that one out of every 10 charities surveyed said they have had trouble with litigation and it has caused people to refuse to serve on their boards of directors and the like. 
Frankly, a number of States responded to that poll, and they enacted protection for the people who are on the board of directors of the Red Cross, or the board of directors of the United Way. That was an appropriate thing to do to protect those individuals. But the average neighbor of mine is not on the board of directors of the Red Cross. My average neighbor and my own activity have more often been just in the volunteering capacity, doing the work, driving the Meals on Wheels. I have driven Meals on Wheels routes over and over again. I wasn't on the board of directors. 
It strikes me that it is appropriate to protect the folks on the board of directors, but how about the volunteer? It is OK to protect the silk-stocking folks in the boardroom, but how about the person on the front line? How about the coach of the Little League, one of the cases I previously mentioned, that was shocking to the conscience of the American people. As a matter of fact, it still almost strikes me as being humorous, the case in Runnemede, NJ, 15 years ago. 
The coach sent the kid from shortstop to left field. The mom protested: `He's a born shortstop, not a left fielder.' A fly ball came. The kid missed it, the ball hit him in the eye, and the coach got sued. 
Mr. President, we cannot have the value of male role models --and we need them desperately in our cities and our communities --and the discipline and sense of teamwork that sports provide to help people develop and have a situation where a mom can say, `Well, my son plays only shortstop and not left field, and if you put him in left field, you'll be the victim of a lawsuit.' 
I have also talked about the fellow who was the Scout leader in the Northwest, with the Cascade Pacific Council, and the boys who were playing touch football. I suppose they must have proven he was negligent for allowing the boys to play touch football. I don't think our Scoutmaster could ever get us ratcheted down below flag football. We wanted to play tackle football. Here the restraint had been exercised to play touch football, and the scoutmaster ends up with a $7 million judgment against him, because he cared enough about the young people of his community to volunteer. Yes, the courts did reduce the judgment from $7 million 
to $4 million. Well, for most folks, $4 million isn't much better than $7 million. 
It reminds me of the first time I got sued. I called my wife Janet. I said, `Good news and bad news.' 
She said, `What is the bad news?" 
I said, `We've been sued.' 
She said, `What is the good news?" 
I said, `Well, it is for $65 million.' 
It wouldn't make much difference if it was for $650, we didn't have it. 
The point is, you have folks willing to volunteer, to extend themselves, to reach out and say, `We care for those beyond our own circle,' and this is what makes America America. American communities are not defined by boundary lines and streets. They are not defined by geography and statute books. They are not defined in the property records. American communities are defined in the hearts of Americans because they are groups of people who love each other. That is probably a word some people would blanch at, someone saying on the floor of the Senate that we love each other. But that is what we mean when we say, `I'll help your son or daughter be a part of the team or scout troop,' or `I'll help them be a part of the soccer team. I love this community, and I'm willing to invest myself in it.' 
What is the price tag for investing yourself in a community now? We have a legal system that may make the price tag your own children's college education, or your car, or your house. A $4 million judgment for being a Scout leader and for somehow not stopping a touch football game among boys? That is a pretty stiff price tag to pay. 
I am reminded of the case in Evanston, IL. The Junior League wanted to set up a shelter for battered women. No insurance company would insure them. What happened? The shelter didn't happen. The insurance company said, `You have to run the shelter for 3 years before we will extend coverage. Because of the litigious nature of our society and everybody suing everybody, even the people you are trying to help turn around and sue you, and since our court allows it, we won't insure you until you have had 3 years of experience showing us you can run the shelter and what the risks will be.' 
We are still waiting for the 3 years of experience, but we don't have the shelter. We are out of whack, and we need to readjust this. We need to put it back in a framework where ordinary citizens can offer themselves. This isn't something that is localized or just a tiny fraction of the country. It is all across the United States of America. 
Here is a statement from the president of the United Way of San Francisco. I believe this was a couple of years ago:  
As fear of lawsuits drives away volunteers, it does more than threaten or lower the number of people available to charity. It threatens to bureaucratize organizations known for their hands-on approach. It would replace the personal touch with the impersonal touch of organizations afraid to be different. 
Here is an interesting article, entitled `A Thousand Points of Fright?' Not a thousand points of light. We do need for people to be points of light. I didn't think a thousand points of light was corny. I thought it was the character of America. I thought it reflected what is great about this country, the fact that we care for each other, we literally love each other enough to put aside some of our own ambitions, to set aside some of our own time to make some sacrifices. But should we make the sacrifice the ultimate sacrifice? Should we make it so that you have to risk everything that you and your family stand for? 
The article says: 
Lawsuit fears are dampening enthusiasm for volunteers, and the White House is beginning to take notice. 
I am grateful the White House is beginning to take notice. I was in Philadelphia on Sunday and on Monday, and I commend the President. I think inspiring us to be the very best we can be and 
to help each other in this culture is inspiring us to be what we ought to be as Americans. But it takes more than inspiration, especially in the context of litigation, where we might face the potential that we would make it impossible to provide for our own families, to see to it that our children have what they need, just because we cared enough about our community to do something special, something extra. 
The proposal before us says if you want to volunteer, we will provide an opportunity for you to do so in a context of reasonability. It simply says you are not going to be responsible for harm while you are delivering those services in a reasonable way. It does not relieve the organizations of responsibility. It just says that the volunteer himself or herself will not have to give up his or her family's potential in the next weeks, months, years, or decade or so, or whatever it is that would result from an extraordinary judgment. 
Over and over again, whether it is the `A Thousand Points of Fright?' article, whether it is the president of the United Way of San Francisco, whether it is the story about Runnemede, NJ, and the Little League or the story about the Cascade Pacific Council and the Scoutmaster with the $4 million judgment, we know there is a problem, and we ought to do something about it. 
We know there have been some things done, mostly to protect people in the board rooms and on the foundation governing bodies. But what happens to the average American who is not on the board but just a person who cares enough to give some of his own time or her own time, the most valuable thing? 
Perhaps more, in terms of the children of America--and the conference in Philadelphia focused on children--the thing that we lack the most is not money. The thing we lack the most for children is relationships. The Government has been spreading a lot of money around for a long time, but the kids are without role models, they are without relationships, they are without the opportunity to learn from adults. I think it is time for us to begin to provide a context in which that relationship can reappear, and that is what this bill is all about. 
This bill relieves volunteers of liability for acts which they would conduct in the course of doing what they were asked to do by charitable organizations. As it relates to the charitable organizations themselves, it establishes rules that would limit the kinds of cases in which there would be punitive damages and limits certain kinds of joint and several liability which provides a basis and a context in which we can expect to elicit far more help for people who need help in America. 
It seems to me that that is something we ought to pursue, and I think it is consistent with what the business of this body, representing the people of America, ought to talk about. 
So I am pleased to commend Senator Coverdell of Georgia for submitting this outstanding legislation, and I hope, as we work to make it an avenue for helping people help each other, that we will do the kind of job which will allow us to look back with gratitude on people who are able to help one another without the threat of a legal system making it impossible for them to serve. 
Mr. KERRY addressed the Chair.

Mr. ASHCROFT. I rise to make brief remarks about an important topic. The topic is the way in which we control our deployment of the resources of the American people. That is just another way of saying it is about spending. 
Over and over again, we come to the end of the fiscal year for the Federal Government and we are threatened with the absence of a spending plan. In the absence of a spending plan, we experience what are called Government shutdowns. It is at a time like that, when we have the potential for shutdown because we do not have any spending plan, that people begin to load up the budget with things they want. They know that the threat of a shutdown makes it more likely that things which could not pass muster on their own, which would not really be justified in the cold, hard light of reason and in the inspection and examination 
of normal debate, would be included. 
This is one of the reasons the deficit has become so high; under the pressure of the deadline and potential of a Government shutdown people are able to get spending plans enacted which simply divert resources, waste resources, and spend more resources than we have. It exacerbates the deficit; it hurts the potential of this country; it shows the absence of discipline which is indicative of the irresponsibility of the Congress. 
We should not allow that to happen. We should not put ourselves in a situation where we come to the end of the fiscal year and the President can say, if you do not put $10 billion or $11 billion or $14 billion more in the budget, I will veto the spending plan altogether, and we will end up with a shutdown and the American people will be held hostage until you agree to the plan for more spending. 
When people are held hostage the debate does not focus on the merits of spending issues, it focuses on the pain of the people who are held hostage without Government services. We desperately need to develop a way in which to handle our budget and appropriations process that does not allow the people to be held hostage by the President at the end of the year. The President should not be able to say, I will veto anything you send unless it has great expansions of programs to which you would not otherwise agree. 
It is with that in mind that I rise today to support what will be debated in this Senate, and I hope will be enacted shortly, and that is a continuing resolution. A continuing resolution is the way for us to have a spending plan which will be in place if we do not reach one in the ordinary budget and appropriations process. And it is a way of saying we will continue spending at some ratio of the previous levels, even in the absence of a budget for next year until we come to an agreement. 
The real virtue of this is simply that it will allow us to debate issues about spending in the next budget even at the close of a budget year without the potential of the American people being held hostage to a shutdown. 
I think that is a wise thing to do. That way we will look at each issue on its merits instead of looking at the pain that might be inflicted upon the country if the President vetoes a budget, shutting down the country and saying unless you do what I say, I am going to keep it shut down and see to it that these people have more injury and more pain. 
We have been through that. We had the longest shutdown in history because of disagreements between the Congress and the President. 
Now, there is a proclivity to say, well, it was the Congress' fault. Well, the Congress did pass a budget, but the President vetoed that budget. We do not want to be in that position again. So we need to put in place a continuing resolution, to do it now in the dispassionate cool of spring and not at the time at the end of the year when the President can say, well, if you do not do it my way, it is my way or the highway. You just send everything home. The people would be held hostage, and we would not really debate the issue on its merits. 
It is with that in mind I support the effort that is being made by the Senator from Texas [Mrs. Hutchison] to provide a basis for a continuing resolution. I think it is the kind of responsible Government that helps us represent the people well and keeps us from inappropriately, improperly spending the resources of taxpayers based upon demands that are made at a time when urgency causes people to make decisions that merit would not justify. 
I thank the Chair.

 Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, on July 18, 1958, through Joint Resolution 479, the Senate and the House of Representatives designated the first day of May of each year as Loyalty Day. On this special day, Americans celebrate the reaffirmation of their loyalty to the United States of America in recognition of America's unmatched heritage of freedom. I would like to join Americans across the land in this celebration, particularly the fine Americans of Climax Springs VFW Memorial Post 3600 in Climax Springs, MO. Post 3600 will have their 12th annual Loyalty Day parade on May 3, 1997. 
On this important day of reaffirming our loyalty to America, we must reflect on what it truly means to be an American. Thomas Jefferson identified the ideals so important to us when he said that all men are `endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.' Even in a time of great national trauma, Abraham Lincoln could echo these sentiments by stating that America is a nation `conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal,' and `that this nation under God shall have a new birth of freedom * * * that government of the people, by the people, for the people shall not perish from this Earth.' 
The fundamental principle in these two statements by these two great Americans is the significance of liberty in the American experience. This historical commitment to freedom, most clearly seen in the lives of those who have fought and died for our country, deserves not only our loyalty but a celebration of that loyalty. That is the essence of Loyalty Day and I urge all Americans throughout this great land to join Climax Springs VFW Post 3600 in the celebration of the freedoms God has blessed us with in America.

Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I thank you for this opportunity to make some comments in regard to this serious matter. 
None of us has any affection for chemical weapons. Each of us hates chemical weapons. We would all like to see chemical weapons abolished. None of us would like to see chemical weapons used. We would all like to believe the statements of prominent experts that have been made about this treaty. We would all like to embrace the assurances of the President that, if something goes wrong, the treaty could be something easily walked away from. 
But, in spite of all our aspirations, in spite of all of our desires, and in spite of all our hopes, there is one reality which will persist; and that reality is the language of the treaty itself. Long after the assurances have stopped echoing through this Chamber, long after the President has left office, who is trying to assuage the fears of those who have misgivings about this treaty, the black and white letters of the treaty itself will be the controlling components of what happens. And the thing that gives me great pause is that the treaty will remain. 
There are the requirements, particularly in articles X and XI of the treaty, which require us to share technology, to share information, and to share, in particular, the defensive technology of chemical weaponry. There is an anomaly in chemical weaponry which is challenging. It is that when you provide the defensive technology for chemical weapons, you are providing one of the essential components of delivering chemical weapons. No one can deliver chemical weapons, unless it is 
launched by a missile, without having to have all the technologies of how to defend against the chemistry of the weapons.

Mr. ASHCROFT. I ask for 30 additional seconds. 
If a rogue state wants to deliver chemical weapons, one of the things they need to do is to acquire the defensive technology to defend against them and to protect their own soldiers in delivery. That seems to me one of the substantial problems contained in articles X and XI. The risks far exceed the benefits. 
As a result, I think it is ill-advised for us to accept assurances which would mislead us. We need to read the treaty, and the treaty is not one which merits our approval.

Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate home schoolers in Missouri who are celebrating Missouri Home Education Week, May 4-10, 1997. As a parent and former teacher, I understand the vital importance of sound education in a child's development. The opportunities for students who achieve educational excellence are virtually limitless. 
As a U.S. Senator I fully recognize that the character and productivity of our Nation are directly linked to the quality of education provided to America's youth. Throughout my career in public service, I have been pleased to support the efforts of home schoolers to provide quality education. 
Home educators in Missouri are making an extra effort to give their children the best chance for success in an ever-changing society. They recognize the importance of family and judge home schooling to be the educational setting that is most appropriate. By personally guiding the scholastic endeavors of their children, home educators ensure that all facets of a child's development are considered when preparing them to become active, productive, and responsible citizens. 
In Missouri, home education has enjoyed considerable success in recent years because of the tremendous support received from citizens all across the State who realize the significance of family participation in the educational process. Furthermore, Missouri home schoolers are establishing one-on-one relationships with adult role models and mentors who enrich home education learning by providing hands-on business experience. This exposure to the marketplace allows home schoolers the opportunity to interact with business, community, and civic organizations. 
I commend the achievement realized by home schools in the State of Missouri and applaud your noble work on this special observance of Home Education Week in Missouri, May 4-10, 1997.

 Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, no one did more to bring peace and prosperity in our time than our 40th President, Ronald Reagan. President Reagan's economic and foreign policies gave us the longest peacetime expansion in our history and made the world safe again for democracy. But more than that, Ronald Reagan called us to our highest and best: we never spoke with more certainty or sat taller in the saddle than when Ronald Reagan was riding point. 
In his farewell address, Reagan told a wonderful story, a story of a refugee and an American sailor. In the early eighties, the U.S.S. Midway was patrolling the South China Sea when the crew happened upon a small craft, a decrepit little boat crammed with refugees trying to make their way to America. The Midway's captain sent a small launch to bring the ship to safety. And as they made their way toward the tiny vessel, a refugee glimpsed a crewman on deck and called out, `Hello, American sailor. Hello freedom man.' 
It was, as Reagan noted, `a small moment with a big meaning.' Throughout our history, America has been a nation dedicated to a proposition, a country committed to freedom--freedom of religion, of speech, of assembly, and of the press. That undying devotion has allowed us to know both wealth and power, for they are the natural fruit of the democratic ideal. From manufacturing to basic science, from aerospace to the arts, it is a material abundance and cultural vitality heretofore unseen. 
And freedom is the song America has sung across the globe whether marshaling her troops or providing resources for the Marshall plan. Five times in this century patriot's blood has been spilled in the fight for freedom around the world. That is our history, it is our common calling, it is our shared wisdom. 
And so as we stand on the verge of a new century, with the greatest technological and material advances mankind has ever known, we would do well to ask ourselves: how stands the cause of freedom? Not just in the Western Hemisphere, but around the world. For while America is safer, stronger, more prosperous today than at any time in recent history, a sound like a bell tolls softly in the night; and it warns of coming conflict. 
Mr. President, there is a destabilizing force in the Pacific rim today--and it is not the Asian democracies. There is an entity, which through its emerging economic and military might, intends to assert its power--and it is not the Asian democracies. There is a political system that sees as its enemy the free people of the world--and it is not the Asian democracies. No, the expansionist force in Asia is Communist China, a country that cares little for international law, and even less for the sacred nature of human life. 
Now, Americans have long known of the existence of evil in the human heart. And yet strangely, we are loathe to confess it. We are Jefferson's children, unrequited romantics, believers in the innate goodness of man. But experience is both the best and most expensive teacher. And it has taught us a costly lesson that I fear is being lost: `Totalitarians do not stop--they must be stopped.' 
Communist China is presently engaged in a military build-up that is as spectacular as it is unsettling. The weapon's bazaar open for business in Beijing includes a blue water navy and a 21st century air force that will give China the capacity to exercise power throughout the Pacific. Russia alone has sold billions of dollars of military technology to the Chinese, including cruise missile(s) capable of defeating the antimissile defenses of the United States Navy. 
These force-projection technologies are not about provid[ing] for the common defense; they are about providing an uncommon capacity to project power. They threaten not just the democracies of Asia, but the American sailors of the 7th Fleet who in the name of peace call the waters of the South China Sea home. 
Just as troubling as Beijing's buying binge is its decision to sell missile and nuclear technology to Pakistan, Syria, and Iran. Over time, this equipment will allow each to produce bomb-grade uranium. Now, China contends that the sales are nothing more than a mutually agreeable exchange between sovereign nations. But the dispatch of cruise missiles to Iran has placed United States forces in harm's way. For let us recall that it was a lesser version of this same missile that took the lives of 37 American sailors aboard the U.S.S. Stark. 
As if this were not enough, Communist China has undertaken another drive: a campaign of persecution and repression aimed at crushing internal dissent. Beijing's policies of torture, arbitrary arrest, and execution in Tibet have made horror ordinary. 
Today, the President has an opportunity to challenge state persecution and champion individual freedom by formally receiving the Dalai Lama. Unfortunately, administration thinking on his visit seems as muddled as our China policy itself. Why is it that the President has an open door policy for Chinese arms dealers, but the Dalai Lama must be slipped through the White House back door? We should embrace the people of China who yearn to breathe free, not toast the tyrants who ordered tanks into Tiananmen Square. 
Or, consider the case of Bishop Su. Hung from the ceiling by his wrists, Su was battered time and again about the head until all but unconscious. He was then placed in a cell filled with water where he was left for days, unable to sit or [to] sleep. Tragically, Su is but one of untold hundreds that have been beaten and killed. Their high crime? A fidelity to God and the desire to exercise that devotion. 
And who will condemn such barbarism? The administration has made not a sound. Well, I would respectively remind them that to sin by silence makes cowards out of men; and an act of cowardice this great has not been seen since Hemingway's Macumber heard the lion's roar. 
As for United States exporters, there is little denying trade with China has been of great value. United States goods and services exports to China have increased from $3.5 billion to over $14 billion in the last decade alone. From power generation equipment to automotive parts, China has pursued Western consumer goods as a means by which to fuel its military expansion. The West has willingly obliged. But at what cost, and to what end? 
Chinese import duties are still five times higher on average than those imposed by the U.S. and quadruple those of Japan. Nearly half of Chinese imports are subject to further barriers. And certain key industries such as electronics, aircraft, and telecommunications are shielded from competition altogether. It would seem that 18th century mercantilism is alive and well in 20th century China. 
Mr. President, China's trade policies are about selective market access that ensure merchandise trade deficits as far as the eye can see; on human rights, Beijing is showing the world a reign of terror unparalleled in the post-cold-war era; and a tour of the Pacific rim's horizon finds a Chinese defense buildup aimed at achieving superpower status at the Asian democracies, expense. 
So what, then, is to be done? Just a decade ago, the vast majority of the Congress seemed to understand who our enemies were and why. But some in Washington today seem confused about what is a decent political system and what is not, which philosophies should be embraced or rejected, what is right and what is wrong. 
We will never tame the Chinese dragon--no more than we subdued the Soviet bear--with the policies of appeasement. The way to bring China into the community of nations, as Michael Ledeen and others have argued, is to talk truthfully and forcefully about the evils found there; challenge Beijing to grant more political and economic freedom to its people; and maintain a military superiority that makes the cost of conflict too high. 
There is an old Chinese proverb which says, `When you want to test the depth of a stream, do not use both feet.' To end diplomatic ties and cease trading with the most populous nation on Earth would be the march of folly. I do believe, however, that we must look anew at both the granting of most favored nation [MFN] status as well as China's acceptance into the World Trade Organization [WTO]. 
For we are now approaching a critically important stage in United States-Sino relations as a new generation of leadership leaps forward. They must know that adventurism in Asia will meet a firm response. They must know we will not sanction the injuries and usurpations that the Chinese people have suffered at the hands of the state. They must know that we will support and defend democracy. 
The theme is freedom. And the fundamental principle upon which we should base U.S. trade policy is this: Truly free trade can only exist between free peoples. And the Chinese who watched treachery take hold in Tiananmen are most certainly not free. 
More than 300 years before the U.S.S. Midway patrolled the South China Sea, there was a great Puritan migration to a land called America. And on board a very different ship, the Arbella, John Winthrop preached a sermon entitled, `A Modell of Christian Charity.' In it, he laid out his expectations for the new colony; he spoke that, `every man might have need of other' and of a world `knit more nearly together by the bond of brotherly affection.' 
Winthrop was an early freedom man and his, like Reagan's, was a transcendent vision. The society he foresaw was a true commonwealth, a community in which each person put the good of the whole ahead of private concern. It should not surprise us, then, that Winthrop's words upon arriving in America were some of Reagan's most frequently quoted: `We shall be a city upon a hill, the eyes of all people are upon us.' 
Well, the eyes of all people are upon us again. And the question they ask? Will America continue to stand for freedom? Or, will she fall captive to policies born of confusion and conciliation. The answer we send will tell much about how brightly our city still shines. 
For we stand on the cusp of a new and exciting age. By all accounts, this has been the American century. The ideals that light our city have found comfort's warm embrace across the globe; democracy has triumphed; market capitalism reigns supreme. But alas, China's shadow looms large. And the decisions of today will determine whether America alone will shape the tomorrows in which we live. So let us resolve to once again hoist up the flag of freedom. Let us resolve to extol the virtues of democracy to all who will listen. And not because democracy is our form of government, but because democracy is the only peaceful form of government. With the hope that one day the long tug of memory might look favorably upon us as we look approvingly on the generations who answered freedom's call in decades passed.

Mr. ASHCROFT. I appreciate the opportunity to spend a few moments speaking about two of America's values. They are values that are embraced by people across our Nation from sea to shining sea, but sometimes those values come into conflict. When they come into conflict, how we resolve that particular conflict will depend on how well we succeed in the next century, how capable we are of carrying on at the high level of performance that America has always expected and that the world has always admired. 
I speak about two values, and I do not think there are two values that are more highly or intensely admired in America than these. The first one is the value we place on our families. We understand that more than anything else the family is an institution where important things are learned, not just knowledge imparted but wisdom is obtained and understood in a family which teaches us not just how to do something but teaches us how to live. 
A second value which is a strong value in America and reflects our heritage is the value of work. Americans admire and respect work. We are a culture that says if you work well, you should be paid well. If you have merit, you should be rewarded. If you take risks and succeed, that is the engine that drives America forward. 
When you have this value of family and the value of work both motivating a society, it is good news for the culture and I think America has a bright future. But sometimes these values collide. When the demands of work somehow get so intense that they impair our ability to do with our families what we ought to do, then we feel tension because we have these two important components of the American character that are bumping into each other. 
Most of us as Americans know that we are working hard enough now that there are many times when we simply feel we are not spending the time we ought to with our families. If you will look at the data that has been assembled by the pollsters and everyone else who takes the temperature of the American public regularly, you will find out that most Americans would like to be able to spend more time with their families, and that most Americans are spending far less time with their families than they used to, 
and that most Americans are spending more time on the job than they used to. The number of hours we are devoting to our enterprises and our work is going up, and we feel a tension with the way in which we value our families. Sometimes we feel like we have been sacrificing our families. 
So one of the things that faces us as a culture, as a community, as a country is, how are we going to resolve these tensions? I think that is one of the jobs, that we have to try and make sure we build a framework where people can resolve those tensions and where Government somehow does not have rules or interference that keeps people from resolving those tensions. 
For example, there are a lot of times when an individual would say on Friday afternoon to his boss or her boss, `My daughter is getting an award at the high school assembly today. Can I have an extended lunch hour, maybe just 1 hour so that I can see my daughter get the award? I would like to reinforce, I would like to give her an `atta girl,' I would like to hug her and say, `You did a great job, this is the way you ought to work and conduct yourself, it is going to mean a lot to yourself and our family and our country if you keep it up.' 
Right now, it is illegal for the boss to say, `I will let you take an hour on Friday and you can make it up on Monday,' because it is in a different 40-hour week. You cannot trade 1 hour for 1 hour from one week to the next. That will make one week a 41-hour week and will go into overtime calculation. Since most bosses do not want to be involved in overtime, it just does not happen. 
What we have is a situation where parents are in a bind. They want to deal with their family, they want to deal with them effectively. Lots of employers would like to help the parent do that, but here is the Government standing and saying, `That's illegal.' 
One of the reasons the Government says that is illegal is because we crafted our labor laws about what can be done and what cannot be done back in the 1930's. A lot of us cannot even remember the 1930's, but they were tough times. We did not have the commitment to flexibility in the 1930's that we have now. We thought the 40-hour week was something that had to be rigid. Only one out of six mothers of school-age children was in the work force in the 1930's--one out of six. That is about 18 percent. Now we have between 70 and 80 percent of the mothers of school-age children in the work force. 
As a result, we live in a different culture. We live in an entirely different world, and these individuals, mothers and fathers, are feeling the stress of not being able to have an ability to accommodate the needs of the family and also pursue the value of work, which we valued so highly and reflected in this body last year when we had welfare reform. We said, `You don't get welfare if you are not willing to go to work,' and we want to value work. But we want to have a way so when we have work as being a primary focus of this culture, it also allows us the flexibility to do well with our families because we understand that it is in families that people build the habits of success, that will ultimately carry ourself and our communities. 
This tension between the workplace and the home place, juxtaposed or set in a framework of laws created in the 1930's that does not allow us flexibility, is a problem. For example, you might be asked to do overtime over and over and over again, and you do overtime, and then you are paid time and a half for your overtime. But at some point, most Americans come to the conclusion, my goodness, no matter how much pay I get, I still need some time, and I would like to take some time off, instead of getting time and a half in pay. I think it might be a good idea to say, if you want time and a half off some week in the future so you can spend time with your kids and make up for lost time, or go on a vacation or go to a parent-teacher conference, you might be able to say to your employer, `Instead of paying me time and a half in wages, you ought to let me take time and a half off sometime.' If the employer agreed to it voluntarily--both parties--we ought to let that happen. It is against the law. The law passed in the 1930's, when we were more rigid and had different conditions in this country, says if you work overtime, you must be paid time and a half; you cannot take comp time or compensatory time off. 
Some employers even want to go so far as to help their families by saying instead of doing 1 week for 40 hours, we would be willing, if you wanted to and on a voluntary basis, let the worker average 40 hours over a 2-week period regularly, so you would only work 9 days in the 2 weeks, but you would work 45 hours the first week and 35 hours the second week and have every other Friday off so you could take the kids to the dentist or drop by the department of motor vehicles and get the car licensed or visit the governmental offices that are not open on Saturday. It is against the law to do that now. 
What I have described are three problems: One, the comp time problem that you can only get comp time in money not in time; two, flextime; sometimes you need to trade 1 hour one week for another hour the next week; and three, to schedule flexibly so you might be on a regular schedule that allowed you to take 
time off with regularity. 
All three of these things are available in the Federal Government and for governmental entities. Since 1978, the Federal Government has said it is OK to swap comp time off instead of overtime pay. The Federal Government said it is OK to have a flextime bank so if you need to take time off you can take some time off if you put some extra hours in the bank. It is also said if you want to have some flexible scheduling so that every other Friday or every other Monday is off, that is something we can work with you on. 
It is totally voluntary--voluntary for the worker, it is voluntary for the Federal Government employer or administrator. Neither can force the other because we do not want to force people to work overtime or take comp time, but we want to allow Americans to make choices which will help them resolve the tensions between the home place and the workplace, these two values that are in competition. 
I tell you, it has worked so well in the Federal Government that it is almost unbelievable. When the General Accounting Office did one of its surveys, and the only survey really that has been done on the subject, 76 percent of the workers said they liked it. Only 7 percent said they did not like it. That is better than a 10-to-1 ratio. Frankly, you cannot interview people in Washington and get that much agreement on the fact that today is Thursday. That is an overwhelming endorsement, and I think it is high time that we gave to the American public generally what governmental workers have had for almost 20 years now, 19 1/2 years. Since 1978, Federal workers have had this ability to say on a voluntary basis, `I would like to take some time off instead of getting the overtime pay,' and the time off would come at time and a half. Or, `I would like to work an extra hour this week so I can take an hour off next week and put it in a flextime bank.' Or, if the worker and employer could agree, `I sure would like to schedule it so I work 9 hours a day for 5 days this week and only work 35 hours next week so I can take off all of Friday, every other Friday.' 
These potentials, which exist for Federal workers, it occurs to me, ought to be able to be available to workers in the private sector as well, were we not to be locked into the hard and fast rules of the 1930's. That was a time when Henry Ford said, `You can have your Ford any color you want so long as it is black.' Things were not quite as flexible then as they are now, and families did not need the flexibility then as they do now. With 70 to 80 percent of all mothers of school-age children now working and two parents working in all those settings, and the tension between work and home, I think we ought to have more flexibility at the option of both the employer and the worker, only when it is agreed to. 
That is really the subject of the Family Friendly Workplace Act which I proposed this year and I believe we will be working on and actually voting on in the next 30 days. It is a way of saying we need to allow families to work out the conflict that exists between these important values that are crucial and so fundamental to the success of this culture in the next century, not just fundamental to the success of our culture, but fundamental to the success of our own families. 
We were aware when we put this bill together that we did not want to allow any employer to be overbearing or coercive, either directly or indirectly, in this respect, so we put in tough penalties. We doubled the penalties that would attend any violation of overtime rules. Not only that, if a worker says, `I think I would like to have time off at time-and-a-half rates instead of being paid time and a half,' and then the worker changes his or her mind, of course, before taking the time off, the worker would have the right to cash the time in at any time. The law provides that if at the end of the year the worker has not taken the time off, the employer has to pay time and a half anyhow. It is designed to make sure there is no coercion and voluntary for both workers and employers, but it is designed as well to be flexible. 
Some people thought having family and medical leave would be the answer. There is a law that says you can take time off to meet your family's needs, but you have to take it off without pay. I think that really is a tough situation, because the workers are put in a circumstance where, in order to relieve the family tension, he or she has to increase the financial tension. Well, the financial tension is what has driven people into the workplace in the first instance. 
I believe we should not have to take a pay cut in order to be a good mom or dad in America. If we would allow for flexible working arrangements, a worker could have a bank of time they have earned in advance that they could use as flextime or they could take some of the time in your bank that you put in at time and a half for comp time and you could meet your family needs that way without taking a pay cut. Simply, the Family and Medical Leave Act says you can leave without pay. I think we ought to have the Family Friendly Workplace Act which says you do not have to take a pay cut in order to be a good mom or dad in America. 
Well, this is the situation. I believe if you ask people, 
they will tell you they need this. President Clinton commissioned a study by the Labor Department. The report was entitled `Working Women Count,' and that report, headed by the Clinton Labor Department, said the No. 1 thing we want is more ability to harmonize, to accommodate the needs of our families and workers. The President himself has recognized this. There was a small portion of Federal Government workers that have not been covered since 1978, and when he took office in the early nineties, he said, `I'll cover them,' and he issued an Executive order which extended the benefits to these workers. 
I think it is time for America to prepare for the next century, and perhaps it may be a little scary for some people to just loosen their grip a little bit on the 1930's, but we do not live that way anymore. The truth of the matter is, we need flexibility. As long as we have a framework of protections and we guard against abuse and we make it voluntary for both employers and employees, I think it is time we said to the American people generally, you can have the same benefits that the Federal Government employees have had since 1978, you can work to accommodate these competing needs that tug and pull you, the need to have a good work situation and the need to meet the needs of your family. 
When we address these issues on the floor of the Senate, I hope we will have an overwhelming vote that sends the American work force into the next century with a sense of optimism and a sense of being able to accommodate these competing values, values of their families and home place and values of industry and the workplace. 
Mr. President, I thank you very much.

Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, thank you. 
Mr. President, I want to thank my colleague from Oklahoma for his excellent statement on this issue. I appreciate his leadership on this issue. When this legislation was initially filed last year, I was not aware of the fact that he had previously included it in other matters. But he has been a leader in respecting the will of the American people not to participate in the funding of assisted suicide. 
Mr. President, I might add as well that while House bill 1003 is largely consistent and almost totally compatible with the bill that Senator Dorgan and I filed here in the U.S. Senate, the House added some provisions which I think improve the measure. Both bills were narrowly and tightly drawn and focused on the fact that we didn't believe there should be Federal funding for assisted suicide. 
The House measure includes provisions designed to reduce the rate of suicide, including assisted suicide, among persons with disabilities or terminal or chronic illness, by furthering knowledge and practice of pain management, depression identification, palliative care, and other issues related to suicide prevention. The bill would amend the Public Health Service Act to use existing Federal funds to establish research, training, and demonstration projects intended to help achieve the goal of reducing the rate of suicide. That would also, of course, include reducing the rate of individuals interested in assisted suicide. It also includes a provision directing the General Accounting Office to analyze the effectiveness and achievements of the grant programs that are authorized by the Public Health Service Act. 
So, resources now available to the public through the Public Health Service Act can be used in accordance with this measure to reduce the rate of suicide. It is important for us not just to be concerned about Federal funding for suicide, but where possible to help individuals understand the potential for hope in the situation rather than despair. 
I might just also point out that assisted suicide and the potential for assisted suicide or funding for assisted suicide in a culture are not really conducive to the development of other therapies. It is interesting to note that Justice Breyer pointed out a number of important facts during the Supreme Court's recent oral arguments regarding the right to assisted suicide. He indicated that supportive services for vulnerable patients remain undeveloped once a society has accepted assisted suicide as a quick and easy solution for their problems. In particular, he noted that in England, which prohibits assisted suicide, there are over 180 hospices for people who are terminally ill; 180 facilities designed for compassionate care to help these people. In a sense, each of us is terminally ill. Each of us ultimately will die. In the Netherlands, on the other hand, which allows assisted suicide, 
rather than having 180 hospices, they have only 3. 
It may be inappropriate to draw a conclusion here, but it seems to me that once a culture decides that the thing to do with terminally-ill patients is to help them die quickly, they neglect and otherwise refuse to develop the kinds of institutions which would help people who really ought to live and want to live and have many things to contribute. 
It is with that in mind that I think it is peculiarly and singularly important that this Congress respond to the voice of the American people, which with near unanimity is calling for us to prohibit Federal funding of assisted suicide. It is with that in mind that I urge my colleagues to join by voting in favor of this proposal. 
Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.

Mr. ASHCROFT. The Senator from Minnesota suggests that these are merely sense-of-the-Senate amendments and that they would not impair the progress of the bill substantially. If by adding these amendments to the bill we send the bill to conference, we delay substantially our ability to move this legislation to the President of the United States for his signature. 
Throughout our comments and remarks, I think it has been clear we are simply at present awaiting judicial decisions which might authorize on a momentary basis Federal funding of assisted suicide, so that it is crucial we not delay this process. And sending this measure to conference would in fact delay the process. 
Second, I should indicate that this is not a measure which is designed to prohibit assisted suicide. Some suggestions seem to have been made that this is a measure which would attempt to control whether or not States could authorize assisted suicide or whether they could fund it on their own or whether we would be intervening by this legislation in the capacity of States to determine what is appropriate or inappropriate for their citizens. Nothing could be further from the truth. 
This is not a measure that relates to the commission of suicide. It relates to Federal funding of assisted suicide. This bill--and many people think it unfortunate it would not--does not prevent Kevorkian from acting. That would be controlled by local jurisdictions and what the law in those jurisdictions is. So that the alleged relevance of some of the proposed amendments simply is not consistent with the content of the measure. 
I think it is important for us to understand we ought to act quickly. We are fortunate that the courts have not already authorized Federal payments for assisted suicide. But for the injunction of a court in Oregon, that would have been the case, according to the director of Medicaid and the Health Services Commission chair in Oregon. And now the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals has overturned that lower court's decision and the matter is still suspended in the limbo of the legal proceedings. But as soon as the ninth circuit's opinion would become final, the Oregon officials have indicated they intend to call for Federal resources to participate in the funding of what they call `comfort care.' I would be uncomfortable myself to receive the `comfort care' offered there. 
But it is, in my judgment, a matter of importance that we act promptly, that we act with dispatch. The attempt to bring unrelated issues to this measure is counterproductive, particularly inasmuch as it is likely to send this legislation to conference and to delay substantially the ability to move the will of the American people into the law of the American people, and that will is that we not fund with Federal resources assisted suicide. 
Madam President, I observe the absence of a quorum.

 Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I rise to condemn the resurgence of terrorism against Israel. We have all watched with concern as a seemingly strong peace process has been assaulted with senseless acts of violence. Most troubling to me is the role Palestinian leadership has played in facilitating that terrorism. Yasser Arafat's failure to combat consistently terrorist activity in territory administered by the Palestinian Authority is the greatest single threat to achieving a lasting peace settlement in the Middle East. 
In the last few years, the Palestinian Authority has allowed terrorist attacks to reach atrocious levels of violence before finally responding to suppress these criminals. In 1996, four suicide bombings in Israel killed 59 people before Mr. Arafat got serious about combating terrorist networks in Palestinian territory. The Palestinian Authority arrested Islamic extremists, censored mosque sermons, and finally jailed almost all known operatives of Hamas and Islamic Jihad. The crackdown was successful and resulted in almost a year of silence from Hamas. 
Last week's suicide bombing in Tel Aviv broke that silence, however, and revived longstanding concerns about Arafat's willingness to use terrorism as a tool of leverage in the peace process. Beginning last August, Arafat gradually released 120 of 200 Islamic activists that Israel identified as security threats. Of those 120 activists, 16 were allegedly involved in terrorist acts that killed Israelis. To make matters worse, Arafat permitted five of the known terrorists to enter his security forces in Gaza and appointed a Hamas spokesman, Emad Falouji, to his Cabinet. Arafat also hired Adnan Ghol, one of Israel's most wanted Hamas terrorists for building the bomb used in a bus attack last year, to serve in his intelligence service in Gaza. 
In his visit to the United States in early March, Arafat was warned by the United States of the danger of releasing known terrorists. Such warnings went unheeded as Arafat returned to Palestine and promptly released the most senior remaining terrorist leader, Ibrahim Maqadmeh. Maqadmeh could very well have been involved in the March 21 Tel Aviv suicide bombing. Arafat claims his release of terrorist operatives is meant to bring all elements of Palestinian society into the peace process, but it is clear that such actions merely give a green light to terrorist attacks. 
Mr. President, I am troubled by the deterioration of the Middle East peace process and alarmed by the release of known terrorists from Palestinian jails. Terrorists are not welcome at the table of peace, and I call upon the Clinton administration to address this issue more forcefully in future discussions with Palestinian officials. The April 10 joint raid by Israeli and Palestinian security forces on a Hamas terrorist cell in the West Bank is a constructive step to rebuild security cooperation between Israel and the Palestinian Authority. It is my sincerest hope that Yasser Arafat and the Palestinian Authority will suppress terrorism at every turn and consistently adopt policies that preserve the security of both Israel and the occupied territories. When Palestinian terrorism ends, sincere negotiations for a lasting peace can truly begin.

Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, rarely do we see a showing of bipartisan agreement similar to the one we witnessed last Thursday when the House of Representatives voted 398 to 16 to pass H.R. 1003, the Assisted Suicide Funding Restriction Act. I look forward to the same showing of bipartisanship today as the Senate considers identical legislation. Except for a minimum of differences, H.R. 1003 is substantively the same as S. 304, which Senators Dorgan, Nickles, and I introduced in February; 33 Senators are now cosponsors of this bill, which simply says and directs that Federal tax dollars shall not be used to pay for or to promote assisted suicide. 
This bill is urgently needed to preserve the intent of our Founding Fathers. The integrity of our Federal programs serving the elderly and seriously ill are at stake without this measure. These are programs which were intended to support and enhance health and human life, not to promote their destruction. Government's role in our culture should be to call us to our highest and our best. Government has no place in hastening Americans to their graves. However, our court system is on the brink of allowing Federal taxpayer funding for assisted suicide. 
On February 27, the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reinstated Oregon's law known as Measure 16. It was the first law in America to authorize the dispensation or the giving of lethal drugs to terminally ill patients to assist in their suicide. Oregon's previous Medicaid director and its Health Services Commission chair have both said independently that once assisted suicide is legal--in other words, when the legal obstacles have been cleared away--assisted suicide would be covered by the State's Medicaid plan, which is paid for in part by Federal taxpayers, individuals from all across America. According to the Oregon authorities, the procedure will be listed on Medicaid reimbursement forms under what I consider to be a misleading but grotesque euphemism. The administration of lethal chemicals to end the lives of individuals will be listed as comfort care. 
Although the ninth circuit ruling is subject to further appeals, Oregon may soon begin drawing down Federal taxpayer funds to pay for assisted suicide unless we, the representatives of the people, take action to pass the Assisted Suicide Funding Restriction Act. 
Additionally, a Florida court recently found a right to assisted suicide in the State's constitution on the right to privacy. If upheld by the Florida State Supreme Court, this decision would raise the question of State funding for assisted suicide. Such actions would implicate Federal funding in matching programs, just as would the situation in Oregon, programs such as Medicaid. And they would raise questions about the permissibility of assisted suicide in federally owned health care institutions in that State. 
So action in Congress is needed at this time to preempt and proactively prevent this imminent Federal funding of assisted suicide which effectively may take place at any moment in the event that the courts clear the way in regard to the situation in Oregon and in Florida. 
It is important to note that there was overwhelming approval for this measure in the House of Representatives. As I stated earlier, the House passed this measure by a resounding vote of 398 to 16. Shortly after that vote, the White House issued a policy statement saying, `The President has made it clear that he does not support assisted suicides. The Administration, therefore, does not oppose enactment of H.R. 1003, which would reaffirm current Federal policy prohibiting the use of Federal funds to pay for assisted suicides and euthanasia.' In light of these events, the Senate should act swiftly to pass this legislation so that it will become the law of the land. 
I would like to give the legislative history for the Assisted Suicide Funding Restriction Act in order to respond to some people who might say that the Senate is taking up this legislation too quickly. 
The Assisted Suicide Funding Restriction Act is not new. It has received more than adequate consideration. It was introduced in both Houses in the last session of Congress. On April 29 of last year the House held hearings. On February 12, 1997, the Senate introduced its bill. On March 6, the House held hearings on the topic of `Assisted Suicide: Legal, Medical, Ethical and Social Issues.' On March 11, 1997, the House introduced legislation. On March 13, the House Commerce Committee Subcommittee on Health and Environment met in open markup session and approved H.R. 1003 for full committee consideration. On March 18 the bill was ordered favorably reported by the Ways and Means Subcommittee to the full committee by a voice vote. Because he found the legislation to be noncontroversial, Chairman Archer decided that a markup in the full Ways and Means Committee was unnecessary, and he turned out to be a prophet in suggesting its lack of controversy when in fact on April 10 the House of Representatives passed the measure by a vote of 398 to 16. 
Of course, the House legislation is virtually identical to S. 304, and the intention of the bill simply is to say that we do not think it appropriate that funds which were gathered and taxed in order to provide medical assistance to individuals to enhance their lives should be used to end their lives. 
It is important also, though, to take a look and clearly develop an understanding of what this bill does not do. While it is clear that the Assisted Suicide Funding Restriction Act prevents Federal funding and Federal payment for or promotion of assisted suicide, it is also just as important to understand there are things this bill is not designed to do. This is a proposal that is very limited and very modest. 
No. 1, it does not in any way forbid a State to legalize assisted suicide or even to provide its own funds for assisted suicide. It simply says Federal resources are not to be used to promote or conduct assisted suicides. After passage of this bill, States might choose to legalize or fund assisted suicide, but they would not be able to draw on Federal resources normally drawn upon in joint efforts between the State and the Federal Government for the provision of health services. 
No. 2, this bill also does not attempt to resolve the constitutional issue that the Supreme Court considered in January when it heard the cases of Washington versus Glucksberg and Vacco versus Quill. Those cases involved the question of whether there is a right to assisted suicide or whether there is a right to euthanasia. 
This bill does not try to answer that complex question. This bill simply says the Federal Government should not be involved in funding or paying for assisted suicides or paying for the promotion of assisted suicide. 
As the bill's rule of construction clearly provides as well, it does not affect abortion. It is not designed to deal with the question of abortion. Members of this body have a widely divergent set of views on that important issue, as I do personally, but this bill is not designed to affect that issue. It does not affect complex issues such as the withholding or withdrawing 
life-sustaining treatment, even of nutrition and hydration. Those issues are not affected by this measure. 
Nor does this legislation affect the dispensation of large doses of drugs that are designed to ease the pain of terminal illness. We know that virtually all medical procedures have some risk of not achieving the therapeutic impact desired but as a matter of fact may impair the health of an individual. This bill is not designed for those situations and instances. This bill is designed to prohibit Federal funding of the administration of lethal doses of drugs and other methods used for the purposes of assisting in suicide or for using Federal funding to promote such assisted suicide. 
It is with that in mind that we believe there should be a broad bipartisan consensus which will support this bill and we hope will carry it forward in a way similar to the way in which the House of Representatives has so done. This legislation has wide support from the public and important organizations as well and has wide support in the Senate. 
It is crystal clear to me and I think to most around us that the American people do not want their tax dollars spent on dispensing toxic drugs with the sole intent of assisting suicide. Recently, a national Wirthlin poll showed that 87 percent of the public opposed such a use of public funds. We would be derelict in our duty were we to allow a few officials in one or two States to command the taxpayers of all the other jurisdictions in America to subsidize the practice of assisted suicide, especially when that practice is against the intention of the individuals in those other States. 
The Assisted Suicide Funding Restriction Act has been endorsed by such groups as the American Medical Association and the National Conference of Catholic Bishops, both of which have submitted letters of support to the Congress.

Mr. ASHCROFT. Additionally, groups such as the National Right to Life, the American Geriatrics Society, Family Research Council and Physicians for Compassionate Care have endorsed this legislation, and nearly one-third of the Senate has signed on as cosponsoring the Assisted Suicide Funding Restriction Act, 33 Senators from both sides of the aisle. I am confident that our vote later today will prove that an even greater number of Senators will support and do support this measure. 
This is not just something which I feel should be prohibited because most Americans are against it. I feel it is wrong for Kevorkian's house calls to be paid for by Federal tax dollars. The next time Kevorkian decides to end a life, we should not foot the bill. And unless we take action, that can happen. 
I feel it is wrong and would argue against allowing for assisted suicide altogether. In cultures where the focus is on assisted suicide, there is not much emphasis on how to ease pain or how to help people confront those life-ending illnesses through hospice programs. There are some dramatic differences among European countries that have differing policies on assisted suicide. England, which prohibits assisted suicide, has a substantial effort directed at helping people in the terminal stages of disease, while the Netherlands, which allows assisted suicide, has not made such efforts. 
So public policy in this arena does make a difference, and it makes a difference on moral grounds. Really, we are focused on very narrow grounds in this particular instance. We are focused on the idea of whether or not tax resources of the Federal Government should be used to assist in suicide. 
Obviously, there are practical reasons not to allow Federal funding for assisted suicide. There are cases, many of them in the literature, where there was an improper diagnosis, so that it appeared there was a terminal disease but when someone's autopsy was conducted after an assisted suicide, it was found it was not a terminal disease. 
That is a mistake which is irreversible. I believe that for us to fund assisted suicides is to be involved in an extremely risky business; it is to deny the will of the people of the United States; it is to engage in the ending of life rather than the enrichment of life, which is what these medical programs were all about when they were created and funded in the Congress. 
I believe it is clear we should signal our intention, an intention consistent with the President of the United States, who has basically endorsed this measure after its passage by the House, consistent with the American Medical Association and a wide variety of other groups that indicate that Federal funding of assisted suicide would be inappropriate. 
Our Government's role should be to protect and preserve human life. Federal health programs such as Medicare and Medicaid should provide a means to care for and protect our citizens, not become vehicles for their destruction. The Assisted Suicide Funding Restriction Act will ensure that our policy in this area will continue. 
Today, the Senate has an opportunity to act proactively, to take the right steps in advance of these threats which are imminent but are not quite upon us, the threat that these legal obstacles might be cleared away and we would be called upon to participate in the funding of assisted suicide under something as misleading and grotesque as the concept of `comfort care' in the State of Oregon. 
Today, the Senate has an opportunity to act responsibly before the situation arises in which Federal health care dollars would be used to end the lives of citizens of this country. I urge my colleagues to join together to pass the Assisted Suicide Funding Restriction Act. 
We should not hook up Dr. Kevorkian to the U.S. Treasury, especially when he tries to sever the lifeline to individuals who are in distress. The next time Dr. Kevorkian makes a house call, taxpayers should not foot the bill. It is time for us to respond to what we know the American people's desire to be. It is time for us to say we will not allow the use of Federal funds to assist in suicide.

Mr. ASHCROFT. Likewise, I would like to extend my thanks and the thanks, I believe, of the American people, to Senator Dorgan for taking this important step and for having the foresight to do it in advance of some commitment of the Treasury. We are perilously close to having Federal funds used in this respect. A court decision stands between us and that potential. But having the foresight to prepare in advance is appropriate, and I thank him for his excellent work. 
I am pleased to note that there are others who want to speak on this issue. I look forward to hearing Senator Hutchinson's remarks. 
I would just say that one of the reasons I am not eager to see Federal funding provide the resource for assisted suicide is that in so many cases that I have known, the diagnosis was missed. It seems to me particularly tragic to think you would seek to fund a suicide on one set of facts and to find out that it was not the case. 
I am reminded of a case reported in the Washington Post--and I make reference to it and will submit it for inclusion in the Record--from July 29, 1996. 
A twice-divorced, 39 year-old mother of two from California, allegedly suffering from multiple sclerosis, checked into a Quality Inn and received a lethal injection--becoming the most recent person to die with Dr. Kevorkian's help. Though her death warranted little notice nationwide, authorities at least had one major question. 
According to the doctor who autopsied her body--`She doesn't have any evidence of medical disease.' The county medical examiner said in an interview, `I can show you every slice from her brain and spinal cord,' obviously, from the pathology reports, `and she doesn't have a bit of MS. She looked robust, fairly healthy. Everything else is in order. Except she's dead.' 
From the Washington Times, Tuesday, October 1, 1996, another individual, Richard Faw, who reportedly suffered from terminal colon cancer. 
The medical examiner wrote: `There was some residual cancer in the colon but none present in the kidney, lungs or liver. . .' He went on to say, `He could have lived another 10 years, at least.' 
It seems to me it would be particularly ironic to be forced to spend resources that we have committed to protecting and preserving health if we were to be committing those resources unduly and inappropriately based on mistaken diagnoses to destroy individuals.

Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, it has been said that America is a city on a hill, a special example for the rest of the world to observe--a place of hope, a place of opportunity--what America is and ought to be. But it might be said that if we are a city, we are in need of urban renewal. We need to restart our engine, to regenerate the potential for growth, for the development of opportunity in this culture. 
Economic growth has been the idea, it has been the mechanism whereby America could find a special place of opportunity, where America could be that particular country that said: 
Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses, yearning to breathe free, the wretched refuse of your teeming shore. Send these, the homeless tempest tossed, to me. 
With what the writer of that great poem inscribed on the Statue of Liberty, America could proudly proclaim, `I lift my lamp beside the golden door.' 
America has been a place of opportunity because it has been a place of growth, with an understanding that we could always grow our way through problems. Growth has been that marvelous key toward providing some new hope for individuals. Individuals from anywhere and everywhere at all times in our history have provided a part of the stream of a growing America, a set of opportunities that is the envy of the world. Yet what is happening and has happened to our growth? What has happened to our culture? Working families are being stressed. They get up early. They work hard. They sacrifice time with each other and with their children, and they seem to have less and less to show for it. They are squeezed not just financially but as families. 
What is the reason? Why is that we as a culture find ourselves laboring under this weight rather than soaring with the opportunity characteristic of our heritage? 
I think we have a tax load that is weighing down individuals in this culture, and it is a major one. It is simple. It is not hard to understand. The most recent issue of Baron's magazine, which is a magazine that monitors business activity and government and families and opportunity, spells out the tremendous tax load--heavier at this moment in history than at any other time in the history of America. It is interesting to note that we were able to spend our way out of the Great Depression with lower tax rates than we now have. We were able to make the world safe for democracy or to work toward making it in the First World War. We were able to defeat the onerous and terrible power of Nazi Germany in the Second World War with lower tax rates than we have now. 
Big government is taking so much of the working wages of Americans that Americans no longer have the resources to spend on themselves that they need. 
The family budget in 1955, for example, was 27.7 percent in total taxes. Now the total taxes of the average American family is well over 38 percent. And you are well aware of the fact that we spend more on taxes than we do on food, clothing, and shelter combined. We need to take a look at what we are spending and how we are deploying it, to see what has happened to what we thought were our wage increases. We have had a lot of wage increases, but we end up with less and less. It turns out that the wage increase for America has been stolen by the Government. If we had the kind of income that we have now and we were paying 27.7 in total taxes like we were in 1955, we would have had real wage increases. 
Mr. President, today is April 15. It is tax day. Yet most Americans do not realize that we are forced to pay a double tax. We pay income tax on the Social Security taxes that are deducted from our check, on those taxes which are pulled out before we ever see our check. We pay income taxes on that tax. That is particularly unfortunate. We are double taxed. Money that we never see, money that goes to Government, we pay a second tax to Government on that money. It does not make sense. 
Interestingly enough, this is not a tax that hits American businesses the same way. As you will recall, half of the Social Security tax is paid by citizens; half is paid by corporations or 
the employers. The citizen who pays the tax pays a double tax--not only pays the Social Security tax but then has an income tax on that same money that is required to be taken out of his remaining funds. The business that pays Social Security taxes gets to deduct from its other taxes what it has paid in Social Security taxes, or gets to deduct from its taxable income what it has paid in Social Security taxes. 
So the business community gets fair treatment of a single tax while the working individual has a double tax situation there, and it is time to end that kind of arbitrary, unreasonable, unequal, discriminatory approach to the worker and to provide parity with the reasonable expectation that is demanded from the employer and the corporation. If this is deductible to the employers and to corporations and to businesses, the payment of those taxes should also be deductible to individuals in our culture. 
The ordinary citizen, the worker, cannot though, and it is time that we lift the American worker at least to tax parity and to tax equality, a position that they should share with the corporate community and the business community. 
For those who are fond of saying that every tax break is a tax break for the rich, it is time to think again. This is not a proposal that is designed to help people who make millions and millions of dollars. Social Security taxes are only levied on the first $65,000 of income. If we provide a deduction for those Social Security taxes which are paid, the person who makes $65,000 in income does not have any smaller deduction or any smaller benefit than the person who makes $650,000 in income or the person who makes $65 million in income. The tax benefit is the same once you reach the $65,000 level. 
So this is a tax benefit that is not focused on the rich. It is not any more valuable to the very rich than it is to the middle class. The truth is this is the middle-class tax cut that is fair. It provides for people who work, that they will not be double taxed on their work. Social Security taxes are the only tax in America levied on work. Income taxes are levied on earned income or unearned income, but Social Security taxes are levied on work. How ironic that in America we would have a double tax on work. We ought to be standing for a proposition, instead of double taxing work, at least give it equality with other income that would not be double taxed. We would give Americans an opportunity to retain some of that for which they had worked so they could spend it themselves. 
There would be a significant improvement in the setting for the average two-income family in America. The average two-earner family pays about $1,227 more in income taxes because they cannot deduct from their income tax the taxes they have already paid to Social Security. If we allow them to deduct those, that means that $1,227 that is paid in income taxes would be available for individuals to have to meet their family needs. This is not just a way of saying that people will be able to spend the money. It is saying that people will be able to spend this money on themselves rather than have Government spend this money on more Government programs. I think most Americans understand that they would be better off deciding what they need most and how best to meet those needs than expecting Government to spend the money for them. 
The thrust of the matter is that this $1,227 per year for the average two-income family would be a welcome relief from a tax load which is higher than it has ever been before in the history of this country. 
I had the privilege of being Governor in my State for two terms before I came here, and I know what jobs mean and how important jobs are. What is interesting to note is that if we were to implement this tax measure of relief for the American people, the scholars estimate it would mean 900,000 new jobs in this country. Nine hundred thousand new jobs would provide a real spurt of growth for this Nation and would help us reacquire the sense of dynamic that America has had historically and that our heritage contains. Nine hundred thousand new jobs would be an average of 
about 18,000 jobs per State. I know that 18,000 jobs is equivalent to at least 3 car plants, new car plants, in a State. That would mean growth. That would mean opportunity. It would build for the future of this great country. I think we need to remind ourselves on a consistent basis when we tax people it is not a question of whether or not the money will be spent; it is a question of whether Government will spend the money or people will spend the money. I believe people can decide best. 
The passage of this act would affect the take-home pay of 77 million Americans who would have more resources to devote to meet the needs of their families, and it would be a measure of providing equity and fairness so that they would not be double taxed and neither would they be taxed unequally and in a discriminatory way as compared to the taxes which are levied on the corporate community. 
Mr. President, so often we say that bigger Government is required because some think that families will not do what they ought to do. I believe we have come to a juncture where Government has made it impossible for families to do what they need to do. Families want to share. They want to be involved in their communities. They want to be involved in reaching out to other people. When Government takes such a big portion of your income, when you have to work 3 hours every day to pay your taxes and you struggle through the rest of your day to meet your own needs, it does not leave much opportunity for sharing. 
The purpose of Government is related to growth. It is related to the growth of people, not the growth of Government. If we are to perpetuate a system where the only thing that can grow is Government, we have made a mistake. We would have destroyed the genius of America and repudiated our rich history of being able to grow our way through any challenge. It is time for us, the United States of America, the city on the Hill, again to be a city of hope and opportunity. It is time for us to provide a basis upon which the American worker and the American economy can grow. We can do that by ceasing the practice of double taxing work. We must stop double taxing working Americans. 
The bill, which I now send to the desk, is cosponsored by Senators Craig, Shelby, Cochran, Hagel, and Hatch. It would end the double taxation that American workers pay on Social Security taxes, because income taxes are levied on those amounts which are deducted as payroll taxes, known as Social Security taxes.

Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, families are the cornerstone of America. The data are undeniable: Individuals from strong families contribute to the society. In an era when nearly half of all couples married today will see their union dissolve into divorce, I believe it is both instructive and important to honor those who have taken the commitment of `till death us do part' seriously, demonstrating successfully the timeless principles of love, honor, and fidelity. These characteristics make our country strong. 
For these important reasons, I rise today to honor Clarence and Helen Reinsch of Argyle, MO, who on April 9 will celebrate their 50th wedding anniversary. My wife, Janet, and I look forward to the day we can celebrate a similar milestone. The Reinschs' commitment to the principles and values of their marriage deserves to be saluted and recognized.

Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, in his `Democracy in America,' Alexis de Tocqueville observed `Americans of all ages, all stations in life * * * are forever forming associations.' Be it to repair a public thoroughfare or to promote temperance, de Tocqueville noted volunteer associations were Americans' best response to community needs and to cultural pathologies. 
This observation, made over 150 years ago, certainly has been the case until a little over a decade ago. Volunteers have nurtured the elderly, they have coached generations of children, they have cleaned up our communities, they have supported and counseled those in need throughout American history. 
I look back at my time as Governor of the State of Missouri when we started the Clean the Highways Program using volunteers. We had 5,000 groups of volunteers--5,000 groups, not 5,000 volunteers--who accepted responsibility. It is a sort of fulfillment of de Tocqueville's observation about America, that Americans of all ages, of all stations in life are forming associations to do good things. 
These groups have been catalysts that interact with all elements of our culture. It is to volunteers that we owe a great deal of gratitude for our social cohesion--our sense of community in America. When things are done from the perspective of government, people view them as entitlements. When things are done by individuals because they volunteer, people know that we love one another. Basically, it is in our care and regard for each other--expressed when we do things on a voluntary basis--that is the real glue that binds us together as communities and holds us together as a culture. 
It was in 1982 that the first warning signs went out that our intricate system of volunteers fulfilling social work was under attack. In Runnemede, NJ, a Little League coach volunteer was sued because he repositioned his Little League shortstop to the outfield, and in the outfield the Little League shortstop then misjudged a flyball and sustained an eye injury. A suit was filed on the allegation that the 10-year-old youngster was a born shortstop, but not an outfielder, and the courts found the volunteer coach negligent. 
Over the next 5 years, liability rates for Little League baseball short up from $75 to $795 forcing many leagues to stop playing. 
In another example, a boy in a Scouting unit with the Boy Scouts of the Cascade Pacific Council suffered a paralyzing injury in a game of touch football. Several adults volunteered to supervise the trip. The youth filed a personal injury suit alleging that the Boy Scouts and the volunteers were negligent for failing to supervise him adequately. 
I remember playing aggressive games as a Boy Scout. I remember playing a game we called fox over the hill. One group was supposed to run from one line to the other line without getting tackled, pummeled, and roughed up. That is the way boys operate. That is part of boyhood. But the jury found that the volunteers were personally liable for some $7 million. Oregon law caused the judgment to be reduced to around $4 million, but few Boy Scout volunteers can afford that kind of a judgment. 
The jury held the volunteers to a heightened standard of care, charging them with a meticulous constant supervision level of care in their supervision over activities that routinely have been permitted without oversight. Such a standard is impossible to uphold. Anyone who has been a Boy Scout or certainly tried to supervise Boy Scouts knows that such a standard would be very difficult, and such an impossible standard has basically caused a marked drop off in voluntarism across the country. 
In fact, the Gallup organization studied voluntarism and, in a study titled the `Liability Crisis and the Use of Volunteers of Nonprofit Associations,' the Gallup organization found that approximately 1 in 10 nonprofit organizations has experienced the resignation of a volunteer due to liability concerns and that 1 
in 6 volunteers reported withholding services due to a fear of exposure to liability suits. 
What we have basically done in the last two decades is to send a signal to people: If you volunteer to be helpful, you could jeopardize the well-being of your own family; you could make it very difficult to maintain the home and lifestyle to which you have become accustomed; in trying to help others, you might, as a matter of fact, hurt yourself. I think that is sad because it has reduced this good impulse of Americans. 
The study also found that 1 of 7 nonprofit agencies had eliminated one or more of their valuable programs because of exposure to lawsuits. So, instead of having more programs to help more people, we have narrowed that because of the threat of lawsuits and the potential of liability. Sixteen percent of volunteer board members surveyed reported withholding their services to an organization out of fear of liability--16 percent. That is almost 1 out of every 6 volunteer board members said, `No, I'm going to think carefully about whether I'm going to be on the board, because I don't want to get sued, and I don't want to ruin the chances of my family to live properly just because some mistake is made somewhere. 
The average reported increase for insurance premiums for nonprofits over the previous 3 years, from 1985 to 1988, was 155 percent. That was over the years prior to the study, a 155 percent increase in insurance. And one in eight organizations reported an increase of over 300 percent. So, nonprofits found an increase in their insurance premiums. These numbers demonstrate rather clearly that the cost of lawsuits and the excessive unpredictable and often arbitrary nature of damage awards have a direct and a chilling effect on the spirit of voluntarism and on the nature of our communities. 
I do not want to wring from the fabric of American society that healthy component that lubricates our social exchanges, the component of caring and loving and dealing with and helping each other, but if our legal system makes it dangerous to help each other and dangerous to care and dangerous to volunteer, we will have done this great country a tremendous disservice. Voluntarism is one of these defining characteristics of American culture. The understanding that people have been historically willing to help one another is a mainstay of who we are as Americans. 
The hyperlitigious nature of the civil justice system is creating a barrier between the desire of Americans to help others and their ability to do so. So, Mr. President, today I rise to introduce a bill that will offer a new level of protection to volunteers who give selflessly of themselves to help others. The Liability Reform for Volunteer Services Act will reinstate reason, it will reinstate rationality, it will reinstate certainly and fairness to a judicial system with regard to voluntarism. 
The Liability Reform for Volunteer Services Act covers volunteer services organizations which are defined as nonprofit organizations that are organized for the public benefit and operated primarily for charitable, civic, educational, religious, welfare, or health purposes. Health care providers, however, specifically are excluded from coverage. Many of them fly under the banner or nonprofit, but we all know that they are anything but volunteer organizations, and they are not, in many respects, charitable. Persons volunteering for service organizations or governmental entities are covered by the bill if they are acting in good faith, within the scope of their official duties, and not being compensated for their services. This really is an effort to say to that person that volunteers, `We are going to give you a fair situation in which to volunteer, and if you are not being compensated, we are still going to hold you to the standard which requires you to have good behavior, but we are not going to expose you to tremendous liability.' 
The bill establishes a standard for awarding punitive 
damages. It is a rather high standard for awarding punitive damages which is designed to punish defendants or defer others from engaging in the same activity against the volunteer services organization or the volunteer. An injured party would be required to establish by `clear and convincing evidence' that a volunteer organization or its volunteers acted with a `conscious and flagrant indifference' to the rights or safety of others and this conduct caused the harm for which the volunteer is being sued. 
The clear and convincing standard is greater than the standard for most civil cases, which is merely the preponderance of the evidence, but it is less than the criminal standard which is beyond a reasonable doubt. The clear and convincing standard is a higher standard than the more-likely-than-not or preponderance of the evidence standard, but, obviously, it is less than the criminal standard of beyond a reasonable doubt. 
Punitive damages would be capped so that punitive damages could not exceed $250,000, or twice the economic and noneconomic losses. So, actual damages would not be affected here. If there were real damages, they would be recoverable, but punitive damages would be capped. In other words, if there were to be punitive damages, not only would they be capped at a maximum of $250,000, or twice the economic damages, you would have to be able to provide that there was clear and convincing evidence that there was a conscious and flagrant indifference to the rights or safety of others. 
Given either party the right to separate any court's proceeding covered by the act into two parts, the first would determine whether the volunteer or service organization is liable to the injured party, and the second would be to determine whether punitive damages should be awarded. 
A volunteer services organization or volunteer would only be responsible in proportion to its degree of fault. That would mean that there would not be the kind of joint liability. If the Salvation Army were 10 percent responsible and some other organization 90 percent responsible, and the organization that was 90 percent responsible did not cover all of their 90 percent in the case, the Salvation Army would not be asked to pick up the tab for the other organization. It would only be responsible for that damage that it had been found to have caused. 
I do not single out one of the most virtuous organizations in America, suggesting that they might ever be liable, but if there were a case against a charitable organization like that, that would be the framework for adjudicating and awarding damages. A volunteer services organization or volunteer only would be responsible for damages in proportion to the degree of fault that was found on their part. 
The protections provided for in this Bill would not apply if the activity for which damages were awarded constitutes a crime of violence or terrorism. If the volunteer commits a hate crime or is convicted of a civil rights violation these protections would not apply. If a volunteer is convicted of a sexual offense under State law, these protections would not apply. In addition, if a volunteer is found to have been under the influence of alcohol or drugs when the incident giving rise to the litigation occurs and that influence caused the harm, these protections would not apply. This is not a bill designed to authorize people to be high on drugs or alcohol or to commit crimes when they are volunteering. In those instances, the sky would be the limit. We would be under the old system. 
Let me just say that volunteers do play an integral part in America, in community service. They should not have to fear litigation. They should not have to withdraw from giving themselves to those in need. The Gallup study shows we have had a withdrawal of talent from the volunteer pool. This is the time when we need more Americans being involved in community in a sense of helping each other, not less. 
In conclusion, let me just make the following observations. 
The basis for the American community and culture is, in large measure, the result of voluntarism. Alexis de Tocqueville said this is what makes America `America.' America is great because America is benevolent--this goodness is the impetus within us to help each other. 
We have had a development of a legal system which has made that very difficult and costly for volunteers. In a very focused and balanced way, we are trying to say to people that their liability for acts in the volunteer community should be limited only to economic damages unless there is a very flagrant disregard for the rights of others and, in those events, punitive damages should be limited. 
I believe that this measure will help restore to the American people the capacity to be caring and giving people, to live with each other in a sense of community--bound together by the glue of mutual concern--in service to one another in valuable and selfless ways.

Mr. ASHCROFT. I yield myself such time from the opposition time as is necessary for me to make a statement. 
Mr. President, I rise today to speak, not in opposition to Merrick Garland for filling the seat on the U.S. court of appeals, but in opposition to filling the seat at all. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit is a judicial circuit which has the lowest caseload of any of the judicial circuits in the country, and I think this is a time when we ought to ask ourselves some serious questions about whether or not we intend to staff circuits in spite of the fact that there are adequate judges in the circuits to handle the caseload which is currently required of the circuit. 
First, the amount of judicial work in the circuit raises questions about the necessity of confirming another appellate judge for the D.C. circuit. It appears that filling this vacancy would be an inefficient use of judicial resources. Before filling any vacancy for an appellate judgeship, the U.S. Senate should look at the filings per judgeship compared with other jurisdictions. Of the 12 courts of appeals, the D.C. circuit has the lowest filings per judge of any of the 12 courts of appeals. While the D.C. circuit has had only 123 cases filed per judge, the eighth circuit, the circuit in which I live, handled nearly three times the D.C. circuit's total of appeal filings, with 307 appeals filed per judge. The eleventh circuit court of appeals, in comparison, had 575 appeals filed per judge.

Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, Senator Christopher S. `Kit" Bond and I would like to share with our colleagues in the U.S. Senate the example of a man who has been a model of citizenship, character, and service to humanity throughout his lifetime. The gentleman about whom I speak is Dr. Paul Currie, who will soon retire as pastor of the Presbyterian Church of Caruthersville. 
On September 22, 1983, Dr. Paul Currie was present in this Chamber serving as Chaplain and offering the opening prayer. While this is historically an honor for any individual, we believe it was more of an honor for the U.S. Senate to have Dr. Currie serving in this chamber. Indeed, we believe the nearly four decades of service rendered to the community of Caruthersville, MO, serves as the real testimony to his compassion for his fellow man. 
Since arriving in Caruthersville in 1958, Dr. Currie has always sought to reach beyond the lines of faith and unite all denominations in service to those in need. We can take faith that there are others who have been inspired by Dr. Currie and now live outside our great state, serving others. 
Although Dr. Currie will be retiring, we will never forget his leadership. This veteran of the Korean war, this humble servant of God, community, and family, deserves to be recognized for his decades of service to his fellow man. 
Senator Bond and I recognize today not only a lifetime of accomplishments by Dr. Currie, but also his inspiration of others. His example will inspire others to seek to enhance freedom, opportunity, and family life for generations to come. 
In closing, I would like to quote a few words from Matthew 25:21, which I feel summarizes Dr. Paul Currie's many great deeds: `Well done, my good and faithful servant!" 
We congratulate Dr. Currie on his retirement and extend him our best wishes for health and happiness for many years to come.

Mr. ASHCROFT. Madam President, thank you very much. 
I want to thank my colleague, the Senator from Utah, for his outstanding leadership on this issue. He has brought to the floor of the U.S. Senate the budgets from 28 years of unbalanced budgets. They represent about, oh, I would say, close to 8 or 9 feet of a stack of papers that has really impaired the capacity of this Nation to move forward. 
But I would like to mention another problem with that barricade of paper. Whenever you can just displace the cost of doing government to the next generation, you are not forced to make the innovations and improvements that you need to make. 
Most of us have noted that, in the recent years, the most dynamic and workable solutions to our problems have come from the States. It is because they operate with balanced budgets. They cannot just spend money they do not have and pass the bill to the next generation. 
Necessity being the mother of invention, the discipline of a balanced budget improves the quality of Government we get. It not only makes sure that we have liberties which would otherwise be forfeited if we grow bigger and bigger Government, but it also improves the quality of what Government does by saying we have to constantly look at what we are doing. We have to innovate and create instead of appropriate just to get better service with limited resources. 
So the quality of our life now, the quality of Government we receive, and the integrity of the next generation is at stake. We must pass a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution to add discipline to our system which would drive creativity and improvement in what we do.  
Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.

Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I rise today to encourage my colleagues to join me in congratulating Gladys Raymore Wilson of Independence, MO, who will celebrate her 100th birthday on March 16, 1997. Gladys is a truly remarkable individual. She has witnessed many of the events that have shaped our Nation into the greatest the world has ever known. The longevity of Gladys' life has meant much more, however, to the many relatives and friends whose lives she has touched over the last 100 years. 
Gladys' celebration of 100 years of life is a testament to me and all Missourians. Her achievements are significant and deserve to be recognized. I would like to join her many friends and relatives in wishing Gladys health and happiness in the future.

Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I rise today to honor a lifetime commitment to law and order in the United States. On March 1, 1997, Mr. Roy D. Nedrow retired as the Director of the Naval Criminal Investigative Service, ending 33 years of law enforcement service to the community at the local, State, and Federal levels. 
Mr. Nedrow began his law enforcement career in 1964 with the Berkeley, CA, Police Department and served there for 6 years, first as a patrolman and later as a training sergeant and detective. In 1970, Mr. Nedrow was appointed a special agent with the U.S. Secret Service where he distinguished himself during assignments in the field and at the Service's Headquarters. As a result of his outstanding performance and talents, Mr. Nedrow earned a number of promotions culminating in his appointment to the Senior Executive Service and assignment as the Service's Deputy Assistant Director for the Office of Investigations where he oversaw the investigations and protective support activities conducted by the Service's 1,200 special agents at its more than 100 field locations. 
On December 28, 1992, Mr. Nedrow retired from the Secret Service to accept the appointment as the Director of the Naval Criminal Investigative Service. His induction came a critical time in the Agency's history. His strong leadership restored stability to an agency which needed greater independence and a change of direction. Assembling a team of highly qualified professionals, Director Nedrow overhauled the Service, reorganizing it to diminish its bureaucracy, and to provide greater accountability and responsiveness to its consumers. He provided his people with a new vision, the necessary resources and support, and the inspiration to achieve positive change. Under his leadership, the Naval Criminal Investigative Service gained national recognition for its innovation in the field of homicide investigation. Its approach to the investigation of previously unresolved or cold case homicides, some as old as 28 years, was lauded in October 1996 by the International Chiefs of Police [IACP] during its prestigious Webber Seavey Award for Quality in Law Enforcement Ceremony for innovation and excellence in law enforcement programs. The NCIS cold case methodology has since been adopted by numerous law enforcement agencies throughout the United States. Director Nedrow also recognized the problems and anxieties endured by families of deceased service men and women whose deaths occurred under other than natural circumstances. He revitalized and championed a Family Liaison Program to assure responsiveness to the needs of, and issues raised by, surviving family members during the death investigation process. His legacy of additional achievements with and for the Service include a well-respected Critical Incident Debriefing Team, a proven Alternative Dispute Resolution system, and a cutting edge Computer Crimes Investigation Group. 
`The final test of a leader,' renowned journalist Walter Lippman wrote in 1945, `is that he leaves behind him in other men the conviction and will to carry on.' The testimony to Roy Nedrow is that the Naval Criminal Investigative Service is indeed a better agency today and that he leaves it in most capable and inspired hands. 
Mr. President, in closing I wish to commend Roy Nedrow for outstanding leadership and service and thank him for his dedication to the Nation as a guardian of our peace. I wish him, and his wife, Claudia, Godspeed in his retirement. 
Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, there are developments in a matter that I think command our attention. I would like to bring them to the attention of the Senate. 
Recently, Senator Dorgan and I, joined by 28 of our colleagues, introduced S. 304, the Assisted Suicide Funding Restriction Act. It is simply a law that says no Federal tax dollars shall be used to promote or pay for assisted suicide. 
There had been a threat that we might be asked to pay for assisted suicide with Federal Medicaid funds in the State of Oregon. Oregon enacted what was called Measure 16, which allowed for physician-assisted suicide for terminally ill patients in that State. Oregon officials stated that they would be submitting Medicaid bills to the Federal Government to pay for assisted suicide under the category of `comfort care,' a euphemism which is particularly troubling to me. 
After Oregon passed Measure 16, its implementation was suspended by U.S. District Judge Michael Hogan, in Eugene, OR. While the law was not in effect, we would not be asked to pay Federal dollars, tax dollars of American citizens, to end the lives of individuals rather than to sustain their lives. 
Throughout the history of the Medicaid and Medicare Programs, there has been the presumption that funds for those programs would be used to elevate, encourage, enrich and extend the lives of American citizens. It turns out now that with this one law in one State, we will be asked for Federal resources for medical reimbursements under the health care provided by Oregon's Medicaid program, to end the lives of individuals, to help physicians help patients commit suicide. 
Senator Dorgan and I, and 28 of our colleagues, have sponsored legislation to prevent such a practice--to prohibit Federal tax dollars from being expended for assisted suicide. Our legislation had an imperative quality because the decision of an appeals court was pending. But today the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals dismissed the action which had suspended the implementation of the Oregon law. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, in so doing, potentially clears the way for the State of Oregon to begin calling upon the resources of U.S. taxpayers to assist people in their suicides. 
I have to tell you, this is against the values of many of the people with whom I speak and many of those I represent in the State of Missouri. Key groups and organizations, including the U.S. Catholic Bishops, the National Right to Life, and the American Medical Association, oppose assisted suicide, and oppose the use of Federal funds for such a practice, as it is an inappropriate expenditure of tax dollars. 
Mr. President, 87 percent of the American public does not want tax dollars spent on dispensing toxic drugs to end the lives of Americans instead of focusing our resources on therapeutic drugs and other therapies to extend and improve the life of American citizens. It is time for us to understand the urgency of this issue, given the fact the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals rejected the challenge to Measure 16. 
Now, the dismissal of the action is appealable by the parties there. They can appeal back to the Ninth Circuit for a hearing en banc, or to the U.S. Supreme Court. But I raise this in the consciousness of the U.S. Senate to say we do not have a significant amount of time, and I believe the vast majority of citizens in this country never anticipated that their tax resources would be consumed in poisoning fellow citizens under the guise of comfort care in the State of Oregon. 
We would be derelict in our duty were we to ignore this problem and allow a few officials in one State to decide that taxpayers all across America must help subsidize a practice that has never been authorized in most of America, is considered to be morally abhorrent by many Americans, and is considered to be medically inappropriate by the American Medical Association. Because of today's decision, I implore my colleagues in the U.S. Senate to act swiftly to pass the Assisted Suicide Funding Restriction Act before our tax dollars begin to go for ending, and not saving, the lives of our fellow Americans. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, families are the cornerstone of America. The data are undeniable: Individuals from strong families contribute to the society. In an era when nearly half of all couples married today will see their union dissolve into divorce, I believe it is both instructive and important to honor those who have taken the commitment of `till death us do part' seriously, demonstrating successfully the timeless principles of love, honor, and fidelity. These characteristics make our country strong. 
For these important reasons, I rise today to honor Mildred and Eldred Bredehoeft of Concordia, Missouri, who on April 6, 1997, will celebrate their 50th wedding anniversary. My wife, Janet, and I look forward to the day we can celebrate a similar milestone. Mildred and Eldred's commitment to the principles and values of their marriage deserves to be saluted and recognized.

Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I am grateful for this opportunity to speak to my colleagues and to the American public about an item which is important and which demands our attention. It is an item of urgency. And because it is, I think it is important that we develop a sense of cooperation and that we act expeditiously. 
A lot of comment is being heard these days about bipartisanship, the need to cooperate and to be partners and participants rather than being opponents and partisans. The measure about which I will speak today is one that has broad bipartisan support, and I think is something upon which cooperation is not only taking place, but one which will provide the basis for the ultimate passage of the legislation. 
Members on both sides of the aisle agree that Federal health programs such as Medicare and Medicaid should provide a means to care for and to protect our citizens--not become vehicles for the destruction or impairment of our citizens. 
The Declaration of Independence reads: `We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.' It is Congress' responsibility to defend the foremost of our inalienable rights--that of life. 
In this spirit and understanding, I rise today to introduce with Senators Dorgan, Nickles, Ford, and others, the Assisted Suicide Funding Restriction Act of 1997, a modest and a timely response to the threat that taxes paid by American citizens would be used to finance assisted suicide. What this bill simply says is that Federal tax dollars shall not be used to pay for and promote assisted suicide or euthanasia. We introduced such a bill in the 104th Congress, and have wide bipartisan support for this legislation, with 30 Members of the U.S. Senate as original cosponsors on the bill. 
This bill is urgently needed to preserve the intent of our Founding Fathers and the integrity of Federal programs that serve the elderly and the seriously ill, programs which were intended to support and enhance human health and life, not to promote the destruction of human life. 
Government's role in our culture should be to call us to our highest and best, to expand our capacity to take advantage of the opportunities of life, and to build our capacity for achievement. I do not believe that Government has a place in hastening Americans to their graves. 
Our court system is, however, on the brink of allowing Federal-taxpayer-assisted suicide funding. This bill is intended to preempt and to prevent proactively such a morally contemptible practice as taking tax money from one American and using it to assist in the suicide of another American. 
Let me be clear that this bill only affects Federal funding for actions whose direct purpose is to cause or to assist in causing suicide--actions that are clearly condemned as unethical by the American Medical Association and illegal in the vast majority of States. Again, this bill simply prohibits any Federal funding for medical actions that assist suicide. 
Some might ask why we need such a law. It is because two Federal courts of appeals recently contradicted the positions of 49 States when they found that there is a Federal constitutional `right' to physician-assisted suicide. These cases involved New York and Washington State laws which prohibit physician-assisted suicide. 
The State of Oregon recently passed Measure No. 16. That was the first law in the country that authorized the dispensing of lethal drugs to terminally ill patients to assist in suicide. Although a Federal court in Oregon struck down that law, the case has been to the ninth circuit, one of the appeals courts that has already signaled a strong indication that there is a constitutional 
right to assisted suicide. 
Oregon's Medicaid director and the chairman of the Oregon Health Services Commission have both said that in the event that the ninth circuit would clear the way for Oregon's law to take effect, the federally funded Medicaid Program in Oregon would begin to pay for assisted suicide with public funds in that State. According to the Oregon authorities, the procedure would be listed on Medicaid reimbursement forms under the grotesque euphemism of `comfort care.' 
Unless we pass the Assisted Suicide Funding Restriction Act, Oregon could soon be drawing down Federal funds through its Medicaid Program to help pay for assisted suicides. Neither Medicaid, nor Medicare, nor any other Federal health program has explicit statutory language to prohibit the use of Federal funds to dispense lethal drugs for suicide primarily because no one in the history of these programs ever thought that they would be used to end the lives of individuals. We have always focused in these programs on seeking to extend rather than end the lives of Americans. 
In fact, the Clinton administration's brief filed in the Supreme Court of the United States opposing physician-assisted suicide pointed out that:  
The Department of Veterans Affairs, which operates 173 medical centers, 126 nursing homes, and 55 inpatient hospices, has a policy manual that . . . forbids `the active hastening of the moment of death.' 
`The active hastening of the moment of death' sounds a lot like assisted suicide to me. 
Such guidelines also apply to the VA's hospice program, the military services, the Indian Health Service, and the National Institutes of Health. 
Nonetheless, if the ninth circuit reinstates Oregon's Measure 16, Federal funds will be used for the so-called comfort care, also known as assisted suicide. 
I believe we would be derelict in our duty if we were to ignore this problem and allow a few officials in one State to decide that the taxpayers of the other 49 States must help subsidize a practice that they have never authorized and that millions of Americans find to be morally abhorrent. 
It is crystal clear that the American people do not want their tax dollars spent on assisting the suicide of individuals. Recently, a national Wirthlin poll showed that 87 percent of Americans oppose the use of public funds for this purpose. Even the voters of Oregon, who narrowly approved Measure 16 by a 51- to 49-percent margin, did not consider the question of public funding. The voters of two other west coast States, California and Washington, soundly defeated similar measures to authorize assisted suicide. Since November 1994, when Oregon passed its law, 15 other States have considered and rejected bills to legalize the practice. However, this bill does not talk about authorizing or prohibiting assisted suicide. It merely states that no Federal funds could be used to promote or assist suicide. 
Let me just say a few words about the way the legislation is crafted. It is very limited. It is very modest, and I think that provides the basis for its bipartisan support. 
It does not forbid a State to legalize assisted suicide, and it does not forbid using State funds for the practice. It merely prevents Federal funds and Federal programs from being drawn into promoting it. 
The bill also does not attempt to resolve the constitutional issue that the Supreme Court considered last month when it heard the cases of Washington versus Glucksberg and Vacco versus Quill. These are right-to-suicide cases, and the bill does not attempt to answer this complex question. Nor would this legislation be affected by what the Supreme Court decides on the issue. Congress would still have the right to prevent Federal funding of such a practice even if the practice itself had the status of a constitutional `right.' 
As the bill's rule of construction clearly provides, this legislation does not affect any other life issue that some might have strong feelings about. The bill does not affect abortion, or complex issues such as the withholding or withdrawal of life-sustaining treatment, even of nutrition or hydration. Nor does it affect the dispersing of large doses of morphine or other drugs to ease the pain of terminal illness, even when this may carry the risk of hastening death as a side-effect--a practice that is legally accepted in all 50 States, and ethically accepted by the medical profession and even by pro-life and religious organizations. This bill is focused exclusively on prohibiting Federal funding for assisting suicide.

Mr. ASHCROFT. President Jefferson wrote in words that are now inscribed in the Jefferson Memorial here in Washington that the `care and protection of human life, and not its destruction,' are the only legitimate objectives of good government. Thomas Jefferson believed that our rights are God given and that life is an inalienable right. With this understanding and belief, I urge the Congress and the President to support this bill. It is a modest but necessary effort to uphold our basic principles by forbidding the Federal funding of assisted suicide. 
Mr. President, I thank my colleague from North Dakota for his excellent work, his cooperation in this respect, and his emphasis on what this bill does and what it does not do. There is a narrow focus in this measure. We do not seek to preempt the ability of States to make decisions regarding their own laws, or individuals to make their own decisions. We are merely making reference to the fact that the Federal Government should not be financing assisted suicides. 
I thank him for his outstanding work and for his excellent effort in developing this legislation, to narrowly focus it and target it in such a way that makes it possible for us to work together. I commend him.

Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, the document that emerged from the Philadelphia convention has become the longest lived national constitution in the world. It was the product of a sense of urgency, of mission, of common purpose. And years from now, after we have long since passed, it will endure, standing unchallenged by the varied crises of human affairs. 
The Philadelphia delegates crafted this document on what they believed to be fundamental principles: Majority rule, dual sovereignty, one man, one vote. The Framers also recognized, however, that a lasting government would have to be not only durable and stable, but flexible enough to evolve with the emerging Nation. For this reason, they included an article for amendment that would allow the document to be changed over time. 
Since 1787, more than 10,600 constitutional amendments have been introduced. Only 27 have been adopted. Many of the proposed amendments have bordered on the ridiculous. One called for the creation of four regional Presidents. Others have called for the legalization of dueling, or changing the Nation's name to the United States of the World. 
The amendment I introduce today, however, is neither ridiculous nor unimportant. In fact, I would suggest that is one of the defining issues which this Congress will face. For it cuts to the very heart of who we are as a party, as a polity, as a people. It is a term-limits constitutional amendment. If enacted, the resolution would limit Members of Congress to three terms in the U.S. House of Representatives and two terms in the U.S. Senate. 
Mr. President, term limits are a tried and tested reform that the American people have seen operate firsthand: For the President since 1951, for 41 Governors, for 20 State legislatures, and for hundreds of local officials nationwide. Indeed, this is at least one reason why congressional term limits enjoy such widespread support: Voters have witnessed their ameliorative effects and want them extended to the national legislature. 
Some will undoubtedly argue that the 1996 election and the notable increase in new Members weakens the case for term limits. Nothing could be further from the truth. Ninety-four percent of all the Members who sought reelection last year were returned to Washington. The turnover that did occur was largely the result of voluntary departures, not competitive elections. 
Why do reelection rates continue at all-time highs? Because incumbency is, and always has been, the single greatest perk in politics. Committee assignments translate into campaign contributions. Bills mean bucks. The simple fact remains, the average incumbent spends more of the taxpayers' money on franked mail than the average challenger spends on his entire campaign. 
Reapportionment's role in ensuring long-term incumbency must also be considered. Many State officials are acutely aware of the benefits derived from high reelection rates. Consequently, they manipulate districts in a way which maximizes the potential for incumbents to return to Washington. This is not only an argument for limited tenure, it is an argument for adopting House limits of less than 10 years. 
As with all good ideas, this reform has occasioned some controversy. Primarily, opposition has come from careerists in the Congress whose livelihood is at stake. These self-proclaimed keepers of the public faith worry aloud about the impact of lost legislative wisdom. And, in the cloakrooms and Capitol corridors, they whisper about `protecting the people from themselves.' 
Opponents seem to believe that only seasoned legislators in a professional Congress can effectively deal with the issues of the day. Mr. President, it is the height of arrogance and elitism to suggest that any one Senator is essential to our Government. The strength of American democracy is that the people are the source of Government's legitimacy. Because, as Alexander Hamilton aptly noted more than two centuries ago, `Here, Sir, the people govern.' 
These assertions also stand at odds with the great triumph of individualism that is America. For they are based on the flawed supposition that only a limited number of citizens are qualified to serve. Richard Henry Lee put it best. `I would not urge the principle of rotation,' said Lee, `if I believed the consequence would be a uniformed Federal legislature; but I have no apprehension of this in this enlightened country.' Indeed, no more than a cursory look at the writings of Adams, Jefferson, Mason, and Paine reveals the healthy respect they had for the average citizen. 
Mr. President, I share the Founders' belief that there is wisdom in the people. The resolution I bring before the body today is a commonsense reform that the citizenry undeniably wants, a remedy our Republic desperately needs, a reform whose time has come. 
Rotation in office has worked for the President, scores of Governors, and countless others across this great land. Let us extend its therapeutic effects to the Halls of the U.S. Congress. I beg this proposal's adoption.

Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, today I rise in support of my colleague from Vermont in his introduction of the Team Work for Employees And Management Act. I thank the Senator from Vermont for his leadership in helping American workers develop the capacity to be competitive, to be productive, and to maintain our standard of excellence throughout the world. The Team Act, which passed both the Senate and the House during the 104th Congress, but was vetoed by President Clinton, is vital to the survivability and strength of our Nation's economy. 
Our Nation's strength is a result of recognizing the importance of the human resource in the equation. You simply cannot be competitive without tapping every part of the resource that you have. When we think of the NCAA basketball tournament next month, it is unthinkable that we would send teams into competition and forbid the coaches to talk to the players. What nonsense that would be. 
It is fundamental recognition of the fact that the people on the court will have a different perspective than the people off the court. The people on the field will have an awareness of how things are going that is special, different, unique, and of value. 
The same is true in industry. No matter how hard a compassionate manager tried to observe the process from outside, no matter how well the engineer from the design room tries to structure the environment for productivity, the person who actually is on the floor is going to have the ability to say, `This doesn't work here. It may look good in theory, but it doesn't work in practice.' 
I think that is what the TEAM Act is all about. It is about understanding and recognizing the tremendous resource that workers are, that they can be to the competitive position of this country by outproducing, outworking, outthinking, outsmarting, and out- cooperating workers anyplace else in the world. 
Most Americans would believe, and it is because we are commonsense people, that it is OK for employees and employers to talk. If you would have listened to the debate in this Chamber, you would have heard from those on the other side of the aisle, `Why, it's all right, it's all OK, it's perfectly legal right now. We don't need this.' 
When opponents of the TEAM Act say it is perfectly legal now, we do not need this law, it confounds me. Let me read from a list of things that have been ruled inappropriate for nonunion employers to talk to their nonunion employees on, so the American people have an understanding of what the law is and whether it needs to be changed. 
If you discuss the extension of the employees' lunch breaks by 15 minutes, that is illegal, from the case of Sertafilm and Atlas Microfilming; the length of the workday, to discuss how long each workday is going to be, that is illegal, from Weston & Booker Co. A decrease in rest breaks from 15 to 10 minutes, that is illegal to talk about with workers. What paid holidays you have--the Singer Manufacturing case held that was illegal to talk about. The extension of store hours during wheat harvest season--the Dillon's company case said you cannot talk with workers about that to get their input. 
Workers know what kind of break they need. Workers know what kind of workday they would like to work. I know of one plant in my home State where workers decided they wanted to work 4 days of 10 hours a day instead of 5 days of 8 hours a day and have 3-day weekends every week. Why would Government stand between workers and manufacturers, between managers and employees or their associates to say you cannot discuss those things, and yet that is what the law is for 8 out of 9 American workers, because 8 out of 9 American workers are nonunion workers. 
The National Labor Relations Act governs election of unions and collective bargaining. Section 8(a)(2) was passed in 1935 to prohibit the establishment of sham company unions, a tactic commonly used by employers to defeat union organizing. These organizations pretended to engage in collective bargaining, but followed management's dictates and typically were run by officers handpicked by management. Companies then pretended to enter into collective-bargaining agreements with these sham organizations so that when a union attempted to organize the workers, the companies could hide behind the exclusive representation and contract bar tenets of the law. 
Vigorous enforcement of section 8(a)(2) resulted in the demise of the company unions by the early 1950's. While sham unions should continue to be prohibited under our labor laws--and would remain so under the TEAM Act--the broad prohibition that remains in effect today prevents the types of legitimate cooperative working relationships that encourage worker participation and decisionmaking. 
Let me give you an example. When I was Governor of the State of Missouri, I had the opportunity to work with companies. Like I do today, I would go and work on the assembly line. I would go and work with people to learn about their jobs and talk to them about their concerns. 
One of the companies that was hauled into the justice system of the Labor Department for cooperating with its employees was a company called EFCO Corp. It was a small company in Missouri, having approximately 60 jobs. Now it has over 1,000 jobs. Much of its capacity was to increase its on-time deliveries, which went from the low seventies up into the high nineties, and which allowed workers to start working 4 days a week instead of 5 days a week, get their 40 hours in 4 days and have long weekends, spend more time with their kids, accommodate the demands of their families. It all came from these programs. 
What was most distressing was that when EFCO wanted to be involved, it was said to have dominated its discussion groups or teams because they provided employees with pencils and pens and allowed them to have access to the financial records of the company. That was what the NLRB said was a violation. 
You would say this company is bending over backward. It opens up the books to the workers and says: How can we do better for and how can we, as a team, do better, how can we as a company have the kind of performance and productivity that will recommend us to the world? And indeed they are now a world-class company. But because they provided the pens and pencils and they allowed the workers to have access to the company's financial records, the NLRB filed charges against the company. This is not the kind of thing that recommends America for leadership. It is the kind of thing that takes correction. 
Opponents say if you talk about those things, the workers will think you have union when you don't. It will be a sham union. Frankly, I do not underestimate the American worker that severely. 
Over the Christmas break I went to and worked in about five or six places in Missouri, actually on the job side-by-side with people. I never met a single worker who did not know whether he or she was in a union. They know. Workers know whether union dues are being deducted. The know whether they are in a separate organization. It is not hard. This is not above the capacity of the American worker. The idea somehow that if we allow managers to talk to employees, employees will be tricked into thinking they have a union when they do not have a 
union is ludicrous. It underestimates the intelligence of the American work force. 
A second objective from the other side is, `Well, maybe if we allow people to talk, they will be just talking to certain employees who only have limited views, and they will not reflect the views of employees generally.' There is a safeguard. If there is an unfair system established where workers and employers are communicating with each other and it is working against the interests of the workers, it is easy. Workers have every right to unionize. They can form a labor union. They can petition for a labor union. They can ask that unions come in if they think it is unfair. 
There is a structural guarantee of competition. If nonunion systems are not working well for employees, if these things are likely to be so distorted or so unfair, nothing in this law, nothing in this proposal, in any way derogates, undermines, erodes, or otherwise lessens the right of a worker to petition for an election to organize or unionize a plant. 
There are about 30,000 employers that would like to have such employee-involvement programs. Why is it they would like to have such programs? Because they have seen that when we work together we succeed. Strange to me, that is basically a quote from President Clinton's 1996 State of the Union Address. He said, and I agree, `When companies and workers work as a team, they do better, and so does America.' 
The real truth of the matter is understood in the hearts and minds of everyone who has every worked on a team, knowing that when you work together, you do better than when you work at odds with each other. 
The ability of union workers to collaborate with employers is well ensconced. It is fought for by the unions and protected by the employers, recognized as a great benefit. But why should we limit that great benefit to 11 or 12 percent of our society, to the 1 out of 9 workers in America that are in unions? Why not extend this benefit to all workers in America saying that it is entirely appropriate for nonunion workers, as well as union workers, to be involved in collaborating and cooperating, in providing their good judgment of how best to improve the situation for workers and to improve the productivity and profitability of the business? 
No. I do not think we would send our teams to the NCAA tournament forbidding the players to talk to the coaches. We have too much sense to do that. No, I do not think that union companies are going to stop having team discussions between employees and the company owners and managers. They have too much sense to do that. And, no, I do not think that this Government should stand between the owners of corporations and their managers and the employees who work hard and want to succeed and want to be productive and keep them from talking to each other, because I believe the American people have too much sense to do that. 
I urge my colleagues to extend this benefit which now inures to the benefit of 1 out of 9 workers in America to the rest of the working population. Let us give everyone an opportunity to contribute to a winning effort, to succeed. That will maintain America's position as the most productive and most profitable and most rewarding place, not just for companies, but for citizens, not just for institutions, but for individuals. It is, in fact, a reason that America continues to draw people from around the globe. It is the fact that we have recognized the worth and value of individuals. And for us to deny their value in a commercial setting would be a substantial error which we must not make.

Mr. ASHCROFT. I thank my colleague from the State of Connecticut. Mr. President, I am pleased to have an opportunity to make some remarks about the balanced budget amendment. It is my understanding the minority leader may come to the floor to speak, and if he does I am happy to interrupt my remarks to provide him an opportunity to make whatever remarks he plans to make. 
Mr. President, when we discuss the balanced budget amendment, we are usually talking about the impact of runaway spending on our economy or on our future. These are fundamental considerations, but I think there is another consideration that we must not lose sight of, and that is, perhaps, more fundamental and more profound than the economic implications of the balanced budget. A protracted deficit spending empowers the central Government with the means to undermine our basic liberties. What I really mean to say is that unlimited spending by Government promotes unlimited Government, and unlimited Government means limited freedom. There is a relationship between the size of Government and the number of its prerogatives and the size of individuals and the number of their prerogatives. 
For how we tax and spend, really, in fact, determines whether we are prosperous or poor, free or enslaved, good or evil. I believe if we want to be free, we have always to be careful about the size of Government. 
Now, the acknowledgment that we can control Government by controlling its power of the purse is not new. From the very beginnings of this Republic there has been a clear understanding that if you could control the purse, if you could limit spending, you could limit the encroachment of Government upon the freedom of individuals. Money is and money has always been the source of Government's most basic power. History bears testament to this truth. 
The Magna Carta, which was signed grudgingly by King John a few centuries ago--I might add, no relation, King John, but the name is still in current use--prescribed that the monarchy could not impose taxes, and King John grudgingly signed this, the monarchy could not impose taxes without the consent of the Great Council. Charles I was executed because he tried to spend money without the consent of the Commons. And our own Declaration of Independence talks of injuries and usurpations, not the least of which was George III's imposition of taxes without representation, taxes without the consent or participation in the decisionmaking by colonial residents. 
Mr. President, deficit spending has wrested power from the people. It has taken power from the next generation and brought it to this generation, the power to decide how the resources of our own children will be spent. It has deposited this power in the Halls of Congress. 
We are not only taking the freedom of this generation when we spend in deficit, we are taking the freedom of the next generation, so that we have a compound problem here. The extent and reach of Government encroaches upon the capacity of individuals to live freely, not only in the present time but because we are funding this overreaching of Government with deficit spending, it encroaches upon the freedom of the next generation. 
This is an inversion of the will of the Framers of the Constitution. It is an invasion of the social contract in which our forefathers developed this country. It takes the power from the people and puts it in the hands of the Congress. And really what Congress' enterprise ought to be is empowering people. It is time to return to the people the ability to control their own lives, their future and their destiny and to begin to assure the next generation that we will not have exercised their prerogatives, we will not have made their choices about how to spend their resources, but that we will, indeed, protect some of that prerogative which they rightfully have which they ought to enjoy. Another way of saying this is that it is simply immoral to tax unborn generations of Americans in anticipation of their existence in order to satisfy our undisciplined consumption that is a result of deficit spending. 
Mr. President, Congress today does not have to vote to raise more revenue in order to spend more money. We have gone through a transition from tax and spend, which is an arguable proposition, to borrow and spend, which is certainly a very questionable proposition. We now are in a category of steal and spend, because borrowing without the intention or capacity to pay back by those who are doing the borrowing is something that is categorized in the law as something far different from borrowing. People who go to borrow without the intention to pay back are stealing. Most State statutes call it stealing by deceit. When we in this generation borrow without the intention or capacity to repay those moneys which we have borrowed, we, in fact, are stealing from the next generation. We cannot have their consent to take their resources because they do not exist yet. We are taking resources from our children and grandchildren at a time before they are even born. We are borrowing without the intention to pay back. We have gone from tax and spend to borrow and spend, and I daresay, now we find ourselves in the moral reprobate position of stealing from the next generation to spend. 
I spent some time as attorney general of my State. I had the privilege of serving the people of Missouri for 8 years as attorney general. It is the attorney general's responsibility to uphold the convictions of individuals who have violated the law. Among those are people who abuse children. I think child abuse is reprehensible. It is beyond my comprehension how someone would abuse a child, let alone his or her own child. 
But most of the people who abuse children would not think of stealing from children, or stealing from their own children. I find it to be abhorrent and immoral, and it is very unwise that we would take from our own children the capacity that they ought to have to be free, and that we would somehow wrest from them the decisionmaking capacity of free citizens in the next generation to decide how to deploy the resources that they generate. We would have already made the decisions, we would already have consumed the benefits, and we would send to them nothing more nor less than the bill--the debt to be paid. 
We owe our children so much more than that. Tax and spend was bad; borrow and spend was worse. When we got to a situation where we could not repay that which we had borrowed, it became stealing by deceit, and steal and spend is morally reprehensible and must be curtailed, it must be stopped. 
The ability to take resources of the next generation is unique to the Congress. No father can create debts which are visited upon his or her son or daughter. No mother can create a debt that can be visited upon her son or daughter. The law simply does not allow the debts of a parent to be imposed upon a child. Only in one universe can this happen, and it can only happen when the people of this country, through their Congress, create a debt which will be visited on those who are yet unborn, will be used as a set-off to garnishee the wages that are yet unearned. It's time that we stop. 
No family in America finds its children encumbered by the debts of parents. The American people are fed up with a Congress that spends these yet unearned wages of the next generation, and rightly so. It is more than economics; it is a matter of freedom. Second it is more than freedom; it is a matter of integrity. 
Mr. President, deficit spending is not only a threat to our posterity and our children's future, it is a method by which Washington's elite circumvent the public, the law, and the Constitution. When the people express the belief that Government is out of control, they are correct. For too long, this body has satisfied the appetites of narrow interests at the public's expense. Where is the accountability to taxpayers? Where is the will to do that which is right? 
Mr. President, we have tried time and time again to deal with this problem of recurring chronic debt. In terms of the medical profession, this is not an acute problem that lasts momentarily and then is gone, this is a chronic problem. These copies of out-of-balance budgets for the United States, year after year--I believe there are only 28 years stacked here. Over the last 60 years, you can more than double, perhaps triple, the volume represented by these out-of-balance budgets. They represent the absence of our capacity to discipline ourselves to stop spending someone else's money, to stop borrowing someone else's money, to stop stealing by deceit the resources of the next generation. 
In 1985, we tried something. It was a noble endeavor. To be commended are Senators Gramm, former Senator Rudman, and Senator Hollings in the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act. Then again we didn't have the will to carry through, and we changed the law so we could change the rules because we could not change our habits. We put Gramm-Rudman II in place in 1987. Then we changed the law and we changed the rules because we could not change our habits and broke that agreement. When the Budget Enforcement Act of 1990 went into effect, again, we found ourselves changing the law and the rules because we could not break our habit. It becomes apparent to me that we need to do more than just have laws and rules, because we never have been able, in the face of our bad habit, to maintain our commitment to the rules or to the laws. We have simply changed the law and broken the rules because we could not break the habit. 
We need systemic change, something that goes to the very heart of us, that forbids this insistent expropriation, taking away from the next generation. It is simply that we need to put into the Constitution an immutable, unchangeable document, a kind of capacity to provide the discipline we have lacked and lacked consistently. I think we need to summon the discipline to restrain Government. It is obvious that Republican and Democrat Congresses have not had it. Republican and Democrat Presidents have not had it. It is time for us to provide a backbone implant, if you will, for the Congress of the United States to place in the Constitution of the United States this discipline. 
While one Senate cannot bind the next Senate, and hasn't because we have changed the laws and changed the rules because we could not break the habit, our Constitution can provide that discipline. Persons born in 1900 paid, roughly, 24 percent of their income in Federal and local net taxes. Persons born in 
1970 will pay about 34 percent of their income in net taxes. If the policies that we have in place now remain, persons born in 1994 and thereafter will find themselves, over the course of their lifetimes, paying a net tax rate of about 84 percent. It is a trend which cannot continue. It is taxation without representation. It is an expropriation of the freedom and opportunity of the next generation. It is immoral, it is obscene, and it must end. 
As Thomas Jefferson stated in a letter to James Madison in 1789:  
The question whether one generation of men has a right to bind another * * * is a question of such consequence as not only to merit discussion, but place also, among the fundamental principles of every government. 
We must place it among the fundamental principles of our Government by enshrining the balanced budget amendment in our Constitution. 
Now, there is some quibbling about whether those who founded this great Nation would have wanted the balanced budget amendment in the Constitution. I must say to you that there were certain presumptions that surrounded most individuals who assembled to create the finest document ever written by human hand--the U.S. Constitution. One presumption was the presumption of integrity and the presumption of responsibility that the Founders expected of those in Government. Tragically, that presumption is unwarranted as it relates to the Congress today. I believe, absent their ability to rely upon the integrity and determination of the Congress, they would gladly have placed in the Constitution a framework which would have required such responsibility. 
Mr. President, I send to the desk for inclusion into the Record the letter of Thomas Jefferson to James Madison, written in Paris on September 6, 1789.

Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, during this debate, we have heard frequently that there is not a need to amend the Constitution. There is authority, we are told, for Congress to do what is right if we simply exercise greater fiscal discipline. No one in this Chamber has ever argued that there is inadequate authority for balancing the budget. But these unbalanced budgets are a testimony which is undeniable, not to the absence of authority, but to the absence of discipline. It is time that we, who have experienced a collective loss of will, provide a structure in which we cannot allow this abuse of the future of the United States to continue. 
The balanced budget amendment is real reform, and it will be felt. I had the privilege of serving my State as Governor. I have seen what happens when there is a framework and structure which demands discipline. I know that for 8 years we balanced our budgets. As a matter of fact, we aimed for a little surplus so we could create a rainy day fund so that when times got tough, we could simply call upon those resources that we had developed when times were good. 
And it was not only an appropriate way to do business because it was moral and because it didn't steal from the next generation. It was an appropriate way to do business because it was very healthy for the State economically. And over and over again our State was rated at the very top with the highest bond rating--the highest financial rating of any State in the country because it was understood that we had this concern about the integrity of our fiscal affairs. 
So, Mr. President, let me just say a balanced budget amendment is real reform. It will reestablish the historical responsibilities observed in this country that we could have balanced budgets, except in times of war, which is something that should be assumed. But it cannot be assumed and must be institutionalized. 
It is also a political reform that will be felt first and foremost in the cold corridors of power here on the Potomac. Most importantly, it will be felt by the American people who will have their right to self-governance restored. 
Over two centuries ago Edmund Burke reminded members of the British House of Commons of a fundamental principle. Burke said: `The people must possess the power of granting their own money or no shadow of liberty can subsist.' 
The truth of the matter is that, if the people do not have power over their own purse strings and if we can extend our Republic of Government by borrowing or stealing from the next generation, we indeed will have seriously eroded the liberty which we are entitled to in this country. 
We need to safeguard those liberties which were first inscribed in the Magna Carta in 1215 preserved by the blood of patriots on continents around the world. We must return the power of the purse to the people. We must stop stealing from our children. We must stop stealing by deceit. 
Mr. President, the balanced budget amendment to the Constitution not only has to do with economics and the economy, and not only has to do with prosperity. It is a problem about integrity, and it is a challenge relating to liberty. And we must embrace it and offer it to the people of the United States for ratification.

Mr. ASHCROFT. Thank you very much. I thank the Senator from North Carolina for this opportunity to speak. 
I am delighted to have an opportunity to participate in the discussion of the confirmation of the President's choice for Secretary of State, Madeleine Albright. 
Generally, Mr. President, I respect the Executive's prerogative to choose Cabinet officers whom the President believes will faithfully and diligently execute the Administration's policies. However, in our federal system, the Senate plays an important role in the confirmation process through the constitutionally granted power to `advise and consent.' It is this duty--the duty to advise and to grant consent--which brings me before you today, for I have grave concerns regarding the conduct of U.S. foreign policy under the Clinton administration. 
As a member of the Foreign Relations Committee, I had the privilege and the responsibility to question Ambassador Albright concerning her strategic vision for the conduct of U.S. foreign policy. Ambassador Albright is a capable and forceful advocate of the Clinton administration's agenda. I am confident that she will serve the President with honor and distinction. Unfortunately, I am equally confident that Ambassador Albright will continue to promote the same misguided Clinton foreign policy that we have had for the past 4 years. 
We need our foreign relations to be conducted at the highest level of integration and coordination, and the highest level of representation of the sovereign interests of this country and the American people. We must ensure that our influence is used to advance the national interest and to ensure respect for American leadership abroad. National prestige is reinforced and enhanced when we operate with a coherent, concise, and understandable foreign policy. As the world's only remaining superpower--we must enhance our capacity to deliver military, economic, and moral leadership with clarity. 
To date, the Clinton administration has reacted to foreign policy developments, but has failed to a develop a foreign policy. The administration has lurched from managing one crisis to another, but never articulated the national interest in accordance with a core philosophy. Instead of consistently safeguarding and promoting our values abroad, the Clinton administration has acted on an ad hoc basis according to the exigencies of the moment, confusing our allies and emboldening rogue nations. China was emboldened to conduct missile tests off the coast of Taiwan; North Korea was emboldened to further the development of their nuclear weapons capabilities; Saddam Hussein was emboldened to strengthen his position in northern Iraq. 
Mr. President, in her confirmation hearing Madeleine Albright said, quoting the President of the United States, `Where our interests are clear, our values are at stake, and where we can make a difference, we must act and we must lead.' This formula for deploying American forces is one which is so broad and so vague that it sends signals which might confuse other players in the international arena. 
`Where our interests are clear'--I suppose we could have an interest anywhere--and `where our values are at stake'--I am sure the values we hold dear are at stake in every situation around the world--and `where we can make a difference.' Well, the truth of the matter is, no one would think that we would send our troops where we could not make a difference. 
I remain concerned that if we deploy troops in too many instances just because there are interests and there are values at stake and we can make a difference, there may come a time when our troops will be so occupied that they will not be available to protect strategic national interests where we must make a difference.

Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, during her confirmation hearing Ambassador Albright stated that `we are not the world's policeman, nor, . . . are we running a charity or a fire department.' However, she failed to recognize that the combination of her so-called `assertive multilateralism' and a `do-ability doctrine'--whereby the United States acts `in the places where our addition of action will, in fact, be the critical difference'--places the United States, as a practical matter in the position of being the world's policeman, of running a charity or a fire department. 
For the past 4 years, the pursuit of the United States' national interests has been obscured by an overriding reliance on multilateral action. The administration's embrace of `assertive multilateralism' has resulted in both the abdication of our responsibilities and the misguided projection of our power. For example, instead of applying the Reagan Doctrine to Bosnia by equipping and training the Bosnian forces in spite of our allies' objections, the Clinton administration subcontracted our role of arming the Bosnians to a terrorist regime in Iran, allowing fundamentalists to gain a foothold in the heart of Europe and thus unnecessarily endangering the lives of U.S. troops. In contrast, the administration's attempt at nation building in Somalia sacrificed the lives of 19 brave Rangers without regard to whether such action advanced our vital national interests. When this administration acts according to the exigencies of the moment instead of according to an underlying philosophy, the country lurches from paralysis to mission creep without regard to the national interest. 
Recently, there has been discussion of the possibility of reworking our entire military force structure--which is presently based on the capacity to fight two simultaneous major regional conflicts--in order to enable us to commit U.S. troops to an ever-growing number of multilateral peacekeeping missions. I am concerned that we may sacrifice our vital national security interests in order to be able to participate in peripheral endeavors. We should not be shortsighted. We should not lose sight of what we must do in order to accomplish what we can do. Our military should be used to protect our national security interests, not provide peacekeeping in areas without strategic significance. 
We need to continue to very closely monitor the foreign policy of the Clinton administration in terms of the national security interests of the United States. We must be vigilant about the deployment of U.S. troops around the world, including deployments that might include an attempt to place U.S. troops under the command of individuals who are not U.S. citizens and who do not have the kind of values to which we are committed. 
Mr. President, in this era of hegemonic stability, with the proliferation of fissile materials and missile delivery systems to rogue nations we must be constantly vigilant to security threats. We must ensure that adherence to Russia's narrow and one-sided interpretation of the ABM Treaty does not jeopardize the safety of the American people. Russia should not have veto power over developing a defensive system to protect the American people from missile attack. Ambassador Albright supports the administration's goal to develop a theater missile defense system that will protect our allies and our troops abroad--but not to develop a system to protect our own territory and citizens at home in the near term. I find this position to be untenable. 
Mr. President, we must not only protect the physical security of the United States and the American people. We must also safeguard our sovereignty--our State and local laws and customs from international review. I am troubled by Ambassador Albright's assertion that `there is no such thing anymore as just a purely domestic issue or a purely foreign issue.' She says there are only `intermestic' issues, meaning international and domestic issues combined. I think there are some issues of sovereignty that need to be reserved directly and appropriately, not only to the purview of our country, but to its citizens--to individuals and to families. I am concerned about her support of international treaties which 
could infringe upon the parental and religious rights Americans now enjoy. 
I am concerned that we closely monitor the extent to which the United States from time to time by treaty cedes the sovereignty of the American people to international organizations. Madeleine Albright, the Secretary of State-designate, for instance, signed the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. Britain, which has ratified the treaty, is now being called on the carpet because they allow moderate corporal punishment of children by parents. I simply do not think we need to look to the United Nations or international organizations to tell us whether moderate spanking of children is allowed in the United States. Inasmuch as she was an individual who signed the treaty on behalf of the United States, I think it behooves us, given her commitment to the so-called `intermestic' nature of all issues, that we ask her to be especially careful about the sovereignty of the United States and the prerogatives of individuals in specific States. Ambassador Albright stated that `the promotion and protection of international human rights may require that domestic state and local policies in certain areas be open to international scrutiny. We have no reason to fear it.' I would suggest that any threat to our sovereignty, any threat to our State and local laws, any threat to the sanctity of the family, is a reason to be vigilant. 
In order to safeguard the national interest, we must reorganize our foreign policy apparatus. This Nation is still saddled with an unwieldy cold war foreign policy bureaucracy in which many of the functions of AID, ACDA, and USIA could be better handled by the State Department. I was hoping that Ambassador Albright would come forward in support of this effort, as did Secretary of State Christopher--however fleetingly. The American people not only want our Government to reflect their wishes abroad, but they want it to do so coherently, concisely, and clearly. If we have a single voice in foreign policy representing the administration, be it Republican or Democrat, that single voice is most likely to get the job done, rather than the cacophony of voices from competing fiefdoms which undercut the authority of the Secretary of State. 
For example, currently there is a `good-cop, bad-cop' approach to foreign policy, whereby the entities who hand out U.S. foreign aid maintain good relations with client nations, while the Department of State essentially holds the line in protecting U.S. interests. We should not be handing out foreign aid to a country at a time when that very country is clearly acting against our interests. When we distribute foreign aid, it should be with an understanding that the United States agency or department asking for coordination and cooperation from a country in one arena is the same agency or department that will be delivering assistance to that country. 
We must prioritize our expenditures. There are those in this country, like Ambassador Albright, who think that there cannot be any cuts at all in the foreign relations area. The Clinton administration has actually asked for over $1 billion more in funding over last year's level. Lobbyists for more foreign aid kept trawling the Halls of Congress last year with their buttons saying `Just 1 percent.' I just want to point out that the `Just 1 percent' is actually about $18 billion. Ambassador Albright is convinced that we have made `the most out of that (foreign aid) money.' I am not so sanguine. We have poured hundreds of millions of dollars into countries over the years with little effect, because we have not tied that aid to internal changes in many countries which would make that aid meaningful and eventually unnecessary. 
I am not in favor of abolishing foreign assistance, but I am in favor of sending a signal around the globe that when American citizens are tightening their belts, and exercising fiscal responsibility, there will be some ripple effects in terms of our aid. We need to send a clear signal that the shared sacrifice here at home should be matched by a certain degree of sacrifice around 
the world. There is a direct correlation between our international prestige and the fiscal health of this country. If we do not have the ability to put our financial house in order, we will not be respected by countries around the world. If we continue to race down the road to bankruptcy, our influence will not be substantial. It is my sense that our stock will rise on the exchange of the world's international community, when we demonstrate our intent to address seriously our responsibilities. 
However, the United States is not alone in the need to downsize its bureaucracy and eliminate waste. The United Nations must do the same. To her credit, Ambassador Albright has been an outspoken critic of waste, fraud, and abuse in the United Nations. She was instrumental in initiating an oversight process. However, I am disturbed that she supports the payment of arrears by the United States. The Congress withheld those funds in order to exert leverage for reform. Those funds should not be released until there is tangible evidence that those reforms have been enacted as required by Congress. 
I am casting my vote for Ambassador Albright with grave reservations. For I want to make clear that my vote for Ambassador Albright to ascend to the position of Secretary of State is not an endorsement of the Clinton administration's foreign policy. As I noted, I take my `advise and consent' responsibilities very seriously. I also take my oversight responsibilities very seriously. I pray that over time, my concerns that we are in store for 4 more years of an ad hoc foreign policy will prove to be unfounded. Ambassador Albright is an honorable, committed, and distinguished public official. She is eminently well qualified to be our 63d Secretary of State. It is a privilege to be able to cast the historic vote for the first woman to be nominated for this office. As a member of the Foreign Relations Committee, I look forward to working with her in the future to protect America's interests abroad.

Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the St. Charles Chamber of Commerce 1996 Citizen of the Year, William H. Weber. On January 24, 1996, Bill Weber will gather with friends, family, and colleagues to celebrate his distinguished contributions to his community. 
Bill is a lifelong resident of Missouri and St. Charles. His volunteer career has touched innumerable oragnizations with his leadership, commitment, and unselfish hard work. Bill has been the driving force behind such significant projects as fund raising to build both the St. Peters Rec-Plex and the YMCA of St. Charles County. After a volcano destroyed the city of Armero, Colombia, South America, he worked tirelessly to build a YMCA facility to provide basic needs and housing for the children of that disaster. 
Closer to home, he has served on the boards of directors for Boys and Girls Town of Missouri, the Regional Commerce and Growth Association, St. Louis Sports Commission, St. Charles Public Schools, St. Charles Police and Fire Board, Crimestoppers, Mid America Theater, St. Charles County Horse Racing Commission, Daniel Boone District Chairman, Boy Scouts of America and the Eagle Board of Review, YMCA and United Services Blue Ribbon Committee. 
He received the Boy Scouts' highest honor, the Silver Beaver Award in 1989, Channel 5's [KSDK] Volunteer Board of Governors Jefferson Award in 1993, the YMCA's highest leadership award and Youth in Need honored him as its first recipient of their Youth Leadership Award. For this lifetime of service, I rise today to recognize and salute William H. Weber, St. Charles Chamber of Commerce 1996 Citizen of the Year. His volunteer work has been a shining example to me as well as all Missourians.

Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, families are the cornerstone of America. The data is undeniable: Individuals from strong families contribute to the society. In an era when nearly half of all couples married today will see their union dissolve into divorce, I believe it is both instructive and important to honor those who have taken the commitment of `till death us do part' seriously, demonstrating successfully the timeless principles of love, honor, and fidelity. These characteristics make our country strong. 
For these important reasons, I rise today to honor Donna and Ralph Potter of Kansas City, MO, who on Sunday, January 5, 1997, celebrated their 50th wedding anniversary. My wife, Janet, and I look forward to the day we can celebrate a similar milestone. Donna and Ralph's commitment to the principles and values of their marriage deserves to be saluted and recognized.

Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, earlier today Senator Hatch introduced S. 10, the Violent and Repeat Offender Act of 1997. Senators Lott, Domenici, Sessions, and I worked with him in developing the bill. While not perfect, the bill does take the initial steps in dealing with the epidemic of violent juvenile crime sweeping the Nation. 
Mr. President, the face of crime in America is indeed changing. Throughout our history, one thing has been clear: government's first responsibility is to keep the citizenry safe. John Jay wrote in The Federalist, No. 3, `Among the many objects to which a wise and free people find it necessary to direct their attention, that of providing for their safety seems to be first.' 
The murderers, robbers, rapists, and drug dealers of yesteryear were typically adults. Now they are typically juveniles. As the age of these criminal predators becomes younger and younger with each passing year, so does the age of their victims. 
Last Wednesday afternoon, 12-year-old Darryl Dayan Hall was abducted at gunpoint from the Southeast Washington area by three teenagers of a gang known as the Simple City Crew. This is the same gang that opened gunfire at a crowded community swimming pool in June 1993, wounding six children. This past Saturday, police found Darryl's frozen body. He had been shot once in the back of the head and at least once in the body. 
The three teenagers who are now charged with Darryl's murder have had numerous prior brushes with the law. One of Darryl's assailants was charged as a juvenile with possession of PCP in 1995 and then was released--as is too often the case--promising not to run afoul of the law again. Another of Darryl's assailants was, and is, on probation following his juvenile conviction last spring for possession of PCP with intent to distribute. Darryl's third assailant was charged as a juvenile just last month with carrying a deadly weapon. 
Mr. President, from 1984 to 1994, the number of juveniles murdered in this country increased 82 percent. In 1994, one of every five juveniles murdered was killed by another juvenile. The rate at which juveniles 14 to 17 years old were arrested for murder grew by 22 percent from 1990 to 1994 and the problem is going to get worse, much worse. 
Congress over the last three decades has established 131 separate Federal programs--administered by 16 different departments and agencies--to serve delinquent and at-risk youth, according to a report issued by GAO last March. Conservative estimates of Federal appropriations used for these at-risk and delinquent youth programs was more than $4 billion in fiscal year 1995. 
Despite this ongoing massive expenditure, the Federal Government has failed to meet its responsibility of providing public safety in this arena because it has not focused on holding juveniles accountable for their violent crimes. We now have a new category of offenders that requires a different, tougher approach. In short, we have criminals in our midst--young criminals--not juvenile pranksters and truants. 
The juvenile offenders of today will become the career criminals of tomorrow, if government continues to fail to recognize that America has an acute social illness that cannot be cured solely with money spent on social programs. This legislation introduced today takes a common sense approach in dealing with the current epidemic of juvenile violence. It would help States make urban, suburban, and rural communities safe once again. 
The bill would provide $2.5 billion over 5 years in new incentive grants for States to enact accountability-based reforms in their juvenile justice systems. This legislation would authorize funding for various programs, including efforts aimed at trying our most violent juveniles as adults; establishing the ability of States to collect juvenile criminal records, fingerprints, and photographs, and to share such criminal histories and information within a State, with other States, and with the Federal Government; and establishing Serious Habitual Offender 
Comprehensive Action Program [SHOCAP]. Religious organizations would also be permitted to participate in the rehabilitative programs included in the bill. 
Mr. President, serious, violent, and repeat juvenile offenders must be held responsible for their crimes. Today we are living with a juvenile justice system that was created around the time of the silent film. We are living with a juvenile justice system that reprimands the crime victim for being at the wrong place at the wrong time, and then turns around and hugs the juvenile terrorist, whispering ever so softly into his ear, `Don't worry, the State will cure you.' 
The juvenile justice system's primary goal today is to treat and rehabilitate the juvenile offender. Such a system can handle runaways, truants, and other status offenders; but it is ill-equipped to deal with those who commit serious and violent juvenile crimes repeatedly. 
The criminal justice system can emphasize to adult criminals that acts have real consequences. The purpose of the criminal justice system is to punish, that is, to hold defendants accountable. 
This legislation would provide financial assistance to States to help them reform their juvenile justice system to get the message to juveniles that their acts have real consequences to them as well. States will be eligible to receive Federal funds to help provide for the adult prosecution--as a matter of law or prosecutorial discretion--of juveniles 14 or older who commit violent crimes such as murder, forcible rape, armed robbery, and assault with a deadly weapon or offenses involving controlled substances or involving the possession of a firearm or a destructive device. 
Mr. President, punishing dangerous juveniles as adults is an effective tool in fighting violent juvenile crime. For example, in Jacksonville, FL, State Attorney Harry Shorstein instituted a program to prosecute and incarcerate such offenders in 1992. Two years later, the number of juveniles arrested in the city dropped from 7,184 to 5,475. While juvenile arrests increased for most of the Nation, Jacksonville's arrest rate actually decreased by 30 percent. 
Mr. President, States also need to create and maintain juvenile criminal records. Typically, State statutes seal juvenile criminal records and expunge those records when the juvenile reaches age 18. The time has come to discard the anachronistic idea that crimes committed by juveniles, no matter how heinous, must be kept confidential from the rest of society. 
Our laws continue to view juveniles through the benevolent prism of basically good kids gone astray. The law should really view the juvenile predators of today as the criminals that they are. These young criminals know that they can commit crime after crime because their juvenile records are kept hidden under a `veil of secrecy.' They also know that when they reach their 18th birthday, they can begin a second career as adult criminals as if they had never committed a crime in their young lives. The argument is that we are protecting juveniles from the stigma of a record, but in reality we are coddling hardened criminals. We must separate rhetoric from reality by lifting the `veil of secrecy.' 
The law enforcement community needs to know if an individual has a prior juvenile criminal record in order to conduct criminal investigations and apprehend those responsible for crimes in their towns, cities, and counties. 
According to Police Chief David G. Walchak, who is also president of the International Association of Chiefs of Police, law enforcement is in desperate need of access to juvenile criminal records. The police chief says, `Current juvenile records (both arrest and adjudication) are inconsistent across the States, and are usually unavailable to the various programs' staff who work with youthful offenders.' Chief Walchak also notes that `there are only 26 States that even allow law enforcement access to juvenile records * * * if we [law enforcement] don't know who the youthful offenders are, we can't appropriately intervene.' 
Mr. President, it is that simple. As juvenile gangs spread from urban to suburban to rural areas, as they travel from State to State, the `veil of secrecy' draped over their criminal histories and records undermines the ability of law 
enforcement to protect the rest of society. 
In order to empower local law enforcement, the proposed bill would provide money to States to create and maintain juvenile criminal records, and to share those records with other federal, State, and local law enforcement agencies. 
Mr. President, school officials also need access to juvenile criminal records to assist them in protecting the best interests and safety of all students. The decline in school safety across the country can be attributed to a significant degree to laws that put the protection of dangerous students ahead of protecting innocent, law-abiding students. While visiting with school officials in Sikeston, MO, a teacher told me how one of her students came to school wearing an electronic monitoring ankle bracelet. The student told the teacher, `You don't know if I'm a murderer or a rapist and I ain't gonna tell you.' That student was not only brutally honest, he was right. No one had any knowledge of what crime he had committed and, more importantly, they had no way of finding out. 
If schools knew the histories of violent juveniles, they could respond to any misbehavior by imposing stricter sanctions, assigning particular teachers, or having the student's locker near a teacher's doorway entrance so that the teacher can monitor his conduct during the changing of class periods. In short, this bill would allow school officials to take measures that could prevent violence against other children at school. 
Mr. President, for purposes of adult sentencing, adult courts need to know that convicted felons have a history of criminal behavior. According to the 1991 Survey of Inmates in State Correctional Facilities, nearly 40 percent of prison inmates also had prior criminal records as juveniles. That is approximately 4 in 10 prison inmates. The proposed legislation would allow adult courts to have access to juvenile records so that criminals could no longer masquerade as neophytes before the adult criminal justice system. 
The bill also allows State and local governments to use Federal funds to implement the Serious Habitual Offenders Comprehensive Action Program [SHOCAP]. 
SHOCAP is a multi-agency crime analysis and case management process for identifying and prosecuting violent and hard-core juvenile offenders in a community. SHOCAP targets such serious habitual offenders for intensive social supervisory interventions, intensive accountability in school attendance and discipline, and strenuous investigation and prosecution when they commit a new crime. 
The Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention [OJJDP] conducted five test pilots of SHOCAP. Oxnard, CA was one of the sites selected. When SHOCAP was implemented in Oxnard in 1983, officials found that less than 2 percent of all juveniles arrested in that community were responsible for over 35 percent of the felonies committed by juveniles. Four years later, Oxnard's juvenile violent crime dropped 38 percent. Illinois and Florida have also recently established statewide SHOCAP programs in an effort to reduce their juvenile crime rates. S. 10 would allow all jurisdictions to use Federal funds to help implement SHOCAP. 
Mr. President, reforms are also necessary at the Federal level as well. S. 10 would make it easier for Federal prosecutors to try juveniles as adults. Under the bill, U.S. attorneys would have discretion to decide whether to try as adults juveniles 14 years or older without having to go through the Attorney General's office in Washington. 
Federal juvenile court proceedings would be opened to the general public. When imposing a sentence, the district court would also be allowed to consider a juvenile's entire criminal record under the bill. In any case in which a juvenile is tried as an adult, access to the record of that offense would be made available to law enforcement authorities and others in the same manner that adult criminal records are publicly available. 
Mr. President, the government should also be able to mount a counter-attack on gang violence. This legislation targets violent youth gangs, like the notorious Simple City Crew in the District. There would be new Federal penalties for offenses committed by criminal street gangs. Gangs are no longer concentrated in the big cities, they are now in rural towns. The bill would also provide $100 million to hire assistant U.S. attorneys to prosecute juvenile criminal street gangs. 
We as a nation and a government must challenge this culture of violence and restore the culture of personal responsibility and accountability. It is high time to consider hard-headed and sensible juvenile justice policies. Where possible we must give second chances. Where necessary we must punish severely. This is a first step to restore justice to a nation that has grown weary of injustice. 
In sum, this legislation would send a clear, cogent, and convincing message to violent juveniles: `Serious acts have serious consequences.'

Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, earlier today Senator Hatch introduced S. 10, the Violent and Repeat Offender Act of 1997. Senators Lott Domenici, Sessions, and I worked with him in developing the bill. While not perfect, the bill does take the initial steps in dealing with the epidemic of violent juvenile crime sweeping the Nation. 
Mr. President, the face of crime in America is indeed changing. Throughout our history, one thing has been clear: Government's first responsibility is to keep the citizenry safe. John Jay wrote in The Federalist, No. 3 `Among the many objects to which a wise and free people find it necessary to direct their attention, that of providing for their safety seems to be first.' 
The murderers, robbers, rapists, and drug dealers of yesteryear were typically adults. Now they are typically juveniles. As the age of these criminal predators becomes younger and younger with each passing year, so does the age of their victims. 
Last Wednesday afternoon, 12-year-old Darryl Dayan Hall was abducted at gunpoint from the Southeast Washington area by three teenagers of a gang known as the Simple City Crew. This is the same gang that opened gunfire at a crowded community swimming pool in June 1993, wounding six children. This past Saturday, police found Darryl's frozen body. He had been shot once in the back of the head and at least once in the body. 
The three teenagers who are now charged with Darryl's murder have had numerous prior brushes with the law. One of Darryl's assailants was charged as a juvenile with possession of PCP in 1995 and then was released--as is too often the case--promising not to run afoul of the law again. Another of Darryl's assailants was, and is, on probation following his juvenile conviction last spring for possession of PCP with intent to distribute. Darryl's third assailant was charged as a juvenile just last month with carrying a deadly weapon. 
Mr. President, from 1984 to 1994, the number of juveniles murdered in this country increased 82 percent. In 1994, one of every five juveniles murdered were killed by another juvenile. The rate at which juveniles 14 to 17 years old were arrested for murder grew by 22 percent from 1990 to 1994 and the problem is going to get worse, much worse. 
Congress, over the last three decades, has established 131 separate Federal programs--administered by 16 different departments and agencies--to serve delinquent and at-risk youth, according to a report issued by GAO last March. Conservative estimates of Federal appropriations used for these at-risk and delinquent youth programs was more than $4 billion in fiscal year 1995. 
Despite this ongoing massive expenditure, the Federal Government has failed to meet its responsibility of providing public safety in this arena because it has not focused on holding juveniles accountable for their actions, it must focus on the problem of rising juvenile violence. We have a new category of offenders that deserve a new category of responses. We have criminals in our midst--young criminals. 
The juvenile offenders of today will become the career offenders of tomorrow, if Government continues to fail to recognize that America has an acute social illness that cannot be cured with money spent solely on social programs. This legislation takes a commonsense approach in dealing with the epidemic of juvenile violence. It would help States restore safety in urban, suburban, and rural communities. 
This legislation would provide $2.5 billion in new incentive grants for States to enact certain accountability-based reforms to their juvenile justice systems. This legislation would authorize funding for various programs, including trying violent juveniles as adults; establishing the ability of States to collect juvenile criminal records, fingerprints, and photographs, and to share that criminal history 
information within the State, with other States, and with the Federal Government; and establishing the Serious Habitual Offender Comprehensive Action Program [SHOCAP]. In addition, religious organizations would be permitted to participate in rehabilitative programs. 
Serious, violent, and repeat juvenile offenders must be held responsible for their crimes. Today we are living with a juvenile justice system that was created around the time of the silent film. We are living with a juvenile justice system that reprimands the crime victim for being at the wrong place at the wrong time, and then turns around and hugs the juvenile terrorist, whispering ever so softly into his ear, `Don't worry, the State will cure you.' 
The juvenile justice system's primary goal is to treat and rehabilitate the juvenile offender. Such a system can handle runaways, truants, and other status offenders; but it is ill-equipped to deal with those who commit serious, violent, and repeat juvenile crime. 
The criminal justice system, not the juvenile justice system, can emphasize that adult criminal acts have real consequences. The purpose of the criminal justice system is to punish, that is, to hold defendants accountable. 
This legislation would provide financial assistance to States to help them reform their juvenile system. A State would be eligible to receive Federal funds if the State agrees to enact legislation that would provide for the adult prosecution--as a matter of law or prosecutorial discretion--of juveniles 14 or older who commit a violent crime, such as murder, forcible rape, armed robbery and assault with a deadly weapon; an offense involving a controlled substance; or an offense involving possession of a firearm or a destructive device. 
Punishment of dangerous juvenile offenders as adults is an effective tool in fighting violent juvenile crime. For example, Jacksonville, FL State Attorney Harry Shorstein instituted a program to prosecute and incarcerate such offenders in 1992. Two years later, arrests for juveniles dropped from 7,184 to 5,475. While juvenile arrests increased for the Nation, Jacksonville's arrest rate decreased by 30 percent. 
States need to create and maintain juvenile criminal records. Typically, State statutes seal juvenile criminal records and expunge these records when the juvenile reaches age 18. The time has come to discard anachronistic ideas that crimes, no matter how heinous, by juveniles must be kept confidential. 
Our laws view juveniles through the benevolent prism of kids gone astray. It should view them as young criminals who know that they can commit crimes, repeatedly as juveniles because their juvenile records are kept hidden under the veil of secrecy. These young criminals know that when they reach their 18th birthday, they can begin their second career as adult criminals with an unblemished record. In rhetoric we are protecting juveniles from the stigma of a record but in reality we are coddling criminals. We must separate rhetoric from reality by lifting the veil of secrecy. 
Law enforcement officers need to know the prior juvenile criminal records of individuals to assist them in criminal investigations and apprehension. 
Law enforcement is in desperate need of access to juvenile criminal records, according to Police Chief David G. Walchak, who is also president of the International Association of Chiefs of Police. The police chief says, `Current juvenile records (both arrest and adjudication) are inconsistent across the states, and are usually unavailable to the various programs' staff who work with youthful offenders.' The police chief further states that `There are only 26 states that even allow law enforcement access to juvenile records.' 
In the words of Chief Walchak, `If we [law enforcement] don't know who the youthful offenders are, we can't appropriately intervene.' It is that simple. As juvenile gangs spread from urban to suburban to rural areas, as they travel from State to State, the veil of secrecy draped over their criminal history records undermines law enforcement efforts. 
This legislation would also provide money to States to create, maintain, and 
share juvenile criminal records, and to share those records with other Federal, State, and local law enforcement agencies. Strengthening law enforcement should be a top priority. 
School officials need access to juvenile criminal records to assist them in providing for the best interests of all students. Students are vulnerable in unsafe school environments. The decline in school safety can be attributed to laws that protect dangerous students rather than innocent students. While visiting with school officials in Sikeston, MO, a teacher told me that a student came to school wearing an electronic monitoring ankle bracelet. The student told the teacher, `You don't know if I'm a murderer or a rapist and I ain't gonna tell you.' That student was brutally honest. No one had any knowledge of what he had done and, more important, no way of finding out. 
If schools know the identity of a violent juvenile, they can respond to misbehavior by imposing stricter sanctions, assigning particular teachers, or having the student's locker near a teacher's doorway entrance so that the teacher can monitor his conduct during the changing of class periods. In short, this bill would allow school officials to take measures that could prevent violence at schools. 
For purposes of adult sentencing, adult courts need to know if a convicted felon has a history of criminal behavior. According to the 1991 Survey of Inmates in State Correctional Facilities, nearly 40 percent of prison inmates had a prior record as a juvenile. That is approximately 4 in 10 prison inmates. This legislation will not enable criminals to masquerade as neophytes before the criminal justice system. 
The bill allows State and local governments to use Federal funds to implement the Serious Habitual Offenders Comprehensive Action Program [SHOCAP]. 
SHOCAP is a multiagency crime analysis and case management process for identifying and targeting the violent and hard-core juvenile offenders in a community. 
SHOCAP targets these serious habitual offenders for most intensive social supervisory interventions, the most intensive accountability in school attendance and discipline, and the most investigation and prosecution when they commit a crime. 
The OJJDP conducted five test pilots of SHOCAP. Oxnard, CA was one of the selected sites. SHOCAP was implemented in 1983. Oxnard found that less than 2 percent of all juveniles arrested in that community were responsible for 35 percent of felonies by juveniles. Four years later, Oxnard's violent crime dropped 38 percent. Illinois and Florida both have recently established statewide SHOCAP's. This bill would allow all jurisdictions to use Federal funds to implement SHOCAP. 
Reforms are necessary at the Federal level as well. This legislation would make it easier for Federal prosecutors to try juveniles as adults. Under the bill, U.S. attorneys would have discretion to decide whether to try as adults juveniles 14 years or older who are alleged to have committed an act which if committed by an adult would be a felony. This would eliminate juvenile transfer hearings that leave the transfer decision to juvenile court judges. 
Federal juvenile court proceedings would be open to the general public. When imposing a sentence, the district court would be allowed to consider the juvenile's entire prior juvenile records. In any case in which a juvenile is tried as an adult, access to the record of the offenses of the juvenile shall be made available in the same manner as is applicable to adult defendants. And in those cases in which the juvenile was adjudicated delinquent in Federal juvenile delinquency proceedings, the U.S. attorney would be allowed to release such records to law enforcement authorities of any jurisdiction and to school officials. 
When the act committed by the juvenile is heinous, the punishment will be weighed accordingly. If tried and sentenced as an adult, the juvenile would be subject to the death penalty as an adult. In addition, the death penalty would be lowered from age 18 to 16. 
The Government should mount a counterattack on gang violence. This legislation targets violent youth gangs, like the notorious Simple City Crew in the District. There would be new Federal penalties for offenses committed by criminal street gangs. Gangs are no longer concentrated in the big cities, they are now in rural towns. The bill would also provide $100 million to hire assistant U.S. attorneys to prosecute juvenile criminal street gangs. 
We must challenge this culture of violence and restore the culture of personal responsibility. It is high time to consider hardheaded and sensible juvenile justice policies. Where possible we must give second chances. Where necessary we must punish severely. This is a first step to restore justice to a nation that has grown weary of injustice. 
In sum, this legislation would send a clear, cogent, and convincing message: serious acts have serious consequences.

Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I am delighted to have the opportunity to file, in conjunction with Senators Hutchison, Lott, Nickles, Craig, Collins, Enzi, Grassley, Coats, Warner, Helms, B. Smith, and Gramm, the Family Friendly Workplace Act. This is an important piece of legislation, which should free our families from inflexible work schedules in order to meet the competing demands of the workplace and their families.

Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Texas for her sensitivity on this issue and for her commitment to it. I know she is dedicated to helping resolve this. There is simply no reason why the Government of the United States should put a barrier between the employers and employees of America who want to resolve stresses and strengths. We should have laws that allow people to reach these judgments about flexibly and allocating time, with adequate protection which are enforcement mechanisms through the Department of Labor.

Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, let me quickly encapsulate this important piece of legislation for the American people. 
Last year, in a bipartisan effort, we succeeded, and this year this bill is sponsored by a group of individuals including the chairman of the Commerce Committee, Senator McCain, Senator Lott, Senator Coverdell, Senator McConnell, Senator Abraham, and Senator Gramm, and I believe that we will again this year have a bipartisan approach. I have already spoken with a number of the people who were active in this measure--Senator Gorton, Senator Rockefeller, Senator Lieberman, and Senator Dodd--about last year's approach. We again have introduced a similar bill. This is a step on the road of reforming the legal system to provide reason and rationality where the legal system, the tort system has been out of control. 
Three years ago, for general aviation, the private airplane business, the small plane business, we passed a law which provided a framework of responsibility which put that part of the tort system back under control. People pooh-poohed the idea. They said, `It won't help; it won't work to pass such a law.' But we are now again building such airplanes in the United States. There are 9,000 new jobs in that industry alone because we made that decision, and the quality of the airplanes is better than it has ever been before. We have not deprived anyone of the capacity to receive compensatory damages as a result of inferior products or defects in products, and we want to extend the tort reform effort which began with general aviation a step further. 
The second step we took last year, in 1996, when we enacted securities law tort reform. And that law went into effect this last year. So it is now time for us, having done the general aviation portion of legal reform and tort reform and having moved from that to the securities law, to move to manufacturing generally in the product liability area. It is not an attempt to curtail compensatory damages. People who are injured should be compensated for their injuries. But it is an attempt to bring sanity and reason to an out-of-control tort system which is hurting the quality of our products, stifling innovation and making it very difficult for some industries to survive here. I need not tell most folks that they have already made these kinds of adjustments in the European Economic Community and, of course, by our competition in the Pacific Rim. 
This is another step forward in tort reform, and I commend those who have agreed to help us in this respect. I look forward to working with Senators on the other side of the aisle. The President of the United States has repeatedly reiterated his desire to sign a good bill in this respect and we will be fashioning a bill this year. The bill which we have signed is the conference report from last year's effort which passed both Houses of the Congress, and it will provide a place holder as we assemble good legislation this year which we can send to the President and urge him to sign. 
Mr. President, I thank you for the opportunity to introduce these two measures, S. 4 and S. 5.

Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, today is an exciting day as I introduce, along with Senators McCain, Coverdell, McConnell,  and Abraham, S. 5, the Product Liability Fairness Act of 1977. 
Justice Holmes once wisely observed that a page of history is worth a volume of logic. With respect to the effort to enact product liability law, we have hundreds of pages of history and volumes of logic to support its enactment now. 
The effort of the Federal Government to address product liability goes back almost two decades when President Ford established the Federal Inter-Agency Task Force on Product Liability. Although administration changed, President Carter did not abandon the effort, but enhanced it with resulting research that supports what we do today. President Carter chartered the drafting of the Model Uniform Product Liability Act, which tentatively was offered as a vehicle for state action. 
Product liability legislation has been reported out of the Senate Commerce Committee seven times. Last Congress, legislation and a conference report containing many compromises and bipartisan agreements was voted upon favorably in each House. A bipartisan majority of the Senate approved the conference report on March 21, 1996. 
The bill that we introduce today is that conference report. I appreciate that today's bill reflects a bill one that was vetoed by President Clinton. But, we are not here today to simply repeat history. We are here to make history and provide Americans with fair product liability legislation. 
We are introducing the same bill as a `place marker' for discussions and a fair resolution of issues. The President's veto message suggested that he well may have been misinformed about the nature of the legislation passed by bipartisan majorities last year. Let us have discussions to clarify those matters so that the legislation is unequivocal in its meaning and purpose. 
We are resolved to work with the White House to obtain the President's support. I take the President at his word when he said in the Presidential debate on October 6, 1996, `I signed a tort reform bill that dealt with civil aviation a couple of years ago. I proved that I will sign a reasonable tort reform.' 
It is interesting that the President referred to the General Aviation Revitalization Act of 1994, which he did sign on August 17, 1994. The aviation liability reform bill enacted a statute of repose for general aviation aircraft. In 1994, proponents of the bill said that it would produce jobs. It has. To date, over 9,000 new jobs, good jobs, have been created. Single engine aircraft are being manufactured in America again, and an endangered industry has been revitalized. President Clinton was right to support that bill. 
What did opponents say in 1994 aviation bill? They said that no new jobs would be produced. And, they said that if planes were produced, they would be unsafe and, in hyperbole, suggested that they might be made of balsa wood. What actually happened? I already mentioned that 9,000 new jobs have been created. You should also know that the aircraft being made by American workers are the safest single engine aircraft produced in the history of this country. 
Let us bring the results of the General Aviation Revitalization Act of 1994 to the broad segments of our country and industries. 
We introduce this bill to stimulate job growth. We introduce this bill to remove the chilling effects that prevent the introduction of good and useful products. We introduce this bill to encourage new product development. On the other hand, it is our goal to assure that anyone that makes dangerous and defective products is appropriately sanctioned by our tort law. 
From the perspective of many, this bill is a very modest one. From their perspective, there is a need to have liability reform in other crucial areas, such as: general punitive reform, medical liability reform, and volunteers' liability reform. 
The principles contained in this bill are a good starting point to make the product liability laws in this nation fair for consumers who purchase defective 
products while placing the burden on those responsible for placing these products in the stream of commerce. It also ensures that those who misuse products, or use them while under the influence of drugs or alcohol, do not collect a windfall which becomes a burden for American consumers in the form of increased costs for products--useful products that are no longer available in the market, and the loss of jobs and greater opportunities. 
This bill in no way limits compensatory damages. This bill would not affect the ability of plaintiffs to sue manufacturers or sellers of medical implants. It would, however, allow raw material suppliers to be dismissed from lawsuits if the generic raw material used in the medical device met contract specifications, and if the biomaterial supplier is not classified as either a manufacturer or seller of the implant. 
Strong product liability reform is good for America. It ensures that consumers, injured by a product, will be fairly compensated. It will enhance American innovation, which is the best in the world, by treating responsible entrepreneurs fairly while treating the bad actors harshly and to the full extent of the law. 
As chairman of the Consumer Affairs Subcommittee I am committed and look forward to working with this administration toward ending the 20-year study and painstaking endeavor to provide our Nation with sound and fair Federal product liability law. It took the European community about 6 years to accomplish this goal and create the European product liability directive. Japan enacted its first product liability reform law almost 2 years ago. 
Our Nation, this Congress, and this administration should pull together and meet the challenge of our foreign competitors and enact fair and balanced product liability law. In that spirit and for that purpose, we introduce S. 5.
