Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President I thank Senator Snowe, Senator McCain, and Majority Leader Lott for working with us to craft a compromise regarding the coastwise eligibility of Barge APL-60. This limited certification will allow the barge to be used by Camden Iron and Metal in an important new Navy ship disposal initiative. Thanks to the diligent efforts of Senators Lautenberg and Specter, initial funding of $7.5 million for this ship disposal initiative has been included in the FY99 defense appropriations bill. I would just like to clarify with the Senator from Maine that it is her understanding that this provision will apply to all work done by the barge in connection with the initiative for as many years as the initiative continues.

 Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, during last year's passage of the balanced budget agreement, Congress achieved a great victory. We created a new $24 billion program to fund children's health--the State Children's Health Insurance Program. 
Even with that historic effort, our work is far from finished. There are 10 million children in this country without health insurance. But even more troubling is that nearly half of these children are eligible for Medicaid health coverage yet remain unenrolled. 
This is the great tragedy of Medicaid. Barriers to enrollment like complicated application forms, inaccessible sign-up procedures, and demeaning eligibility processes are preventing families from enrolling their kids. A recent report by the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research (AHCPR) stressed the need for states to engage in outreach activities to increase enrollment of Medicaid-eligible children. Likewise, President Clinton recently identified Medicaid outreach as a high priority of his administration. 
The bill I am introducing today would go a long way toward getting these children enrolled. This bill, the Health Care for America's Children Act of 1998, would create an incentive program to reward states who engage in outreach activities to enroll the 4.7 million uninsured children who are eligible for Medicaid. States who employ effective outreach activities like shortened and simplified applications, presumptive and continuous eligibility, and outstationing of eligibility workers in schools and day care centers, would be eligible for a performance bonus. 
State adoption of these outreach activities is critical to removing the barriers to enrollment and ensuring that all eligible children get the Medicaid health insurance to which they are already entitled. According to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), adoption of these outreach measures would increase the number of children enrolled in Medicaid by 700,000 each year after the year 2000. That means that by the year 2007, we could have all eligible children covered. 
Lack of health insurance can be devastating to the health status of children. Children without health insurance are four times more likely to go without needed medical or surgical care. And children without health care are less likely to grow up to be healthy productive adults, less likely to receive timely preventive care, and less likely to receive treatment even for serious illnesses. 
Unmet health care needs also translate into higher costs over the long run. Uninsured children are more likely to need emergency room care at twice the cost of office-based care. Each dollar invested in immunization saves $7.40 in future medical costs. 
Ensuring that children have access to health care is an investment in our future. Over 10 million uninsured children in this country is a crisis. But it is a travesty that we have the means to cover almost half of these children and are failing to do so. In the words of Albert Camus (CAM-OO), `perhaps we cannot prevent this from being our world which children suffer, but we can lessen the number of suffering children.'

 Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, today I introduce the Firearms Safety and Consumer Protection Act of 1998. I am sure that this bill will face opposition, but I am equally sure that the need for this bill is so clear, and the logic so unquestionable, that we will soon see hunters, law enforcement agents and other gun consumers fighting for the passage of the legislation. 
Mr. President, I have long fought against the gun injuries that have plagued America for years. We succeeded in enacting the Brady bill and the ban on devastating assault weapons. And in the 104th Congress, even in the midst of what many consider a hostile Congress, we told domestic violence offenders that they could no longer own a gun. These were each measures aimed at the criminal misuse of firearms. 
But there is another subject that the NRA just hates to talk about--the countless injuries that occur to innocent gun owners, recreational hunters, and to law enforcement. Every year in this country, countless people die and many more are injured by defective or poorly manufactured firearms. Yet the Consumer Product Safety Commission, which has the power to regulate every other product sold to the American consumer, lacks the ability to regulate the manufacture of firearms. 
Amazingly, in a nation that regulates everything from the air we breathe, to the cars we drive, the cribs that hold our children, the most dangerous consumer product sold, firearms, unregulated. Studies show that inexpensive safety technology and the elimination of flawed guns could prevent a third of accidental firearms deaths. Despite this fact, the Federal Government powerless to stop gun companies from distributing defective guns or failing to warn consumers of dangerous products. 
Ths gaping loophole in our consumer protection laws can often be disastrous for gun users. To take just one recent example, even when a gun manufacturer discovered that it had sold countless defective guns with a tendency to misfire, no recall was mandated and no action could be taken by the Federal Government. The guns remained on the street, and consumers were defenseless. Time after time, consumers, hunters, and gun owners are each left out in the cold, without the knowledge of danger or the assistance necessary to protect themselves from it. 
For too long now, the gun industry has successfully kept guns exempt from consumer protection laws, and we must finally bring guns into line with every other consumer product. Logic, common sense, and the many innocent victims of defective firearms all cry out for us to act--and act we must.

 Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, on behalf of the family and friends of Joan D'Alessandro, I want to express gratitude for the passage of Joan's Law, a bill I introduced in October 1997, as a provision in H.R. 3494, the Child Protection and Sexual Predator Punishment Act. 
Twenty-five years ago, 7-year-old Joan D'Alessandro left her home in Hillsdale, New Jersey to deliver Girl Scout cookies to a neighbor and disappeared. Three days later, that neighbor, confessed to taking Joan's life and changing forever the lives of those who loved her. Joseph McGowan, a school teacher, had raped Joan, killed her, and dumped her broken, battered body in a ravine. 
Although McGowan was convicted and sentenced to 20 years in state prison, the nightmare for the D'Alessandro family was far from over. For the past 12 years, they have had to live with the very real prospect that their daughter's killer will walk out of jail one day a free man. Already, McGowan has twice been eligible for parole and a New Jersey appeals court recently ordered another parole hearing. No family should have to suffer the tragedy of the loss of their child and then be forced to relive it again and again through parole hearings and appeals. 
In response to their tragic loss, the D'Alessandro family has worked tirelessly at the state level for the enactment of Joan's Law, legislation providing that a child molester who murders a child under 13 in New Jersey will receive life in prison without the possibility of parole. Joan's Law is now on the books in New Jersey and I am proud that we, in this Congress, are seizing the opportunity to enact companion federal legislation. 
My original legislation states that any person who is convicted of a serious violent felony should be sentenced to either death or imprisonment for life when the victim of the crime is under 14 years of age and dies as a result of the offense. As included in Senator Hatch's substitute to the House-passed bill, the bill also contains a narrow provision which allows the court to impose a lesser sentence in a case where the defendant has provided substantial assistance in the prosecution of another person. While I would have preferred Joan's Law to move forward as originally introduced, I understand and respect the addition of such a provision. It is a change that was made in consultation with and with the approval of both the D'Allesandro family and the bill's House sponsor, Representative Bob Franks. 
In am heartened by the swift passage of the Child Protection and Sexual Predator Protection Act both in the Judiciary Committee and on the floor. By including Joan's Law among the bill's provisions we have sent a strong message that our society will neither tolerate nor forgive the brutal acts of a criminal who takes a young life and ensures that this murdere will never bring such harm and grief to another family.

Mr. TORRICELLI. I thank the majority leader and minority leader for bringing this legislation forward. Although time has been short, to some of us this is very important. Mr. President, this is a simple effort to conserve 15 acres of land in Morristown, NJ. It is for most Americans a sacred piece of real estate. It is where George Washington spent the winter of 1779. There are few more hallowed grounds in American history. 
While previous Congresses have saved much of this real estate, this particular acreage is under threat of development. This is a simple authorization. The U.S. Government can either enter into a contract to purchase or receive it as a gift, this final threatened acreage. I am very grateful for this support and bringing this forward today. 
Finally, Mr. President, I want to mention, while Senator Gorton is on the floor, that in separate legislation in the Interior bill he has authorized a study of all remaining threatened lands from the Revolutionary War, that we no longer have to do this on a piecemeal basis. 
I thank again the majority leader, Mr. President. 
I yield the floor.

 Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, today I introduce legislation which will assist in the critical effort to preserve our nation's most vulnerable farmland. I want to first acknowledge Senator Leahy's decisive leadership on this issue, and recognize him as the author of the original legislation establishing the Farmland Protection Program in the 1996 Farm Bill. He has been a tireless advocate for this important issue, and I look forward to working closely with him in the future to protect more of our Nation's open spaces. 
We have heard a lot during the last decade about the dissolution and destruction of the American Family Farm. Indeed, the family farm is under serious threat of extinction. Today, there are 1,925,300 farms in the United States, the lowest number of farms in our Nation since before the Civil War. The U.S. is losing two acres of our best farmland to development every minute of every day. In my State, New Jersey, we have lost 6,000 farms, or 40 percent of our total, since 1959. This reduction has serious implications for the environment, the economy and our food supply. 
The threat comes partially from an anachronistic and unfair inheritance tax that threatens the generational continuity of the family farm and partially from the fact that much of America's farmland is near major cities. As our cities sprawl into neighboring rural areas, our farms are in danger of becoming subdivisions or shopping malls. 
Last year I strongly supported a significant reduction in the estate tax to keep farms in the family, preserve open space and ensure fairness in our tax code. This was an important victory for farmers across the Nation. However, we also need programs like the Farmland Protection Program to reinforce this effort. This critical initiative is designed to protect soil by encouraging landowners to limit conversion of their farmland to non-agricultural uses. It has proven so successful that demand for these grants currently outstrips availability of funds by 900 percent, and the last of its authorized funding was spent during fiscal year 1998. 
The legislation I am introducing today with Senators Leahy, DeWine and Jeffords will provide authorization for additional funding, and ensure the survival of this important program. Our bill will reauthorize the program at $55 million a year through 2002, and will broaden the original legislation to allow non-profit conservation groups to hold these easements. This provision is necessary because some State governments, such as Colorado's, are barred from holding easements by their constitution. This legislation will allow non-profit groups to hold these easements in lieu of the state government and this will broaden participation in the program. 
I hope my colleagues are able to support this legislation and allow us to continue building on the success of the past few years, during which we were able to protect nearly 82,000 acres on more than 230 farms.

 Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, today with my colleague from New Jersey, Senator Lautenberg, I introduce the `Children's Lead Prevention and Inclusive Treatment Act of 1998.' For almost thirty years Congress has focused attention on lead-related issues. In 1971 we first passed the Lead-based Paint Poisoning Prevention Act, and much has been done since that time to identify children with elevated lead levels, to educate parents on the dangers of lead, and to devise means of removing or controlling lead in homes. Over the last 20 years, the removal of lead from gasoline, food canning, children's toys, and other sources has seen a reduction in national population blood lead levels by over 80 percent. 
Yet recent studies indicate that we are still not doing enough. While national lead levels have dropped over 80 percent, the numbers for Medicaid children, and poor children overall, are nothing short of disgraceful. Since 1992 the Health Care Financing Administration, at the behest of Congress, has required that Medicaid children be screened for elevated blood-lead levels at least twice before they reach the age of 2. But the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that nationally, 890,000 children between the ages of one and five have elevated blood lead levels and have never been tested. 
Even worse, Mr. President, in a Report to Congress earlier this year, the General Accounting Office reported that almost 79 percent of Medicaid children under two years of age have never been screened! This means that as many as 206,000 Medicaid children between the ages of 1 and 2 have not been screened. Considering that in 1991 the U.S. Public Health Service called for a society-wide effort to eliminate childhood lead poisoning by the year 2011, it is quite apparent that we are not making much progress in reaching that goal. 
A subsequent GAO report further identified poor and minority children as being at greatest risk of lead poisoning. GAO reported that the prevalence of elevated blood lead levels in Hispanic children aged 1 through 5 was more than twice that of white children, and for African-American children it was more than five times that of white children. Additionally, children in families below 130 percent of the Federal poverty level had a higher prevalence of elevated blood lead levels than those children above the Federal poverty level. Yet all these children continue to be the very ones falling through the cracks! 
That is why, Mr. President, I am introducing this legislation. The Children's Lead PAINT Act promises to be a three-pronged attack on the lead-screening system. First, it will create a `safety net' through WIC and Early Start to ensure that high-risk children are screened. A parent enrolling their child in either of these programs must provide proof of screening, within 180 days of enrollment. If a child hasn't been screened, a parent can request WIC or Early Start to perform the test themselves. Additionally, if WIC or Early Start performs the test, Medicaid will be authorized to reimburse the program. 
Second, we will be putting teeth into the State's screening obligation, by setting a Minimum number of Screenings a State must perform, or having it face a penalty for failure. Beginning in Fiscal Year 2000, States will be required to screen at least 50 percent of Medicaid children under age 2. This will increase 10 percent each year until it hits 90 percent, where it must remain. If States fail to meet these targets, they stand to lose one percent of their Medicaid funds. 
Finally, Mr. President, we will require any Health Care Provider that signs a State Medicaid contract to agree in that contract to comply with the screening requirements, and to provide follow-up services to children who test positive. Although States have been required to perform these screenings, they are not a mandatory requirement of Medicaid health care contracts. Thus, there is no statutory obligation on the part of physicians to perform the tests. This will ensure that doctors perform the tests and that if a child does test positive that an environmental assessment will be done at their home and that follow-up testing and evaluations will be conducted. 
I am especially pleased that I have been joined in this fight by two highly regarded national advocacy groups. The Alliance to End Childhood Lead Poisoning, a non-profit public interest organization exclusively dedicated to the elimination of childhood lead poisoning, has publicly endorsed the Lead PAINT Act. Similarly, the Coalition to End Childhood Lead Poisoning, a non-profit parents and victims organization dedicated to educating the public on the dangers of lead poisoning and as well as to eradicating this disease, has also publicly endorsed this legislation. 
Mr. President, although we have made great progress in lead poison prevention techniques, first, by banning lead-based paint in homes and more recently by strengthening our home testing system, the GAO report makes it very clear that we are failing to identify those children with lead already in their bodies. It is time we demand accountability. Our children deserve no less.

 Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, today I introduce legislation authorizing funding for extended school day and extended school year programs across the country. The continuing gap between American students and those in other countries, combined with the growing needs of working parents and the growing popularity of extending both the school day and the school year, have made this educational option a valuable one for many school districts. 
Students in the United States currently attend school an average of only 180 days per year, compared to 220 days in Japan, and 222 days in both Korea and Taiwan. American students also receive fewer hours of formal instruction per year compared to their counterparts in Taiwan, France, and Germany. We cannot expect our students to remain competitive with those in other industrialized countries if they must learn the same amount of information in less time. 
Our school calendar is based on a no longer relevant agricultural cycle that existed when most American families lived in rural areas and depended on their farms for survival. The long summer vacation allowed children to help their parents work in the fields. Today, summer is a time for vacations, summer camps, and part-time jobs. Young people can certainly learn a great deal at summer camp, and a job gives them maturity and confidence. However, more time in school would provide the same opportunities while helping students remain competitive with those in other countries. As we debate the need to bring in skilled workers from other countries, the need to improve our system of education has become increasingly important. 
In 1994, the Commission on Time and Learning recommended keeping schools open longer in order to meet the needs of both children and communities, and the growing popularity of extended-day programs is significant. Between 1987 and 1993, the availability of extended-day programs in public elementary schools has almost doubled. While school systems have begun to respond to the demand for lengthening the school day, the need for more widespread implementation still exists. Extended-day programs are much more common in private schools than public schools, and only 18 percent of rural schools have reported an extended-day program. 
This bill would authorize $50 million over the next five years for the Department of Education to administer a demonstration grant program. Local education agencies would then be able to conduct a variety of longer school day and school year programs, such as extending the school year to 210 days, studying the feasibility of extending the school day, and implementing strategies to maximize the quality of extended core learning time. 
The constant changes in technology, and greater international competition, have increased the pressure on American students to meet these challenges. Providing the funding for programs to lengthen the school day and school year would leave American students better prepared to meet the challenges facing them in the next century.

 Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I introduce legislation that represents an important step forward in our national strategy for addressing traumatic brain injury (TBI) and spinal cord injury (SCI). Tragically, these injuries have enormous personal and economic costs on victims, their families, and our nation as a whole. 
Today, an estimated 4.5 million Americans live with a disability as a result of a TBI. Each year, more than two million people suffer a TBI, 10,000 of whom live in my State of New Jersey. More than 200,000 Americans live with a SCI, with 10,000 new injuries reported each year. Collectively, TBI and SCI costs the U.S. more than $35 billion per year. 
These statistics, however, reveal only a fraction of the problem. In the U.S., we have no standardized system of collecting information on these injuries. Instead, we rely on the work of a few limited State programs and private organizations who often lack the resources to collect complete, timely, and accurate data. 
Mr. President, the legislation I introduce today, the TBI/SCI Registry Act, will allow the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to make grants available to states to establish their own TBI/SCI registries. The CDC and state departments of health will then work as partners in establishing and maintaining comprehensive tracking systems that ensures patient privacy. 
The important information that state registries will be responsible for collecting will include: circumstances of injury and demographics of patients; length of stay in hospital and treatments used; severity of the injury; outcomes of treatments and services. 
The benefits will be far-reaching because the collection of accurate data will help identify high-risk populations for future prevention programs and will help link patients to effective treatments and social services. Perhaps most important, the information from these registries will help advocates and legislators justify TBI/SCI as a greater funding priority. 
The National Institutes of Health (NIH) currently spends approximately $60 million for SCI and $52 million for TBI. This research has contributed to tremendous progress, but we must improve our ability to identify innovative research projects and increase our financial commitment to those efforts. 
Mr. President, this legislation will ultimately help achieve this goal by creating a foundation for a unified scientific and public health approach for preventing, treating, and someday finding a cure for TBI/SCI. I am proud that my bill has already received the endorsement of the Christopher Reeve Foundation, the American Paralysis Association, the Brain Injury Association, and the Eastern Paralyzed Veterans Association.

 Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today to join the Holy Name Healthcare Foundation in honoring Joseph C. Parisi and Lucille his wife as they receive the Lifetime Achievement Award. The Parisi's record of community activism and involvement has been extensive, and I am pleased to recognize them on this occasion. 
Joseph C. Parisi has served as Mayor of Englewood Cliffs since 1976. Prior to that he served on the town council for four years and was also the Englewood Cliffs Police Commissioner. His involvement in the Englewood Cliffs community for over twenty-five years has made Englewood Cliffs one of the finest towns in the North Jersey area. Mayor Parisi has worked on behalf of a diverse pool of charitable and civic organizations that include the Witte Scholarship Fund, the Quincentennial Columbus Day Celebration, Veterans of Foreign Wars, and the Knights of Columbus. The Englewood Chamber of Commerce, UNICO, and the New Jersey Insurance Agents, have all honored Mayor Parisi as their `Man of the Year' in the past. 
Lucille Parisi has equaled her husband's accomplishments in a number of civic organizations. As President of the Hudson County Independent Insurance Agents, President of the Englewood Cliffs Democratic Club, and Director of the Fort Lee Savings and Loan, Lucille has been an active member of the community. For the past 16 years, she has also served on the Board of Trustees and the Foundation of the Holy Name Hospital. 
As a native of Bergen County, I have known the Parisis well for many years. I have seen their dedication to the Englewood Cliffs Community firsthand, and I have consistently been impressed by their level of commitment. They truly embody the activism and dedication to community that is so vital. 
I know they will inspire others to take an interest in improving their communities. They have earned a place in the hearts of Englewood Cliffs residents, and it is my pleasure to be able to honor them and their family on this occasion.

 Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Maurice River Township as it celebrates its 200th anniversary on Saturday October 3rd. It is a pleasure for me to be able to recognize this important milestone. 
Maurice River Township has a rich and varied history that will be celebrated and honored this Saturday. Maurice River Township was first chartered as one of six precincts of the County of Cumberland, created by the Colonial Legislature, in the Colony of West Jersey on January 19th, 1747. Together, Greenwich, Hopewell, and Stow Creek, on the North side of Cohansey Creek, as well as Fairfield, Deerfield, and Maurice River on the South side of Cohansey Creek, formed Cumberland County. The Maurice River Precinct contained all of the land on the East side of Prince Maurice's River. In 1798, Maurice River was finally incorporated as a Township by the New Jersey State Legislature. 
Over the past 200 years the Township of Maurice River has developed into a thriving community, incorporating the eight villages of Delmont, Bricksboro, Dorchester, Leesburg, Heislerville, Port Elizabeth, Cumberland, and Milmay. Today, Maurice River stands as one of the most vibrant communities in the State of New Jersey, and I am confident it will continue to grow in a positive direction. 
The determination and the spirit of the Maurice River community make it a privilege for me to recognize its bicentennial anniversary. The Township has become one of New Jersey's brightest stars, and I look forward to another two hundred years of success.

Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today to offer my appreciation to my colleagues on the Labor Committee for their hard work on the Higher Education Reauthorization Act of 1998. I am especially grateful to the Chairman and Ranking Member, Senator Jeffords and Senator Kennedy, for their inclusion of two provisions I authored which are critical to the people of this Nation and of my state of New Jersey. 
The first addresses the issue of campus safety. Mr. President, every year, over 10 million students and their parents agonize over where to attend college. They spend months researching schools and visiting campuses in an effort to find the perfect fit. Just as information is the key to making an informed choice about professors or scholarships, it is the key to choosing a safe learning environment. Currently, students and their parents do not have access to all the information. 
Current law requires colleges and universities to report statistics on crimes that occur on their campuses. Reports of hate crimes, however, is limited to only those that result in murder, rape, or aggravated assault. This is the law notwithstanding the fact that these 3 categories of crimes only represent 16 percent of the total number of hate crimes that occur on college campuses every year. Over 80% take the form of other crimes, including simple assault and robbery. 
An amendment I offered, which is now part of the Higher Education Act, will ensure that students and their parents have all the information necessary to choose a safe school. This amendment will require colleges and universities to report all hate crimes that involve either bodily injury or a serious property crime such as burglary or arson. It also expands the definition of a hate crime to protect women and the disabled. Current law only protects against crimes motivated by prejudice based on race, ethnicity, religion, or sexual orientation. 
Our children are our future. Their college years are among the most exciting and formative of their lives. Expanding the types of hate crimes colleges and universities must report will empower students and parents with all of the information necessary to ensure that those years are as safe as possible. 
I would also like to thank Senators Jeffords and Kennedy for their inclusion of another amendment I authored which will freeze the status of a student reservist's grace period for paying back their education loans until they return from active duty service. All students are permitted a grace period of up to nine months after graduating or withdrawing from class before they must begin to repay their student loans. However, the typical length of active duty service for a reservist is currently 270 days, meaning that a student's grace period has often expired by the time they return home from military service. 
We should not welcome our courageous men and women in uniform home from active duty by handing them a bill. Students who serve their country in the armed forces should at least have the peace of mind of knowing that their student loans are not increasing while they are abroad. This provision will provide them with that peace of mind. 
For these two provisions and for all their hard work on this very important piece of legislation, I thank Senator Jeffords, Senator Kennedy and all of my colleagues on the Labor Committee.

Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today to offer an amendment on the underlying legislation of FAA reauthorization. I do so in recognition of the reality of life of hundreds of thousands of people that I represent--and, indeed, most Members of the Senate represent--who, by the chance of the place of their birth or where they choose to live, have a daily encounter with the rising problem of airplane noise in our country. 
We have through recent decades learned to expand our concept of pollution of the air and the water to toxins, to chemicals we work with every day. But to most Americans they, in their own lives, have already come to understand and reach the decision that I bring before this Senate today: Noise is a pollution, and it is a very real part of the quality of life of most people in our country, impacting their communities. 
I offer this amendment because this problem will not solve itself and, indeed, as the years pass, it is clear it is going to get worse. The FAA predicts that by the year 2007 there will be 36 percent more airplane flights than this Nation will experience this year; 60 of the 100 largest airports in this country in each of our major metropolitan regions are planning expansions with new runways. To some, this is a choice between economic expansion and the quality of life or health of our families. We do not have to reach that choice. If we build airports, plan their expansion, and deal with the issue of flight paths with good, scientific information, understanding the impact of noise on health and how it can be mitigated, there is no reason to compromise economic growth while we legitimately address the health of our families. 
We already know that 25 million Americans are impacted by noise problems every day. Even the rudimentary studies that have been undertaken lead us to understand that noise exposure is an element of hypertension difficulties and cardiovascular problems. It is estimated that another 40 million people with different levels of noise exposure have sleep or work disruption that affect their productivity and their own quality of life. 
The Environmental Protection Agency for a time was involved in these issues. Some of the judgment I bring before the Senate today was made more than two decades ago. Then Congress understood the impact of noise on health and quality of life. But in 1981 the Congress eliminated the Office of Noise Abatement and Control, so much scientific work and the advice of scientists and others with this responsibility ceased. 
In the EPA's absence, the Federal Aviation Administration has been charged with the responsibility of monitoring aircraft noise. Mr. President, the FAA has a mission, it has technical capabilities, and it performs its mission admirably. But dealing with the problem of noise is not its expertise or its mission. There is an obvious conflict of interest between promoting the expansion of the aviation industry and its airports and their operations, and dealing with the problem of noise. This conflict was recently highlighted by the Natural Resources Defense Council's own study that found that the FAA's policy, relying on a 65-decibel threshold for determining the level of noise compatibility with residential communities, was far too high and completely inappropriate. Yet that is the level the FAA continues to use because it does not force the critical choices in dealing with noise abatement. 
I cannot adequately describe, for the quarter of a million people who live in New Jersey who are impacted by noise problems from Newark Airport, JFK, and La Guardia every day, how disappointing it is that this work in the Federal Government has ceased and the FAA alone is exercising this responsibility. 
In our absence in these 17 years, much of this work and much of the progress on the question of noise and airports has been ceded to European leadership where much of the current health studies are being undertaken. For example, in Munich, Germany, a scientific study recently found that chronic exposure to airplane noise was affecting the psychological well-being of young children. Another study in England, where in our absence this work also was continuing, found that children studying under flight paths to Heathrow Airport in London had a reading age 6 months behind children who were not similarly exposed to aircraft noise. 
The amendment I offer today, of which I now speak, would reengage the EPA in the serious business of evaluating alternatives and the impacts of airplane noise. It is based on legislation that I introduced last year with Senators Sarbanes, Wellstone, Lautenberg, Moynihan, Murray, D'Amato, and Boxer. I have termed it the `Quiet Communities Act,' and it would reestablish within the EPA an Office of Noise Abatement and Control. 
Some of that mission is reflected in the amendment I bring to the floor today for this authorization legislation. It will require the EPA to conduct a study which examines the FAA selection of noise measurement methodologies, so we know when the FAA does undertake studies whether their methodologies are sound and reasonable, as well as establishing a threshold of noise at which health impacts are felt. 
So that in communities all across America, when people gather with local airport authorities and State authorities and Federal authorities, there is a scientific basis to know with some certainty whether or not their children's health is being impacted. 
It is important to note that this bill will only give the EPA the authority to recommend new standards. It will only give them authority to recommend. It imposes nothing. The EPA can make its suggestions. It can do scientific studies. It can give a baseline. It will not change the authority in making final judgments. 
Mr. President, I believe this is a reasonable suggestion to go down the path that other industrialized democracies have followed and which this Congress recognized two decades ago, that noise is a real and persistent problem in America that affects health. It is only reasonable that on a voluntary basis the EPA be able to make recommendations at what level and what methodologies so we can have an informed debate. 
Mr. President, I offer this amendment for my colleagues' consideration, and I urge its adoption. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, in a few moments, the Senate will vote on an amendment that I have offered with my colleague, Senator Lautenberg. The amendment could not be simpler on its face or more modest in its intent. We could have required an environmental impact statement for every time the FAA changes a flight path. We did not do that. We could have given the EPA the power to set standards for noise, for health. Maybe we should have, but we did not do that. 
All that we have asked is that, as with each of our other major industrial competitors in the western world, noise be considered as a factor in the operation of this Nation's airports. That is all. And on two bases. First, when the FAA establishes methodology to determine whether or not particular noise involving airplanes is safe for schoolchildren or families or recreation, that methodology be evaluated by the EPA. That is all. They will not establish it. They will not make the decisions. They will evaluate whether the methodology is sound because scientific studies are indicating our current methodology does not accurately gauge whether or not our children are safe. 
Second, that the appropriate levels of what is safe be established. There is also independent scientific evidence, as confirmed by European allies, that current levels may allow a level of noise pollution that does have detrimental health impacts. We would like the EPA's judgment on what the appropriate levels might be. They will not make a decision. They will offer their advice. 
Mr. President, it is modest in its intent. It recognizes that noise is a real part of their lives for 40 million Americans every day of this expansion of our air networks. I urge adoption of this amendment.

Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I want to first express my congratulations to Senator Murkowski without whose efforts in committee we would not, today, be discussing this resolution; Senator Graham of Florida, who has labored for so long on this cause; Senator Daschle; Senator Landrieu; Senator D'Amato; Senator Craig; so many Members of this institution who have taken the cause and interests of the people of Puerto Rico and made them their own. 
There are few more solemn responsibilities to come to the Congress of the United States than the issue of admission into this great Union. It is solemn because to join in union is to share a future, to pledge our fortunes, our lives, together. It is a serious occasion because the prospect of joining this Union raises the prospect of `forever,' because this Union is indivisible, it is permanent. The judgment to join this Union is made by any peoples and any lands but once in their history, and it is never revisited again. 
For 100 years, the people of Puerto Rico and these United States have shared a common history. Our people have fought together, bled together, and died together. Our cultures over a period of time increasingly have merged. Hundreds of thousands, indeed, millions, of people of Puerto Rico have chosen to live among other Americans in these United States. Indeed, the judgment that potentially might be made by the people of Puerto Rico who reside on the island has economically and culturally and even politically already been made by millions of others in how they live and where they choose to live. 
The history of the United States for these 200 years has been a history of constant enfranchisement, expanding the right to vote to African-Americans, to women, people 18 years of age, in our own generation to the people of Hawaii and Alaska. 
It is part of the great history of this country that we, unlike other nations, were not satisfied to simply enfranchise ourselves but recognized we were the greater and the better people through our expansion. Now we, potentially, visit that question again. It is a judgment that can only be made by the people of Puerto Rico for themselves. This is ultimately their responsibility to decide. But it is the responsibility of this Congress that they have the right to decide. It is a peculiar and tragic irony of history that the first republic to be created out of colonialism might now enter the 21st century in a neocolonialist position. 
No American should be content with this contradiction of our own history, and some might claim--some might even accuse--that this U.S. Government is in a position with the people of Puerto Rico that is anything less than full, free, fair, and democratic. Yet, by the definition we have applied for ourselves, it would be difficult to defend against the charge. Written on the walls of this Capitol from the inaugural address of President Harrison in 1841 is, `The only legitimate right to government is an expressed grant of power from the governed.' 
Yet, Mr. President, every day, the people of Puerto Rico are subjected to fees, rules, regulations, policies, and determinations from this Congress, having no representative who has a right to vote and make a judgment on their behalf. The relationship between the people of Puerto Rico and the United States is a contradiction with everything that we hold dear and every principle upon which this country was founded. 
Mr. President, I urge the people of Puerto Rico to take this judgment seriously between this date and December 13 and to think carefully. If they decide to join this Union, this is a moment that they will not visit again. Joining this Union is permanent. If it were my judgment, I, like the Senator from New York, Senator D'Amato, would choose to join the Union. I believe history has given us the right and the responsibility to face the future together. But I recognize mine is no more than a casual opinion. The decision rests with the people of Puerto Rico alone. The importance of this resolution is that as the people of Puerto Rico vote, they should recognize that the U.S. Congress considers Puerto Rico to genuinely be the unfinished business of American democracy. 
The people of Puerto Rico should recognize as they vote that the Congress of the United States is watching, that we recognize our responsibilities and are prepared in the 106th Congress to receive their judgment and make our own decision about the future of this Union. 
Mr. President, once again, I want to congratulate Senator Murkowski for having presided over these issues these months, and Senator Graham for his leadership, and each of my colleagues who come to this floor on a bipartisan basis, across ideological lines, uniting in our common belief that there is no right to govern without the consent of the governed and that it is not good enough, in spite of the enfranchisement of all of our people across this continent, that there remains a single exception. America is too good a land, our history is too great, for anyone to be an exception to these great and lasting principles. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

He is an extraordinary man who has given great service to his people in making this night possible. Carlos Romero-Barcelo, your service has been nonetheless a great credit to the people of Puerto Rico. 
Mr. President, I yield the remainder of my time to the Senator from Connecticut, Mr. Lieberman.

 Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize St. Rose High School as it celebrates its 75th Anniversary. This year marks the 75th year the high school will provide quality education to students in and around the Belmar area. It is a pleasure for me to recognize this important milestone. 
St. Rose exists to educate high school age men and women so that they may realize their spiritual, academic, and social potential. St. Rose's mission, since beginning as a parish school in 1923, emanates from a tradition of Roman Catholic education administered by the Sisters of St. Joseph of Chestnut Hill. The staff of religious and lay faculty is responsive to the needs of a changing world. They have created a safe, supportive, disciplined atmosphere and curriculum that honors and nurtures the dignity, worth and capabilities of each student. The alumni go on to assume positions of leadership within their communities and professional fields. 
This school has become an extraordinary educational institution that has improved the quality of life for the citizens of New Jersey, and it has long been an example of the standard that we set for our nation's high schools. Through hard work and dedication, the faculty have illustrated their commitment to building the leaders of tomorrow, and their success over the past 75 years serve as an inspiration to all educators. 
I am proud to recognize St. Rose on its anniversary, and I look forward to another 75 years of quality education from this institution.

Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I would like to thank the many Senators who have demonstrated a commitment to historic Civil War battlefield preservation which culminated in this amendment to the Interior Appropriations Bill that directs $10 million be made available for matching grants to States and local communities for Civil War Battlefield preservation. I especially want to thank Senators Lott and Gorton for their efforts over the past several months as well as my long time ally in this issue, Senator Jeffords. 
Battlefield preservation is essential to allow current and future generations to experience the powerful lessons these places convey about the past, present, and future of the United States. A battlefield's landscape speaks beyond written accounts and motion picture and television recreations. The remarkable story of our country's struggle for independence cannot be compellingly told or wholly understood without these sites. The need to protect these sites of heroism and sacrifice has never been more acute. Today, residential, commercial, and industrial development threaten significant battle sites in many states.

Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I thank my colleague and friend, the Senator from Florida, Senator Graham. 
I, too, rise in observance of Hispanic Heritage Month, noting that there could be no better way to note the importance of our Hispanic heritage and this month of observance than to deal with the reality of the political status of Puerto Rico. 
In 1841, President Harrison said, `The only legitimate right to govern is an express grant of power from the governed.' 
Those words were deemed so important to our Republic, so basic to our system of government, they became a part of the architecture of the Capitol itself. The history of our country is about the expansion of democracy and the enfranchisement of people. The very purpose for founding this Nation was to ensure that our people would have control over their own destiny and choose their own Government. Through the generations, this maturation process has included the enfranchisement of women, African-Americans, and eventually to all people over the age of 18. 
The democratic process was probably never better exercised or no firmer commitment made than when this Congress established an orderly procedure to admit new States. That process committed to the people of our country that the process of enfranchisement and of self-government was not simply for themselves but other people who share our ideals, culture, and our geography. 
Ever since 1898, the end of the Spanish-American War, we have shared a culture, a history, and a geography with the people of Puerto Rico. The people of the island of Puerto Rico have been subject to our laws and regulations, but they have been unable to vote for the very legislators who would govern them through their actions. 
Puerto Rico is the unfinished business of American democracy. Having long since enfranchised all of our population, having extended our sovereignty into the Pacific Ocean and the Northwest, all that remains is the people of these few islands including Puerto Rico, the first and most important case that remains to be dealt with. 
This is important not only to the 29 million Hispanic-Americans, it is important to all of our people, because it involves justice and fairness. 
Earlier this year, Senators Craig and Graham introduced the Puerto Rican Political Status Act. I was very proud to follow their leadership and be part of its drafting and its introduction. That legislation in similar form passed the House of Representatives in March. It would fully and clearly allow the people of Puerto Rico to follow the path of full democracy if they so chose. Unfortunately, the legislation remains in the Energy and Natural Resources Committee. While we are all grateful that the chairman has scheduled consideration of the legislation, in truth it is very late in the life of the 105th Congress. Each day that passes, every week that goes by, we increase the chance that the people of Puerto Rico will not have an expression from this Congress about the chance they may possess to enfranchise themselves and be heard through a recognized plebiscite this year. 
Regardless of individual opinion of Members of this body as to what the judgment of the people of Puerto Rico might or should be, whether Members of the Senate support statehood or commonwealth or independence, the one thing I believe upon which we can all agree is that we have a responsibility, consistent with our own ideas, our ideals, our culture--a mandate of history to ensure that the people of Puerto Rico are heard. 
What decision the people of Puerto Rico might make is their choice. Whether or not they have a choice is our obligation. There are 3.8 million people on Puerto Rico, with too long an association with our country to pretend this is not a historic problem. They are too many in number to conclude that it does not really matter. I urge the leadership of this Senate to ensure that this legislation dealing with the political status of Puerto Rico and its opportunity for a plebiscite come before this Senate before it expires. 
I urge the people of Puerto Rico to proceed with their plebiscite and make a final and lasting judgment about their political status. The United States cannot allow itself to enter the 21st century in a great irony of history--that the product of the world's most important democratic revolution, the first people on the face of this Earth to rise up against colonialism and demand the right of the governed to express themselves, be a party to what is by any measure a postcolonialist political arrangement. 
It is not simply that it is unfair to the people of Puerto Rico, it is wrong for the people of the United States. It is inconsistent with our history and it cannot endure. 
I compliment Senator Craig and Senator Graham for their leadership, and say how grateful I am to be a part of this truly historic effort. 
I thank the Senator from Florida for yielding time.

Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, today with Senator Lautenberg I introduce legislation to preserve land on which our nation was forged. During the harsh winter of 1779-1780 the Continental Army, and its leader, General George Washington camped at Morristown, New Jersey. 
Washington chose Morristown for its logistical, geographical, and topographical advantages and also because of its close proximity to British-occupied New York City. Washington and his men encountered great hardships here, as the winter of 1779 was the worst winter here in over 100 years. 
When soldiers first arrived at Morristown, they had no choice but to sleep out in the open snow as it took most about two to three weeks to build wooden huts to hold groups of a dozen men. The last of the Continental Army, however, did not move into the huts until the middle of February, and conditions were so bad that many soldiers stole regularly to eat, deserted, or mutinied. Only the leadership of General Washington held the Continental Army intact, enabling him to plot the strategy for the coming spring that would turn the tide of the war. 
Through the preservation of this site, we honor the men who served at Morristown and fought for our independence. And more than that, we preserve the best classroom imaginable to understand how our nation was born. 
Recognizing the importance of this site, Congress created the Morristown National Historical Park in 1933, the first historical national park in the National Park System. 
In the years since the establishment of the park, however, New Jersey has undergone a revolution of another sort: from Garden State to Suburban State. In 1959, there were 15,000 farms in New Jersey covering 1.4 million acres. Today, there are 9,000 farms on 847,000 acres, a 40% decrease. In New Jersey, as much as 10,000 acres of rural land is being developed every year. 
North-central New Jersey and the area around the park has not been spared from this development. Much of the private land adjacent to the park has been subdivided and developed for residential use. Many of these residences are visible from park areas, altering the rural character of the park and diminishing the visitor's experience of the park's historic landscape. 
The legislation we are introducing today will help preserve the natural environment of the Park by authorizing the Park Service to expand the boundary of the park to include the 15-acre Warren property on Mt. Kemble Ridge. Specifically, our legislation authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to acquire through purchase, purchase with appropriated funds, or donation, the Warren Property. This acquisition will prevent this land, where patriots made their camp during the winter of 1779-1780, from being re-zoned and subdivided for residential development. 
The National Park Service strongly supports this legislation. NPS Deputy Director, Denis Galvin, recently testified in support of legislation to acquire the Warren Property before a House National Parks and Public Lands Subcommittee hearing on March 26, 1998. This important parcel of land has been classified as `desirable for acquisition' by the National Park Service since 1976. 
In addition, the property's owner, Jim Warren, is a willing seller and interested in seeing the property preserved as part of Morristown National Historical Park. Acquisition of the Warren Property for inclusion in the park would ensure that the character of the park's historic landscape is not further degraded. 
Unfortunately, there are historic sites in my home state of New Jersey and across our country that need to be preserved. It is my hope that through this effort, the Morristown National Historical Park and sites like it across the country will be preserved for generations to come so that the history of our country and its guiding principles will remain alive in the hearts of all Americans.

Rowan provides an exceptional environment for achievement and fulfillment through rigorous academic training and vigorous personal interaction among the members of its diverse learning community. As a regional public university committed to teaching, Rowan combines liberal education with professional preparation and offers programs from the undergraduate through doctoral levels. Rowan University seeks to achieve knowledge through ambition, responsibility through service, and character through challenge. The University is a constantly expanding resource for the State of New Jersey, developing as a community of learners with a curriculum that integrates professional and liberal education. Rowan has succeeded in developing values, shaping character, and enhancing the capacity for a fulfilling and socially responsible life among its graduates. Rowan University alumni are well prepared to assume positions of leadership within their communities and professional fields. 
Rowan University has become an extraordinary comprehensive institution that has improved the quality of life for the citizens of New Jersey, and it has long been an example of the standard that we set for our nation's universities. Through hard work and dedication, the faculty have illustrated their commitment to building the leaders of tomorrow, and their success over the past 75 years serve as an inspiration to all educators. 
I am proud to recognize Rowan University on its anniversary, and I look forward to another 75 years of quality education from this institution.

Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, there is perhaps no greater foreign policy priority in the post-cold-war world than assisting former Communist countries in making the difficult transition to democracy. The fall of the Soviet Union was not the final victory of the cold war. That will come only when all of these former adversaries embrace liberty, free markets, and the rule of law. Recognizing this, the 102nd Congress in 1992, passed the Freedom Support Act. This bill acknowledged that we can help countries make the transition to democracy both with the carrot of economic aid and the stick of withholding such assistance. It included a provision, Section 907, which mandated that with the exception of humanitarian aid, democracy-building funds, and investment assistance, Azerbaijan will not receive any direct economic aid until it ceases the blockade of neighboring Armenia and the Armenian enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh. 
However, since that historic moment in 1992, this provision of the Freedom Support Act has repeatedly come under fire for its scope and perceived effect on relations between the United States and Azerbaijan. Opponents of Section 907 have repeatedly sought the opportunity to weaken its restrictions, or eliminate them altogether, arguing that they are no longer valid and have unfairly constrained U.S. investment in the Caspian Sea region. In response, I would argue that Section 907 is still necessary to safeguard the rights of the Armenian people. 
Mr. President, I am pleased that the Foreign Operations Appropriations Bill reaffirms our commitment to Section 907 of the Freedom Support Act. By doing so, this Congress reaffirms our commitment to the peaceful resolution of international conflicts and to the Armenian people themselves. The Azeri blockade of Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh is a direct result of the dispute between the two countries over the status of Nagorno-Karabakh, the longest-running ethnic conflict in the former USSR. The human cost to date has been 35,000 lives and 1.4 million refugees. 
The Azeri blockade has been particularly brutal for Armenia which relies on its ties to the outside world for survival. It is a land-locked country where only 17 percent of the land is arable. Due to the blockade, 80 percent of the Armenian population now live in poverty. Humanitarian assistance cannot get to Armenia, which is still trying to rebuild from the devastating earthquake of a decade ago, and Nagorno-Karabakh is dealing with a critical shortage of medical equipment. Industrial recovery has been stalled as 90 percent of Armenia's energy supply comes from abroad, and without its usual rail and transportation routes, Armenia is forced to rely on chartered cargo flights from Russia and Ukraine, or insecure land connections through Georgia, one of the most unstable countries in the former Soviet Union. 
Mr. President, the tragedy is that while life in Armenia is bleak, Azerbaijan has a bright future. It is estimated that Azerbaijan controls oil reserves of 40 billion barrels, and with it the potential to generate tremendous revenue. Section 907 will not cripple Azerbaijan. Indeed, since 1992, we have sent $130 million of humanitarian aid to ensure that this does not happen. Instead, this provision sends a powerful message to the Azeri government that in the post-Cold War era the United States will not tolerate the inhumane and belligerent treatment of innocent people in Armenia, in the former USSR, or anywhere the world over. We owe it to the Armenian people to continue this pressure on Azerbaijan to lift its blockade, and I am proud that this bill keeps Section 907 intact.

Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the amendment offered by Senator Kennedy regarding the tragedy of Pan Am Flight 103. This year marks the tenth anniversary of the bombing over Lockerbie, Scotland which killed 270 people. The memory of the 189 American citizens on board that doomed flight has not faded with the passage of time, but those who want to see justice done have become increasingly frustrated with the amount of time it has taken to try and bring the perpetrators to justice. 
It now appears as if the indicated suspects, Abdel Basset Al-Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah, may finally be tried for their crime. The United States-United Kingdom proposal urges Colonel Qaddafi to transfer the suspects to the Netherlands to stand trial before a Scottish court, under Scottish law, and by a panel of Scottish judges. However, I believe that it is critical for the United States to retain its pressure on Colonel Qaddafi to comply with the will of the international community. Qaddafi must transfer these suspects to the Netherlands, but the United States must also continue to refuse to negotiate with Qaddafi on this issue. Should Qaddafi fail to transfer the suspects, it is critical that the United Nations prepare a strong response and impose a multilateral oil embargo against Libya. I wholeheartedly support the language of this amendment, and I am pleased to be a cosponsor.

Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. Leahy, I know that you join me in welcoming the progress that the citizens of Northern Ireland and the Republic have made toward implementing a peace agreement. I would like to thank you and the members of the Appropriations Committee for the tremendous work you have done this year, including funding the International Fund for Ireland (IFI) at the full amount President Clinton requested in FY 1999. At this critical point in time, this Senate, and the United States as a whole, must begin to study our relationship with Northern Ireland and do our best to ensure that peace takes hold in the region. Dramatic cuts in the budget, particularly foreign aid, have made this task more challenging. Understanding both the need to support peace in Northern Ireland and dealing with budget cuts, I would like to request your support for consideration of adding any additional funding to the IFI, should it become available at a later time. It is important that we consider ways to meet the needs of the people of Northern Ireland and the Republic, and I hope you will join me in this effort.

Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I am very proud to join with my colleague, Senator Lautenberg, in offering this resolution of congratulations. With all the rancor and discord of our times, it is worth the Senate taking a moment to note that in small towns and cities across America, there are values that endure. 
On Saturday, 12 young men, no more than 11 and 12 years old, reminded us of some of those values. They became the first American team in 5 years to win the Little League World Series. It is a process that began a year ago when 7,000 different teams across America and in several other nations began to compete for this honor. The culmination was on Saturday when, by a score of 12 to 9, they defeated Kashima, Japan. 
There is no denying the athletic prowess of each of the 12 young men who produced this victory. An 11- or 12-year-old boy to hit a baseball more than 210 feet in repeated home runs is as much an achievement in its own way as Mark McGwire racing for a home run title. 
But in truth, there is more to this success than simple athletic prowess. Behind each and every one of these young men was a parent, a coach, a teacher, a neighbor, an umpire--someone who gave something of themselves, not simply to teach an athletic skill, but character, values, the qualities of determination that are so very American. 
In this way, each of the 46,000 people of Toms River were a part of this victory; indeed, in a special sense, so was every American a part of this victory. 
The lesson learned is that sacrifice and humility are an essential part of victory. How else does one explain a Mike Belostock who, in a championship game at a principal moment of his life, discovers that his eye is scratched from a contact lens and tells his mother he has decided not to play because the eye damage could have sacrificed the chances of his team. 
Or persistence: Chris Cardone who replaced Belostock in the lineup and hit a game-winning home run, his first in 28 games, and only his second hit of the tournament. Or Todd Frazier who not only struck out the final Japanese batter, but who also batted a perfect 4 for 4 in the game. 
Those are all sources of pride, but when the game was over and the team came home, there was something that impressed me even more. Every parent made it very clear that on Monday morning, every superstar of the `Beasts from the East' would be at school promptly and ready for work when school resumed. 
Mr. President, I join my colleagues in congratulating Chris Cardone, Todd Frazier, Scott Fisher, Gabe Gardner, Joe Franceschini, Casey Gaynor, Eric Campesi, R.J. Johansen, Mike Belostock, Brad Frank, Tom Gannon, Chris Crawford and their coaches, Mike Gaynor and Ken Kondek, for a job well done. 
Toms River is a town of champions, those who were on the field and those who were off. For those of us in the Senate and across America who watched their achievement with pride, we are reminded that there are values in our children as quintessentially American as baseball itself. Toms River, congratulations and well done. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, yesterday I engaged in a colloquy with Senators Kohl and Moseley-Braun regarding the intent of report language in S. 2312 concerning tax standards for tax-exempt health clubs. In that colloquy, I stated that my expectation was that the report would `focus on adult fitness provided by tax-exempt organizations that serve only adults.' However, both tax-exempt health clubs and for-profit health clubs serve entire families including young adults and children. While I believe the report should focus on adult fitness provided by tax-exempt organizations, tax-exempt organizations also offer non-adult service. The fact that they offer service to non-adults does not qualify an entity for tax-exempt status. Therefore, to eliminate any entity that provides any level of services to non-adults would greatly restrict the usefulness of this report in providing guidance to Congress. Again, I want to emphasize that my intent here is only for the IRS to provide Congress guidance in this area. 
Therefore, I want to clarify that it is my expectation that the report will reflect the language in the report accompanying S. 2312 with the input of yesterday's colloquies as well as this clarification. Again, I want to thank Senators Campbell and Kohl for their assistance on this and I look forward to working with them and all other interested Senators and parties on this issue.

Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment of the Senator from New Mexico, Mr. Bingaman, with regard to the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. 
Among the great attributes of our country, historic memory may not be our greatest strength. It was only 25 years ago that America found her economy crippled by attempts made to compromise her national security by an oil embargo placed upon states that disagreed with fundamental aspects of our national foreign policy. 
The 1970s may be a memory, but we have been revisited by the low oil prices that preceded the oil embargo of that decade. 
Mr. President, because of the foresight of this Congress in creating a Strategic Petroleum Reserve, there is now space for 120 million barrels of oil. This Congress had the foresight, during and after the oil embargo, to plan to preserve our foreign policy independence, to preserve a large capacity to store oil so we could not be intimidated. 
What is missing now is the foresight to fill that reserve. The Senator from New Mexico has noted there is no better time, with oil being sold at historically low prices. But it is important for Members of the Senate to understand that this is a propitious moment not only because the reserve has capacity and prices are low, but because in many ways the principal factors that led to the embargo of the 1970s, in an attempt to exercise leverage over American foreign policy, many of those factors are being revisited. 
In 1973, the United States imported less than 27 percent of its crude oil requirements. In 1979, we imported less than 43 percent of our requirements. Yet, an embargo, given those numbers, was enough to create a national recession, hyperinflation, and caused a serious debate about foreign policy objectives. 
The United States has now passed the 50 percent limit on importing foreign crude oil--9.2 million barrels per day--and by the year 2015 could import fully 70 percent of America's oil. Indeed, in the last 10 years, the rate of increase in the American importation of oil is more than all the imported oil of all nations in the world, other than Japan and Russia. Not only are we dependent, not only is it at historic highs, it is increasing. 
Secretary of Energy Pena said: 
The United States is highly dependent on Persian Gulf oil for a large and growing percent of our imports. 
Mr. President, it is not only a question of the level of our imports, it is also the fact that many of those importations of oil continue to come from volatile areas of the world, including the Persian Gulf where we have serious foreign policy disputes with nations in the region. 
It is estimated by the year 2010, the Persian Gulf's share of world export markets could surpass 67 percent, a level not seen since the oil embargoes of 1973 and 1974. Simultaneously, while American dependence on foreign oil is increasing, and world dependence on Persian Gulf oil is increasing, the United States continues to abandon domestic wells at an extraordinary rate. In the last 10 years alone, 173,000 U.S. oil wells have been abandoned. And oil production from smaller stripper wells is at its lowest level in 50 years. 
Mr. President, at a time when Americans are enjoying a low price for oil and foreign policy threats have retreated for the moment, it is difficult for the Senator from New Mexico to rise and gain support of the Congress for this important initiative. But almost certainly this country will be revisited at another time when there will be an attempt to compromise our foreign policy and use the economic leverage of oil against this country. 
We cannot be so foolish to forget what the oil lines were like or the recessions or the high inflation. In only a year after the Shah fell in Iran, in 1979, oil prices rose 250 percent. There are few easy ways to guard against this attempted intimidation or the economic shocks that would follow. Indeed, I know of only one. It is not perfect, it is not complete, but it is a contribution--it is the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. 
It is time again to take advantage of these low prices to begin filling the reserve. For that reason, Mr. President, I rise in favor of the amendment offered by the Senator from New Mexico, Senator Bingaman, and I urge its adoption. 
I yield the floor. 
Mr. MURKOWSKI addressed the Chair.

Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, today I rise in support of H.R. 1151. Credit unions have been, and remain, a vital component of our national banking system. At a time when credit unions serve more than 74 million people nationally, any initiative that would impede the ability of credit unions to provide services to their members, would seriously undermine the financial well-being of the public, and the fortitude of our financial industry. That is why today's action is so important to the future of the credit union industry. 
Despite the claims by opponents of credit unions that state otherwise, credit unions are nonprofit entities that provide much needed opportunities for hard-working people. To millions of Americans, the low-interest loans that credit unions offer represent the opportunity to buy their first home, the chance to purchase a much needed automobile, the ability to send their children to college, or achieving the dream of starting their own business. For example, in my home State of New Jersey, there are over 315 credit unions that serve more than 1.1 million people. 
Passage of this credit union legislation demonstrates a commitment by the U.S. Senate to millions of hard-working American families. Supporting credit unions means bolstering our economy and providing more financial opportunities to save and invest soundly. 
Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support credit unions by voting in favor of H.R. 1151.

 Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today in recognition of the `Old Grange' Restaurant, which has recently been placed on the New Jersey Register of Historic Places. The Old Grange, which is part of Historic Cold Spring Village, has been honored by the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection through inclusion in the Register as one of New Jersey's Cultural treasures. It is a pleasure for me to be able to note this historical designation and to celebrate the Old Grange. 
The Old Grange is located in the Cold Spring section of Lower Township. Grange #132 was organized in the late 1800's with a charter membership of thirty-two people. Also known as the Patrons of Husbandry, the Grange is America's oldest farm organization and the only rural fraternity in the world. During the early 20th century, the Old Grange was the site of many Township of Lower activities, serving as a school, voting area, and meeting hall, in addition to supporting projects and programs relating to the Grange Association. By 1970, Cold Spring Grange #132 was no longer able to maintain a membership base to support the organization. In 1973 it became the first building in the complex later known as Historic Cold Spring Village, the 19th century open-air living museum located adjacent to the Grange. Since 1981, visitors to the Village have enjoyed the grand meals offered by the Old Grange Restaurant, and the memory of Cold Spring Grange #132 has been kept alive. 
The preservation of one's history is important to creating a sense of personal responsibility for one's community. All those who have worked to preserve the Old Grange and the Historic Cold Spring Village should be celebrated for embodying this concept and successfully instilling it in others. It is a pleasure to know that the rich and diverse cultural heritage of Cape May County is alive and well at the Village. 
I am proud to recognize the Old Grange Restaurant as a historic site, and I am pleased that the State of New Jersey has made this designation.

Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I am in support of Senator Kyl, but I must state my objection to Senator Craig's amendment. 
In my career in the U.S. Congress, representing Atlantic City, I have never risen on the floor to oppose gaming. But this is too much. All of our communities have a right to decide when and where we want gaming. We restricted it to one city in New Jersey. Under Senator Craig's amendment, every living room, every child's bedroom in America will become a gaming parlor. The Internet will bring gaming to children, and it won't be restricted to problem gamers. There will not be any control. If we want to have Indian tribes having Indian gaming, let them do it on their reservation. That is their right, their sovereignty. But my State has sovereignty, too. We have decided not to allow gaming in every community. Some States, like Utah, and many of your States, have decided not to have it at all. Now it will be imposed upon you with a monopoly of gaming on the Internet, available to everyone. I urge my colleagues to defeat the Craig amendment.

Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I would like to thank Senators Gregg and Hollings for accepting this amendment to the Commerce, Justice, State and Judiciary Appropriations Bill which directs $3 million to the implementation of nonpoint pollution control plans in the Coastal Zone Management Program. 
I rise to draw this country's attention to the national significance of our coasts as an integral part of our national infrastructure. As we approach the next century, we must treat them like our roads, schools, and technology, as the foundation of economic development, job creation, and current prosperity. Our coasts are a central element of the tourism industry which nationally employs 14.4 million people and contributes over 10% to our GDP, making it the second-largest sector in the economy. 
With more than 50% of the nation's population living within 50 miles of the shore, our coastal areas are heavily used resources under severe environmental pressures from land development and associated activities as well as seasonal pressures from summer vacationers. For example, over 400,000 people live in the immediate vicinity of the Barnegat Bay estuary in New Jersey; in the summer that number doubles to 800,000. The popularity of Barnegat Bay has caused non-point source pollution from runoff and storm water discharges resulting in blooms of brown tide algae in 1995, 1997, and as recently as last month. Polluted runoff is the major reason why pfiesteria and hazardous algal blooms frequently close rivers, kill fish and make people sick. Nationwide, 40% of our waters are not fit for fishing and swimming; 30% of our shellfish beds are closed or restricted for harvest; and 2500 beaches were declared unsafe for swimming in 1996. 
Created in the 1970's, the Coastal Zone Management (CZM) Program is a voluntary partnership between the federal government and coastal states and territories to preserve and restore our coastal areas. The program encourages the wise use of land and water resources through the preparation of special area management plans to protect natural resources while providing for coastal dependent economic growth. 
Section 6217 of the 1990 Coastal Zone Reauthorization Amendments requires states and territories with approved coastal zone management programs to develop and implement coastal nonpoint pollution plans. Through prior federal assistance, 29 plans (see attachment) have been conditionally approved and are ready for implementation. (In addition, Texas, Georgia, and Ohio, recently entered the CZM program and will also be working to develop nonpoint runoff plans.) The premise behind this amendment is simple: the federal government must continue to support those who have developed nonpoint pollution plans and are now ready to implement them. These funds are an investment in our future, an investment that will pay dividends not just for our towns and states, but for the entire country and for generations to come. 
I ask unanimous consent that the list of states with approved plans be entered into the Record.

Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Harkin amendment to fund President Clinton's Food Safety Initiative. In supporting this effort to fund food safety in our country, I must admit to some surprise about the debate. Through the years in this Congress, we have had controversial debates with legitimately and strongly held different views. This is a difference of opinion that I just do not understand. 
It is now estimated that there are 9,000 Americans per year losing their lives because of food safety. There is a rising cost in human life and suffering because of compromises in the quality of food consumed in America. In a nation where we are accustomed to automobile accidents and crime, the leading reason in our country to visit an emergency room is because of food that you purchased and consumed. It is not an insubstantial cost to our economy. Mr. President, 6.5 million people suffering from foodborne illness; $22 billion in cost to our economy. 
Two years ago, on a bipartisan basis, across philosophical lines as a national community, we came to recognize that this cost was not sustainable and mostly was not necessary. This Congress began to fund, under President Clinton's leadership, an initiative to ensure the quality and safety of our Nation's food supply. We are now about to enter into the second year of that program, which has included hiring more inspectors, enhancing surveillance and early warning, increasing research into pathogens like the E. coli bacteria, and to develop more fast, cost-efficient, and more modern detection methods. The second year is about to begin, but a preliminary judgment has been made on the budget of the Government to abandon the effort: No research, no new technology, no new inspectors--nothing. 
It would be a legitimately held view to come to the floor of this Senate and say, `The President's plan has been tried and has been evaluated, it is understood, but there is a better idea.' There may be better ideas. There is no monopoly of wisdom in constructing this plan. But to argue, in the U.S. Senate, in the face of this rising problem, that the better answer is to do nothing, confounds logic. I do not understand it--governmentally or politically. 
The American people may be under the impression that their food supply is safe. It is certainly true by world standards; compared with many nations, it is safe. But it is not what they believe. Mr. President, 9,000 deaths is unconscionable, but it is not even the full extent of the problem. Some years ago, like most Americans not recognizing the full extent of this problem, I heard testimony from a constituent of mine named Art O'Connell. His 23-month-old daughter, Katie, had visited a fast-food restaurant in New Jersey. The next day she wasn't feeling well. Two days later she was in a hospital. By that night her kidneys and her liver began to fail. A day later, she was dead. 
I thought it was about as bad a story as I could hear, and then in the same hearing I heard mothers and fathers from around America whose children had also been exposed to the E. coli bacteria, and realized that sometimes the child that dies can be the fortunate child. The E. coli bacteria will leave an infant blind, deaf, paralyzed for life. In the elderly, it can strike more quickly and also result in death. 
It is a crisis in our country, but it is one that will not solve itself. Indeed, it is estimated over the next decade, the death toll and the suffering from foodborne illness in America will increase by 10 to 15 percent per decade. 
There are, to be certain, a number of reasons--the sources of food supplies, a more complex distribution system, failures to prepare food properly, and almost certainly because of rising imports of food. Food imports since 1992 have increased by 60 percent. Yet, notably, inspections have fallen by 22 percent. There are 53,000 potential sites in America involved in the production of food for the American people--53,000. The United States has 700 inspectors. To place this in context, in the State of New Jersey where we operate a gaming industry, in Atlantic City, we have 14 casinos. We operate with 850 inspectors. What my State government in New Jersey is doing to assure that the roulette wheels and gaming tables of Atlantic City are safe for gamers, the United States of America is not doing for the food supply of the entire country. Mr. President, 700 inspectors for this country. 
To be honest, I do not argue that, even if Senator Harkin's amendment is accepted, that the Members of this Senate can face their constituents honestly and claim that this problem is being solved, no less managed. It would, in truth, require much more. Over the years, in working with Senator Durbin, we have outlined legislation that is far more comprehensive, in my judgment, much more attuned to what is required--to create a single food agency to replace the current 12 Government agencies involved in food safety, to remove agencies whose principal mission is to prevent the consumption and sale of food from inspection--to remove an inherent conflict of interest in the management of the Nation's food supply; and certainly to give the Department of Agriculture a mandatory recall authority so the moment we know there is a problem and health is endangered, we can eliminate the distribution problems. 
All these things are required, but we are asking for none of that today. All that Senator Harkin is asking is to fund at the commitment levels we decided on a year ago, to do the second half of a 2-year program to provide for the inspections, the technologies of this food safety program. 
Mr. President, many of us years ago learned of a different period in American history through the words of Upton Sinclair in his writing, `The Jungle.' At a time when the Federal Government was not doing little to ensure the safety of our food supply for our people, it was doing nothing. 
Most Americans will be surprised to learn that, as they read as a student of Upton Sinclair, the technology of food inspection has not really changed in these several generations. The principal instrument used by the U.S. Government to ensure that meat is safe is the human nose of an inspector. The second line of defense is his eyesight. As food comes down the assembly line, assuring that it is safe is based on the instinct of those inspectors, albeit inspecting 2 percent of the Nation's imported food supply. 
Part of this program is to advance the technologies which we are using in every other aspect of American life, the extraordinary technologies of our time which uniquely, incredibly and inexplicably are not being used on a very item of life and death of our citizens--our food supply. This program will develop and advance those technologies. 
New pathogens are being found all the time. The E. coli bacteria itself is changing. This program will research to understand those pathogens, to use our technology to defeat them in biomedicine. 
As the Senator from Iowa has said, we also need enhanced surveillance. Because we live in a time when the food supply of one State can appear in another State within hours, a single source of contaminated food can be across America in days. We need to track it through surveillance to find it and eliminate it. 
Of course, as I suggested, we need more inspectors to also ensure the presence of the Government is there. 
All we are doing is attempting to fulfill what the American people believe they already have. Most Americans, if you were to ask them today, would tell you: `Yes, there's a Federal inspector where that meat is produced, those fruits and vegetables, that syrup, they are there, and we are using the best technology and we are understanding the pathogens.' We are asking that this Senate help fund that which we committed to 2 years ago and that which the American people already believe exists. 
Finally, there is ample time for us to disagree on many issues. There are legitimate concerns about which we can differ. If ever there was an issue about which we could come together in common cause, this is that issue. This is not an expansion of Government power, it is a power which the Government has had for all the 20th century. It is not draining significant resources we do not have. It is $100 million in a modest program. 
I am proud to join with Senator Harkin, Senator Durbin and Senator Kennedy in offering this amendment. I hope we can receive an affirmative vote and proceed with this program and avoid all that suffering, which is just so unnecessary, and begin to turn the corner on dealing with this very important problem. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, in regard to the amendment offered by the Senator from Connecticut, Mr. Dodd, this institution should take some pause. This is some moment. Thirty years of American foreign policy by Democrats and Republicans are about to be put aside. The consequences of what Senator Dodd suggests that we do here are enormous. Consider the moment. 
These are not isolated humanitarian items. This would open trade for the United States of America with the greatest rogue regimes in the world, where Presidents of the United States, through 3 decades, have drawn the line and said that we will not do business with these governments unless and until they take specific actions to free their people, allow basic human rights, or make basic concessions in their relations with the United States. We are about to clear the table and tell them all is forgotten and all is forgiven. 
Consider the actions, Mr. President, through the years about what would be changed. In my State, perhaps more than most in this country, tonight every Member of this Senate would have to address the families of the victims of Pan Am 103. It has been clear to Mr. Qadhafi, until he brings those to justice who were responsible for destroying that aircraft and the lives of all of those families, there will not be trade with the United States on a bilateral basis. 
With the amendment of the Senator from Connecticut, the war of wills in which we have been engaged with Mr. Qadhafi, even now while he is discussing bringing those murderers to justice--we proceed. The line that was drawn those years ago is now erased. 
With the Sudan--another terrorist state to which now we would sell food and medicines, engage in normal commerce; it harbors Hezbollah guerrillas, the assassins who attempted to kill President Mubarak of Egypt; we were so brave in those days, the United States was so forthcoming in drawing this line--all is forgotten and forgiven. 
In North Korea--just when we have succeeded in getting the North Koreans to come to the table and enter into an agreement to stop the development of atomic weapons and try to get some responsible behavior--no need for the negotiations, we are now going to engage in commerce. 
With Syria--its harboring of terrorism against Israel; its occupation in Lebanon--we will now engage in commerce. 
And Iraq--at the moment, sanctions against Iraq are multinational. 
But every Member of this Senate knows that the day is fast approaching when America could stand alone. Inspectors would be barred, our military would be barred from the skies. And the United States would have to have its own sanctions. And this amendment--even though Saddam Hussein has been identified again as a terrorist regime and America could be alone in its sanctions --here we would engage in commerce. 
It has been contended to the Senate that we do this as a decent people because the real victims here are the poor of all these nations. That indeed is not fair, Mr. President, to this country or this Government, because, indeed, while we maintain sanctions on each of these terrorist States, for good and sound reasons that I have outlined, this Government has gone to every length to protect the poor of the poor. 
In North Korea, the shipment of 800,000 tons of food, only on the condition that we know who is getting the food and that it is not going to the North Korean military. But it is not fair that the poor of the poor of North Korea are victimized because of our embargo--800,000 tons of food distributed to the poor. 
And the Sudan, one of the poorest nations in the world--Senator Dodd is right, the poor of the poor should not be victimized because that Government harbors terrorists and assassinates foreign leaders. And so we have approved $76 million in food assistance, only on the condition that we know that it gets to the poor of the poor. 
And in Iraq, $2.8 billion worth of food and medicine, only on the condition that it not go to Saddam Hussein, that it not go to the elite, that it not support the Iraqi military--just that it go to the poor of the poor under U.N. inspections. 
The amendment of the Senator from Connecticut, if indeed we at one point predictably stand alone against Saddam Hussein, our food sales will not just go to the poor of the poor, they will go to the entire Iraqi establishment. 
As the author of the modern Cuban embargo, I make no apologies in this case, either. The United States provides more food and medicine per capita to Cuba than any nation in the world provides to any other nation of the world, bar none. No Member of this Senate has any apologies to make for American support of the poor of the poor in Cuba. In the last 12 months alone, there were 123 licenses to ship food and medicine to Cuba, worth $2.5 billion. I challenge any Member of the Senate to find any country more generous than the United States of America, giving to any adversary, more generously than we have to the people of Cuba. 
We have a license program and we have a license program for a reason, rather than unrestricted sales of food and medicine, as the Senator from Connecticut suggests. The reason is because we found when those food and medicines are not licensed, Mr. Castro has resold them or used them to support his own military establishment, like Saddam Hussein. There is no denial of food and medicine. We simply are requiring that it be done properly. 
Senator Helms and I, with other colleagues, have joined in this Congress in an alternative to Senator Dodd's proposal. Humanitarian shipments go to Cuba through the church and are licensed, on an unrestricted basis--simply that we know who is distributing them, the church, humanitarian organizations, not the Communist Party and not Fidel Castro. It is a question of control. 
It is argued, finally, that these sanctions, this restriction on commerce with terrorist regimes should be lifted because they don't succeed. On the contrary. The record is otherwise. Sanctions on South Africa to end apartheid, to the Jackson-Vanik amendment to allow Soviet Jews to leave Russia, to restrictions on Vietnam until they cooperated with POWs, the record is that, while imprecise, while offering no guarantees, economic sanctions, including the leverage on our greatest, most successful export products, foods and pharmaceutical products, can and do yield results. No one should assume, no one should believe that they work in every case or work quickly. But the historic record is that they are an alternative to military action. 
Where would Ronald Reagan--or George Bush--have been when Pan Am 103 was shot down, if he did not have the opportunity to have economic sanctions and this leverage? There would be nothing available but military action. Where would we have been after the shoot down of an American aircraft 2 years ago in the Straits over Cuba, if the President could not have tightened economic sanctions? 
No, they are not perfect, but they give the President added authority and weight to change policy. Every one of the countries most impacted by Senator Dodd's amendment in the course of the last year and every year for the last 5 years has been identified by the State Department as a source of terrorism against the international community, every country I have mentioned on this floor tonight. 
Is it really the intention of this Senate, after all these years of claiming that we had the will to fight this war on terrorism, we were as resolved as Qadhafi and Saddam Hussein and Fidel Castro, after all these years, now we are to say to them 
we have lost our will, we changed our minds? If that is the intention of the Senate, at least have the intellectual honesty to come to the floor, repeal the terrorism list, repeal sanctions entirely, because that is the effect of this statement. We will identify you as a terrorist, we will claim you are killing our citizens, harboring assassins, but we are glad to trade with you. 
I recognize that sometimes it is necessary, unfortunately, that the United States stand alone. Only Britain and the United States are still remembering the victims of Lockerbie; only the United States, the people who are jailed in Cuba. Only the United States may have the resolve to see it through with Saddam Hussein. That is too bad. But if the end result is the United States has to stand alone against these terrorist regimes, then we never stood in better company. We can be proud that we alone remember the victims and we alone are going to impose a price for those who violate international law and victimize people. 
But let it not be said, however, the Members may vote on this amendment, that any of us were a party to the poorest of the poor, and the hungry being victimized by our foreign policy, because those simply, my colleagues, are not the facts--from the tons of wheat that goes to North Korea to the pharmaceutical products licensed and distributed in Cuba. 
My colleagues, consider carefully this amendment. This is not a question of the Clinton administration. It is policies and embargoes that go back as far as John F. Kennedy. It is not just a question of a couple of governments. It is virtually every nation on the terrorist list. It is not simply a question of taking the stand because of an isolated incident, like Pan Am 103 or a disagreement with Saddam Hussein. They are issues as serious as preventing another Persian Gulf war by using our leverage and continuing leverage on North Korea to cooperate on a missile regime and on atomic weapons. 
This is, indeed, a serious matter. I hope if an amendment is offered to table Senator Dodd's amendment, as I am informed may happen, Democrat and Republicans, on a bipartisan basis, will not only vote to table the amendment by the Senator from Connecticut, but it will do so in an expression of true and strong resolve. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. TORRICELLI. The Senator from Florida makes a valuable point that somehow the responsibility for the economic ailments of failing Marxist governments incredibly is being placed on the U.S. Senate. The reason that there is hunger in Cuba and North Korea is because their systems have failed. 
I recognize that in the great farm belts of America, there is tremendous frustration and suffering because of the farm crisis. But it is not frank, it is not fair to the American farmer to suggest that if the United States abandons its human rights policies and its economic embargoes on these terrorist governments, that is the salvation for the American farmer. 
As my friend and colleague from Florida stated, the per capita income of Cuba is $300. Cuba has 7 days' worth of foreign exchange. Just how much wheat or corn does the Senator from Kansas believe Fidel Castro will be buying? North Korea has no foreign exchange at all. Nothing. The Sudan has a per capita income of $100 per year. These are not countries that are markets for American farm products. 
I share the concern of our colleagues from the Midwest of the plight of the American farmer, but believing that we can compromise our policies on terrorism or for human rights by offering sales to nations that have no resources is a false promise and, what is more, simply contradicts the facts. 
The Senator from Florida has said it right. There is blame for these failing economies and the fact the poor are suffering, but it is not here. The Senator from Florida was my cosponsor in offering in the Senate the Cuban Democracy Act which is the foundation for the current embargo against Cuba. He should be proud of everything that he did because, indeed, as is now the case with the Sudan and with North Korea and with Iraq and with Cuba, we have assured that the poor, on a humanitarian basis, will get food even though they can't buy it. 
That policy now will be undermined by offering to sell these products to people who can't buy it. I think the Senator from Florida has made the case persuasively. Thank you for yielding.

Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, this issue has now been debated at great length. And having listened to so many of my colleagues, for my own part, I wanted only to respond to several things that have been said and then leave the issue with the Senate. 
It is being suggested that somehow the idea of economic sanctions is some aberration of policy, inconsistent with our values, inappropriate in the final years of the 20th century. I want to remind my colleagues that the American effort to impose economic sanctions began with Woodrow Wilson, after the Great War, as an alternative to military conflict. So many lives had been lost and the war was so senseless that we began this 20th century with a commitment that this was the better alternative. I don't believe that Members of this Senate have been dissuaded from that view, given the outrageous conduct by terrorist states and facing the choice of military attack or expressing our outrage by separating them out of the international trading community. Sanctions are the better choice. 
Contrary to the statements of my friend, the Senator from Nebraska, the record is replete that they do succeed. How many Soviet Jews would have left Russia had it not been for Jackson-Vanik? What cooperation would we have had from Vietnam in finding POW crash sites if it hadn't been for sanctions? Where would North Korea had been now in stopping the development of atomic weapons if not for sanctions? Where would we be in negotiating with Qadhafi for the killers of Pan Am 103 if not for sanctions? Indeed, would Fidel Castro have had the Pope in Havana if there had not been sanctions? They are not always perfect, but they are the better alternative to military action. 
My friend Senator Durbin, the Senator from Illinois, asked the rhetorical question whether or not there would be an impact on national security. What an easy vote to cast on this floor. But what a difficult thing it would be to face if tomorrow morning Castro, Saddam Hussein, and Qadhafi found that the sum and the substance of America's economic boycott on principle against their regime had been destroyed. Thirty years of American foreign policy is on the line. Without a hearing, without the administration being heard, without an alternative being offered, the sum and substance of American foreign policy would be taken off the books. 
I suggested earlier in a colloquy with my friend from Florida, Senator Graham, that I know why it is being done. I understand the frustration of our colleagues from the Middle West. But the suffering of American farmers is addressed by changing American farm policy, not changing American foreign policy. These are the poorest nations in the world. It is not fair to the American farmer to say that plummeting prices and failing farms are going to be answered by ending the embargo on Cuba, where the average person makes $300 a year, or the Sudan, or North Korea. These are poor, small nations, without the ability to buy. If they had the ability to buy farm products, they would be buying them from Argentina, Australia, or France, or other American competitors. But they are buying from no one, because they have nothing. 
Let's at least be honest about the debate. This will not add up to one dime of American farm sales. It is a political answer for an economic problem. I suspect that the numbers would bear me out that my State of New Jersey manufactures as much in the gross value of pharmaceutical products as the State of Nebraska and the State of Kansas produce in agricultural products. Every major pharmaceutical company in America is in my State. I have never heard one pharmaceutical executive or one worker suggest that we should give in to Qadhafi on Pan Am 103, or the political prisoners in Cuba, or terrorism in Syria or Sudan because of a market opportunity--not one. And I don't believe that your farmers feel any differently than my pharmaceutical executives.

Mr. TORRICELLI. I wanted to ask a question, if I could, and then I will yield to the Senator from Connecticut. 
In my reading of the Senator's amendment, not only would it be lifting these restrictions on food, but also on pharmaceutical products, including medical devices, and including the financing of food; is that accurate?

Mr. TORRICELLI. Well, let me conclude, and then I will allow the Senator from Connecticut to end on his amendment, as is only right and appropriate. 
I don't know how a Member of this Senate tomorrow morning could call the families of the victims of Pan Am 103, who are now suing to get financial reimbursement for the loss of their loved ones from Qadhafi, and now suggest that we are going to be financing food exports to Libya or Cuba. Not only are we not selling, but we will be financing. 
This brings us back to where we were with Saddam Hussein when the gulf war started. How could we explain to any American that, while American soldiers were having to fight in Iraq, Iraqi soldiers were eating food not only made in the United States but financed by American taxpayers? That would be returned to. Senator Graham and I specifically prohibited medical devices because there was evidence that Fidel Castro was using medical devices made in the United States to torture and interrogate prisoners in Cuba. That is the sum and substance of what the Senate faces. 
I apologize to the Senator for consuming so much time.

Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, Members of the Senate, we are about to cast a vote that we will remember for many years. I know the issue of the day is the farm crisis in the Midwest. The answer to that problem is in this market, in this Senate, not by changing a fundamental of American foreign policy. The issue today may be the farm crisis, but last year and the years before that, it has been the war against terrorism. 
My amendment is simple. We have lifted the American embargo against selling food and medicine unless--unless--you are from a country that is engaged in terrorism against the United States of America. 
Mr. Qadhafi does not deserve, tomorrow morning, to wake up and find out we forgot about Pan Am 103; or Castro, with his political prisoners; nor should we end with North Korea our actions just when we are negotiating the control of atomic weapons. 
I know the frustration of my colleagues from the Midwest, but these nations, with per capita incomes of $100, $200, $300, they are not buying agricultural products from anyone in the world, so they are not going buy them from us, because they have no money, because they are failing Marxist regimes. 
For 30 years, this country has held the line that on human rights and on actions of terrorism against our country we would not deal with them. Things are so close, the handful of Marxist regimes that are left--the handful--do not throw them a lifeline. 
Can you imagine the frustration tomorrow morning of activists in Cuba who are fighting for freedom to find out we have taken the heart out of this embargo? Make no mistake, this is the heart. These countries, from Libya to North Korea, to those that are harboring assassins in the Sudan, the Hezbollah in Syria, these terrorist nations, they are not seeking to buy airplanes or high technology. This is all they would have if they had the resources. 
This is not a message you want to send. Today it may be the farm crisis. But terrorism is not gone from this Earth. The State Department has told us that there are these nations, these six nations, engaged in terrorism against our people. They do not deserve an exception. The Senate has done its will. It has lifted food and medicine. Just keep this exception on these few terrorist states.

Mr. TORRICELLI. The Senate will soon be considering the product liability legislation. If enacted, the Senate would be continuing an unfortunate practice in this country where manufacturers of firearms have some special protection outside of consumer products. 
Mr. President, as indicated by this chart, for many years this country has regulated the manufacture and the sale of consumer products, items as seemingly as innocent as teddy bears, for recall, safety standards. And yet firearms were outside the design requirements, the safety requirements, and the recall requirements. 
This issue comes before the Senate again under product liability, because it is my intention, with the Senator from California, Mrs. Feinstein, to offer an amendment to exempt gun manufacturers from the $250,000 punitive damages protection. 
Through all these years, the Congress has failed--by design requirements for safety, for distribution requirements--to ensure that firearms get to legitimate owners, to provide the American people with real protection. What the Congress has failed to do, the courts have begun to recognize. Suits are being filed across America by parents when they lose their children to weapons that get in illegitimate hands, by neighborhoods, by police officers, by cities, seeking damages caused by weapons that could have been designed more safely, with child restraint provisions. If, indeed, this product liability legislation is enacted without our amendment, those suits will not proceed. 
Yesterday at a press conference in the Senate, we heard from a Steven Young, a father of a murdered teenage boy in the streets of Chicago. He has joined with three families to sue gun manufacturers because, in his judgment, they knowingly allow these weapons to be sold to criminals. The families of the young people killed in Jonesboro, AR, in a school shooting are planning to file suit because those weapons had no safety mechanisms on them. Mayor Rendell of Philadelphia and Mayor Daley of Chicago are both preparing suits on behalf of the citizens of their cities to recover the costs from gun violence because manufacturers have not been responsible in design and manufacture. If this Senate does not enact this amendment and, indeed, tries to prohibit it by voting cloture shortly, the suits may never happen. 
Families and cities, the people of our country, are in a similar position with gun manufacturers to where we were 40 years ago with the tobacco companies. Congress has not acted, so people pursue the law in the courts. Indeed, it took 40 years and hundreds of cases before tobacco companies began to understand they needed to act responsibly. If these cases can proceed against gun manufacturers, there will be discovery, documents will be produced. As liability mounts, gun manufacturers will be careful who sells these weapons, who is able to buy these weapons, that the law is complied with, and that there is every possible safety feature built into these weapons. The liability of the gun manufacturers can work to protect our families. Thirty-six thousand people died from gun violence last year. This is the leading cause of death among young people in our cities. We ask the Congress to do nothing but to allow the courts to proceed in offering people protection. 
The shield that would be offered to gun manufacturers involves many of the weapons sold in this country. Twenty-three percent of all 38-caliber pistols, 2 of the 10 guns most often found at crime scenes, are made by small manufacturers who would be protected under product liability. One company alone, Davis Industries, produces 50,000 Saturday-night specials a year. In all, 20 percent of the weapons produced in America will be shielded from any liability above the $250,000 in punitive damages if we enact this product liability reform without our amendment. 
It has often been said by the National Rifle Association that it is their responsibility to protect gun owners. If the National Rifle Association opposes this measure, they will be taking a clear stand against gun owners. It is gun owners who will have the right to go to court if a product is improperly sold, improperly manufactured. The only people who will be jeopardized are people who are either victims of these guns or own these guns. This is a chance for the gun lobby to do something responsible. They claim they want to be on the side of the gun owner and law enforcement and innocent victims--take a stand. 
I urge my colleagues to defeat the cloture motion, allow us to proceed on the amendment, and offer this protection to the American people. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Higher Education Reauthorization Act of 1998 (S. 1882). I commend my colleagues, Chairman Jeffords and Senator Kennedy, for their hard work and leadership on this most important legislation. There are few pieces of legislation in this Congress that are as important to American families. 
I would also like to express my gratitude to Senators Jeffords and Kennedy for including in this bill two amendments I authored and which I think are critically important for students across the nation. 
The first, the Torricelli Campus Hate Crimes Right to Know Act, would expand the campus security information available to the over 14 million students and their parents who apply to college every year. 
In 1990, the Crime Awareness and Campus Security Act, was enacted in response to a steady rise in violent crime on some college campuses. This legislation paved the way for families to obtain vital security information about their college campuses. However, it is clear the law needs strengthening. Currently, the Campus Security Act requires colleges to report only those hate crimes motivated by race, religions, national origin, sexual orientation, or ethnicity, and those that result in murder, rape, or aggravated assault. This dual reporting requirement severely limits the ability of prospective students to gain information about the safety of a campus. 
Our nation's college campuses should be a refuge from crime, particularly heinous attacks motivated by hatred and bigotry. The disturbing truth, however, is that college campuses are often fertile ground for bigotry. Twenty-five percent of minority college students attending predominantly white colleges have been victims of a hate crime. In 1996, 90 incidents of anti-Semitic activity occurred on college campuses. 
Students and their parents have the right to know about any crimes, particularly those involving hatred and bigotry, that were committed on a college campus they will call home for four or more years. My legislation, which is now part of the Higher Education Act, will ensure they get that information. 
The Torricelli Campus Hate Crimes Right to Know Act lists hate crimes as one of the reportable offenses and expands the definition of a hate crime to include those that result in robbery, burglary, arson, motor vehicle theft, vandalism and simple assault. The legislation also expands the definition of a hate crime to include gender and disability. 
I am grateful to my colleagues, Senators Jeffords and Kennedy for including this language in the Higher Education Act to provide students and their parents with vital information so that they may better protect themselves against such crimes. 
Mr. President, I would also like to express my gratitude to the managers of this bill for including another piece of legislation I introduced. 
This legislation undoes a travesty. We are inadvertently penalizing student reservists who are called to active duty and deployed overseas in places like Bosnia. While these courageous individuals are enduring great personal sacrifice in the service of their country, we are putting them at a financial disadvantage by starting the clock on the six month grace period for paying back their federal student loans. 
Since the average call-up for a student reservist now lasts for 270 days, the grace period on their loans expires. Instead of returning home to a hero's welcome, they are coming home to a mailbox full of default notices. Although the Department of Education can grant deferments to these students upon their return, federal law prohibits reinstating the six month grace period, so interest continues to accrue whenever they are not attending classes. It is unfair and inconsistent with our increased reliance on the Reserve forces to call up these students to serve in harm's way, and, at the same time, to keep the clock running on their six month grace period for paying back their student loans. 
This amendment, which is based on legislation I have introduced with Senators Sessions, Hutchison, DeWine, Cleland, D'Amato and Bingaman, will not provide these veterans with any special treatment or benefit. It will simply guarantee that the repayment status on their student loans will be the same when they return as when they left. 
These selfless Americans are helping to maintain a tradition that is over 350 years old, and extends back in time to before the founding of our Republic. Historically, militia and National Guard units have fought with honor in all major U.S. military operations from 1637 to the present. Today, these dedicated individuals represent all fifty states and four territories, and truly embody our forefather's vision of the American citizen-soldier. Reservists are active participants in the full spectrum of U.S. military operations, from the smallest of contingencies to full-scale theater war, and no major operation can be successful without them. 
Since the start of operation Joint Endeavor almost 1,000 New Jerseyans have served with the New Jersey Air National Guard in Bosnia, and right now there are New Jerseyans on the ground in the Balkans fulfilling the requirements of the Dayton Accords. It is important for us to acknowledge their sacrifice so that we never forget what it means to be truly selfless. 
In closing, Mr. President, I would like to thank Senators Jeffords and Kennedy and their staffs for all of their hard work on the Higher Education Reauthorization Act and for their assistance with these two amendments.

 Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today in recognition of DeRossi and Son Company, which has been recently honored by the Small Business Administration. DeRossi and Son Company was nominated as the Regional Small Business Prime Contractor of the Year and recognized as one of the top small business prime contractors in the State of New Jersey. As a result of this nomination, DeRossi and Son has earned the U.S. Small Business Administration `Administrator's Award for Excellence' certificate. It is a pleasure for me to be able to note these accomplishments and congratulate DeRossi and Son on a job well done. 
Since 1926, when Angelo and Dominick DeRossi founded the company, DeRossi and Son has manufactured military dress coats for the United States Government. The company provided clothing for the United States Armed Forces during World War II, the Korean War, and the Vietnam War. DeRossi and Son has a long history of excellence, beginning in 1943 when it received the Army Navy E Award during World War II. This was an award issued for excellence in production and quality during the war. Mr. DeRossi believes that the success of the company is due to the training he received from his grandfather and father and to the great dedication and effort his staff and employees have in serving the customer. 
Small businesses face enormous odds for success in the corporate world. There are tremendous obstacles every day, yet DeRossi and Son has been able to rise above adversity. This award is a wonderful testament to its strength and perseverance among small businesses in the State of New Jersey and across the country. Few companies are able to make this claim, and I am honored to be able to say that one has been from my home state. 
Both the DeRossi Family, and the company they built over the last seventy-two years, are excellent examples of an immigrant success story. The DeRossi Family's contributions have done much for the future of the town of Vineland, the State of New Jersey, and the United States as a whole. I congratulate DeRossi and Son on a job well done, and I wish both them and their employees the best of luck in the future.

 Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, today I introduce legislation that will improve the lives of 30,000 Americans, 850 of whom live in my State of New Jersey, who are stricken with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS). Many of us know ALS as the disease that struck down the famed Yankees 1st baseman, Lou Gehrig. Today, few of us are aware of the tragic effects ALS still has on its victims. 
First diagnosed over 130 years ago, ALS is a fatal neurological disorder that usually strikes individuals over 50 years old. Each year, over 5,000 new cases are diagnosed, and tragically, life expectancy is only 3 to 5 years. The financial costs to families of persons with ALS can be up to $200,000 a year. 
Mr. President, the legislation I introduce today addresses the need for the federal government to provide increased medical services and research for ALS. First, the bill waives the 24-month waiting period that ALS patients must endure in order to receive Medicare services. Since the life-expectancy for ALS patients is only a few short years, it is crucial that these individuals have access to Medicare services as soon as possible. It makes absolutely no sense to require individuals to wait two years to receive Medicare services when their life expectancy is only three to five years. 
Next, the legislation will ensure Medicare provides coverage for all Food and Drug Administration (FDA) drugs used to treat ALS. Medicare typically does not provide coverage for drug therapies, but in the case of ALS, the need for an exception is clear. In addition, expanding Medicare coverage for ALS therapies will hopefully stimulate further research. 
Finally, the bill recognizes the need to increase critical research into ALS by authorizing $25 million to the National Institutes of Health. 
Mr. President, this legislation is simple, it's modest, and the logic is overwhelming. ALS is a disease that strikes at every community, with the potential for every American. No one is immune, and everyone is vulnerable. I am pleased to be joined by my colleague Senator Wellstone in introducing legislation that represents a first real step toward improving the quality of life for people with ALS while bringing us much closer to finding a cause and a cure.

Mr. TORRICELLI. I want to thank the majority leader for yielding the time. I am very pleased to join with the majority leader and my colleagues in offering this resolution regarding the commitment of the United States to Taiwan. 
Like the majority leader, I, too, want to congratulate President Clinton for an extraordinarily successful visit to the People's Republic of China. He covered the issues of human rights, security, our economic relationships--I believe there was real progress made. 
Mr. President, it is sometimes said that international conflicts begin more often from miscalculation than design. I believe it is of service to the Senate and to our country to make clear upon President Clinton's return both what was said and accomplished and, indeed, what remains in place with regard to the U.S. relations with the people and the government on Taiwan. 
American policy toward Taiwan is governed by the Taiwan Relations Act. There are 4 principle components of this Act, accepted by this Congress, the bedrock policy of this country, and they remain unchanged. 
First, the future of Taiwan will be determined by peaceful means. The Taiwan Relations Act does not say that the people of Taiwan and the mainland will be reunited by peaceful means. It says the future will be determined by peaceful means. That has not been altered. 
Second, the United States affirms that one of its principle objectives is the preservation and enhancement of the human rights of the people of Taiwan. 
Third, that the United States does not maintain as its policy the isolation of Taiwan, its government, or its people but there are many members of this institution, and, indeed, in this government, that believe it would enhance the security of the region and both peoples if Taiwan were admitted to international organizations. 
Fourth, the United States remains committed to sell those defensive means necessary for the security of the people of Taiwan. 
Mr. President, at a time of economic turbulence in Asia, it is notable that there is one government and one people that are a bedrock of economic stability. Taiwan is a model of development of democratic capitalism. It is a leader in technology and international trade, with a standard of living obtained for its people that is the envy of Asia. It is also notable that at a time when it is necessary for the President of the United States to discuss human rights with other countries, to discuss their means of government, that Taiwan remains a stable democracy, respecting the freedom of religion and of speech and of expression, where people choose their own leadership. 
For all these reasons, Mr. President, it is important that there not be any miscalculation. The policy of this country toward Taiwan is governed by the Taiwan Relations Act. We remain committed to that democracy and to its security. This is not of some small moment. This is, after all, the 19th largest economy in the world. Taiwan is the seventh largest trading partner of the United States--a vibrant democracy in the family of democratic nations. 
There are many of us who believe that in future years the security of the region would be enhanced by Taiwan's enhanced relationship with the United Nations, by its entry into the World Trade Organization and the Asian Development Bank, where its economic power could be heard and, indeed, enhance its economic stability. 
Mr. President, for all those who have watched this recent trip to Asia, it bears reminding that this Congress wrote the Taiwan Relations Act. The Taiwan Relations Act governs the relationship between the United States and all issues affecting the future of Taiwan and its people. Only this Congress can change the Taiwan Relations Act. 
Mr. President, we are all proud of President Clinton's trip to China. I believe that he came home with real substantive accomplishments. I believe it is also useful, as the majority leader has pointed out, to make clear both what has changed and what has not. The American commitment to Taiwan has not changed. It will not change. It is a bedrock of the American commitment to maintain special relationships with nations that choose their own leaders and live in the democratic family of countries. 
I thank the majority leader for his leadership on this issue. I am proud to join with him on this concurrent resolution.

Mr. TORRICELLI. I thank the Chair. 
Mr. President, first let me say at the end of this long road how pleased I have been to work with the Senator from Georgia. He has reached across the aisle to Senator Feinstein, Senator Breaux, Senator Graham, Senator Lieberman, and others in making this a genuine bipartisan effort. I admire his leadership and appreciate very much his extended hand that has brought us to this day. 
Mr. President, I want at the outset to begin, even at a moment of some personal satisfaction, by stating some considerable disappointment. The 105th Congress was to be the `Congress of education,' the time in which America was going to finally face the reality that the great variable in American life is the quality of the education we are affording our children. Recognizing that with a quality education accorded to our children everything--at a time of global competition and rising technological standards--is possible and without it everything is in peril, the President challenged Congress to take leadership in the rebuilding of our schools, the raising of standards through voluntary testing, and the hiring of new teachers to reduce class size. Perhaps this was done because the President, like all of us, recognized that it is late. Forty percent of American fourth graders are failing to attain a basic level in reading; 40 percent of eighth graders are failing basic tests in mathematics. In math and science, America ranks 19th of 21 industrial nations. 
Thomas Edison once noted that `discontent is the necessity of progress.' Every Member of this Senate should feel discontent because in the year of education, the Congress that was to take up all of these challenges has failed in all but this one last chance. 
The Senator from Georgia, Mr. Coverdell, has worked in the last year to bring before this Congress a simple, a modest but nevertheless an important addition in the fabric of American education, the A+ savings account. This provision returns to the Senate floor from a conference committee without any of the objectionable amendments that I and my Democratic colleagues rightfully found both disconcerting and, indeed, contrary to the efforts to improve educational quality in America. All that remains is the simple and bipartisan effort to provide for working American families the chance to save their own money to educate their own children in the school of their choice. 
It is simple, it is direct, but nevertheless it is important. Taken in its most basic form, this is an invitation for $12 billion of new money to enter American education. My colleagues, that cannot be bad. At a time when American schools struggle to pay teachers, to repair themselves, to improve curriculum, new money--without a dollar of taxpayers' contribution--all given voluntarily by American families, cannot be bad, and yet there are objections. 
It is claimed that this will be, as you will hear on this floor in the debate to follow, a diversion of public resources, a threat to the public schools. My colleagues, not a dollar, not a dime of public money is being taken from the public schools--nothing. It is all private money. Whatever the public schools got yesterday, after this bill becomes law, they will get tomorrow. 
Then it is argued, well, it may not be a diversion from the public schools, but it will help a privileged few. 
Mr. President, on the contrary, this Senate last year argued, in establishing almost identical accounts to educate college students, that we should put a cap on this tax benefit--$90,000 for a single parent, $150,000 for a married couple. Under this proposal by the Senator from Georgia, we have adopted the identical income caps--not for the privileged few but for working-class families who want to contribute to the education of their own children. 
Like the Senator from Louisiana, Mr. Breaux, I make no apologies. How many Members of this Senate line up on the Senate floor to either have programs designed for the poor or the privileged few, tax benefits for the rich, or Government programs for the poor? Finally, there is a chance to stand on the floor of this Senate Chamber to help the education of working middle-income, middle-class Americans. And that cannot be bad. 
Then it will be said, `Perhaps it doesn't help the privileged few, and perhaps it doesn't divert money from public education, but it doesn't help everybody.' If Senators come to the floor to object to every piece of legislation because it doesn't help everybody, they will have a frustrating experience in this Senate. I learned a long time ago never to make the perfect the enemy of the good. We help as many people as we can in each instance when we can, and that is exactly what the Coverdell legislation does. 
Mr. President, 70 percent of the families who will benefit from these tax-free savings accounts will be families who earn under $75,000 a year--70 percent. That is the vast majority of the American people. Does it include everybody? No. But the vast majority of Americans will have an opportunity to save under these A+ savings accounts. 
Who are these families? And how will it help? In one of the great ironies of this legislation, 75 percent of those families who will benefit now have their students, their own children, in public schools. The greatest beneficiaries are public school students, simply because the overwhelming majority of American students go to the public schools. Under our legislation, the money in these savings accounts can go to buy a home computer, school uniform, and afterschool activity, a school band instrument, books, or--most important, in my judgment--the hiring of a public school teacher after school to be a tutor to a public school student struggling in math or science. 
There was an article in the Washington Post a few weeks ago, quoting a young woman, Tiffany Johnson, a high-school senior in Maryland, who said, `It's totally impossible to function [in school] without a computer. . . . It's a big handicap not to have one at home.' 
Mr. President, 61 percent of all public school students in America today are doing their homework and their school work with no computer--unless they are a minority student. If they are black or Hispanic, 85 percent have no access to a home computer, creating a new stratum in American education that is potentially dangerous economically, educationally, and socially. It is not simply that the A+ savings accounts are the best idea to get computers in the hands of these students, it is not they are the best idea, it is the only such idea before this Congress, because these accounts will allow public school students to purchase that new tool of education. 
Then there are those 10 percent of Americans who choose to send their children to private schools. There is a benefit here for them, too, in helping to ease the burden of tuition. In the great cities of America, from New York to Los Angeles to Chicago to Newark and Miami, the parochial private schools in America today almost uniformly are designed to help the working poor. Mr. President, 65 percent of the students in Newark and Camden in parochial schools are black and Hispanic. Their tuition is $1,500, $1,600, $1,800 a year. It cannot be bad that these middle-income, working-class families, struggling to pay these tuitions in these cities, who want an alternative to the public schools, get a chance to save their own money tax-free to pay that tuition. 
It is no coincidence, in my judgment, in the last few years in the House of Representatives, the principal Democratic sponsor of this legislation was former Congressman Floyd Flake who, in the heart of Queens, took an African American church, built a school based on people's own savings in a struggling working-class neighborhood, and now says that this, and this singularly, could help those families pay this tuition bill. This is a community that asked for nothing from the Federal Government but to rebuild itself with its own resources. Mr. President, I come here today with the same belief--$12 billion in resources from working families to educate their own children, public and private. 
But there is one more thing that is, to me, as exciting as any of these statistics, impacting any of these neighborhoods or communities, and it is this. I remember a time in America where the education of a child was a family responsibility. Communities rushed to choose school board members; parents came after school; grandparents were involved in the grades and the homework. Somehow, in the last generation of America, we decided that education was now the province of bureaucrats and unions and everybody but parents and families themselves. 
Senator Coverdell and I, I hope, if we create nothing else with this legislation, we have provided an invitation to get them back involved in American education, because from the birth of a child these savings accounts are available to grandparents at birthdays, aunts, uncles, churches, unions, employers, to put money in these accounts where everyone is involved, again, in preparing for a child's future. If that money is not used in high school or grade school, every dollar of it can be rolled into a savings account for college that we established last year in the Senate under the leadership of President Clinton. 
I believe it is a compelling case. It is not a perfect answer. It does not solve every educational problem in America. But it is an important, if modest, beginning in a great debate. 
I have a great hope for this Senate, a great hope, that in the next decade, Democrats, Republicans, liberals, and conservatives will be involved in a fierce competition for who has the best ideas to rebuild American education; who can challenge the American people to do the most for rising standards, greater access to opportunity; who can reach into the heart of our cities and challenge parents that I, and I alone, have the best idea for your child. 
This is the beginning of that debate. From here, we can go to school construction, lowering class size, national testing, a host of ideas. And, in spite of my alliance with the Senator from Georgia on this issue so that we have made this bipartisan, I want my party to win that fight. And I believe we can. I think we have the most ideas. I think we have the best ideas. But this idea, nevertheless, is a good idea and it is a beginning. I hope when we vote in a short period of time, we can act together. 
Oliver Wendell Holmes, Sr. once said `. . . the greatest thing in this world is not so much where we stand, as in what direction we are moving.' This legislation, A+ savings accounts, has America moving, if modestly, in the right direction. I am enormously proud to have been part of this effort. I am grateful to the Senator from Georgia for his leadership and to my Democratic colleagues for participating in what has become this bipartisan effort. I urge my colleagues, by an overwhelming vote, to give their approval to the conference report. 
I yield the floor.  
Mr. GRAHAM addressed the Chair.

Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today regarding an issue that is of great concern to myself and the military families in my state. I am referring to the Military Traffic Management Command's (MTMC) proposed re-engineering of the personal property program. The MTMC is responsible for moving service member's household goods when they receive Permanent Change of Station orders, and the current system for doing so has often been criticized for not providing the same quality service that is available in the private sector. 
The current system is a $1.1 billion a year industry that is awarded without competition and contains no provisions for the government to enforce quality standards. The status quo has produced a dismal 23% customer satisfaction rate, which is understandable when we consider that one in four military moves results in a claim for missing or broken household goods. To make the situation worse, it takes about 8 months to settle 80% of these claims with the service member, at a cost of $100 million to the government. 
For over three years, the Department of Defense has been trying to bring elements of competition and corporate practice into the military program. MTMC's plans will permit full and open competition from all types of companies which provide corporate moving services, and will hold its contractors to standards of performance. It will streamline the personal property program, and introduce accountability to the program through the use of the Federal Acquisition Regulation. The re-engineered program will also make full replacement insurance value available to service families for the first time, and will guarantee that a minimum of 41% of the total contract will be performed by small businesses. The GAO has reviewed this proposal and found it to be superior to the current program. 
However, I am concerned that an alternative to the MTMC's re-engineering program, referred to as the Commercial-Like Activities of Superior Service (CLASS), has been included in the House FY99 Defense Authorization bill. This alternative, which is opposed by the Department of Defense, the Military Coalition, the Business Executives for National Security and the Military Mobility Coalition, does not improve the quality of service for our personnel, does not take advantage of current commercial practices, does not provide our military families with a streamlined claims process, and offers no protection for the interests of small business. It is estimated that the CLASS program will cost the DoD about three years and an additional $6 million to implement. I am hopeful that my colleagues in the Senate will reject the CLASS program during the conference committee negotiations, and allow the DoD to move forward with its pilot program. 
I urge my colleagues to support MTMC's re-engineering effort and to remember that this is simply a pilot program. It will take place in three states and will encompass only 18,000 shipments out of a total of 650,000 annually, or only three percent of DoD's total annual shipments. Congress has also charged GAO to review the pilot as it is conducted and report back to Congress. If, at the end of this test, there are changes to be made, we can make them at that time. 
Mr. President, our military families have waited long enough for us to improve the personal property program, and legislatively changing all of DoD's efforts for some other idea at the last minute would be extremely counterproductive. I look forward to removing this burden from our service personnel, and to working with my colleagues to ensure MTMC's re-engineering program becomes a reality.

Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Georgia for yielding me time, but more than that, for his leadership in the course of this Congress to bring to the floor of the Senate, in its final form, the A+ savings accounts. 
I also congratulate the conferees for settling what were some real differences in bringing now, in this final form, the A+ savings accounts in such a manner, I believe, that on a bipartisan basis Senators can be both pleased and proud to lend their support in final passage. 
Mr. President, upon passage in the Senate of the A+ savings accounts, seven Democratic Senators joined with me in writing the majority leader, expressing our concern that amendments offered by Senator Ashcroft and Senator Gorton presented some real difficulties to Democratic Members of the Senate in being able to vote for the conference report. 
These two amendments would have either prohibited national school testing, which has been a priority of the Clinton administration, or transformed educational funding by the Federal Government into block grants to the States. 
Many of us have believed that block granting many of these worthwhile programs would have placed in jeopardy important Federal initiatives in secondary education. And eliminating testing would have prevented milestones in education which the Clinton administration thought were so important. 
It is important for Democratic Senators to know both amendments, in an effort to obtain genuine, broad-based bipartisan support, both amendments are not contained in the conference report. The conference report for A+ savings accounts now is the Coverdell-Torricelli bill as originally proposed. That is why I believe, as we are coming to a vote tomorrow, this legislation deserves bipartisan support. 
There is nothing here that every Democratic Member of this Senate cannot enthusiastically support and embrace. Indeed, with all respect to my friend, the senior Senator from Georgia, in its purist form this is an idea consistent with Democratic Party philosophies. It is, in fact, everything that President Clinton offered last year with regard to the financing of higher education. Senator Coverdell is simply now applying that to grade school and secondary school education. 
What a simple idea. How basic. American families can save their own money, in their own savings accounts, without taxation, to educate their own children in the school of their choice. What possible argument could anyone have with that proposal? And yet people have found reason to object: first, that it undermines the public schools. On the contrary, not only does it not undermine the public schools, the Joint Committee on Tax is arguing that 70 percent of all of the families who will save money in these accounts for their own children will use it on behalf of public school students. As designed by Senator Coverdell, this money will be available for afterschool tutoring of public school students, 
ironically, hiring public schoolteachers, afterschool activities, computers, school supplies, uniforms of public school students. 
This does not only not undermine the public school system, it strengthens it by bringing new resources. 
The second argument is that, if this is done, it may not hurt the public schools but it is done to help a privileged few. On the contrary; the income limitations used in this legislation of $110,000 to $140,000 are the same the Senate used last year in establishing savings accounts for colleges. It is believed that 75 percent of all the money in these savings accounts will be saved by families with incomes of less than $70,000 a year. This is a middle-income program to help working families educate their children--public or private. 
Then the argument is made, maybe it doesn't undermine the public schools, maybe it isn't just for a privileged few, but it doesn't help everybody. It doesn't help everybody. It doesn't help high-income people who are not below the income limitations, and if truth be told, families with no income, the very poor, will not be able to save money. 
One warning I received upon entering a career in the U.S. Congress is, never make the perfect the enemy of the good. I know of no legislation in any form, in any endeavor, by any Senator, which helps everybody all the time. Any Senator who comes to this floor looking for that legislation will live a frustrated life in the U.S. Senate. 
Suffice it to say, millions of American families, millions of modest background who simply have a child in a public school but would like them to have a home computer, their child is in public school but they would like them to be able to stay in after school and participate in activities that cost money; they are in an urban school but they would like, under mandatory programs, to get their child a school uniform, buy extra books--this program does work for them. And for those 10 percent of American families that send their child to a private school, a parochial school, the yeshiva, because they believe that is best for their circumstances, it helps to ease the burden of their tuition, it is straightforward, it is direct, and, mostly, it is right for the country. 
I will concede that, while I enthusiastically support this proposal, this Congress has not been everything it should have been for education. The President challenged the Senate that, from school testing to the reconstruction of our schools to class size, this Congress should have dedicated itself to improving the quality of American education. And it did not. But it has produced this one idea. It may not be the best idea, it is certainly not the only idea, it will not transform American education, but that does not mean it is not a good idea that can help. 
I have often believed, in the current state of American education, that everybody has something to offer and there are many good ideas. Everything is defendable in American education except one thing--the status quo. This challenges the status quo. For the first time in a long time, we are opening the possibility that American families can all see themselves as involved again. If you could change one thing, in my judgment, in education today, it would be the belief that families are relevant again to educating their own children. This is no longer simply something in the hands of government, a school board, a union, Washington, or a State capital; we are responsible for the education of our own children. 
Senator Coverdell has established that on every child's birthday, every grandparent, every aunt and uncle, can be relevant again. They can look at a child they care about and, rather than a meaningless toy, rather than some worthless gift, there is an account. Perhaps you would like that child to have a computer, reading materials, participate in afterschool activity; they are struggling in math or science and they would like to have a tutor. Put money in their account, at Christmas or at any time of the year. Let the extended family be involved on the front lines of educating that child. 
Beyond that family, when a labor union sits across the table from a great American industrial employer and they have settled on pension benefits and they have settled on health benefits, let that labor union leader have one more question: How about a contribution to the savings account to help educate the children of my membership? 
No, it is not going to solve every problem, but we estimate that this proposal will bring $12 billion of private resources to the education of American children. That can't be wrong. It cannot be wrong--$12 billion of new money is now available to help our children in their secondary school education. 
If, at the end of the day, its critics are right and all this money is not used for public education or private education but remains in these accounts, then we believe, our critics taken at face value, the worst that could happen is, this money is rolled over into savings accounts for college--meaning that not only will we be provided this option for secondary school education, but the money will then become available for college education--ironically, in accounts established under the leadership of President Clinton and supported on a bipartisan basis in this Senate. 
I believe this will pass the Senate. But more significantly, Senator Coverdell has introduced this Senate into an important and dramatic new debate. We Democrats and Republicans, liberals and conservative, will be in a competition in the redesign of American education. No better opportunity, no more timely debate, could be visited upon this Congress than this new competition. It is important. It is worthwhile. If we succeed, we will redesign American education. 
Senator Coverdell has made a valuable addition in beginning this debate. I congratulate him for it. I look forward tomorrow, when we both will return to this floor, to introduce this final debate in enacting A+ savings accounts. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleague from New Jersey, Senator Lautenburg, to introduce the `Marine Mammal Rescue Fund of 1998.' This legislation will amend the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 by establishing a grant program that Marine Mammal Stranding Centers and Networks can use to support the important work they do in responding to marine mammal strandings and mortality events. 
Since the enactment of the Marine Mammal Protection Act in 1972, 47 facilities nationally have been authorized to handle the rehabilitation of stranded marine mammals and over 400 individuals and facilities across the country are part of an authorized National Stranding Network that responds to strandings and deaths. 
Mr. President, these facilities and individuals provide our country with a variety of critical services, including rescue, housing, care, rehabilitation, transport, and tracking of marine mammals and sea turtles, as well as assistance in investigating mortality events, tissue sampling, and removal of carcasses. They also work very closely with the National Marine Fisheries Service, a variety of environmental groups, and with state and local officials in rescuing, tracking and protecting marine mammals and sea turtles on the Endangered Species List. Yet they rely primarily on private donations, fundraisers, and foundation grants for their operating budgets. They receive no federal assistance, and a very few of them get some financial assistance from their states. 
As an example, Mr. President, the Marine Mammal Stranding Center located in Brigantine in my home state of New Jersey was formed in 1978. To-date, it has responded to over 1,500 calls for stranded whales, dolphins, seals and sea turtles that have washed ashore on New Jersey's beaches. It has also been called on to assist in strandings as far away as Delaware, Maryland, and Virginia. Yet, their operating budget for the past year was just under $300,000, with less than 6 percent ($17,000) coming from the state. Although the Stranding Center in Brigantine has never turned down a request for assistance with a stranding, trying to maintain that level of responsiveness and service becomes increasingly more difficult each year. 
Virtually all the money raised by the Center, Mr. President, goes to pay for the feeding, care, and transportation of rescued marine mammals, rehabilitation (including medical care), insurance, day-to-day operation of the Center, and staff payroll. Too many times the staff are called upon to pay out-of-pocket expenses in travel, subsistence, and quarters while responding to strandings or mortality events. 
Mr. President, this should not happen. These people are performing a great service to Americans across the country, and they are being asked to pay their own way as well. And when responding to mortality events, Mr. President, they are performing work that protects public health and helps assess the potential danger to human life and to other marine mammals. 
I feel very strongly that we should be providing some support to the people who are doing this work. To that end, Mr. President, the legislation I am introducing would create the Marine Mammal Rescue Fund under the Marine Mammal Protection Act. It would authorize funding at $5,000,000.00, annually, over the next five years, for grants to Marine Mammal Stranding Centers and Stranding Network Members authorized by the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS). Grants would not exceed $100,000.00 per year, and would require a 25 percent non-federal funding matching requirement.

Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation that addresses a potential crisis in our organ donation system. Proposed regulations by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) would have devastating effects on community-based transplant programs by prohibiting states from offering organs to their own sickest residents before making them available nationwide. 
There is no more noble a deed than donating one's organs so that another may live. In the past 15 years, the national transplant system has saved over 200,000 lives. In my state of New Jersey, over 10,000 people in the past 10 years have received life-saving transplants. 
Notwithstanding this success, there is a critical shortage of organs for donation. Less than one percent of Americans offer their organs for donation upon their death. Eleven people die every day in this country waiting for an organ. 
The changes proposed by HHS, however well intentioned, fail to adequately address the national shortage of donated organs and create a system which may actually increase waiting times in many areas of the country. By directing the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) to develop a system which removes geography as a factor in organ donation, the regulations will significantly increase waiting times in states with efficient systems. For instance, at University Hospital in New Jersey, the State's largest liver transplant center, the waiting period for a liver in 1997 was only 26 days, compared to a 250 day national waiting period. Forcing facilities, like University Hospital, to first offer donated organs nationwide will undoubtedly lead to longer waiting periods. 
These unintended consequences will be felt most greatly among patients with disadvantaged backgrounds. In my State of New Jersey, we are extremely fortunate to have a system that is fair and efficient. New Jersey's unique system of certificate of need and charity care ensures that the most critical patients get organs first regardless of insurance. A national organ donation system will force the smaller transplant centers that serve the uninsured and underinsured to close as the vast majority of organs go to the handful of the nation's largest transplant centers with the longest waiting lists. Without access to smaller programs, many patients will be faced with the hardship of registering with out-of-state programs that may turn them away due to lack of insurance. Those who are accepted will be forced to travel out of state at great medical risk and financial hardship. 
Mr. President, the legislation I introduce today is a bipartisan effort. I am pleased to be joined by my colleagues, Senators Gorton, Feingold, Mack, Sessions, Thurmond, Landrieu, Breaux, Hollings, Lautenberg, Kohl, Inhofe, G. Smith, and Shelby. Our bill will delay for one year the Secretary's ability to issue regulations regarding the nation's organ donation system. The delay will allow HHS to further consult with the medical community, particularly those serving low-income patients, to develop workable guidelines for organ donation. In addition, the legislation calls on HHS to conduct a pilot study to determine the impact of any regulations before implementation. Finally, the legislation finds that provisions of the proposed changes with respect to standardized ranking and listing criteria, enforcement measures, and disclosure requirements are a potential good first step in improving the nation's organ donation system. 
For the past 15 years, the national organ procurement and allocation system has existed without federal regulation. During this time, each State has developed a unique system to meet their individual needs. Many states, such as New Jersey, have focused on serving uninsured and underprivileged populations. Clearly, improvements can be made to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of organ donation nationwide. The legislation I am introducing today will allow us to meet these objectives by providing greater time for a more thoughtful debate.

Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, during the course of the last year as a member of the Judiciary Committee and the Governmental Affairs Committee, I have felt that part of my responsibilities are 
to follow the investigation of independent counsel Kenneth Starr in some particular detail. 
I, like many Americans during the course of this last year, have been troubled about Mr. Starr's investigation and the sensitivity to the rights of individual Americans in any sense of balance or fairness with which he is pursuing his responsibilities. During the course of this year, I have, on six different occasions, written to Attorney General Reno, noting problems with the investigation or particular areas of concern. These have included possible conflicts of interest on the part of Mr. Starr and his deputy, Mr. Ewing, and that Mr. Starr continues to draw a salary from his law firm in excess of $1 million--a law firm that represents important interests, including tobacco companies whose future interests may be at variance with policy positions of the Clinton administration while Mr. Starr is investigating President Clinton. 
Second, Mr. Starr's association with people and organizations that appear intent on discrediting President Clinton. These, of course, would include Mr. Scaife, Mr. Starr's association with Pepperdine University, his promise of employment while being funded by an individual who is committed to the destruction of President Clinton personally and politically. 
Third, the question of possible witness tampering. This, Mr. President, goes to the question of allegations of payments to David Hale by individuals associated with some of these organizations that may have undermined the credibility of testimony given in the Whitewater investigation. 
All these issues for the moment aside, each individually troubling, we are now confronted with a new and potentially more serious question, and that is the apparently purposeful releasing, or to use the vernacular, `the leaking,' of the sensitive nonpublic and possible grand jury information by Mr. Starr and his associates. During this investigation, various newspapers and television accounts have repeatedly used `unnamed sources' to report information that made it appear likely, if unmistakable, that the Office of Independent Counsel was providing information to reporters that was otherwise protected as a matter of law, if not just department policy. 
Now in an exhaustively detailed account, a new publication, Brill's Content, has reviewed the independent counsel investigation of the President and found clear and unmistakable evidence that Mr. Starr and his associates have purposefully leaked information about the investigation of President Clinton. If these reports are true, Mr. Starr's activities are not only a violation of the ethical standards of the legal profession, they are a direct possible violation of rule 6E of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure and an obvious violation of Department of Justice guidelines. 
This leaking would obviously have been objectionable if undertaken by an individual U.S. attorney or another Department of Justice official. The precedence of the Department of Justice almost certainly would have led to an investigation by the Office of Professional Responsibility with sanctions or firing by the individual responsible. But undertaken by someone in the Office of Independent Counsel, it is, in my judgment, an offense of a far greater nature because the independent counsel has been given unparalleled, even unprecedented powers, to investigate the President of the United States without much of the oversight and accountability that is required of career prosecutors or others in the Justice Department itself. 
It obviously poses a direct and fundamental threat to the credibility and effectiveness of the Office of Independent Counsel. Before this goes any further and the Office of Independent Counsel and the statute upon which it rests is further undermined, there is an obvious and overwhelming need for either the Federal courts, in their direct responsibility to oversee this investigation, or Attorney General Reno in her responsibility in the administration of the Department of Justice, to undertake an immediate and thorough investigation of the Office of Independent Counsel, because if these allegations that Kenneth Starr is leaking protected grand jury information are true, then the Office of Independent Counsel is spinning seriously out of control and operating outside of the law. 
Mr. President, the evidence today, if not conclusive, is overwhelming. On February 6, 1998, David Kendall, the President's personal attorney, wrote a 15-page letter to the Federal district court detailing dozens of instances of obviously improper disclosure of grand jury information. 
In response, Mr. Starr told numerous media outlets that these leaks were not coming from anyone in his office. In a letter to Mr. Kendall, Mr. Starr wrote, `From the beginning, I have made the prohibition of leaks a principal priority of the office.' Starr continued, `It is a firing offense, as well as one that will lead to criminal prosecution.' Mr. Starr continues, `I have undertaken an investigation to determine whether, despite my persistent admonition, someone in this office may be culpable.' 
Despite calls from the Department of Justice and the Office of Professional Responsibility to investigate, the Attorney General of the United States, Ms. Reno took Kenneth Starr at his word and allowed him to proceed with an internal investigation of his own office. Although Mr. Starr pledged to end these leaks and investigate any wrongdoing, it is obvious that he neither investigated nor changed the conduct of his office, or as now we know, even himself. 
This week, Steven Brill in his magazine Content provided even further evidence of these transgressions. Mr. Brill reports that he has personally seen internal memoranda from 3 different national news organizations that cite Mr. Starr's office as the source of many of these stories of grand jury leaks. 
He discloses an internal publication of the New York Times, in which its Washington editor is quoted as saying, `This story was very much driven in the beginning on sensitive information that was coming out of the prosecutor's office. And the sourcing had to be vague because it was * * * given with the understanding that it would not be sourced.' 
But if this sourcing, this reporting and analysis was not enough, these disclosures have been confirmed directly by Mr. Starr himself. 
On April 15 of this year, Brill reports that Starr acknowledged that he and his office have provided non-public information to reporters. Mr. Starr said, `I have talked with reporters on background on some occasions, but Jackie [Bennett, his deputy] has been the primary person involved in that. He has spent much of his time talking to individual reporters.' 
Mr. President, in his statement, Mr. Starr confirms what many of us have suspected all along: the Office of Independent Counsel has not only violated department guidelines on providing information, but it may have violated Rule 6E of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, and committed a criminal offense in its own investigation. 
Mr. President, I need not remind my colleagues of the seriousness of this possible criminal offense by Mr. Starr's office. 
It has been a founding principle of Anglo-American law that confidentiality of grand jury investigations is central to the administration of justice. 
Mr. Starr has defended his media leaks by saying they were not a Rule 6E violation. He says, `* * * if you are talking about what 
witnesses tell FBI agents or us before they testify before the grand jury or about related matters,' they are not violations. 
Mr. President, Mr. Starr's defense may be that he violated the spirit, but not the letter of the law. Tragically, Mr. President, that is not the case under the precedents of this country. 
On May 5, 1998, in In Re: Motions of Dow Jones and Company, the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia--the court which, ironically, has jurisdiction over Mr. Starr's current grand jury investigation--ruled that leaking information about prospective witnesses who might testify at a grand jury, about expected testimony, about negotiations regarding possible immunity, and about the strategy of grand jury proceedings, all violate Rule 6E. 
The court wrote, `Matters occurring before the grand jury' that cannot be disclosed `* * * include not only what has occurred and what is occurring, but what also is likely to occur.' 
What is therefore so shocking about Mr. Starr's own defense of his activities, his disclosures, is not that there is a precedent to the contrary to which one can be referred, it is that Mr. Starr himself is fully aware of this restriction. They are in the law. He knows them and he violated them. 
In one of his impromptu sidewalk press conferences, held February 5 of this year, Mr. Starr told reporters that he could not talk `* * * about the status of someone who might be a witness [because] that goes to the heart of the grand jury process.' 
Exactly, Mr. Starr. Disclosing potential testimony, likely testimony of someone who might appear before a grand jury, is not outside the Federal statute or its precedence; in your own words, Mr. Starr, it goes to the heart of the process and the protection afforded citizens of this country. There is a reason. This being a Nation that is ruled under the precedence of law, there is a reason why this Congress, the Justice Department, and the courts have protected grand jury information. 
If Mr. Starr's violation goes unanswered and he is not held accountable, there are consequences for all Americans, in all investigations, by all prosecutors, in all years to follow, because without it we could not guarantee that witnesses would ever feel free to disclose information to an investigator. They would live in fear that it would always potentially be disclosed. We could not ensure that grand jurors would be able to deliberate free from the influence of interested parties who would manipulate their investigation in public debate. We could not preserve the reputation of witnesses called before the grand jury, but found not guilty of any crime. 
Mr. Starr's activities are not simply a violation of the rights of President Clinton or grand jury witnesses, they are a violation of the administration of justice in this country. 
Mr. President, all crimes in the United States are not equal or serious. But crimes committed by Government in the administration of justice against individual Americans, given the vast and enormous and disparate power of Government in the administration of justice can be the most serious crime of all. It is that to which Mr. Starr stands accused today. 
Mr. President, I do not know how Attorney General Janet Reno is dealing with these allegations. One can only imagine, because when the public debate began about possible grand jury leaks and the violations of Federal criminal statutes with regard to disclosing information, Mr. Starr stood silent. He permitted the Attorney General of the United States to allow him to proceed with an internal investigation of these grand jury leaks of his own office when all the time he knew that he was the source of some of the leaks, potentially undermining not only public confidence in the investigation but almost assuredly the confidence of the Attorney General herself. 
Mr. President, I don't know what Janet Reno is thinking. But Kenneth Starr made a fool of the Attorney General of the United States having her proceed with Mr. Starr investigating his own transgressions. 
This maneuvering, however, to many in this institution will not come as a surprise. The problems with the independent counsel have been coming for some time, and, indeed, almost incredibly Justice Scalia predicted in his dissent in Morrison v. Olson exactly what has now occurred. 
A prosecutor so focused on one suspect under the laws of the independent counsel would, and he wrote, and I quote, `What would normally be regarded as a technical violation * * * may in his or her world assume the proportions of an indictable offense.' 
Mr. President, this is exactly what has occurred. Mr. Starr has been transformed from one who is supposed to be an objective prosecutor into a partisan political actor without oversight from the Department of Justice, control of the Federal courts, and no longer even operating within Federal law. 
Mr. President, I call upon my colleagues to join me in urging the Attorney General to once again assume her lawful responsibilities in the administration of justice, recognizing that the Office of Independent Counsel cannot operate outside of Federal law. Mr. President, it is high time at last to restore the credibility of this investigation.

Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, last month the Senator from Massachusetts, Mr. Kennedy, came to the floor to urge the Republican leadership to allow the body to consider reform of managed health care in our country. Today, I also want to join his plea that this institution be allowed to consider the consequences for American families of the managed health care system in our country. 
The simple truth is health care in America is in a state of crisis--not a crisis of competence or technology. Most assuredly, it is a crisis of confidence. Confidence in health care in many respects is as important as the quality of the providers or the level of our technology. I have rarely in my life seen an issue where so many Americans are of a similar mind with such a depth of concern regarding the availability and quality of health care under the HMO system. 
I realized myself the depth of these feelings when, only a few months, ago I joined with my colleague, Congressman Pallone from New Jersey, in a field hearing in our State. During the hearing, families told me about their own experiences in attempting to care for their children, gaining access to the best health care providers, and the enormous frustration and feeling that the costs of operations were being placed before the health of their children. 
Perhaps the best example came from a single family in New Jersey, the Bolingers. Their daughter, Kristin, is 15 years old, and lives in Spotswood, NJ. She has experienced the frustration of managed care that has been visited upon many American families. As an infant, Kristin developed unexplained intractable seizures which left her in need of very specialized care and expensive diagnostic tests. Five years before, Kristin's parents had enrolled themselves in an HMO. But because of the rules of the HMO, Kristin could no longer see the pediatricians and the specialists who had been treating her for her entire life. Those who had the experience with Kristin, had seen her symptoms and knew her case, were now separated from her treatment, and in their place the HMO on its list of available doctors made a pediatrician available who was not qualified, who had no experience with her condition, and did not know her or how to treat her. 
Her family then was left in an extraordinary position. In caring for their 15-year-old daughter, do they absorb all of the financial costs which they are unable to bear when treating their child or do they go to doctors who, on their face, were not qualified to deal with the case? 
The family was left in a desperate financial position. The HMO refused to pay many of her medical bills deeming them `not medically necessary.' The case only gets worse. 
In 1994, scoliosis, caused by Kristin's condition, required the use of a back brace. The HMO gave her a back brace which was inferior and not usable. 
Last year, Kristin had to undergo corrective spinal surgery. Her physician prescribed home nursing care and physical therapy. For a long time the HMO refused to pay for the physical therapy or the home care. They would pay for nothing. After they started to pay, the physical therapy was only half complete when payments stopped. 
This, of course, leaves Kristin Bolinger's family with a question that they will ask themselves all their lives. The bills were not being paid, the family had to make these sacrifices in spite of the fact they were paying an HMO all of this time on time in full. The finances aside, the Bolinger family for the rest of their lives is left with the question: How much did their child suffer, and how much of her condition might have been reversed if she had gotten the right care at the right time? 
Obviously, Mr. President, Kristin Bolinger and her family are not alone. She is one of 4 million people in my State of New Jersey and 50 million in our country who have absolutely no protection from the judgments of their health maintenance organizations. They live at the whim of whatever decisions may come from the officials who manage these health care organizations. That is true, even though I am very proud that in New Jersey we probably have the best patient protection system for those in managed care of any State in the Nation. But it doesn't work. State protections don't work because only 25 percent of those in health maintenance organizations in New Jersey can be covered by State protections. The other 75 percent, who like Kristin Bolinger are in ERISA-based plans, are left to their own devices to fight their insurance companies for their rights because State protections cannot shield them. 
It is no wonder that more than half of all Americans who are enrolled in health maintenance organizations are significantly dissatisfied with the quality of their care. 
Fifty-one percent of Americans believe that health maintenance organizations are eroding the quality of health care for their families. Fifty-five percent fear that if they become ill while in a managed health care plan, those who administer their plan would have their highest priority in saving money rather than caring for their patients. And if that is not bad enough, the worst indication may be that this lack of confidence of those who are enrolled in the plan is mirrored by health care professionals themselves. Forty percent of all physicians who work in these very plans every day watching these judgments believe that the quality of health care and of the judgments made by health care professionals is eroding and prevent them from making the best medical judgments for patients. 
I cannot tell you that the movement in America to managed health care plans has not had benefits. The truth is the spiraling upward costs of health care in America are being contained. I do not believe we ever could have developed the current Federal budget surplus without managed care. It has been of enormous benefit to the American economy as corporations have contained costs, but there is a loss of balance. If we are achieving the controlling of these costs, but the price is that families and physicians do not have confidence they can get the care they are purchasing, we are paying a very high price for this efficiency. What is required is to restore the balance between the efficiencies of delivering care and ending the upward spiral of rising health care costs, but assuring quality and access and balance of judgments. 
The truth is this loss of balance is not necessary. Patients should have access to health care professionals who are qualified to treat their conditions and not forced to accept people without the proper professional credentials simply because they are preferred by health care managers in these organizations. Insurance companies should not withhold the care that family physicians and specialists alike deem necessary. If a health care professional, a doctor believes a certain treatment is necessary, as a matter of right that doctor's judgment should prevail. Obviously, if a doctor believes that an HMO is making the wrong judgment for the health of an individual, there should be a fair and speedy appeals process to someone who can make the best judgment for the patient. 
Mr. President, this case is so obvious, it is so compelling, it comes as close to a consensus judgment as can ever be reached in a country of this size and complexity. It is at issue in every State, in millions of American families, borne out by the practical experience of people that Senators meet every day. It is true today. It was true yesterday. It was true last month. It was true last year. 
I join with the Senator from Massachusetts, Mr. Kennedy, in urging that this Congress this year deal with health maintenance organization reform. There is legislation before this Senate that is prepared. It is ready. It is comprehensive. It deals with the issue. Senator Daschle's legislation, S. 1890, would deal with the very issues that Kristin Bolinger had to face in her own life. Senator Daschle's Patients' Bill of Rights, consistent with the call of President Clinton in his State of the Union Address, would ensure that patients like Kristin would have (1) access to providers who are qualified to treat their conditions, including referrals to specialists when necessary; (2) that any Member of a health maintenance organization, wherever they are in America, wherever they travel, whatever community they are in, have access to emergency care in a hospital that is proximate to them when they are in trouble or in need; (3) have access to a fair and immediate appeals process. 
More than anything else, this would convince the American people that their interests and the needs of their families are being put before the profits of these organizations. It is obviously too late to deal with Kristin Bolinger's pain or the terrible financial plight of her family. Kristin's experience and those of millions of other Americans can be instructive to this 
Senate and remind us of our obligations to deal with the problems of health care in America. We can still acknowledge the enormous efficiencies of managed care and its benefits of ending the rising costs, helping with corporate efficiency and the predictability of health care costs. But simply because these organizations are working to add efficiency, does not attest to the fact that all families are being treated fairly as demonstrated by Kristin Bolinger's experience. Senator Daschle's legislation, his Patients' Bill of Rights, deals with that balance. I urge the majority leader, Senator Lott, to bring the Patients' Bill of Rights for managed health care reform before the Senate. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, anyone who has been listening to this debate on the Senate floor in the last few weeks is now familiar with the painful but very real statistics. Each day, 3,000 young Americans begin smoking and eventually 1,000 will die. I can think of no issue on the floor of this Congress which could more directly affect the lives of Americans for a generation to come to finally deal with the reality of tobacco and its assorted dangers. 
Legislation offered by Senator McCain, which I enthusiastically support, makes a contribution in several important ways to dealing with this problem: First, it requires a warning label and restricts advertising designed to attract children to smoking cigarettes; second, it grants broad authority to the Federal Drug and Food Administration to regulate tobacco products, their advertising, and their distribution; third, it establishes a national tobacco trust fund for smoke cessation programs, health research, and compensation for States and farmers as a result of tobacco smoking and the program; and, finally, it also penalizes companies up to $3.5 billion per year if they fail to meet their targets to reduce youth smoking. 
There is, however, a less addressed but equally significant impact of this legislation that also needs to be addressed. It has been raised by the Senator from Texas, Senator Gramm, and now by the Senator from South Dakota, Senator Daschle, that there are unintended tax consequences of this legislation. I am relieved that my colleagues joined in the judgment not to raise the tobacco tax to $1.50 per pack but cast their votes, as I did, to keep this tax $1.10. It is, nevertheless, the reality that this taxation upon cigarettes could be the most regressive tax ever passed in American history. This tax burden is falling disproportionately on the working poor and, indeed, on poor families themselves. 
It has been noted that the total tax burden of families who earn under $10,000 a year would increase by 40 percent as a result of this tobacco tax. Indeed, three-quarters of the tax would be paid by families who earn under $50,000 per year. This would add a tax burden to an American population that is already excessively taxed. 
I understand that it is President Clinton's priority that a new Federal surplus be used primarily to deal with the future obligations of Social Security. I support him in that initiative, as I believe there are important initiatives of education and health care that are unaddressed in our country. But the tobacco legislation brings into focus another reality: The average American family is still paying too much taxation. Indeed, the CBO reports that taxes on the American public have recently reached 20 percent of the gross domestic product. Not since the Second World War has the total tax burden on the American people, as a percentage of our economy, been so high. According to the Joint Committee on Tax, Americans earning $30,000 and less will pay 59 percent of this new tobacco tax, which is being added on this already heavy burden. 
The answer of the Senator from Texas is to primarily deal with this new burden by dealing with what is known as the marriage penalty. Indeed, in 1996, 21 million couples 
encountered an average penalty because of their joint filings as a result of their marriage of $1,400. That represents 42 percent of the American people--married couples--are paying more as a consequence of their marriage. 
A proposal by Senator Gramm combines a phase-in of tax relief for the marriage penalty, with tax credits for the self-employed to purchase health insurance, for costs of upwards of $16 billion during the first 5 years, and $30 billion in years 6 through 10. 
Responding to criticism that earlier versions of his amendment would have completely drained the public health funds in this bill, Senator Gramm now proposes to limit the use of the tobacco trust fund from one-half to one-third of the revenues in the outyears for dealing with this elimination of the marriage penalty. He does so, however, by using the general revenues of the Federal Government. The consequences of using these general revenues for the admittedly important objective of eliminating the marriage penalty is that it contradicts President Clinton's goal of first using Federal surpluses to deal with Social Security. 
Indeed, on a bipartisan basis, I could not understand and it would be difficult to accept that this Congress would not want to first deal with ensuring the financial safety of Social Security before dealing with other admittedly important tax objectives. Specifically, the Gramm amendment potentially would remove $90 to $125 billion worth of Federal revenues that the President has designed to deal with the future security of Social Security, specifically for the baby boom generation. 
I think Senator Daschle has a better idea. He offers an alternative which allows this Congress to remain focused on securing Social Security for the next generation while dealing with this admittedly high tax burden and the unintended consequence of regressivity of the tobacco tax. 
First, Senator Daschle would ease the tax burden on American families by providing full deductibility for health insurance premiums for the self-employed. No issue could be more important for people starting their own businesses, for middle-income families, than dealing with this full deductibility of health insurance. 
Second, it maintains the integrity of the tobacco bill and still protects Social Security. So the programs now envisioned in the tobacco bill would remain--dealing with public health, tobacco farmers, reimbursement to the States--while at the same time allowing us to provide this tax relief. 
The difference, of course, between Senator Daschle's proposal and Senator Gramm's proposal is that Senator Gramm did not simply deal with the marriage penalty--because only 40 percent of all married couples are paying a marriage penalty, he was providing tax relief beyond this and thereby causing this financial strain. The alternative offered by the Senator from South Dakota, Senator Daschle, deals simply with those families who are actually paying the marriage penalty and thereby allows us to do so in a more responsible fashion. 
This, I believe, is the better alternative, but I hope the Senate does not simply deal this year with the question of the tax burden on the American people by only addressing the question of the marriage tax penalty. That will suffice for the tobacco legislation. I hope and I trust by the time the Senate is finished dealing with tobacco legislation that we have dealt with deductibility for the self-employed of their health insurance and the elimination of the marriage penalty. 
Before yielding the floor, I hope that the Senate would follow the debate that has now begun as a consequence of the important analysis offered by the Senator from Texas, Senator Gramm, on both the overall national tax burden and its regressivity by dealing with other tax issues in the remainder of this session. 
First, if not in this legislation, then before this session adjourns, the Senate should deal with the fact that there are too many Americans of modest means who are finding themselves in the highest tax bracket. Today, a single individual is paying a 28 percent Federal income tax with a salary of $25,300, and a married couple with only $42,350 in income is paying a Federal tax of 28 percent in income taxes. Therefore, we are applying the highest rate to people of genuinely modest means. 
I believe we would make a real contribution to tax fairness in the Senate in this year if the 15 percent bracket could be expanded to $35,000 for individuals and $70,000 for married couples. This would move more than 10 million Americans from the 28 percent tax bracket to the 15 percent tax bracket and genuinely ensure that middle-income people are able to take advantage of a lower 15 percent bracket. No single proposal would grant tax relief on a broader, more comprehensive basis to middle-income Americans. 
Second, before this Congress adjourns this year, I hope the Congress will return to the issue of capital gains simplification. I have joined with Senator Mack and Senator Breaux to encourage that savings and investment income be restored to a 12-month holding period in order to avail ourselves of the lower capital gains tax rate that was instituted by this Congress on an earlier date. 
Third, return again to the issue of estate taxes by building on the $1 million exemption from the estate tax in last year's tax bill by slashing the estate tax rate by 25 percent. We made real progress last year by raising the exemption to a $1 million, but the Federal tax rate and the State tax remain confiscatory at an unbelievable 55 percent. 
Fourth, and finally, I hope this Congress, before concluding its work this year on the Federal Tax Code, will return to the incredibly poor savings rates in this Nation. The United States now suffers from the lowest savings rate in nearly 60 years. I believe this Senate should exempt the first $500 in interest from taxation, ensuring that any family in America that saves $10,000, whether in equity or bonds or savings accounts, would not pay taxes on that first $10,000. Nothing would do more for Americans to prepare for their own retirement, to provide security for American families, than transforming every $10,000 in savings in America by every family instantly into a tax-free account. This could be done simply by exempting the first $500 in interest. For those 60 percent of American families that have no equity, no savings other than their house, and live in the dangerous position of paycheck-to-paycheck, this, for the first time, would provide a real incentive for those families to save money. 
Mr. President, my purpose today primarily was to draw attention to the worthwhile objective of providing some tax relief in the tobacco legislation for those families, primarily of low and moderate means, who will disproportionately be shouldering this burden of increased tobacco taxes. But I wanted to take advantage of the opportunity both to demonstrate the relative advantage of Senator Daschle's proposal, to provide this tax relief within the tobacco bill, thereby not jeopardizing the revenues available to deal with providing some safety for Social Security, but also to point out to the Senate that, beyond dealing with the tax burden of families because of the tobacco legislation and thereby providing relief in the marriage penalty and the self-employment full deductibility on health insurance, the Senate should be setting its sights on other areas as well in the remainder of this year--an encouragement in savings, general income tax relief for middle-income families, and on the inheritance tax. The Senate has a larger obligation of easing the tax burden, and I believe the debate that has begun in the Senate has begun to outline the possible components, beyond the tobacco legislation, of broader tax relief for the American families. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.

 Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today in support of Clyde J. Hart's nomination as Administrator of the Maritime Administration. Mr. Hart is originally from my home state of New Jersey and I am proud to stand with him as he prepares for his confirmation process before the Senate. 
Mr. Hart is currently the senior Democratic Counsel for the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, Surface Transportation and Merchant Marine Subcommittee in the Senate. I have had the great privilege of working with him in the past on the issue of hazardous waste transportation, and have found him to be very intelligent and extremely effective. 
Before coming to work for the Senate, Mr. Hart had extensive experience in a variety of fields. He has practiced law here in Washington, D.C., taught courses at the University of Virginia and served his nation in uniform from 1965-1969. He is a scholar and a patriot. 
I commend President Clinton for such an excellent choice for Maritime Administrator and look forward to working closely with Mr. Hart as he assumes control of this critical agency. I join my colleagues in support of this nomination and am confident of Mr. Hart's prompt approval by the full Senate.

Mr. TORRICELLI. Although I have not been in this institution long, I have already discovered one thing about the Senate. Things are not often as they appear. This discussion has been almost entirely about money, what fees are paid, and who pays them. 
But in truth, this amendment is not about money, it is about power. It is about whether or not the individual American who has little or no money, cannot afford expert testimony, cannot afford to pay the fees with extensive and complex litigation, can stand in a courtroom face to face with the largest and richest, most powerful corporations in the world and get justice. 
Through almost all of the history of this Republic, we have assured that right to every American. But today, this Congress is at a point of judgment about the tobacco industry because those individual lawyers, on contingency fees, representing individual American citizens, have brought us to this point of decision. 
Make no mistake about it, Americans are dealing with the reality of health care and tobacco and the financing of our future health care as a result of a potential tobacco settlement, not because of this Congress, not because of the good graces of American industry, not because the leadership of the President, but because of the threat in courts of law that individual attorneys, on contingency fees, have found justice for individual American citizens. 
This fight is not about money. There are ample resources in any tobacco settlement. The fees would be paid. It is about whether or not this door to American justice is to be closed. And that is the decision. 
The great irony of it is, on the other side of the aisle, the party which has always claimed to represent the rights of the individual, the founding wisdom of our constitutional system, and the prerogatives of individual State governments, would be bringing this amendment at all. If it were to succeed, the Senate of the United States would be setting professional fees, a judgment that not only does not belong here but demeans the institution. The Senate of the United States would be taking prerogatives away from State governments and State attorneys general which have negotiated these decisions or made these judgments. 
The McCain legislation deals with this, in what I believe is a proper fashion, in setting arbitration panels where arbitrators can pay what expenses the lawyers had, what they had to pay, the risk they took, the time involved, and then, on a professional, informed basis, decide on proper compensation. 
Alternatively, that judgment will be made here, and on what basis? Who here knows the risks involved, what expenses were incurred, what professional judgments were required? Never in my limited experience in this institution would we be making a less informed decision. 
Mr. President, I strongly urge the defeat of this amendment. The attorneys general of this country have availed themselves of a right that individual Americans have used for generations. They made a judgment to the taxpayers of this country who could not afford to pay private attorneys the enormous fees, the enormous costs through recent years, 
to avail themselves of contingency fees to protect the taxpayers just as individual Americans have done for years. Now it is time to ensure that system worked--that freedom to remain with the individual States to reach their own final judgments. 
Finally, Mr. President, let me suggest to you this legislation is not only inappropriate for the institution, it is not only denying Americans a power of equal justice against the strong and the powerful, which they have enjoyed for generations, it is also, finally, if nothing else, patently, clearly, unequivocally unconstitutional. On what basis will the Federal Government take this judgment away from the States under the 10th amendment? And on what basis would this Congress decide to take this compensation away from individual Americans in what is clearly an unconstitutional seizure of property without compensation? 
Mr. President, this amendment is bad on a variety of bases. Collectively, it is almost unthinkable. I am very pleased that Senator Hollings and Senator Kerry have led us in the debate, and am more than a little proud that the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, on which I am proud to serve, Senator Hatch, once again, as has been his tradition, has come to the floor of this institution in the protection of the prerogative of the institution and the Constitution of the United States. 
I thank the Senator from South Carolina for yielding the time. 
I yield the remainder of my time.

Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise on an issue of great importance to me, personally, and I believe many other Members of the Senate. 
Winston Churchill once noted that nations whose sons fight and die together forever change their relationship. Seven years ago, the United States and Kuwait tragically shared this experience. The liberation of Kuwait forever changed the relationships between our two peoples. Though our cultures and the faiths of many are different, we share a sense of national independence and, I believe, a growing awareness of a burgeoning potential for democracy in Kuwait. 
It was, therefore, extremely disturbing on November 19, 1997, when several members of the Islamic faction in Parliament in Kuwait sought the ouster of the Minister of Information, Sheikh Saud Al-Nasir Al-Sabah. It did so because of an allegation that he permitted books to be displayed at a book fair which fundamentalists deemed to be offensive. Members of this Senate--indeed, many people in the administration--not only know Sheikh Saud Al-Nasir Al-Sabah well, they consider him a friend. During the darkest days of the invasion and occupation of Kuwait, he was the voice of that Nation in the United States. We trusted him. More, perhaps, than anyone we know in Kuwaiti society, he rallied support to the liberation of his country. 
These allegations against him we now recognize were little more than an effort by Islamic fundamentalists to extend their control over the Ministry of Information, which would have changed the nature of the political system in Kuwait. Judgments about Kuwait's future are for the Kuwaiti people, obviously, and entirely. But I believe as friends of that Nation who have fought and died with them, we all have a stake in the growing movement of that society for free expression. 
I know my colleagues join me with some relief and considerable pride in that in a reformed Government following this incident, Sheikh Saud Al-Nasir Al-Sabah was kept as Oil Minister. Indeed, not only did he remain in the Government, therefore, but he received a promotion. 
I know the people of Kuwait have been traumatized by this effort, through this emergence of Islamic factions within their political system, to extend their control and threaten rising elements of democracy in their society. I trust that Kuwaiti democracy will be the stronger for this experience, that the people of Kuwait will not only understand but appreciate the interests of the U.S. Senate in the political system of that country, since the concept of the government and free expression in Kuwait is so much a part of our mutual understanding for the defense of that society. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I want to thank Senator McCain and Senator Hollings for agreeing to include the Murkowski-Torricelli junk E-mail amendment to this bill. And I want to thank my distinguished colleague from Alaska for join with me in this effort. 
Last year, Senator Murkowski and I each recognized the growing threat to Internet commerce posed by the proliferation of unsolicited commercial e-mail, known by its Internet slang as `Spam.' Although we initially had somewhat different approaches to this problem, we recognized that something had to be done. 
The amendment we have today is the product of a good faith effort involving privacy groups, marketers, online service providers, and others to achieve a result that will rein in these destructive e-mail practices, while protecting the first amendment rights of all who wish to send and receive legitimate e-mail. Before I address what our amendments does, I want to briefly discuss the problem of unsolicited commercial junk e-mail. 
Junk E-mail, or so called spamming, is an unfortunate side effect of the burgeoning world of Internet communication and commerce. Like many other Americans, I have an account on America Online and am inundated with unsolicited messages, peddling every item under the sun. Similarly, I receive junk e-mail daily at my official Senate e-mail address, as well as the complaints of dozens of constituents who forward me the Spam that they are sent. 
The incentive to abuse the Internet is obvious, E-mailing ten million people can cost as little as a couple of hundred dollars. And because the senders of these e-mails are generally unknown, they avoid any possible retribution for consumers. 
Today, unsolicited commerical e-mailers are hiding their identities, falsifying their return addresses and refusing to accept complaints or removal requests. Their actions approach fraud, but our current law doesn't seem strong enough to stop them. 
I have long been concerned about excessive--indeed any--government regulation of the Internet. Many of the best qualities of American life are represented and enhanced by the Internet, and I fear government regulation has the possibility to stifle the creativity and development of cyberspace. 
However, a failure to address this problem now poses a greater threat to the Internet than do these minimal requirements. Junk e-mail is estimated to take up 30 percent of all Internet traffic and is increasingly responsible for slowdowns, and even breakdowns, of Internet services. Let me be clear, this legislation is not a de facto regulation of the Internet. In fact, it does not go as far as some have suggested. It does not ban all unsolicited e-mail because we wanted to avoid any inference of government interference. However, it is a first and needed step in making cyberspace saner. 
The Murkowski-Torricelli amendment takes some important and necessary steps. First, it requires senders of unsolicited commercial e-mail to identify themselves and provide a valid return e-mail address. Second, it requires senders to inform recipients that they have the right to reply and stop any future messages by typing `remove' on the subject line. Third, it requires junk e-mail to honor any request to remove someone from their mailing list. Fourth, it authorizes the FTC to enforce these requirements with civil fines and injunctive relief. And finally, it requires the FTC to establish a web site to accept consumer complaints and list its enforcement actions. 
Put simply, our amendment strikes a balance that will help consumers prevent unwanted and unsolicited electronic mail, without creating a burdensome regulatory system or unnecessarily restricting free speech. It recognizes that the government should not hastily and haphazardly regulate pass legislation to regulate the Internet. However, it also recognizes that some practices are simply too destructive to ignore. 
Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.

 Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today to thank our nation's Corrections Officers for their selfless dedication to rehabilitating those members of our society who have strayed from the path of the just. I would especially like to recognize the 5,500 members of the New Jersey State Corrections Officers Association whose daily work allows our children to grow in an environment unfettered by criminal elements. These courageous men and women risk their lives on a daily basis and deserve to be recognized for their efforts on our behalf. 
Although Corrections Officers play a critical role in safeguarding our communities from convicted felons, they receive very little public recognition for their work. When a felon is apprehended the police receive the credit for the arrest and the prosecuting attorney is praised for proving the felon's guilt. Juries are hailed as courageous and the judges imposing sentences are lauded for their commitment to justice. Once the trial process is completed and a felon is convicted, that person goes to prison and is forgotten by mainstream society. However, Corrections Officers are not allowed to forget because they deal with convicted felons on a daily basis. From rehabilitating to guarding those people who have forfeited their rights to live in our communities, Corrections Officers find themselves in high risk situations every day. 
In a society that believes in the fundamental importance of law and order, it is important to remember the people who help those principles flourish. By ensuring that inmates are rehabilitated before re-entering our communities, Corrections Officers are disciplinarians and teachers. They impose the will of the people while teaching criminals about the need to adhere to the law. Clearly, there are formidable obstacles to these endeavors, and I am continually impressed by the way these officers persevere in spite of the difficulties they encounter. In a criminal justice system that places an ever increasing amount of pressure on Corrections Officers to be infallible, they maintain a consistently positive and professional attitude towards their jobs. 
The men and women who work as Corrections Officers in our nation's prisons should be celebrated for their commitment to their communities. I am privileged to recognize their efforts and I encourage my colleagues to do so as well.

Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today on behalf of myself and my colleague from Georgia, Senator Coverdell, to submit a concurrent resolution expressing the sense of Congress with respect to documentation requirements for physicians who submit claims to Medicare for office visits and other evaluation and management services. 
In May of last year, the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) released revised Medicare documentation guidelines for evaluation and management (E/M) services. The guidelines were intended to provide physicians and claims reviewers advice about preparing and reviewing documentation for E/M services. They were also expected to improve the quality of medical records and continuity of patient care. 
It is clear now, nearly eight months after the guidelines were implemented, that the guidelines' intent has not been fulfilled. Rather than improving the quality of patient care, the new E/M guidelines have caused patient care to suffer. 
I have received hundreds of letters from physicians in my state of New Jersey telling me that they spend so much time trying to figure out how to bill Medicare under the new guidelines that they have little time left for their patients. There are 42 choices a physician must consider before selecting the proper E/M code for a given service. These kind of highly complicated and excessive billing guidelines force physicians to spend less time with their patients and more time on their charts. The result is a diversion of the physicians' attention away from patient care and medical decision-making. Even the American Medical Association (AMA), who helped draft the guidelines, warns that they may impose an undue burden on physicians that may detract from patient care. These concerns have prompted the AMA to commit to make changes in the guidelines that address concerns about their complexity. 
The resolution I rise to submit today expresses the sense of Congress that HCFA should postpone its plan to implement the documentation guidelines and continue consultation with physicians organizations on how to reduce the complexity of E/M guidelines. The resolution also expresses the sense of Congress that HCFA should conduct a pilot study of any documentation requirements prior to their implementation to assure that they contribute to, rather than detract from, quality patient care. 
It is well settled that adequate documentation is necessary to assure quality and appropriateness of Medicare services. It is also needed to prevent waste, fraud and abuse. However, we in Congress have a responsibility to ensure that strategies to address these issues not result in burdensome requirements that interfere with patient care.

Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I join the Senator from Virginia and, indeed, the Senator from New York, Mr. Moynihan, in each of their amendments and speak to them today. 
It is, I think, worth noting that the decision before this Senate is neither new nor without the apprehension that should come with historic experience. 
On March 31, 1939, Neville Chamberlain rose in the British Parliament and announced unambiguously, unequivocally, the British will defend the Polish frontier with the threat of war. To be certain, it was a war that inevitably was going to be fought and should have been fought. But what is instructive about the experience, as Winston Churchill later noted, `Here was a decision at last taken at the worst possible moment and on the least satisfactory ground.' 
More than a generation later, the Senate has a chance to ask all the questions that were not asked in the British Parliament on that day, because before this Senate is the most solemn question that the representatives of any free people can ever ask. 
We are pledging the good name of this country to go to war, to consume the lives of our sons and our daughters for the defense of another people. That does not mean it is a pledge that sometimes should not be made. Maybe it should be made in this instance. But there are questions that should be raised that are the foundation of the amendments offered by the Senator from Virginia, Senator Warner, and the Senator from New York, Mr. Moynihan. 
Those questions are, in my judgment, whether or not, having made this pledge, the United States and our NATO allies genuinely have the military capability, in our resources, to fulfill the obligation, whether or not the United States and our NATO allies have the political will to lend credibility to this pledge, and whether or not this promise of defense enhances or detracts from the general security of the United States and the NATO alliance. 
Let me begin, Mr. President, by addressing the question of the military feasibility of this most expansive American pledge to defend other nations since the NATO alliance itself and the Japanese-American security agreement. Indeed, this expansion of our security guarantee is based on an unspoken but a very real sense of a change in historic realities in this Chamber. It is based on the belief that Russia is weakened, an historic opportunity has arisen, and that the views of Russia are either no longer relevant or that she is without choice in this question. 
Mr. President, the current state of affairs with regard to the military and economic power of Russia is an aberration. Russia has been a great power for more than 1,000 years; and it will be a great power again. Its affairs are part of the calculus of American security and cannot be discounted. 
It is a nation of nearly 150 million people with over 6.5 million square miles of territory. It possesses 40 percent of the world's natural gas reserves and rivals any power on Earth as a source of natural resources, including petroleum. Russia is a technological leader. It is a major industrial power. And it continues, in spite of its current economic difficulties, as the only source of military technology, production and power that potentially rivals the United States. 
So, Mr. President, there may be many things uncertain about the future, but this much is certain: Russia will continue in the future to be a great power. And yet while it may not be spoken on this floor, this calculation of immediately extending the American security umbrella to Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary is based on the calculation that at some point Russia might be a threat to their frontiers, and we will provide for its defense. 
Mr. President, I know us as Americans to be an ambitious people and a confident people. But this is an extraordinary guarantee the people of the United States are extending to these three new democracies in Eastern Europe. 
No nation in history has been able to defend against the territorial ambitions of Russia when she was an imperial or in an imperialistic mode. It is worth noting, from Napoleon to the Third Reich, people have miscalculated on their abilities to deal with Russian ambitions in Eastern Europe. 
Russia was challenged in the borders of Poland by the Third Reich and 162 divisions of the Wehrmacht. We are an ambitious people, Mr. President. The U.S. Army today, 4,000 miles from our borders, has three divisions. 
What military means is it by which we are going to give credibility to this pledge? Not next year, not 10 years, not at some point in the future, but the day this treaty is signed. Three divisions, half a world away on the borders of Russia herself? 
There is, Mr. President, another irony to this military pledge related to the comments of the Senator from Texas, Mr. Gramm, in noting that in some ways the current borders of NATO are a relic of the Iron Curtain of Josef Stalin. Well, now, Mr. President, we are to draw a new line. And it may have its benefactors and its beneficiaries. But what of those nations not inside this new line? The great lesson of Yalta was that those nations that fell on the other side of the line were lost to a Stalinist equation and calculation that they were now in a new sphere of influence. 
This Senate is faced with a question of tomorrow, next month, this year, drawing a new line in Europe that may bring Poland and the Czech Republic and Hungary in, but leaves the Baltics and Romania and the Ukraine out. How would a future adversary, not in a democratic Russia but in a possible successor Government, interpret this new sphere of influence? Not as a check on ambitions but as an invitation to ambitions? 
Equally important, I believe, Mr. President, from my first, and in this instance, military review of this instance, is that we are entering ourselves again into a military calculation that for 50 years we have wanted to escape. Because if we are to make this pledge of defending these three new democracies, and we do so with three divisions of the U.S. Army and no indigenous military capability whatsoever, we are entering into, again, something which we feared and have so fought to escape. The only means of defending these governments is through atomic weapons. We are pledging unmistakably a nuclear exchange to defend the Polish frontier from possible future invasion. It is where we were during the cold war with New York for Berlin, Chicago for Paris, San Francisco for Rome. 
It is easy to make the pledge, Mr. President. The question is whether to do so without military resources is responsible. It is not simply that our own resources are insufficient. My friend, the Senator from Delaware, has drawn a parallel between this expansion and the initial NATO treaty or expansions in other instances. In this instance, we are not joining in mutual defense with the British army or the Germans or the French; we are pledging to defend Poland, whose armed forces consist of 1,700 Soviet tanks designed for the 1950s and 1960s, a Hungarian air force which will contribute to its own security 50 aging Soviet MIG fighters, and the Czech air force whose pilots fly an average of 40 hours a year in training for their own self-defense. 
The Senate can make this judgment. You can decide to extend the American security umbrella all over Eastern Europe, even though there are insufficient American forces to contribute to their defense, and rely on indigenous forces. But at least make the decision based on the reality that there are no indigenous forces. It is a military pledge without military capability. 
Second is the issue of whether or not there is the political will in the United States and in Western Europe to give this promise meaning. The NATO treaty is the most successful military alliance in history. At a time when the Soviet Union had overwhelming military means, it was the foundation of the defense of Western Europe, but it was not based on the fact that the United States signed a treaty. It was based on historic and economic realities. Through two world wars the American people had demonstrated they were prepared to defend one Europe because they believed that the security of Western Europe and the United States were inseparable. Our quality of life, our security, our economic future could not be distinguished from Great Britain, France, in the first instance, Italy and Germany and other member states at other times. 
In a free society, the President of the United States may sign a treaty pledging to defend Hungary, the Czech Republic and Poland, but if the economic realities are not such that the American people believe that our futures are indistinguishable, it is a dangerous promise because it is a hollow pledge. 
The reality is today that there may be a time when each of these republics have sufficient economic intercourse with the United States and Western Europe that we believe they are part of the Western alliance by economic and cultural and historic definition and this pledge has meaning. But no one can argue--indeed, this is the foundation of the rationale of the amendment by Senators Moynihan and Warner--no one can argue that that reality is true today. 
Total economic intercourse with the Czech Republic today is .09 percent of American exports.

Mr. TORRICELLI. I thank the Senator from Virginia. 
Mr. President, no one can argue that we have reached that state of economic dependency at the moment. That is the rationale of the delay, to allow these bonds to form and to give this pledge meaning. 
Finally, the foundation of American security in this generation and as far as the eye can see is the Russian-American relationship. Any judgment we make which enhances Russian democracy enhances American security. Most fundamental to this debate is the fact that Eastern Europe and the NATO alliance's first line of defense is the Russian ballot box. If Russia is democratic and capitalistic and free, Eastern Europe is secure. If it is not, no force on Earth is going to defend the Ukraine, the Baltics, or even these republics. 
I believe strongly this pledge and this NATO expansion will be enhanced by both of these amendments. I accept the reality that NATO is going to be expanded, but I believe it is a more responsible judgment if we address these questions, allow for this delay. I believe it would lead to a better expansion of NATO, and we would be pleased and proud that we made these exceptions. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, like the Senator from Virginia, my remarks are not based on a belief that the cause and reasons for NATO have expired. Quite the contrary. My concern is that whatever we do in the expansion of NATO has real credibility. I raise the military question of whether or not the Polish frontier is defendable with this pledge, simply because of this: It never has been. 
There is not a historical basis by which the ambitions of an imperial Russia has ever been checked, nor will we. I, too, believe that Poland should be defended. 
I will vote for NATO expansion, but under the amendment offered by the Senator from Virginia and the Senator from New York, they are suggesting a strategy whereby the political and economic bounds be given meaning, or there be time. It is not an honest assessment of the situation of the people of Poland to tell them that three American divisions with no indigenous forces are going to be positioned to defend them against a revitalized, or ambitious future Russia. It is not an accurate situation. 
If this is worth doing, it is worth doing with real resources based on a real assessment of costs, based on bonds that have meaning, not over a period of time. It is based on that realistic military situation that I join with the Senator from Virginia. I, too, like the Senator from Delaware and the Senator from Virginia, believe the United States will stand by its credibility and its pledges in each of these instances. But it is one thing to do it; it is another thing to do it contrary to historic experience, or military reality. 
I thank the Senator from Delaware for yielding me the time so I could clarify my views.

Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I thank Senator Coverdell for yielding the time and for his very gracious comments and, very importantly for the country and for the States, his extraordinary leadership on this issue. 
Mr. President, I will concede that when this debate began I believed we were entering upon something very important, that after years of fooling ourselves about the quality of education in America, the Senate was about to undertake a broad and comprehensive debate--indeed, a discussion that could last not simply for this year or this Congress but through the decade--about how we fundamentally reform education in America, a debate in which everything was relevant and all subjects and proposals would come forward but one, and that is the defense of the status quo, because if there is one aspect of American life today that cannot in its entirety be defended, it is the quality of education that we are giving our children. 
The process of education in America today stands like a dagger at the heart of this country. It is time to speak the truth to parents and children alike, because it is not simply that the education of our country is not of a quality to compete, the problem is more fundamental--because many parents, working hard, paying their taxes, helping their children, believe they are being educated to world-class standards when they are not. 
The simple answer to the question, what can be said about the future of a country where one-third of its students may enter the work force functionally illiterate, 40 percent of fourth graders cannot meet minimum standards of math, 40 percent of eight graders cannot read at basic levels, the simple truth is a country that is teaching its children to those standards has a very limited economic future and cannot maintain its current quality of life or perhaps even social stability. 
That is the sad truth about our country today. And so I believed that when Senator Coverdell brought this legislation forward, we would be laying the foundation for an extensive debate about what we do about private and parochial schools, what we do about the public schools, that we would incorporate the best of President Clinton's ideas and that of the Democratic and Republican leadership and set out an agenda to carry us through the years in this great debate. 
It was sadly, it appears, Mr. President, not to be. There are aspects about the Coverdell legislation that have been said so many times and yet it is as if those who do not agree simply do not want to hear. 
Among those, sadly, I must say, my friend and a man that I admire as much as any in this country, the President of the United States, Bill Clinton. I heard the President yesterday say this is another form of a voucher, it is support for the wealthy, it is an abandonment of the public schools. 
It is worth stating one more time before this debate concludes so, no matter what the vote and however people may choose to cast their votes, we understand the simple truth. No one ever contended that the Coverdell legislation was an answer for every problem of education in America. If you are voting for it because you believe in one vote you solve all problems, you will not only be disappointed but you will be dishonest in casting your vote. It is one idea to deal with one set of problems. It does these things. But not as its critics have contended. 
Last year this Senate voted to establish savings accounts for college educations. In that instance, as on this day, we did not want this benefit to go to the wealthy alone. With limited resources, we wanted this benefit to go to middle-income people and working families. So we established income limits, $160,000 for a family, $110,000 for a single parent. Those are the same limits that are in this bill. If you came to this floor last year establishing savings accounts for college, believing you were targeting these resources to the middle-income people--and you did--on this day you have the same chance with the same limits of providing the same opportunity to the same families. This is a middle-income program. Yet it is argued this is just another form of a voucher. 
Senator Coverdell and I differ on the question of vouchers. He supports them. I do not. In either case, this is not a voucher. A voucher is a system whereby you take a drawing right upon Government money and you transfer that money from a public school to a private school. Under the Coverdell proposal, all the money being made available is your money. It is a family's savings, not the Government's. The public schools will not receive one dime less, not one dime less because we establish these accounts. All we are using, or allowing to be used, is the family's own money. 
At the end of the day, as Members of the Senate come to this floor to cast their votes, the issue is really more simple than it might otherwise appear. Senator Coverdell's proposal will provide a net increase over these years of $12 billion in new resources for American education, public and private. Who among us, knowing the test scores of our students, the quality of their instruction, the challenge to our country, would argue that this $12 billion should not be made available when it draws nothing from the Treasury, puts no restraint upon our resources, but simply allows families to join the fight for a quality education? 
Now the question arises, of that $12 billion, what else does it bring? Because, you see, not only is it not drawing upon Government resources but it draws upon another powerful idea. Through most of the life of this country, the education of a family, a child, a whole generation, was not seen as the responsibility of a school board or a government alone. It was grandparents and aunts and uncles, employers, a whole community was part of educating a child. Somehow, through the years, education became a government issue alone. The government will always be central to education, in raising the resources and hiring teachers and assuring quality, but part of the genius of 
this proposal is that through these savings accounts, on every holiday, on every birthday, on every occasion, aunts, uncles, grandparents, employers, labor unions, churches, can also put their money in these accounts to help educate these children. It is an invitation to the American family and community to get back into the process of educating American children. 
Yet, it is argued, those who may now concede maybe it doesn't just go to the wealthy, and maybe after this final argument they will concede maybe it is not government money, maybe it doesn't hurt the public schools--but what does it do for most American students who have these accounts? It bears repeating, because it goes to the heart of the issue of educational quality. I hope these accounts allow us to maintain a system of private education--be they Yeshivas or private or parochial schools, so parents have a legitimate choice of where to send their children. That choice and that competition has served America well in every other aspect of American life. I doubt it is a complication and I doubt it will fail to provide quality in education, as it does in all other areas of American life. 
But the fact of the matter is, too, these accounts are not just about maintaining a private school system in the country free of constitutional challenge by not using government money. The simple truth is, 90 percent of the students in America go to public school. We cannot begin to deal with issues of educational quality unless we also deal with public schools. Simply because most of these students go to public schools, by logic most of this money will go to public school students. The Joint Committee on Taxation has informed the Congress that 70 percent of this money, 70 percent of the beneficiaries of this money, will be public school students. Because under the proposal of Senator Coverdell, this money is available not simply for tuition to private schools, but after-school activities: Transportation after school, the hiring of tutors, home computers, books, software. 
It is an acknowledgment that education in the 21st century is not any longer just about a teacher, a desk, and a student. Learning will take place throughout the day, throughout the year, in many avenues of learning. How many middle-class and working-class families in America can afford to buy home computers, pay the cost of hiring a public school teacher to teach in the evening or after school when a child is having trouble with her studies? How many can buy the software so a student can do the research? How many can afford the after-school transportation, the uniforms, the athletic equipment, things that a generation ago as students we took for granted? They are not available anymore. Or they weren't necessary then, like tutors or home computers. But they are necessary now. 
For those who come to the floor and argue about the social justice of it, whether or not this is being made available to the broad majority of Americans, consider this. There is a new dividing line in America of opportunity and it is access to knowledge and education. Mr. President, 60 percent of American families do not have home computers. Their ability to research, to write, to learn when they are not in school, to be competitive, is being compromised. Public education, the great leveler in America, can have two tiers--those families who have money for these ancillary purchases and those who do not; those who can afford tutors and those who do not, to participate in advanced math and science. 
Under the Coverdell proposal, these accounts are available to ensure that those 60 percent of Americans who do not have access to this technology can buy it through these accounts. Indeed, it is worse than it appears on its face. In the minority communities, 85 percent of African American families do not have access to home computers. This is an opportunity, it is an avenue where many of these families--admittedly not all--many families can save their own money to prepare their students. 
Yet it will be argued by people of good faith who genuinely care about education, who will come to this floor and argue that, well, it may do those things, some students in the public schools may get home computers, some may get tutors, and in the private schools some working families may be able to keep their children in schools who couldn't do it otherwise, but it won't help everybody, it won't help a third of the students, 20 percent of the students, 10 percent of the students. They could not be more right. I have not heard Senator Coverdell argue, and certainly this Senator has not argued, that this is a prescription that will help every student in every way in every educational problem in America. 
I challenge one Senator to come to this floor with one idea that will do that. This is a single idea, not the last idea. It may not even be the best idea, but it is an idea that does help the problem of education in America. Let me address that for a moment, if I can, frankly in a partisan sense. 
For many years, members of my party proudly have been able to contend that the issue of education in America, in access and in quality, belonged to the Democratic Party. Indeed, from student loans to student lunches, title I through the vast array of 40 years of education programs, much of those programs were authored by Democrats in this Congress. It is one of the things that led me proudly to be a member of the Democratic Party. 
But if at this late date in our Nation dealing with our education problems we are about to engage in a partisan competition, if there is to be an upward spiral of competition in ideas for who can serve the cause of quality education, then it is a debate not only worthy of the country, but important for our future. 
Education savings accounts need be neither a Republican nor a Democratic idea. Last year in establishing such accounts for college, they were authored by President Clinton himself. This year, Senator Lieberman, Senator Breaux, Senator Biden, myself, and others have joined in this effort with Senator Coverdell to establish these accounts. This does not mean that we subscribe to the notion that this is a replacement for either the President's program or other proposals. Indeed, I began my remarks today by stating some profound disappointment. This legislation is worthy of being passed. It would be better if Senator Carol Moseley-Braun's legislation for school construction were included. With two-thirds of American schools in fundamental disrepair, needing serious construction, the Federal Government should be involved, and the President's proposal, as advanced by the Senator from Illinois, should be included. 
Senator Kennedy's proposal, in advancing the proposal of President Clinton for 100,000 new teachers to reduce class size to 18, should be included. Senator Levin's proposal for technology training for teachers would better prepare our schools and should be included. Senator Murray's proposal for class size; Senator Boxer's proposal for after-school activities. 
I am going to support Senator Coverdell's proposal, because I believe it is a worthwhile contribution, but I also concede this: This Senate could have done better. We may be addressing one important proposal and making one valuable contribution, but we could have made many valuable contributions. We could have made this genuinely bipartisan and further advance the cause of quality education. 
Finally, let me say that on this day when the vote is complete, I will join with Senator Lieberman, Senator Cleland, Senator Breaux, and others in a letter to the majority leader, because it is still not too late to have this educational debate be genuinely bipartisan to avoid a confrontation with President Clinton and to achieve something real in the process of education reform. 
The majority has the power in the conference committee to maintain its provisions to eliminate voluntary Federal testing standards across the country. The majority will have the votes and the power in the conference committee to impose block grants on the Department of Education under the title. That power 
exists, but it will not lead to the cause of bipartisanship or more comprehensive education reform. It will ensure a Presidential veto, frustrate those of us who have fought for education savings accounts, and deadlock this Senate in further consideration of improving educational quality in the United States. 
I urge the majority leader in the conference committee to use his influence to have those provisions removed, to allow Senator Coverdell's proposal to stand on its merits in which we can privately engage in a conversation with the President and convince him in one of the great ironies of this debate. Senator Coverdell's proposals are not only consistent with President Clinton's goals for education in America, they, indeed, spring from the same roots as his own programs last year for college education. 
Finally, I want to state my great admiration for Senator Coverdell, his tenacity and his creativity in having brought the Senate to this point. I know he must share my disappointment in that all of our optimism for bipartisanship, our hope for a thorough educational debate in which we could have engaged in a competition of how together we could improve the quality of our schools rather than having sought partisan advantage--it has been a disappointment, but we make progress where we can, remembering Edison's words that discontent is a necessary element in progress. We have had our share of discontent. Senator Coverdell, in the passage of his legislation, will at least have a share of progress as well. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. TORRICELLI. I thank Senator Hutchison, thank for setting aside this time today, and for her leadership on this issue in the Senate. I certainly share your support for making same-gender education available to more parents and their children. The benefits of same-gender education have been demonstrated in the context of private and parochial schools, and the evidence is strong that these same benefits await public education, if the legal uncertainty surrounding this issue were lifted. 
That is why I was pleased to support your amendment--to allow schools to move forward with same-gender programs, if they deem appropriate, and not with the fear that by doing so they risk losing federal financial support. Nevertheless, during the debate on your amendment, concern was raised as to the legal status and impact of your amendment, and some claimed your amendment allowing same-gender education funding could lead to discrimination against one sex or the other. Could you please elaborate as to why you believe that your amendment complies with both Title IX of the 1964 Civil Rights Act and the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment?

 Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today to commemorate the 83d anniversary of the Armenian genocide. On this sad occasion, my thoughts and sympathies are with the Armenian people as they remember the horrors of the events 83 years ago. 
It is with a great sense of sorrow that we mark the 83d year since the tragic genocide and exile of the Armenian people. The senseless murder and expulsion of 1.5 million Armenians through a staged campaign of the Turkish Ottoman Empire has been one of the most sobering events in modern history. The Armenian Genocide has the uneviable distinction of being the first genocide in the 20th century. This fact alone underscores the seriousness of the events between 1915 and 1918, and it should remind us of the need to keep all those who perished during the Genocide alive in our memory. 
We pause now to ensure that the Armenian Genocide will never slip into the recesses of history. While humankind has the ability to sponsor acts of great kindness and sacrifice, we also have the capacity for great evil. Along with the Holocaust, the Armenian Genocide signifies our ability to promote evil, but if we close our eyes to the tragedies of the past, we risk the chance of repeating them in the future. 
Sadly, the Armenian American community has its roots in the Armenian Genocide. Many individuals living here in the United States either lost family members at the hands of the Ottomans, or are survivors themselves. They have risen above adversity to become prominent and successful citizens despite a tragic past. The Armenian American community has been vocal in expressing its anguish about the Genocide. It is my hope that their perseverance in marking this event each year, as well as our own efforts here in the United States Senate, will be enough to allow us to remember the lessons of the Genocide. We are constantly forced to relearn the effects of evil unchecked, but I hope, in this case, we will be guided to a better future.

 Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today to salute Schoor DePalma Engineers and Design Professional Firm as it completes its thirtieth year in business, and to recognize its contributions to the State of New Jersey. This engineer and design professional firm has contributed to some of the state's largest engineering and design projects. 
Schoor DePalma is one of the most widely recognized civil engineering firms in the State of New Jersey. The company's ingenuity brings forth a superior level of accountability, concern, and quality of work. 
Schoor DePalma's commitment is easily also recognized through its selfless involvement with the community through entities, such as the Board of Professional Planners and the Board of Professional Engineers of the State of New Jersey and its participation in highly regarded academic programs such as the Board of Overseers for the New Jersey Institute of Technology, a variety of college foundations throughout New Jersey, and the awarding of scholarships to students in the engineering field. 
One of Schoor DePalma's most recent and profitable contributions to the State of New Jersey was to enhance the economically distressed community of East Orange. Schoor DePalma was hired to conduct a comprehensive business analysis of the six main business districts of East Orange by looking at crime statistics, the labor force, the mix of businesses, infrastructure, and streetscaping needs. Schoor DePalma's innovative blue print for economic growth proved to be successful when some local establishments saw a remarkable 50 percent increase in business. 
I am proud to recognize Schoor DePalma as a model corporate neighbor and I look forward to another 30 years of excellence from them.

 Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the Political Science Department at Kean University. Over the past twenty years, Kean's Political Science Department has produced an outstanding record of accomplishment and I am pleased to recognize this model program. 
The faculty and administration of Kean's Political Science Department have consistently demonstrated their selfless commitment to furthering the intellectual growth of the University's students. Kean's balanced educational program presents students with a unique blend of experiential learning and classroom teaching. It is a model of excellence for all American universities. 
Kean's Political Science Department has earned just recognition by offering challenging participatory programs like the American Israel Public Affairs Conference, the Center for the Study of the Presidency's Student Symposium, the Harvard Model United Nations Program, the Howard University Simulation of the Organization of African Unity, the Schering-Plough/Kean College Political Science Education Partnership, the Washington Program, and the annual Department Washington DC Student Workshop. 
In an era of decreasing funding, program costs are met through contributions from outside sources, student groups and alumni. The University itself provides enormous scholarship support. As a result of the Political Science Department's dedicated efforts, little cost need be borne by its student participants. 
I am pleased to join the New Jersey State Legislature in honoring the Kean University Political Science Department as a model of educational virtuosity. It is my sincere hope that the Department continues its tradition of excellence with the vigor and success that has characterized it for the past twenty years.

Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I would like to begin by acknowledging Senator Santorum's efforts on this amendment. I look forward to working with him in the future to preserve our nation's most vulnerable farmland. 
We have heard a lot during the last decade about the dissolution and destruction of the American Family Farm. Indeed, the family farm is under serious threat of extinction. Today, there are 1,925,300 farms in the United States, the lowest number of farms in our nation since before the Civil War. The U.S. is losing two acres of our best farmland to development every minute of every day. In my state, New Jersey, we have lost 6,000 farms, or 40% of our total, since 1959. This reduction has serious implications for the environment, the economy and our food supply. 
The threat comes partially from an anachronistic and unfair inheritance tax that threatens the generational continuity of the family farm, and partially from the fact that much of America's farmland is near major cities. As our cities sprawl into neighboring rural areas, our farms are in danger of becoming subdivisions or shopping malls. 
Last year I strongly supported a significant reduction in the estate tax to keep farms in the family, preserve open space and ensure fairness in our tax code. This was an important victory for farmers across the nation. However, we also need programs like the Farmland Protection Program to reinforce this effort. That is why I am supporting Senator Santorum's amendment which will express the Sense of the Senate that Congress should reauthorize funds for the Farmland Protection Program. This critical program is designed to protect soil by encouraging landowners to limit conversion of their farmland to nonagricultural uses. 
The Farmland Protection Program was authorized by the 1996 Farm Bill and provided $35 million over a six year period. However, the last of the funding was dispersed in FY1998 and there is no money in the budget for the program this year. This amendment will send a strong message that we remain committed to protecting our family farms and preserving our open spaces. I am proud to support Senator Santorum's amendment, and look forward to its acceptance by my colleagues.

Mr. TORRICELLI. I thank the Chair. 
Mr. President, there is a significant chance that this Senate will one day be remembered for having finally begun to address the problems of educational quality in America. President Clinton in his State of the Union Address challenged this Congress to deal with the problems of school construction, class size, and competence. We are now taking up that challenge, and, indeed, in the last few weeks in dealing with the Coverdell-Torricelli proposal, we also address the problem of access to private schools and the rights of families to save money privately to deal with the costs of public and private education. 
Today we return to the subject again. Senator Carol Moseley-Braun of Illinois, as she has on many occasions, is now bringing forward consistently and repeatedly a message to deal with the plight--the construction of our schools. 
I recognize that in this Senate almost everyone has an idea to deal with the problems of education in America. Almost everyone is 
right except those who think they have the only idea. This problem is so serious in quality and in access that it will require not just this Senate but Congresses to come, not just this idea but many ideas. The quality of education in this country is the most serious threat to the maintenance of not only social order but our quality of life. We recognize it has many components but probably none more difficult than rebuilding our Nation's schools. 
It is estimated that it could cost $112 billion to rebuild crumbling schools in America. 
Having toured many of these schools in my own State of New Jersey, I have seen students sitting in hallways because there was not enough room. I have seen students with buckets next to their desks to catch the rain, students who did not have restrooms in their own school facilities but were sent to other buildings. Our parents and their parents before them worked and saved and sacrificed to build a system of public education in this country and an infrastructure that was without equal in the world. They met that challenge. The simple and regrettable truth is we have not. 
This system of education, which more than anything else in the Nation is the foundation for our country's prosperity, is crumbling around us. One-third of the students in the Nation face exactly the plight that I have outlined, and more will join them unless we stand up to this challenge. 
To all of you who are part of the efforts to assure there is access to the Internet, who joined with us in the fight to help private and public savings through Coverdell-Torricelli, who believe in testing, who join any of these fights, join this fight because there is no one front in the war dealing with educational quality in America. It must be fought on all fronts at the same time. 
I am very proud to be part of the efforts of the Senator from Illinois, Carol Moseley-Braun, who more than anyone else has brought this fight forward and will be principally responsible when we ultimately do succeed. 
I thank the Senator for yielding the time.

 Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Leonard Stern for receiving the 25th Anniversary Recognition Award from the Meadowlands Regional Chamber of Commerce. 
Mr. Stern has been a pioneer in New Jersey's real estate industry and has been crucial to the State's resurgent real estate market. From investing in the New Jersey Meadowlands to Jersey City's waterfront, Mr. Stern's ventures have greatly improved both the health of the economy and the environment in northern New Jersey. By providing jobs and improving infrastructure, Mr. Stern's commercial property has improved the general welfare of the region and has helped prepare it for the challenges of the approaching century. 
For over forty years, Mr. Stern has worked to enhance our premier educational institutions. In 1961, he founded the Albert Einstein School of Medicine at Yeshivah University. He established the Presidential Scholars Program at New York University to provide scholarships for qualifying students of all races and creeds. In addition, he has provided invaluable assistance to New York University's School of Business, the Max Stern Regional College, the Max Stern Athletic Center at Yeshiva University and the Manhattan Day School. Mr. Stern's many awards and citations are a testament to his activism within these academic communities. 
Leonard Stern's exemplary record of service sets a certain standard for which all Americans should strive. I applaud his efforts and encourage all Americans to follow his example.

Mr. TORRICELLI. I have an amendment at the desk. 
</TEXT>
</DOC>

<DOC>
<DOCNO>105-torricelli-nj-2-19980326</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I asked that this amendment be read in its entirety so that its simplicity is clear to the Senate. The totality of what is being asked is that the Justice Department, in negotiating with the W.R. Grace Corporation about a contaminated Superfund site in Wayne, NJ, seek fair reimbursement. We make no demands. We change no law. We cite no number. We ask that there be a fair reimbursement. 
I have done this because the story of W.R. Grace and its contamination in Wayne, NJ, is a story of everything that has been wrong about environmental cleanups in our country. Since 1995 the Federal Government, has been in negotiations with W.R. Grace for reimbursements. This is a site that a private company operated for 23 years. They operated it at a profit. The Government owned no share of the land or the company. When the land was no longer useful because it was contaminated, they abandoned it and left. In the ensuing years, they have given the U.S. Government $800,000, although the U.S. taxpayers have already spent $50 million cleaning the site. It is estimated by the Army Corps of Engineers it could cost another $55 million. 
Members of the Senate need to know the American taxpayers are being held accountable for $100 million in cleaning this contaminated site by the W.R. Grace Corporation and that corporation has paid only $800,000. The American taxpayers are paying this freight although they have absolutely no liability whatever as a matter of law. 
For 24 months, there have been negotiations. There had been reports that there would be $50 million in reimbursements from W.R. Grace. Then it was $40 million. Last week it was $20 million. There was going to be an agreement by December. And then it was January. And then it was March. 
There is no agreement. There is no reimbursement. But the people of this country are going to subsidize the environmental abuses of the W.R. Grace Corporation to the tune of $100 million. It is a disgrace. 
For 18 months, the Attorney General of the United States does not have time to reach an agreement. A Member of Congress from the district, Mr. Pascrell, Senator Lautenberg, and I have urged the Attorney General to proceed to litigation. She has not done so. She did not have time to litigate or to protect the taxpayers. But within 5 minutes of the filing of this amendment, she can send a letter to Senator Gregg that this is an interference with her prerogatives. 
Mr. President, if the Attorney General were protecting her prerogatives and protecting the liability of the U.S. Government and the taxpayers of this country, this amendment would not be necessary. I have a great admiration for Attorney General Reno. I like to believe and assume she has no knowledge of this affair, that members of her staff have done an enormous disservice to her, to the Justice Department, and to the taxpayers of this country. As it stands, if suit is not filed, if negotiators are not emboldened, the taxpayers of this country will subsidize a private corporation for $100 million of unnecessary expenditures. 
I understand that, ironically, members of the majority party will rise to the defense of the Attorney General and her prerogatives, which in this Congress is indeed a historic turn of events, to defend the Attorney General in this instance, that she should be allowed to pursue this without our interference or oversight. 
Mr. President, the Attorney General has her responsibility and we have ours. It is her judgment whether to file a suit and to conduct the negotiations. But when those negotiations are concluded, it is this Congress that must appropriate the money to meet the settlement. 
All that I have done is offer a sense of the Senate--not a law, a sense of the Senate--that we would like the Attorney General to vigorously pursue these negotiations and protect the interests of the taxpayers. That is all I have asked. I do not know how the request could have been more modest. I intend to reserve the balance of my time, because it is my interest to hear the distinguished chairman respond to this request, but I want simply to say before we hear his comments that I am personally offended at the Attorney General's correspondence and deeply disappointed at its tone, its lack of cooperation, and the failure to meet the responsibilities to defend the interests of this Government in this litigation. 
I reserve the remainder of my time.

Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, recognizing the views of my friend, the Senator from Alaska, the distinguished chairman of the committee, and the Senator from New Hampshire, I will not insist upon the amendment. 
Let me conclude the debate by simply suggesting this: I think it would be regrettable if this Senate ever allows itself to be silenced in simply expressing its intentions or desires because the executive branch may have conflicting views or believe an issue is its prerogative. Ultimately, the expenditures of this Government are our responsibility. 
So I want the Attorney General to be clear on this. I will shortly ask that this amendment not proceed. But this should be clear as negotiations proceed with the W.R. Grace Corporation. If it is the intention of the Justice Department to reach a settlement, whereby the taxpayers of the United States are left with this $100 million expenditure and a private corporation, which has profited by these operations, and the resulting environmental abuse, is left without making a significant contribution, I most assuredly will return to the floor of the Senate with an amendment on an appropriations bill that would cover the payment of those expenditures, and I will insist on a vote, and I will fight. I do not believe the taxpayers of this country should be subsidizing polluters. I will not stand for it. Nevertheless, in deference to my friends and colleagues from Alaska and New Hampshire, in recognition of their views, at this time I ask unanimous consent to withdraw the amendment.

Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, as Senators rise to address things that have been added to the supplemental appropriations bill, I, quite the contrary, rise in recognition of something significant that has not been added to the supplemental appropriations bill. It is one of those few instances where there is a genuine achievement by the Senate in failing to act. 
It had earlier been suggested that an amendment might be offered to prohibit the FCC from using its powers to order a reduction in the cost of television advertising in political campaigns. This legislation does not contain that provision. In my judgment, it affords the FCC an extraordinary opportunity to take the lead in campaign finance reform. 
Mr. President, on 117 occasions in this decade, the U.S. Senate has considered, voted, and failed to implement fundamental campaign finance reform. This Senate has continued that unfortunate tradition. But now the Senate has an opportunity to help the process of political reform in the United States and to renew confidence in the institutions of Government and the political process itself by doing something for which it should be fully capable. They need do nothing. 
Yesterday, the new and very able chairman of the FCC, Chairman Kennard, announced that he would commence a notice of inquiry, which is an information-gathering process, to lead to a ruling on free air time. This could be the most significant achievement for campaign finance reform in the United States in 25 years, because fundamental to the problem of campaign fundraising in the United States is the cost of campaign television advertising. President Clinton and Senator Dole, in the last Presidential campaign, spent two-thirds of all the money they raised to purchase television advertising time from the commercial networks. Some U.S. Senate campaigns, including my own, spent over 80 percent of their resources on television advertising. 
Mr. President, it makes no sense that candidates for Federal office in the United States spend so much of their time traveling around the country meeting with contributors, raising money, instead of meeting with voters, addressing real concerns in their States, because they need to raise millions of dollars to purchase federally licensed air time that belongs to the people of this country. This air. 
Time does not belong to the networks; it belongs to us, the people of this country. It is only licensed and it is given on condition. One of those conditions should be to be responsible in aiding the public debate. 
I supported the McCain-Feingold legislation, and I know some of my colleagues, like Senator McConnell, did not. But, rightfully, Senator McConnell did note something with which I strongly agreed--that the United States does not need less political debate; it needs more political debate to address our serious problems, to discuss our differences. This is the one means by which we can reduce the cost of running for political office and this threshold price of inquiry, of entering into the political process, and still enhance and expand political debate. 
Mr. President, it is a considerable achievement that this supplemental appropriations bill does not prohibit the FCC from acting in this instance. I hope that continues to be the stance of this Congress and that Chairman Kennard moves beyond this level of inquiry, genuinely adjusting and changing permanently the cost of television advertising. It is not too late for this Congress to move beyond the complaining, the infighting, the inquiries of the last Federal election and institute genuine reform. It is not too late, but it is getting late. And this may be the last opportunity. 
I am very pleased, Mr. President, that this legislation has remained silent on this issue and that this last lingering hope of reform remains alive. 
I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today to address a crisis facing our youngest citizens. Physical inactivity among our children is threatening the very foundation of the health of our nation. Physical inactivity and poor diet together account for at least 300,000 deaths in the United States each year. Only tobacco use contributes to more preventable deaths. More than 58 million American adults, one third of the population, are overweight or obese. Even more alarming, childhood obesity rates are rising with 22 percent of children now overweight, a percentage that has doubled in the past 30 years. 
This growing trend of inactivity is especially dangerous for our younger generations. According to the National Center for Health Statistics, nearly half of our young people aged 12-21 do not engage in vigorous physical activity on a regular basis. In fact, only 22 percent of American children are physically active for the recommended 30 minutes each day and nearly 15 percent are completely inactive. As the Centers for Disease Control point out, these destructive behaviors established during youth are likely to extend into adulthood. We must be proactive in setting a positive example for our children and stop the negative behavior before it starts. 
To plant the seed for a healthy future, we must continue to cultivate and educate our children. Fostering enjoyment of exercise in our adolescents will spur them to maintain a healthy lifestyle into adulthood. The result will be fewer physical and mental disorders and increased productivity. As Dr. C. Everett Koop recently pointed out `this is not an issue requiring additional fact-finding before action is taken.' The time for action is now. 
A national commitment to lifetime fitness must be fostered. Congress has the opportunity and the responsibility to step forward and take a crucial leadership role. Several programs are currently addressing this important issue but they need our active support: the CDC's National Physical Activity Initiative, the President's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports, C. Everett Koop's `Shape Up America' campaign, the YMCA's Healthy Kids Day, and most recently, the National Sporting Good Association's `Wannabe Cool, Gottabe Active' campaign. 
These programs, and others like them, need our encouragement, our gratitude and our support. That is why I am here today. To submit a resolution declaring the last week in April National Youth Fitness Week. Together we can reverse the trend in physical inactivity and restore our nation to a course of wellness, fitness and productivity. It is our responsibility as the nation's leaders to ensure a healthy America.

Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from New Jersey for yielding me the time and, more than that, for his leadership, tirelessly, month after month, in bringing this issue of savings accounts to the Senate and now, I believe, to acceptance. 
I have noted in the debate to date, Senators have offered a perspective that they have other ideas that would enhance educational quality in our country. 
People believe they may have better ideas. People have other suggestions and approaches. In large measure, they all have merit. Neither Senator Coverdell nor I argue that this is exclusively the only approach in improving educational quality in our country. But it is an idea and it is a worthwhile idea. Critics are right that the country also must, as the President has suggested, rebuild America's schools. We need additional teachers, we need to reduce class size, and I believe we need to do voluntary testing. The President's proposals and those of our Democratic and Republican colleagues all have merit. A+ savings accounts are not designed to replace those ideas, and they are not instead of other suggestions. But this is a beginning, and it is an important beginning. 
A+ savings accounts, under Coverdell-Torricelli, will bring $12 billion of new educational resources for the classrooms of America, in public and private schools. It is not a diversion of current public resources, as might be the case with vouchers. These are new resources. It isn't Government money at all. These are the funds of private American families who are given a new avenue to use their own money to enhance the quality of public or private education. It is resources where we need them the most. It is estimated that 75 percent of all of these resources through educational savings accounts will go to families who earn $70,000 per year or less--families who are struggling the most to provide their children with quality education. Yet, Senators will come to the floor and argue that this money continues to go to a privileged few. What privileged few in America earn $50,000, $60,000 or $70,000 a year and pay the tuition or the ancillary cost of public education on one, two, or three children? 
Other Senators will argue that the money should be going exclusively to public schools. Well, according to the Joint Committee on Taxation, it's estimated that 70 percent of the actual funds placed in these savings accounts will go to public school students because not only are these resources available for private tuition at parochial schools, yeshivas, and other private institutions, they are also available for the ancillary cost of public education. What parent in America today, recognizing how students are struggling with advanced science, new math, the more complexities of rising educational standards that we are trying to impose on America's schools from our school boards and local governments, does not recognize that this complexity requires additional instruction? Educational savings accounts are the only means that we are offering American families, through any program, to hire tutors, to get teachers after school, pay them additional resources to get their time to help American students compete and to learn. 
It is the only program designed by anyone that I know to deal with the fact that even some of our best public schools are canceling after-school activities, after-school transportation, extracurricular activities, which are such a vital part of American education. These savings accounts will make this money available to pay for those activities. 
I believe that A+ savings accounts can be the beginning of a revolution in American education, where Senators will succeed in coming to the floor, as the President has suggested, and offering legislation to rebuild our schools, where others will succeed in ensuring that there is voluntary testing that will renew the standards and quality of American instruction. A+ savings accounts could be the beginning of that revolution in American education. 
We offer this to supplant no other idea, as a replacement for no other initiative, but that it stand on its own merits. At a time when American families are struggling to prepare their students for a new generation, the difference between success or failure, a quality of life or a struggle of life, can be simply defined by the quality of the access to an education. Who here can argue that parents should not be able to use their own resources, for which they work every day, to save funds to help in a private or a public education? 
I believe, Mr. President, that in the final analysis, as the 
years pass and as we look back on this proposal, we will realize that we have awaken in America a tremendous resource--because A+ savings accounts would not only provide this opportunity to American families, but something much larger--to get the American family involved again in the process of education. 
Imagine a system where on a child's birthday, or on Christmas, on Easter, on any anniversary in our religious or civic calendars, aunts, uncles, grandparents, would provide money as a gift to go into a savings account to help a child with their public or private education. We are inviting the extended American family back into the business of education when for so long people believed that education was a problem of the Government or, at best, a mother and father, but still believe that they cared about these children who were their nieces, nephews, or grandchildren. This is a vehicle to get involved. If that is true of the extended family, it's true of others as well. 
I have noted in this debate before the potential where labor unions could go to the negotiating table and ask not just for health benefits, or retirement, or pay increases, but ask every month in every paycheck that $5, $10, or $50 be placed in a child's savings account as part of a labor agreement; where corporations compete for labor in America not just on wages but say to their employees, `if you work for our company, we will contribute to your savings account to help a child.' 
The potential here is enormous. But it begins with a single step, and that is to establish these accounts. I know many of my colleagues who are still wondering about their position on this legislation have many questions. I want you to consider this one, as well, because I recognize that this proposal is controversial. Many of my colleagues who have doubts about it stood on the Senate floor a year ago and enthusiastically supported educational savings accounts--accounts to help parents deal with the rising, and sometimes insurmountable, burden of college tuition. It is believed that under this savings account proposal we could quadruple the amount of money available for college tuitions, because every dollar placed in these savings accounts for public and private secondary education can be rolled into a college savings account if not used by the 12th grade. So if for no other reason you do not join us today in Coverdell-Torricelli, but you believed last year in educational savings accounts for college tuition, you should be joining with us today. 
Finally, Mr. President, I offer this: Of all the divisions in American life, of race, or poverty, or opportunity, the one this country cannot afford in the next century is to create a caste system of knowledge. Yet, that threat is arising in America: two distinct classes of American citizens, one that enjoys unlimited opportunity and the other mired in the past, in poverty, without hope or opportunity. That division is knowledge. Where parents do not feel the public school can adequately prepare their child, they should have a private school option. 
I agree that we cannot afford, at a time when our public schools are not adequately financed, to divert public resources. That is why I have opposed vouchers. But this is another opportunity to provide that private school option with a family's own money. 
But ending this division of knowledge requires something else, too. The classroom experience will never be enough in the next century to prepare American students to compete in the world. It will never be sufficient. That is what's exciting about these savings accounts, where parents, after the regular school hours, can use tutors for extra instruction, paid for with their own resources through these savings accounts, and through the use of technology. Who in this Senate believes that in the 21st century a student can genuinely compete and prepare themselves in research, or computation, or writing, or word processing, without a home computer and access to the Internet as a research tool? I doubt that anybody here will make that case. Yet, 60 percent of American students will end the 20th century without a home computer. Most 
frightening, 85 percent of all minority students will never have that resource, under current financing. These home savings accounts in the Coverdell-Torricelli proposal make funds available for home use and the purchase of a computer. It is our greatest opportunity to assure that this new divide in American life never occurs, that access to knowledge will occur regardless of race or family income, that opportunity is afforded across these lines of American life. 
Finally, Mr. President, I hope that we can proceed on a bipartisan basis. I regret that the judgment has been made that more amendments will not be made available by many of my Democratic colleagues. By the end of the day, we are still left with a proposal that stands on its own merits and deserves the support of Senators, Democratic and Republican. 
Let us begin the great American initiative to confront the most pressing problem in contemporary American life, which is the crisis of quality in the American secondary schools. This is not an end to that debate. It is not a definitive solution. But it is a beginning, to be followed by many proposals of many Senators of both great political parties. I hope we receive overwhelming support. 
Again, I congratulate the Senator from Georgia for bringing this before the Senate. I am very proud to offer it with him as his coauthor. I thank the Senator for yielding.  
Mr. COVERDELL addressed the Chair.

 Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today both to remember the 15,000 innocent people who died at the Katyn Forest Massacre in 1940 and to make sure that their memory never fades from our minds. 
In 1939, Joseph Stalin's army captured 15,000 Polish military officers and proceeded to perpetrate what some have called one of the most heinous war crimes in history. These 15,000 people were Poland's elite and presented a serious threat to Stalin's future control of Poland. Fearing their resistance, Stalin ordered his army to execute the Polish officers in the Katyn Forest. There was no trial. There was no justice for the victims of Stalin's excesses. Stalin did this under the cover of a forest and the shield of his authority while hiding it from the international community. The investigation conducted by this Congress found that the victims were unarmed and innocent. It concluded that the crime was concealed by the Soviet government and that its perpetrators were never brought to justice. As the years passed, the Soviet government was content to let the Nazi regime be blamed for Katyn. It avoided issuing a formal apology or attempting to even make reparations. On February 19, 1989, the Soviets finally released documents confirming the Soviet role in the Katyn Massacre. 
After fifty years of lies and manipulation, an admission of complicity does not ease the pain of a nation whose entire population was affected by this horrible event. I am hopeful that as time goes by and more people learn about this massacre, we will all be able to come to terms with the memory of Katyn and the pain that it has caused. It is a memory that must be sustained to ensure that our bonds of humanity will continue on into the next millennium and that our past will not be destined to repeat itself. 
Mr. President, I rise today to remember these 15,000 victims with the hope that their memory will prevent future atrocities from occurring and will crudely remind the world of its responsibility to protect the innocent at all times. In 1998, we have an obligation to one another to make sure that a tragedy like this does not occur again. The only way to do this is to make sure that the memory of Katyn lives on.

Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I would like to first compliment the Senator from Georgia, Mr. Coverdell, for his tireless work through these months to bring the Senate to the 
position of voting on the A+ savings account. I have been his partner in this effort, and something that has genuinely become bipartisan. I am very proud of our efforts. 
Mr. President, I begin with a personal view on the debate about education in our country. People have different thoughts and very varied proposals. Many are the reasons, and I could accept much about the alternatives except one thing. I cannot accept, and I do not understand, those who would come to the Senate and argue the state of American education and defend the status quo. American education needs to be addressed, not in the margins but in every fundamental aspect of the delivery of education to our children. Indeed, at a time in American life when so much is working, the economy is performing, Americans feel good about our country and its future, faith on any analysis, the single most compelling problem, the most fundamental dilemma that threatens the American future, quality of life, our economic performance, even our political stability, is the quality of American education. 
Recent reports are startling. Forty percent of our students are failing basic science. Forty percent of fourth graders are failing to test at the basic levels of reading comprehension. Of the 21 developed democracies in the world that have achieved an industrial status, America ranks 19th in the testing of our students. 
The legislation before the Senate can accomplish many things, but if it only establishes some new funding, if it does no more than establish savings accounts, then it falls far short of my ambitions. My hope about the Coverdell-Torricelli legislation is that it will genuinely confront the entire status quo of how Americans regard education. 
It does this in several ways. But, first, what is important to understand about it is that this is not a voucher. Senator Coverdell and I come together on this legislation, but we come at it from different perspectives, perhaps. Senator Coverdell supports a voucher on other days and other debates in the Senate. I do not. That may be the best indication for those Senators who are thinking about their positions and how they relate to the voucher issue. I have opposed it because, while I believe in private education and its critical role for America, I do not believe we can afford to divert a single dollar of public education funding to private schools, not because they don't need it, but because the public schools can't afford it. The Coverdell-Torricelli program for A+ savings accounts does not divert a penny of public money into private schools. 
This is all new money. But, mostly, it is not government money. The money that would go into these savings accounts and allow people to either provide extra funding for public activities or for their private tuitions is entirely money that belongs to American families, their own money. That is a critical part of this debate. Whether you are an advocate of public education or private education or, as in my case, both, we are talking about new resources for education in America. How can anyone look at the status of American education today, with the failing grades of our students, and oppose a measure that at the end of the day means more funding for education, and not from government, but an avenue for families to contribute themselves? That is the question that every Senator should be asking themselves. 
Ironically, some will come to this floor arguing against our proposal because of their concern about public education, not recognizing that not only do we not divert public funds from the public schools, but according to the Joint Committee on Taxation, 75 percent of all the parents who use these A+ savings accounts will be the parents of public school students. It may be the most exciting aspect of the entire program. 
With 90 percent of all American students attending public schools, the reality is those schools are not providing many of the services that they provided 20 and 30 years ago. As a student of a public suburban school in northern New Jersey 25 and 30 years ago, our school provided extracurricular activities for athletics, transportation for after-school activities, club activities and access to the technology of the time. In many American suburban school districts those activities no longer exist. Under the A+ savings accounts, parents, from the birth of a child, will be able to put a little money aside every year so their students, in public school, can pay for those activities where local governments no longer provide them. 
But one thing more. Public school students today who are struggling with new science and new math, learning a new language, testing the limits of their ability to learn, increasingly need tutors. Indeed, with advanced science today, how many public school high school students can learn some of the advanced sciences without the assistance after school of a 
tutor? Under our proposal, the money in these A+ savings accounts is available to hire a public schoolteacher or other instructor after school, so students can make up that work and excel in their chosen subject. So, much of this debate may be about private education, but, in a great irony, much of the benefit may be for public school students. 
Then the question inevitably turns to private schools. For all of us who through the years have had doubts about vouchers, we are questioning whether this is the better idea. As I said earlier, first, there is no diversion of public funds so there is no argument about taking resources away from public schools that remain inadequately financed. But the question remains about the role of private education generally in American society. It is not some marginalized concern. We are not discussing a few private boarding schools for an elite American financial class. Mr. President, 15 percent of all American students attend a private or parochial school--a Yeshiva, a Catholic school, a private school on any other basis. If those schools did not exist, if we allowed these private schools simply, over time, to deteriorate and close--recognizing that every year 50 to 70 private schools in America close their doors never to open again--if that trend were to continue, it would cost the United States $16 billion a year to build and operate enough public schools to make up the difference. Where is it these students would go? How would we provide the opportunity, at a time when the public schools already face massive construction problems and are inadequately financed? 
But, more compelling, maybe--who are these students going to most of these private schools? Are we, indeed, creating a means of families saving money to fund the education of an elite? Not in my State nor New York nor Illinois nor California nor any State where our great urban centers are located. Mr. President, 91 percent of all the students in parochial schools in Camden, NJ, are members of minority groups; 60 to 70 percent of all those who attend parochial schools in New York are Protestants. These schools are filling a role in our urban centers where parents feel they have no other choice. Working-class families in an urban environment who want a decent opportunity for their children look honestly at the public schools and may not feel that they can meet their responsibility to their own children without availing themselves of private schools. More than anything else, this legislation is about giving those middle-income families that chance--save $2,000 a year to have the option of sending their child to a private school. 
Yet, the argument continues to be made every day, middle-income families will never be able to afford this opportunity; this will simply be another gift to the wealthy in America. Nothing could be further from the truth. The Joint Committee on Tax estimates that 70 percent of the families who will use a Coverdell-Torricelli A+ savings account, 70 percent, earn less than $75,000 a year. This is a direct benefit to families that are struggling to provide an educational option for their child. 
One of the things that excites me the most about this plan is not just that middle-income families can save for their children's education, or the extra quality for the public school child. It is the ability to get families involved again in a child's education. It was not so long ago in America when people lined up to vote in school board elections and aunts and uncles would participate in helping to tutor a child; where grandparents would sit with a child; where a family participated in the educational experience. For a lot of reasons--people working and the demands on their day and their finances--we have lost that part of America. But think about this aspect of the Coverdell-Torricelli A+ savings account: That on a birthday, a holiday, an aunt, an uncle, a grandparent, can take a few dollars and put that money into this savings account to allow a child to continue with his or her education, whether to buy a computer for a public school student or tuition for a private school student. These accounts are a chance for a family to become involved in educating a child. And that is a part of the crisis in education in America--the family has removed itself. 
Not so long ago I asked a major labor leader in America, if we pass the Coverdell-Torricelli A+ savings account, how would it impact your union, the members of your unions? He said, `Simple. The next time we go to contract negotiations I am putting on the table, along with pay increases and health benefits, I want $5 a week, $10 a week in the contract where an employer contributes to a savings account to help my members educate their children.' Think of it, major corporations who can attract talent and workers by agreeing to put money in these savings accounts--and unions, and professional associations. Every dollar is new money to education in America. And not a dollar is coming from the Federal Treasury or from local governments or taxpayers. It is on a voluntary basis, getting people involved, at every level, back in education. 
Yet, I come back to challenging Members of the Senate to think about this not simply in terms of the tuition of the private school student but to think in broader terms. Not so long ago I read in the Washington Post, a high school senior in Maryland was asked about the changing nature of school. Tiffany Johnson replied, `It is totally impossible to function without a computer now in school. It's a big handicap not to have one at home.' 
Most people who think about Coverdell-Torricelli are thinking about private school and tuition. They need to look at this issue again. They need to think about Tiffany Johnson, because 60 percent of all students in America do not have access to a home computer for calculations, research, or word processing. As Tiffany Johnson has attested, in the world in which we live, researching term papers, writing essays without a home computer is going to create two classes of students in America: The students of the families of the upper middle-class and wealthy and professional Americans, who can afford the software and the home computers, and the rest of America that cannot. Mr. President, 60 percent of Americans do not have those computers--except for minority parents. Minority parents, 85 percent of African Americans and Hispanic Americans, do not have access to home computers. We are creating another dividing line in American education. 
Under the Coverdell-Torricelli A+ savings accounts, that money is not only available for extracurricular activities of public school students, not only for tutoring public school students, transportation of public school students, tuition of private school students, uniforms for public or private school students, it is available for home computers for public and private school students. 
What will we be doing, taxing the money of American families who are trying to buy a home computer for their child to be competitive in school? These savings accounts allow that money without the Federal Government taking its share of taxation. 
Mr. President, I say to Members of the Senate, I have not been in this institution long, but in the time I have been here, I have heard compelling arguments based on realistic assessments of American life for different proposals. Rarely have I been more persuaded of a compelling need with an overwhelming argument to address a national problem. This is not the end of the education debate in America; it is the compelling issue of our time. 
Education remains the great question about whether or not we preserve our standard of living and the America that we have known and come to value and cherish. This debate will have to be followed with the question of, How are we going to rebuild the two-thirds of American schools that are crumbling around us, raise the compensation of American teachers who can no longer afford to remain in the profession that they love and where they are needed? How will we continue to finance access to higher education for middle-income families who are being separated from their ambitions? 
This is a debate that will consume not simply this Senate but the next Congress and Congresses to come, but this is a beginning and it is a valuable contribution. I want to see the Coverdell-Torricelli A+ savings accounts enacted, but I want something more; I want it to be bipartisan; I want the vote to be overwhelming. 
My party has been privileged through most of the last 30 years, from the financing of higher education to support for public education, to have been in the leadership of every fight for quality education in America. 
I say with all deference to my colleagues across the aisle, through much of that time, we were not often challenged for that leadership. Education has been the province of the Democratic Party for a long time. It is good for America that Democrats and Republicans will now compete for the leadership in education. But on this proposal, to finance savings accounts to bring American families back into the financing of their own education, to allow American families to participate in the tutoring, the technology, the uniforms, the extra school activities, and in the paying of private school tuitions, in this matter there should be no competition, because for this plan we can be arm in arm. 
I am honored to have joined with Senator Coverdell in offering this proposal, that it bears both of our names. I look forward to its enactment. 
With this proposal, we can do something right about the problem of education in America. We have been discouraged; we have complained; we have agonized too long. Let us deal with this fundamental crisis in the quality of secondary education by enacting the Coverdell-Torricelli proposal. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, there is always a desire of a Member of the Senate to be philosophically consistent, so I think the question bears some scrutiny. Members of the Senate have previously voted for Hope scholarships and student loan programs in this country, which also have caps on who is eligible to participate. The caps the Senate has previously provided are identical to what is in the Coverdell-Torricelli proposal. There is a two-income, $60,000 cap. 
So when the Joint Committee on Taxation tells us that 70 percent of all these benefits will go to families that earn $75,000 and less, the reason is that there is a cap in the provision that ensures the principal benefits are going to middle-income families, to working families. It was designed to accomplish that end. 
But there is another philosophical consistency with people. I have people raise with me all the time a legitimate concern whether the Government is funding private education. As I pointed out, every dollar of this is the family's money, it is not Government's money. But Members of the Senate who voted previously for savings accounts for higher education have faced this question. I have never heard a Member of the Senate rise on this floor and say, `Well, I'm for savings accounts for colleges, but I don't want it for Notre Dame or Harvard.'

Mr. TORRICELLI. Or Georgetown--whether a religious affiliated school or private education; that these should be for private education only. I have never heard a Member of the Senate say that. To my judgment, it has never happened. The reason is, it would be illogical, it would be foolish. And so it would here. This is being done on the same basis. This is available for public school students and private school students with people's own money. So I think there is a philosophical consistency with the college program.

Mr. TORRICELLI. Indeed, if I had to identify financially my own expectation about the largest single recipient of this funding, I suspect there is a chance it would be public schoolteachers who do the tutoring after school, who will be hired by families with money from these accounts to help students with math and science. They, dollar for dollar, may be the largest recipients. 
One point I did not make, and the Senator from Georgia may have made earlier, is even if Members of the Senate do not agree with us about this need for funding secondary schools, they should recognize that every dollar in these accounts at the end of the 12th grade can be transferred into a college account. This allows families to get a head start in saving money for college. 
So, if you voted last year for these accounts for college, this is a chance to expand them considerably to make that money available. On that basis alone, Members should feel comfortable in voting for the proposal.

Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, 2 weeks ago, all of our hopes for campaign finance reform in this session of the Congress were once again frustrated. A year of investigations, legislative proposals, and public debate were met with a filibuster led by the Republican leadership. Perhaps it really should not have come as much of a surprise to any of us. In the last decade, this Senate has considered 321 different pieces of legislation for campaign finance reform, which filled 6,742 pages of the Congressional Record--and all of this with no change. 
So now, for the 117th time in 10 years, the Senate has voted on an element of campaign finance reform to absolutely no avail. It is a problem of near-crisis proportions, not simply because of the burden it places on candidates for public office, not simply because of the compromises it seems to make in public policy. There is a problem far more fundamental. As evidenced in the confidence of our own people in their system of Government, the United States remains perhaps the only developed democracy in the world where its leadership is chosen by a minority of its citizens. Americans are expressing themselves in our system of Government not with their voices but with their feet, because they choose not to walk into a voting booth. 
If it was bad enough that this Congress would not act, now this frustration with reform is in an entirely different form. President Clinton has challenged the FCC to institute at least one element of reform--in my judgment, perhaps the most important element of reform--by mandating a reduction in the cost of television advertising, on the simple theory that if the cost of advertising is less, candidates will be raising less. If the cost of advertising is less, candidates without great financial resources will still seek public office and not find a barrier to expression. It is not a perfect answer, but it is at least a contribution. This was the President's challenge. The FCC has before it that question. 
But it was not enough to have a filibuster to defeat the McCain-Feingold reform legislation. Now an effort is being made to include in the President's supplemental funding request in the appropriations process a prohibition on the FCC actually ordering a reduction in rates. The scale of the problem the FCC would deal with is enormous. Since 1977, the cost of congressional campaigns has risen over 700 percent. The central element of this rising spiral of costs is television advertising. In 1996, candidates spent over $400 million to purchase television advertising on federally licensed, public airwaves. Hundreds of candidates were traveling to virtually every State, thousands of communities, to raise hundreds of millions of dollars to buy time on federally licensed airwaves that belong to the American people. It is almost incredible to believe. 
There has been, since 1988, a 76 percent increase in this financial burden on public candidates for television advertising. Political advertising on the public airwaves dominates all other forms of campaign spending. President Clinton and Senator Dole spent nearly two-thirds of all their financial resources to buy television time. One half of all the money raised by U.S. Senate candidates was similarly spent on television advertising. In the larger industrial States for the principal media markets, the numbers are far greater--in Los Angeles, Chicago, New York, Miami, or Boston. In my own State of New Jersey, in the Senate race in 1996, fully 80 percent of all financial resources went to buy television advertising. Some 30 seconds of access to the 
voting population on television could cost in excess of $50,000. 
Can it be any wonder that candidates are spending all of their time raising money rather than discussing issues? Can there be any question why candidates without great financial resources, simply possessing a desire to serve and a creativity for dealing with public policy, do not feel they can enter the electoral process? The principal barrier is the public airwaves themselves--something the people of the United States already own. Yet, it's being denied to our own people to discuss issues about our country's own future. 
Congress has had a chance to deal with this problem, and it has not. The original version of the McCain-Feingold reform legislation contained reductions in television advertising. It was removed. A challengers' amendment was offered to the McCain-Feingold reform bill that would have provided for a reduction. It was not adopted. I introduced an amendment that would have allowed for a 75 percent reduction. My amendment could not be offered. These are the reasons why I believe President Clinton challenged the FCC to act. To this Congress, our responsibility should be clear. Since the Congress failed to enact campaign finance reform, at least get out of the way so that the FCC can act responsibly and institute at least one element of reform. The Congress has had a decade, hundreds of opportunities, and did nothing. At least now remain silent so that others who will act responsibly can do something to deal with this mounting national problem. 
It is not as if we do not have in the FCC the legal ability to require the television networks to reduce the cost of advertising. And it is not as though this request is without precedence. In 1952, the FCC set aside 12 percent of all television channeling time for education purposes, for noncommercial use. In 1967, President Johnson set aside part of the spectrum for public broadcasting. For the FCC now to require a reduction in rates has not only precedence but overwhelming precedence. Candidates for public office now pay a reduced rate, albeit insufficiently reduced. Perhaps even greater, however, is that the FCC is providing up to $20 billion worth of free licenses to broadcasters for digital television, a part of the spectrum on a digital basis, requiring the broadcasters to pay nothing, and probably the greatest grant to private industry since the opening of Federal lands to the railroads. The broadcasters were provided this license on a single basis, on a single request that they fulfill a public obligation to the people of this country. 
I can think of no greater opportunity to fulfill that public obligation in meeting a more serious national problem than the FCC now--after the granting of these digital television licenses to broadcasters, asking them to provide reduced rates or free television time. The scale of the burden is so minimal. 
Last year, television networks billed, for commercial and other advertising, $42 billion. Of this total advertising expenditure, 1.2 percent was for political advertising. The cost of reducing the rates for political advertising, that 1.2 percent, would still allow for a growth in the overall advertising revenue of the networks next year. So if the FCC acted on any reasonable basis, it would not result in less broadcaster revenues next year and, in year-to-year terms, it would be simply a small reduction in the rate of growth. This we would hesitate to ask after providing $20 billion worth of free new licenses to the networks that are already operating on publicly owned airwaves of the people of the United States? 
Perhaps it isn't that the burden isn't too great; perhaps it isn't a legal problem at all; perhaps it is that there are Members of this institution of the Congress that like the idea that there is a threshold price for entry to public office in the United States. The price of entering public office in the United States is not an academic degree; it is not a command of the issues; it is not a given level of commitment to public service; it is the ability to buy television time to communicate views. Increasingly, that means people of great personal wealth use their own resources. If it is not their own resources, it is the ability to use those resources of great financial interests in the United States that command all of the candidate's time and attention. Perhaps it is that people like this threshold price of entry and what it means for certain interests in the Senate, partisan or otherwise. 
Well, it leaves us with this simple situation: The Congress had its chance for campaign finance reform and, after a decade of effort, it has failed. President Clinton has made a request for the FCC to consider reductions in television advertising rates. That issue is now before Chairman Kennard. The Commissioners of the FCC and its new chairman, Mr. Kennard, have a historic opportunity--an opportunity that goes to the very issue of confidence in this Government, the ability for people to feel they identify with these institutions, with their futures and the welfare of their families. They have an extraordinary opportunity to institute reform. 
I hope the FCC will act, and I hope this Congress, having failed to be responsible in dealing with this problem, at least has the good grace to remain silent, to not amend the supplemental appropriations legislation so that others can meet a responsibility that was not met on the floor of this Senate. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I thank Senators McCain, Chafee, Baucus, and Hollings for their support for my efforts to have the Department of Transportation investigate how to improve the safety of transporting high-risk hazardous waste material on our Nation's highways. This issue is of great concern to me and to the people of New Jersey. 
On October 20, 1997, a truck carrying hazardous materials caught fire while traveling on Interstate-80 in Paterson, New Jersey causing nearby residents and businesses to be evacuated. Two Paterson police officers had to be hospitalized and treated for chemical inhalation as a result of the accident. According to the police, the fire started when two chemicals inside the truck spilled over and mixed together. 
Though the accident was not severe, it certainly would have been much worse had a passing motorists not noticed the fire and forced the driver to pull over. We were also fortunate that the public safety officials were well-trained and acted as quickly as they did. 
What truly concerns me about this accident is the revelation that the company that was transporting the waste had been involved in 46 spill incidents at a cost of more than $100,000 since their inception. Despite this record, their last safety inspection by the Department of Transportation was conducted in 1994, almost four years ago. When I, along with Representative Bill Pascrell investigated how this could possibly be the case, we were stunned to learn that there is nothing in current law which requires an annual safety examination of hazardous waste haulers. Under existing law, in order for a company to be a hauler-for-hire of hazardous material they must possess a permit from the Department of Transportation's Federal Highway Safety Administration. Once a hauler obtains a permit, they basically have it in perpetuity--regardless of their safety record. All they must do is reapply every year for a new safety permit and pay an application fee. While the Federal Highway Safety Administration maintains safety records and conducts safety reviews they do not do annual reviews or require safety inspections as a part of the certification process. 
This is wrong. In my view, this process is too lax and although I would prefer to require this safety inspection outright, I will withdraw my amendment to S1173, the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act Reauthorization to require this and instead submit this amendment to require the Department of Transportation to study how we may best implement a system of linking the renewal of a company's Federal permit to its ability to meet certain safety standards. This approach is fair and is in line with the spirit of the Hazardous Materials Transportation law. 
Once again, I want to thank my colleagues and the Surface Transportation Subcommittee staff for their assistance with this amendment. I look forward to its inclusion in the final highway bill.

Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Nebraska for yielding. 
Mr. President, there is nothing more fundamental to a democratic government than the oversight of executive responsibility by the Congress. It is, indeed, the essence of an accountability of power that this Congress has access to information and the people who hold it. That exercise of congressional power requires the truthful testimony of personnel in the executive branch of the Government. In no area is this more important than in issues of national security, because, ultimately, it is this Congress that holds the power of war and peace and the responsibility to raise funds for the national defense. But in recent decades, the intelligence agencies of this Government have become the exception in this accountability of power--an exception by statute in the Whistle Blower Protection Act and, perhaps more fundamentally, by the culture of governance in the Government itself. 
Tragically, one of the best examples was a former assistant in the Latin American Bureau of the State Department, Richard Nuccio, who came to me, as a Member of the House of Representatives, to report what he believed to be illegal activity. At the time, I served as a member of the Intelligence Committee of the House of Representatives. What Mr. Nuccio imparted to me was criminal conduct. Information that, by statute, was to be reported to the Intelligence Committee had been omitted. In the months and years that followed, the President of the United States expressed outrage. The Central Intelligence Agency conducted an investigation and the rules were changed. 
Mr. Nuccio paid a price with his intelligence clearance, and ultimately with his career. It appeared that no real lesson had been learned at all. 
Last year Senator Shelby and Senator Kerrey provided real protection to executive employees if they come to this Congress with the truth. I have rarely been prouder of two Members of this institution, nor more disappointed in the President of the United States. He threatened to veto the change. 
Mr. President, I rise because I am extremely grateful to Senator Shelby and Senator Kerrey for their leadership. Indeed, they were joined by all 19 members of the committee. As a result, I believe that the intelligence community not only will not be weakened, but it will be strengthened. The best protection against abuse of their authority or, indeed, violations of the law, is the knowledge that Federal employees will be protected if they come to this Congress to report such activities. 
The occurrence of illegal acts will not be concealed by classifying them or by carefully omitting them in a notification requirement of this Congress. 
The best means I know is assuring the intelligence community that it retains the confidence of this Congress and our people. 
This legislation is a real contribution to this Congress. Mostly it is a real contribution to the accountability of power that is so important in our democratic system. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, inscribed on the corridors of this Capitol are the words of William Henry Harrison, spoken at his Presidential inauguration in 1841. He said: `The only legitimate right to govern is an express grant of power from the governed.' 
Indeed, the very principle of the consent of the governed is the foundation of this democratic society. That issue was at question in the House of Representatives this week when the Congress considered the issue of the political status of Puerto Rico. 
I believe it is clear that it is not in the interest of these United States to leave the 20th century, with it being claimed in any quarter of this globe, that the United States is in an involuntary political arrangement with any peoples. The unfinished business of American democracy is the political status of Puerto Rico. 
The history of the 20th century for the United States have been the constant expansion of enfranchisement of the governed. Within this century, we have either guaranteed or attempted to assure the right to participate in our democracy to women and, through the struggle of civil rights, for African Americans. 
In 1913, we changed the U.S. Constitution to ensure that all citizens of the United States could participate in choosing Members of this Senate. In 1971, we extended the right to vote for those who are 18 years old. And, indeed, also in this century, we ensured this enfranchisement was expanded geographically to include the citizens of Hawaii and Alaska. 
But this only begs the question of the unanswered issue since 1898, at the end of the Spanish-American War, of what is to be done with the arrangement of the people of Puerto Rico and the Government of the United States. It is an issue that has come before this Congress continuously. In 1917, Congress granted citizenship to the people of Puerto Rico. In 1952, Congress revisited the issue to provide commonwealth under American jurisdiction. 
And yet, the issue continues, because the full rights of citizenship granted to those of the 50 States remain withheld to the people of Puerto Rico. The people of Puerto Rico are subject to laws and regulations passed by this legislative body, yet they have no voting representation. The people of Puerto Rico are led by a President and Vice President exercising full executive authority, but they cannot vote to choose that executive leadership. 
The people of Puerto Rico hold citizenship in a country whose legislature can take away or compromise their rights of citizenship at any moment. The legislation passed by the House of Representatives, legislation which I was proud to cosponsor--indeed, originally authored when I was a Member of that body--redresses this injustice. 
This legislation does not mandate a political choice for the people of Puerto Rico. Whether or not Puerto Rico ultimately becomes a State of this Union is a question for the people of Puerto Rico, and only for the people of Puerto Rico, to decide. Whether or not the people of Puerto Rico are able to exercise that choice is a responsibility of this Congress. 
I do not believe that this Congress should express itself on that issue. Whether or not the choice is statehood, independence, or commonwealth is only a matter for the people of Puerto Rico. But as certainly as it is our responsibility that the people of Puerto Rico have a right to exercise that choice, it is our responsibility in the United States to ensure they exercise it honestly, with legitimate choices. 
The bill authorizes Puerto Rico to hold a referendum by the end of 1998 as to whether or not to remain a commonwealth, seek independence, or choose statehood. If a majority of citizens were to decide to seek independence or statehood, then the President would submit legislation to the Congress outlining a transition plan that would culminate in 10 years. 
Then, the people of Puerto Rico would take to the polls once again to approve or reject the plan. If it were passed by a majority of the people of Puerto Rico, then the President would submit legislation to the Congress recommending a date to end the transition period. Then, for a third time the people of Puerto Rico would vote again on the issue of self-governance. 
This is an extensive and a complicated plan for final political status. It is important that these three votes be held over an extensive transition period, because as history has made clear, any judgment to join this Union is irreversible and it is final. A decision on statehood is made once and never made again. 
Mr. President, I understand that there are some Members of the Senate who are concerned about this legislation because of its impact on our Union. I believe that a decision by the Puerto Rican people, if they make it in their own judgment, is in the interests of this Union. 
The United States would be enriched culturally. Indeed, it would make clear that the bridge that the United States has enjoyed for so long culturally to Europe is equally as strong with the peoples of Latin America. Indeed, I believe all Americans would be proud and enriched by this judgment. 
Mr. President, that, of course, is a decision for the people of Puerto Rico to make. But if they make it, I hope people in our country and Members of the Senate will welcome their judgment. 
But on this day, Mr. President, I call upon the Energy and Natural Resources Committee to immediately commence hearings on the important Puerto Rico self-determination bill. I join with Senator Graham and Senator Craig in offering this legislation. I hope the people of Puerto Rico can be proud that this Senate will await their judgment and will offer them this opportunity. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. TORRICELLI. I am very proud to join the Senator from North Dakota in offering this amendment. In our Federal system, there is always a preference for State and local governments setting standards of health and safety for our citizens. By right, those judgments should be made in those levels of government closest to the people themselves. But there are instances where our State and local governments do not rise to those responsibilities to protect our citizens. 
Through the years, as our society changes, so, too, sometimes do the standards. We live in a highly mobile society, where in the course of any day, week, or month, citizens from any State in America can find themselves driving on the highways of another locality, in a different jurisdiction. Every Senator has the right and responsibility to know that in that travel, in the pursuit of commerce or recreation, their citizens are safe to some minimal standard. That, in my judgment, Mr. President, is what motivates the Senator from North Dakota today. It defies logic that in 22 States in this Union it is still legal for a passenger in an automobile on a highway to possess an open container of alcohol. And if that is not difficult enough to understand, it is unbelievable that in five States it is permissible, acceptable, it is legal for a person to have one hand on the steering wheel of a moving automobile and the other hand on a container of alcohol. 
Our preference for the States governing these issues cannot blind us to a responsibility to protect thousands of lives of our own citizens. I know that in this institution there are those who will not join with the Senator from North Dakota, but it is instructive that while some may vote against him, few, if any, will rise to debate against him, because the point cannot be defended. 
In any year in this country, about 17,000 people are losing their lives to alcohol-related traffic accidents. Drunk driving is the leading cause of death of all citizens in America from the age of 5 to 25. There is an epidemic of death from drunk driving across this country. So if you are persuaded that there is a single reason to oppose this in deference to a State law, I offer to the Senate 17,000 reasons why we have to meet our responsibility to the citizens of all 50 States who want to travel with safety and confidence across our highways. 
To those who believe that this kind of legislative effort cannot be successful, the best evidence is that through the years our efforts against drunk driving have dramatically reduced the incidents of drunk driving themselves, except with a single category--hard-core drinkers. The casual drinker who drives has been persuaded to exercise caution and to live within the law. But the numbers for hard-core drinkers are staggering. Every weekday between 10 p.m. and 1:00 a.m., 1 in 13 drivers in this country is drunk. Between 1:00 a.m. and 6 a.m., one in seven is drunk. It is those drivers, driving with alcohol in the automobile, with an open container sometimes in their own hands, that we are trying to prevent. 
Mr. President, I can think of no legislation that this Senate will consider in the coming weeks that more dramatically could ease the pain of individual American families and save lives than this legislation offered by Mr. Dorgan. I urge my colleagues to support it. 
I yield my time back to the Senator from North Dakota. 
Mr. CHAFEE addressed the Chair.

Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, last week, President Clinton called upon the Senate to use but one principal criteria when considering nominations for ambassadors for the United States. In his words, that criteria simply stated is: `Will he or will he not be a good ambassador?' 
Over 30 years ago, the Senate was confronted with a similar situation to one before us today. This body was asked to assess whether Patricia Harris should be approved to be U.S. Ambassador to Luxembourg. She was a prominent lawyer. There was no question about her qualifications. Indeed, during the course of her career, she went on to be Secretary of HUD and of HEW. But, in 1965, Patricia Harris represented the first African American woman to become an American ambassador. The Senate then was left with a challenge of meeting what Thomas Jefferson considered our highest calling. That is, in his words, whether this would be a nation of `equal opportunity for all and special privilege for none.' 
I cite the judgment of the Senate in confronting the nomination of Patricia Harris for Ambassador to Luxembourg because the Senate now faces a similar choice. President Clinton has sent before the Senate the name of Mr. James Hormel to become Ambassador to Luxembourg. Mr. Hormel was a member of the U.S. delegation to the U.N. Human Rights Commission. Last May, the Senate approved the nomination for him to serve as an alternate representative to the 51st session of the U.N. General Assembly. Last October, the Foreign Relations Committee recommended Mr. Hormel as our envoy to Luxembourg. But for a few of my colleagues, that is not enough. Just as Patricia Harris met opposition to her nomination as Ambassador to Luxembourg, Mr. Hormel is now being prejudged by some because of his sexual orientation. 
Mr. President, I rise today not simply to advance the nomination of Mr. Hormel, but I rise against those who would prejudge his qualifications based simply on the prejudice because of his personal lifestyle and his sexual orientation. I believe that fairness and decency require that Mr. Hormel be afforded his God-given right to serve his country in a position for which he is clearly qualified. 
No one can argue with his professional experience, his academic achievement, or the qualifications that led this Senate previously to send his name to be a member of our representation to the United Nations or that led the Foreign Relations Committee to recommend his service as an ambassador. 
Mr. Hormel received a doctorate degree from the University of Chicago Law School. He served there as a dean of students. He is a member of the Board of Managers of Swarthmore College, from which he graduated. 
Mr. Hormel is a committed philanthropist and public servant. He serves as chairman of the Equidex Corporation and has donated millions of dollars to some of the most important charities in America. They include the Virginia Institute on Autism, the Catholic Youth Organization, the American Indian College Fund, United Negro College Fund, and the Jewish and Children's Family Services. In recognition, he has received numerous awards and was named Outstanding Philanthropist by the National Society of Fundraising Executives. 
He is a member of the board of directors of the San Francisco Symphony, the San Francisco Chamber of Commerce, the Human Rights Campaign, and the American Foundation for AIDS Research. He is founding director of the City Club of San Francisco, a club created to bring together community leaders of diverse backgrounds. 
Mr. President, as the Secretary of State, Secretary Albright, said, `. . . Mr. Hormel has demonstrated outstanding diplomatic and leadership skills. He will be an excellent United States Ambassador to Luxembourg.' 
Mr. President, what else could this Senate ask of a nominee to be an American Ambassador, with leadership in corporate fields, in civic pursuits, a philanthropist, a leader of great American universities? What other American Ambassadors have better backgrounds, proven community service, or come with higher praise? This isn't about Mr. Hormel's qualifications. It isn't about his ability to serve as an Ambassador. This has become a referendum on Mr. Hormel's lifestyle, the most private intimate matters of his sexual orientation. 
It is said by some colleagues in this institution who stand in opposition to his nomination that his lifestyle is inappropriate and that he is representing a country that is overwhelmingly Catholic. They failed to note, indeed, that the country of Luxembourg itself has spoken favorably of Mr. Hormel's potential service as our Ambassador. 
My colleagues know that Mr. Hormel has spoken candidly about his potential service in Luxembourg and has made clear that he will not use his position to advocate his own views or his own private agenda. Indeed, my colleagues know that American Ambassadors are appointed and confirmed to serve solely the interests of the U.S. Government. Whether it is their political views, their religious views, or their sexual orientation, the advance of any of those opinions would be inappropriate by an American Ambassador. They serve in this position for one purpose and one purpose only: to advance the views of the U.S. Government. 
Yet, Mr. Hormel, like Patricia Harris before him, stands in a historic position, potentially being confirmed by the U.S. Senate, and has made pledges which should be unnecessary--indeed, are unprecedented--and made several pledges to this institution: 
First, to limit his charitable giving to 501(c)(3) organizations and to only donate through private foundations that do not bear his name. He doesn't have to do so, but he has. 
He has pledged to prohibit any organization from using his name as a fundraising tool. He doesn't have to, but he made this pledge. 
He has pledged to remove his name from any fundraising or charitable activities conducted by outside organizations. 
He has pledged to resign from all boards of directors, except Swarthmore College and the San Francisco Symphony. 
Yet, critics of Mr. Hormel argue that he is somehow out of step with American life or American values. 
Mr. President, it is Mr. Hormel's critics who are out of step with American values. A fundamental principle of this country is that everyone has an opportunity to serve, that everyone is accepted and judged based on their ability to contribute. Mr. Hormel asks to be judged only by that standard. 
Mr. President, through the years, from race to gender to religion to ethnicity, this Senate has had to deal with the painful questions of removing prejudice and learning to deal with people based on the content of character that all individuals face equally and fairly as they seek to serve our country. Mr. Hormel asks no more. He has a right to expect no less. 
President Clinton has challenged this Senate to judge Mr. Hormel's nomination to be Ambassador to Luxembourg on its own merits. I hope in the great traditions of this institution we will give Mr. Hormel that chance. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, the debate before the Senate is about campaign finance reform but, indeed, it is really about something much more fundamental. It is about the credibility of the U.S. Government. It may even be about the long-term stability of our system of government. 
The United States will enter the 21st century as the only industrial democracy in the world where only a minority of the people of our country choose our government. In the Presidential elections of last year, only 49 percent of eligible Americans participated in choosing our government. It is a record of shame. That shame does not belong only to those who do not participate. 
Upon leaving the Continental Congress, the Founding Fathers were asked, what form of government have you chosen? It was replied, `A democracy--if you can keep it.' This legislation is about campaign finance reform. But much more fundamentally it is about a democracy--if you can keep it. 
For more than 20 years we have tried to evade the central truth of this problem. We told ourselves that people didn't vote because it wasn't convenient, so we gave them time off from work; that it wasn't possible to go and register in person, so we passed motor-voter. We have done everything we can think of to address a new excuse of why people do not participate in the process. The truth is those 51 percent of Americans who do not vote are participating in the process. By not voting they are speaking volumes about their belief and their confidence in this system of government. 
Central to this eroding of confidence in our 200-year political system is money and people's perception of what it buys and how it undermines our system of government. I participated in the 1996 elections as a U.S. Senate candidate. The record of those elections can be a source of pride to no one. Congressional candidates raised $765 million, culminating a 700 percent increase in campaign spending since 1977. We are not the first Congress or the first generation that recognized there was a problem of confidence in governing America. Those before us, in 1974, after Watergate, passed comprehensive and meaningful reform. But like that generation, in this Congress it is time to recognize that the governing laws are not working. The 1974 reforms are being observed in the exception. A series of Federal court decisions, changes in technology, changes in the political culture, have left them meaningless. I think, indeed, the 1974 reforms did not envision, therefore did not even address, the issue of soft money which is now so prevalent and even governing the system. 
This Senate has not been blind to the problem. We have not been without our advocates, like Senator Feingold, who sought to change the system. In the last decade, this Senate has voted on 116 occasions for campaign finance reform, 321 different bills, all of which have left the system fundamentally unchanged. 
What is it now that brings this opposition by the Republican majority? What is it that would lead potentially a majority of this Senate to participate in a filibuster on a bill which fundamentally prohibits foreign money, enhances prompt disclosure of contributions, helps the FEC in enforcing the law, and banning the soft money which for most of the last year attracted the attention of the country and the focus of the Governmental Affairs Committee on which I serve as an abuse of the system? Which of these provisions so disturbs Members that they would stop this reform legislation? Or is it simply that they like to discuss the problems but fear that any change to the current system would rearrange control of this institution? 
The irony of the opposition is that the principal problem of the reform legislation is not that it does these simple and self-obvious changes but that it does not go far enough. Indeed, if given the opportunity, as the Senator from North Dakota, I would like to offer amendments to take this process further, because the principal change in the political culture since 1974, and obviously in the last election, has been the use of unregulated issue advertising by third party advertisers. We no longer have contests between candidates or Democrats and Republicans, but unregulated, third party institutions, where no one knows the source of the money or even who they are, that sometimes drown out the candidates, change the agenda of people and political parties. This legislation doesn't deal with that issue, and it should. It doesn't go far enough. 
So in my amendment I go further with these tax-free organizations in making them choose. If you want to be tax free, you will not participate in electioneering; if you do want to participate in electioneering and change your status, you will disclosure your contributors. We did not do that here. 
Finally, the Senator from North Dakota indicated the principal reform that is required is reducing the cost of television times. The public airwaves, licensed by this Government, owned by the people of the United States, are being 
sold for millions of dollars and are essentially driving the cost of these campaigns. Mr. President, 82 percent of the election in New Jersey was raising money for television advertising. The average across the country is 70 percent. Until we force the television networks to reduce the cost of the public airwaves, we will never stop the upward spiral of these campaigns. 
So I rise to endorse the efforts of the Senator from Wisconsin to urge the Congress to allow its consideration, to allow a majority of 52 Senators in this institution to work their will, to do the work that every Senator knows must be done--not simply to reforming the financing of campaigns, but much more importantly, much more fundamentally, to make this part of the effort, indeed, the foundation, of restoring confidence in this system. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr, President, I rise today in support of Senator D'Amato's resolution supporting Italy's inclusion as a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council. Should this international body expand, I can think of no country more worthy of inclusion than Italy, and I hope my colleagues will join me in expressing their support for this idea. 
Italy is a major economic player on the world stage and in terms of United Nations contributions. She forms a critical part of the UN's global peacekeeping operations and has been active in a number of international conflicts and crises. Last spring, Italy acted under UN auspices to organize and lead a multi-national peace enforcement operation in Albania. This effort was critical to restoring order and helping Albania organize democratic elections. 
In more general terms, Italy's strategic location in the Mediterranean makes it an important partner for the international community as it launches security operations in many zones of potential instability. Already, Italy has hosted the air bases that the United States and other NATO members have used to conduct air operations over the former Yugoslavia. These efforts, in conjunction with Italy's status as the fifth largest economy in the world, mean that we can no longer ignore its present position in the international community. It plays a vital role in protecting and enhancing our economic and military security, and I believe the time has come to recognize these efforts. 
Italy's contributions to world history and culture, her continuing support for humanitarian and developmental objectives throughout the world, and status as a thriving democracy which has overcome a fascist past all argue for Italy's inclusion in any plans to revise and expand the permanent membership of the United Nations Security Council.

Mr. TORRICELLI. 
Mr. President, today I am joined by my distinguished colleague from Wisconsin, Senator Kohl, in introducing the `Bounty Hunter Accountability and Quality Assurance Act of 1998.' Our bill will begin the process of reforming the revered but antiquated system of bail enforcement in this country. 
Throughout our nation's proud history, bounty hunters have proved a valuable addition to our law enforcement and recovery efforts. About 40 percent of all criminal defendants are released on bail each year, and in 1996 alone more than 33,000 skipped town. Police departments, no matter how efficient or determined, cannot be expected to deal with so many bail jumpers in addition to their other duties. But while public law enforcement officers recover only about 10 percent of defendants who skip town, bounty hunters catch an incredible 88 percent of bail jumpers. 
Because of the special, contractual nature of the relationship between bail bondsmen and those who use them to get out of jail, bounty hunters have traditionally enjoyed special rights--a nineteenth century Supreme Court case affirmed that while bounty hunters may exercise many of the powers granted to police, they are not subject to many of the constitutional checks we place on those law enforcement officials. As a result, bounty hunters need not worry about Miranda rights, extradition proceedings, or search warrants. 
The ability to more efficiently track and recover criminal defendants serves a valuable purpose in our society. But the lack of constitutional checks on bounty hunters also opens the system up to the risk of abuse. Each of us has read or heard about cases in which legitimate bounty hunters or those simply posing as recovery agents have wrongfully entered a dwelling or captured the wrong person. 
In one recent Arizona case, several men claiming to be bounty hunters broke into a house, terrorized a family and ended up killing a young couple who tried to defend against the attack. It now appears that these men were simply `posing' as bounty hunters, but there are other reported incidents in which `legitimate' bounty hunters have broken down the wrong door, kidnaped the wrong person, or physically abused the targets of their searches. And there is little recourse for the innocent victims of wrongful acts. 
Our legislation would begin the process of making bounty hunters more accountable to the public they serve, and would help to restore confidence in the bail enforcement system. The bill would not unduly impose the will of the federal government on states, which have traditionally regulated bounty hunters. Our legislation contains only three simple provisions, each of which will make it easier to better regulate bounty hunters, but none of which will overburden states. 
The first provision of the `Bounty Hunter Accountability and Quality Assurance Act' would simply allow a national bail enforcement organization to run background checks through the FBI, ensuring that there will be a relatively easy way to keep convicted felons out of the bail enforcement business. A nearly identical provision related to private security guards recently passed the House by a nearly unanimous vote. 
The second provision of the bill directs the Attorney General of the United States to establish model guidelines for states to follow when creating their own bail enforcement regulations. In the course of her work, the Attorney General will be specifically directed to look into three areas identified by the bill--whether bounty hunters should be required to `knock and announce' before entering a dwelling, whether they should be required to carry liability insurance (most already do), and whether convicted felons should be allowed to obtain employment as bounty hunters. While states are not required to follow the model guidelines, those states who choose to adopt the guidelines within two years will receive priority for Byrne grant funding. 
Finally, this bill makes bail bond companies liable for the acts of the bounty hunters they hire. The clarification of liability in our bill will encourage these companies to carefully select and perhaps even train the bounty hunters in their employ. Perhaps we can cut down on the worst abuses if we force employers to take a closer look at who they hire. 
Mr. President, it is time to start the process of making rogue bounty hunters more accountable, while at the same time restoring America's confidence in the long tradition of bail enforcement that dates from the earliest days of this nation. I urge my colleagues to join us in taking this first step towards this process, and I thank my distinguished colleague from Wisconsin, Senator Kohl, for joining me in introducing this bill today. 
I ask unanimous consent that the full text of this bill be published in the Record.

Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I want to make myself clear at the outset. I rise today with no portfolio for President Clinton. I do not pretend to know the details of either the Whitewater case or matters pertaining to Paula Jones, with a series of other legal issues now, involving the Office of Independent Counsel, the Justice Department and President Clinton's private attorneys. Those issues are not my purpose today. 
Like most Americans, I have watched events of recent weeks with some curiosity and with a deep sense of regret. I rise today for a different purpose. I want to talk about justice--not the justice of the individual in these cases but the administration of justice by the Government itself. I do so from the perspective of a member of the Judiciary Committee, recognizing that under the Ethics in Government Act it is the responsibility of the Attorney General to investigate alleged misconduct, conflicts of interest and other improprieties of the Office of Independent Counsel. This institution, through the Judiciary Committee, has a responsibility of oversight, both of the Office of Independent Counsel and the Attorney General herself as she implements the act. 
My purpose, then, in this capacity, is to review a series of legal and ethical issues that pose a challenge to the integrity of the Office of Independent Counsel and whether or not it is being administered and the responsibility of the Attorney General to oversee its activities. 
Within recent days, we have learned details of a series of deliberate leaks of grand jury material--not on a few occasions, not on one or two items, but virtually volumes of material impugning the character of individuals--that may undermine aspects of the investigation. Some of these leaks have been characterized as unfortunate. Some, perhaps, inevitable, as part of the process. They may be these things. But they are also something else. They represent a Federal felony. It is against the law. In this case, a potential violation of the law by members of the Justice Department or in their employment themselves. 
David Kendall, President Clinton's lawyer, has detailed some of these leaks in a 15-page correspondence, virtually identifying volumes of material where some of the most reputable publications in America--including the New York Times, the Washington Post --indicate that this material comes from `sources in Starr's office;' `Starr's investigators expect;' `sources familiar with the probe'--hardly masking the Government prosecutor's contravention of Federal statutes, punishable both by fines and jail terms, for leaking grand jury material. 
I believe that the standard for such abuse was set by former Attorney General Thornburgh who, in the matter of Congressman Gray and the leaking of grand jury material, required that his associates, those familiar with grand jury material, were not simply investigated but polygraphed, with a clear or implied threat that any failure to comply or to pass the polygraph would mean their immediate dismissal. 
Indeed, as much of America has heard about the grand jury leaks, it has tended to mask several other perhaps more serious ethical problems that must also be addressed by the Attorney General and are outlined in my correspondence being sent to the Attorney General on this date. 
Just prior to his appointment as independent counsel, Mr. Starr was retained by the Independent Women's Forum to write an amicus brief in the matter of the civil complaint being brought by Paula Jones. The Independent Women's Forum is funded by a Richard Scaife of Pennsylvania. In the furtherance of these responsibilities it is not clear how much or whether, indeed, Mr. Starr was compensated, but it is clear that his firm and he were engaged in this activity, including researching a brief, contacting those attorneys, then representing Paula Jones. They were actively engaged. 
Reports as recent as 3 months ago indicate that individuals at Mr. Starr's firm with whom Mr. Starr is still associated have 
continued to assist Paula Jones in her legal defense team. This morning in the Chicago Tribune it is further alleged by that publication that Mr. Starr's firm--where this financial relationship continues between Mr. Starr and his partners--has continued to provide assistance to Paula Jones' defense team, even while the investigation of President Clinton under the authority of the Attorney General was expanded to include matters relating to the civil complaint by Paula Jones. 
Mr. President, the Office of Professional Responsibility, under the direction of Attorney General Reno, needs to review these serious lapses of ethical conduct and these transparent conflicts of interest. It is left with little or no choice. If there is to be any confidence in the administration of the Office of Independent Counsel, and if the American people are to believe the result of this investigation and whatever recommendations result, the Office of Professional Responsibility will need to definitively establish whether, indeed, there are conflicts of interest, as are being alleged. 
Indeed, I know of no authority in the canons of ethics of the profession, the operating procedures and rules of ethics of the Justice Department, that would permit an attorney in any capacity, no less an Office of Independent Counsel, investigating any American, no less the President of the United States, to operate with ethical standards that allow he or his associates within a single case dealing with the same litigants to do work for such clearly conflicting interests. 
Third, while serving as independent counsel for the Government, Mr. Starr's law firm has received and continues to receive retainers and legal payments from corporations, including Philip Morris and Brown & Williamson, potentially of millions of dollars, that not only have an interest but an extraordinary financial interest in the defeat of President Clinton's initiatives and whose interests are directly impacted by his political viability. 
Mr. Starr's continuing to draw income, a year ago in excess of $1 million in personal compensation, while in the employment of the U.S. Government to investigate matters relating to President Clinton, is not only unsound judgment but as clear a conflict of interest between those of the private attorneys, the private parties that he has sworn to defend and the interests of the U.S. Government that he has similarly sworn to pursue. Both cannot be his master. 
Attorney General Reno is left with the question of what other interests have continued to pay compensation to Mr. Starr, what other clients and what kind of judgment has been exercised. 
Making this all the more urgent, indeed feeding suspicion, is a fourth point that in some ways may be the most troubling. Richard Scaife, who earlier in this affair was funding research into the Paula Jones case, appears again as a part of Mr. Starr's performance of his responsibilities. Mr. Scaife has provided $600,000 per year, approximately $2.5 million, to fund something that is known as the Arkansas project. The Arkansas project is a tax free 501(c)3 organization under the Tax Code of the United States. It indeed has funded this money through the American Spectator magazine. 
The purpose, apparently as outlined in an article in the New York Observer, written by Joe Conason last week, has resulted in the establishment of a relationship with David Hale, the principal witness used by Mr. Starr against President Clinton, in the Whitewater case and a State trooper, former State Arkansas Trooper L.D. Brown. It appears that the American Spectator established a relationship of unknown financial or other reward to secure the cooperation of each individual in the writing of the articles. 
The changing of the testimony of these witnesses, critical to Mr. Starr's work, and when those changes occurred and their relationship with the Arkansas project, becomes an important matter for the Justice Department. It would appear on its face that is at least reason to explore whether the improper use of tax-free foundation funding through this publication with the intention of influencing potential Federal witnesses did not constitute Federal witness tampering. It is, however, an issue that must immediately be established. 
As a part of this aspect of the case requiring investigation, as Mr. Hale's legal representation by one Theodore Olson, who seemed to have guided Mr. Hale in his testimony in the Whitewater affair, who is also the counsel to the American Spectator funded by Mr. Scaife, 
who was also a former law partner of Mr. Starr. 
Mr. President, sometimes facts that are coincidental can paint a picture of conspiracy where it does not exist. There are coincidences, sometimes, of extraordinary scale. But the Attorney General would need to admit that there are events in this case that are peculiar indeed--Mr. Scaife's funding of the American Spectator and its impact on Federal witnesses; Mr. Scaife's potential funding of Mr. Starr as a private attorney in the Paula Jones case; Mr. Scaife's funding of employment for Mr. Starr at Pepperdine University, where he was offered and initially accepted a teaching position in the law department. 
Coincidence? Perhaps. But as our former colleague, Senator Cohen once observed on this floor, `The appearance of justice is as important as justice itself.' 
There are, in the coming weeks, important judgments to be made about the administration of justice with relation to the President of the United States. Those decisions will profoundly impact policy and the guidance of the U.S. Government. I have no knowledge and, therefore, no recommendation on the matters of how the case should be pursued. I am not here to distinguish falsehood from truth. I am here in the interest of justice. 
It would appear on the facts that there is something terribly troubling about the administration of the Office of the Independent Counsel. So in my correspondence of this day, I have asked Attorney General Reno to have the Office of Professional Responsibility inquire as to whether indeed there are conflicts of interest in the Paula Jones case and, indeed, whether it is factual that Mr. Starr was once engaged as a private litigant in that matter. If so, the result is clear--he must recuse himself and professional prosecutors must pursue the matter. Similarly, to establish whether funds, through the American Spectator, were improperly used with a result of tampering of witnesses. Finally, to conclude whether or not the operation of a private law practice, including the solicitation of clients and their funding, has compromised the operations of Mr. Starr in his pursuit of the various cases before his office. 
Mr. President, Members of this institution and of the respective parties have at various times praised or criticized the Attorney General in the performance of her responsibilities. Perhaps the fact that she has been criticized from all quarters for so many decisions is the best testament of her native integrity. Janet Reno is as capable an Attorney General as the United States has ever been fortunate enough to have in that office. I leave these judgments with her, knowing of her high integrity, her understanding of the importance of these cases, the profound impact on the administration of the U.S. Government and of justice itself, knowing that she will do with them what is right and proper. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

 Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the Fair Minimum Wage Act of 1998. I am proud to be an original co-sponsor of this crucial piece of legislation. 
Once again, we begin our fight for the dignity and respect of working Americans. Our goal is simple; to ensure that individuals dedicated to hard work and committed to their families no longer live in poverty. The fact is that while our nation is experiencing a time of unprecedented prosperity, nearly 12 million Americans earning the minimum wage still face a daily struggle to maintain an acceptable quality of life. 
Sixty years ago, Labor Secretary Frances Perkins successfully convinced our predecessors of the need to pass legislation that would guarantee low wage workers a decent living. Today, the need to maintain a basic level of income for American workers is no less necessary. Indeed, that need has never been greater. 
The statistics showing the economic injustice faced by low-wage workers are staggering. Full-time minimum wage workers earn only $10,712 year, $2,600 below the poverty level for a family of three. Given that fact, it should come as no surprise that 38 percent of the people seeking emergency food aid in 1996 were employed. 
One reason behind these disturbing statistics is the diminishing purchasing value of the minimum wage. Between 1980 and 1995, inflation rose by 86 percent, but during the same time, the minimum wage was increased by a paltry 37 percent, greatly reducing the purchasing power of American workers. While the minimum wage legislation we passed in 1996 was a bold step towards closing that gap, our work is not complete. And with each passing day, as inflation marches on, workers' purchasing power once again is falling. 
The legislation drafted by Senator Kennedy will take the steps necessary to restore and maintain the purchasing power of the minimum wage into the next century. 
As modest as our proposal is, The Fair Minimum Wage Act of 1998 will help guarantee low income workers a degree of economic dignity. It will increase the earnings of over 12 million workers, 60 percent of whom are women, 46 percent of whom are full-time workers, and 40 percent of whom are the sole breadwinners in their families. 
An increase in the minimum wage is also closely linked to the success of the 1996 welfare reform. Individuals struggling to make the difficult transition from welfare to work deserve the opportunity to become truly self sufficient. We need to provide an incentive to exchange welfare checks for paychecks. 
The Economic Policies Institute has concluded that, not only did low income families reap the majority of the benefits from the last increase, but minimum wage recipients experienced no disemployment effects. Despite the predictions made by our opponents, vulnerable groups, including teenagers and young adults, were not negatively effected by the increase. 
In closing, I would like to thank Senator Kennedy for drafting this legislation and for his tireless efforts on behalf of working Americans throughout his long career in the Senate. As he has said, this is the right thing to do. Put in the words of President Abraham Lincoln, `Labor is prior to, and independent of, capital. Capital is only the fruit of labor, and could never have existed if labor had not first existed.'

Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I know to many Americans it may be strange or bewildering with so many issues before the Congress that we are debating naming, honoring, Americans by placing their names on different public facilities. But who we honor, and the names we attach to public buildings and locations, matters. By whom we choose to honor, we set standards about ourselves. We communicate with future generations the qualities of people that we admire and the things in American history that are important. The Senator from Georgia has rightly noted the considerable contributions of former President Ronald Reagan. The Senator from Nevada, Mr. Reid, has offered an amendment of importance for another reason. 
Standards change. Nations learn conduct and behavior. No sooner had the Soviet Union fallen than statues of Stalin and Lenin tumbled to the streets. Samoza, Marcos, Batista had probably not even left office when their names and statues were removed from public places. 
In America through the years we have had despots of a different order, people who lived in a free society but did not always respect the law. They were part of the U.S. Government but not always in its best traditions. The Senator from Nevada has raised an issue before the Senate that the name of J. Edgar Hoover remains on the FBI building in Washington, DC. Every year, thousands of American schoolchildren wander down Pennsylvania Avenue to visit the FBI headquarters. Because the FBI now is often a model of law enforcement in our country, because the country has been fortunate to have Louis Freeh as its director, who respects the law and is in the highest traditions of our country, neither those schoolchildren nor many of our citizens, probably, remember or understand that there was a time when the Federal Bureau of Investigation's leadership, under J. Edgar Hoover, neither lived within nor always respected the law.

Mr. TORRICELLI. Upon J. Edgar Hoover's death, perhaps his closest colleague in the Bureau, William Sullivan, described Mr. Hoover as a `master blackmailer.' 
We now know from historians Mr. Hoover had compiled files on Presidents of the United States and Members of Congress through illegal surveillance and wiretapping, holding dossiers on leaders of the U.S. Government. It was a practice of blackmail. It changed policies. It threatened America. And it was wrong. 
Probably no one of his time, through subterfuge, within the U.S. Government, had a more adverse impact on the civil rights movement. He vigorously dispatched agents of the U.S. Government to harass the leadership of the NAACP. He called leading civil rights organizations `Communist fronts.' Indeed, he instructed agents to stand by and watch as racist mobs would beat up voter registration workers and civil rights workers in organized and lawful marches. To the extent that he harassed Martin Luther King, former Vice President Walter Mondale called J. Edgar Hoover `a disgrace to every American.' 
I don't know how we explain to American schoolchildren who leave their schools to honor Martin Luther King, who learn in our classrooms about the American Constitution, our respect for laws, that when they visit this proud Capital of our country, the most prominent name on the most prominent street in America is J. Edgar Hoover. But I know this, the Senator from Nevada is right, that it is a contradiction that should be removed, an explanation that no longer need be made. It is time to remove the name of J. Edgar Hoover from the FBI building. And if it is not enough that we suspected all along his intimidation of Presidents and his violation of basic rights, his biographers now give us more than enough reason. If you don't respect the Constitution, or civil rights, or civil liberties, Mr. Hoover lived outside the laws that he pretended to uphold. 
It is now known that he had secret relationships with underworld boss Frank Costello, whose primary duties in organized crime including fixing games of chance and horse races. Gambling tips were given to Mr. Hoover, so he was able to support a lifestyle and live with income outside of the law. He had close contacts with members of New York's organized crime families as well, who he refused to investigate, or even acknowledge that they were a public policy problem for more than a decade. It is now claimed that outside of these illegal acts, within the bureau itself he used hundreds of thousands of dollars of public money for his own personal use. 
The Senator from Nevada has brought before the Senate a painful decision, because it requires an honest reflection on a period of history of our own country. 
Mr. Hoover was not in the best traditions of this country. And in a time when many fear that civil liberties in our country are sometime threatened, no longer from without but from within, it is a valuable message not only to our own people but, indeed, to law enforcement that we honor people not only who enforce the law but who live within it. 
As Richard Cohen of the Washington Post observed in 1990: 
You affect the future, by what you do with the past and how you interpret it. All over the world, when regimes change, so do names. Danzig becomes Gdansk. Images of Lenin come down all over Eastern Europe, and in the Soviet Union, Stalingrad becomes Volgograd. These are all political statements. They say, `there's a new way of doing things.' 
Mr. President, exactly, there is a new way of doing things. 
The Senator from Georgia offers the name of Ronald Reagan because Ronald Reagan makes us proud. He was the right way of doing things in our country, whether you agree with the naming of the airport or you do not. Mr. Hoover is an indication of the wrong way of doing things in America. I support the amendment offered by the Senator from Nevada. I am proud to offer it with him. I yield the floor. 
Mr. REID addressed the Chair.

 Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today to extend my best wishes to Stephen N. Adubato on his 65th birthday. Steve's belief in his community and dedication to improving the education standards in New Jersey are just two examples of his lifelong commitment to public service. On his birthday, I would like to convey my thoughts to a good friend and valued colleague. 
As the founder and Executive Director of the North Ward Center, Inc., he has created a central location for more than fifteen social service, community education and economic development programs for the Newark community. With the recent opening of the Newark Business Training Institute, Steve has continued his commitment to the community by assisting men and women in the transition from welfare to work. 
Steve has made innumerable contributions to the education of New Jersey students. As a teacher and counselor in Newark, his leadership in education reform and superior teaching skills insured that children received the kind of education they deserved. Steve's commitment to education is a true testament to his compassion and desire to help students in the State of New Jersey. 
As we search for ways to revitalize the once flourishing city of Newark, I have been impressed by Steve's ideas and goals for the area. The economic and social progress we have seen in Newark's North Ward is a direct result of Steve's efforts. He has single-handedly improved this area of the city so that it now serves as a model for urban development. This is a great deal to have accomplished in 65 short years, but Steve is clearly no stranger to hard work. 
Steve Adubato's dedication to the Newark community and the State of New Jersey make it an honor for me to be able to recognize him as he celebrates his birthday. I wish him the best on this special day, and I hope he will enjoy 65 more years of happiness.

Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, the State of the Union Address last evening reminds me of the words of President Kennedy who in 1962 came before the Nation and he said, `It is my responsibility to report on the state of the Nation but it is all of our responsibility to improve it.' 
Increasingly that is a responsibility that is being met. It is incredible now to remember that when President Clinton assumed office 5 years ago there was projected to be in 1998 a Federal budget deficit of $357 billion. Indeed, in the budget that the President is about to submit there is a $10 billion deficit. And the reality is within a year the U.S. Government for the first time in 30 years will be conducting its affairs in a fiscal surplus. 
For 3 decades, six Presidents of both political parties in their State of the Union Addresses have had it incumbent upon them to distribute pain--not to challenge the Nation to meet problems but to distribute sacrifice because of mounting deficits that left the U.S. Government with no choice. 
There have indeed been many victims of the deficit. It is common to talk about them in terms of taxpayers having to pay an ever larger share of their income in Federal tax with an ever-larger share of their taxes going to interest on the national deficit. The taxpayers were not the only victims. The Federal 
deficit made victims out of children who never got the education they required. Students were never able to continue with assistance into higher education because of programs we could not pass; young families that could not get day care, and people, mothers and fathers, who could not follow opportunities because of it. There were many victims of the Federal deficit, and we each now need to be reminded that the country's budget evolved into a surplus. 
Alan Greenspan may have said it best when he said we cannot just balance the Federal budget and think that our work is complete for if there is no investment in the Nation's future then we have still failed. That, Mr. President, is where we find ourselves tonight. Part of our national mission is accomplished. There will be a Federal budget surplus. Now the question is are we wise enough to recognize where the sacrifices have been? Are we smart enough to plan for the future to assure that the economic growth that we are now experiencing can continue? 
Last night in the State of the Union Address the President outlined several specific investments that go to the core of this question, each in a way addressing an aspect of the national infrastructure. The first was Social Security. 
There are in our Nation 80 million members of my generation born in the years after the last world war. They have worked hard. They are saving diligently. They have participated in building this high-growth economy. Soon they begin to face retirement. The Social Security trust fund through their savings and participation will continue to run a surplus through the year 2014. The current projections are that the same trust fund will expire by the year 2031. 
Last night the President left us with a simple challenge. In facing the Federal budget surplus let's deal with Social Security first. Let this generation of Americans now retire. My generation who will be facing it in all too few years know the trust funds will be secure, permanent. Let's begin that planning now. 
Second, the President recognized that in the 21st century the foundation of our Nation's economy and perhaps its principal national infrastructure will be our educational institutions. As certainly as in the 17th century it may have been the construction of canals, as certainly as in the 18th and 19th century it may have evolved into railroads to most certainly what now are institutions of higher learning in our schools. 
As part of the program to deal with this reality, the President challenged us to create a Federal program to hire 100,000 new teachers to enable the Nation to reduce the class size for first, second, and third graders to 18 students, an extraordinary challenge with everything that it could mean for expanding the quality of American schools. But it did more.  
Recognizing that smaller school classes is going to mean the need for more classrooms and facing the reality that fully two-thirds of all American schools are now substandard, two-thirds have at least one serious construction problem that must be addressed, potentially $100 billion worth of necessary construction to bring America's schools up to standards, the President recommended a program whereby the Federal Government would not build the schools; that responsibility would remain local. But we could reduce the cost of the construction by the Federal Government paying the interest on the loans of local governments and State governments to build those schools. 
Third, the President challenged this Congress to continue progress on access to quality health care in America. Two years ago, this Congress assured that Americans could change their jobs without losing their health care. This Congress assured that if a member of a family was taken ill, they would not lose their health care because they made use of it. Two years ago, we did right by the American people in expanding our health care opportunities. And a year ago we did so again, adding 5 million American children, previously uninsured, without access to the system. We brought them into health care insurance through the Government. 
Now the question is even larger. The President challenged us in the State of the Union Address to deal with the reality of 160 million Americans who now have their health care delivered through managed care systems. I know something of this issue because only a week ago in New Jersey, meeting with 100 individuals, many of whom had had difficulties with their managed care systems, I heard the stories that Americans are experiencing every day--members of managed care systems who could not get the truth of their own files, people who needed to see specialists but were denied, people whose privacy had been violated, people who traveled needing access to emergency rooms and could not get it because care would not be received through their managed care program. 
The President's challenge last evening was we can make managed care work, and, indeed, in reducing costs it has worked. We have gone from 12 and 13 and 14 percent annual increases in the cost of health care to 2.5 percent last year. But saving money is only half the equation. The remainder is assuring that what has been the finest quality care system in the world in the United States is maintained and that managed care complements that system and does not frustrate it. 
Fourth, the President recognized the reality that fully 60 percent of American women today with children, with homes to maintain, are also in the work force--not always by choice, certainly not usually by luxury. But with the cost of raising children and maintaining a home today, two family incomes are often a necessity, and yet in modern America the ambitions of these women, the needs of these families are frustrated because they cannot get affordable child care. It is hard to imagine any higher priority today for young working families in America than assuring quality, safe, affordable child care. Indeed, America remains almost alone in the world in not helping our families meet this urgent need and responsibility. 
Through tax credits for businesses, through a larger child care tax credit for working families, the challenge has been laid before the Congress. More directly, the President said, `Not a single American family should ever have to choose between the job they need and the child they love.' Exactly, Mr. President, and that is the challenge before this Congress. 
And yet, finally, I recognize that having fought all of these years to balance the Federal budget, to reach the point where an American President could honestly predict a surplus in our finances, we achieve nothing if we meet these responsibilities but require higher taxes on American families that cannot afford the increased burden. It is notable that this balanced budget has been achieved and some of these social objectives already met while the country has the lowest tax burden on middle-income families in 20 years. But it is important still to recognize that that burden can still be eased more through targeted, responsible tax cuts that do not add to the deficit but help meet some of these social objectives-- tax cuts to encourage and expand child care, targeted tax cuts to help with the cost of financing education, tax cuts that encourage savings and investment to maintain this rapid economic growth that is producing these extraordinary revenues. 
Mr. President, this is an extraordinary time in the life of our country. We can do good and great things but not by resting on what we have achieved. This economy has not grown, our people are not productive, our industries are not competitive, we are not leading the world in finance and industry, no less in diplomacy, statesmanship and military power because we have learned to rest but, rather, because we have learned to challenge --not because we live off the growth of previous years, the investments of other generations but because we invest and save ourselves. That challenge remains with us tonight, not to accept things as they are but to invest, to educate, to build, 
There is a quote that I have through the years always 
admired from an architect in Chicago, Daniel Burnham, who said in 1909 to his colleagues, `Make no little plans, for they have no magic to stir men's blood and will probably never be realized. Make big plans.' Last night, in his State of the Union Address, President Clinton made before the Nation an ambitious agenda. It is a big plan worthy of a big and a great nation. 
I hope and trust in this final year of the 105th Congress our vision will be as big, our action will be as bold as the State of the Union Address this Congress heard last night from President Clinton. 
Madam President, with that, if I could, I should like to yield to the Senator from Oregon.

Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, almost 10 years ago I had an opportunity in visiting Baghdad to meet with Saddam Hussein and members of his cabinet. 
I went to Iraq because of a brutal and seemingly endless conflict between the armies of Iran and Iraq that were consuming hundreds of thousands of lives. Like many people in our Government, I was concerned about how this would impact the region, and whether, indeed, it threatened world peace. I left Baghdad with unmistakable impressions of Saddam Hussein who continued to influence my own judgment, and which I revisit now--that we are on the verge of yet another conflict with the army of Iraq. 
President Hussein knew little of the Western World, and profoundly misunderstood the United States. Because we are a good and a decent people willing to engage in dialog, it was interpreted as a lack of resolve; a failure of will. 
It was for these reasons when President Bush sent American forces to the Persian Gulf that I was proud as a Member of the House of Representatives to be the Democratic sponsor of the war resolution. 
In the years since American men and women triumphed in the Persian Gulf war to uphold the will of the United Nations and serve the best traditions of our country, the Saddam Hussein that I met on that day has not only not changed; he remarkably seems to have learned very little. 
His rape and pillage of Kuwait is now known to have included not simply combatants but thousands of innocent Kuwaiti citizens. Six years after his retreat from Kuwait he continues to hold 620 unaccounted for Kuwaiti civilians. Upon his retreat he torched the land with oil fires and sullied the water, creating the largest oilspill and oil fires in history. 
In 1988, he employed mustard gas against his own people killing more than 5,000 Kurds. 
The Saddam Hussein that America met in the Persian Gulf war was not an isolated departure from good judgment. It was part of a long record of brutality against his own people and his neighbors. 
Today we are on the verge of yet another conflict with Saddam Hussein, because not only is there a long tradition of such irresponsible international behavior but because nothing seemingly has changed. 
In 1992, he violated the terms of the gulf war cease-fire by moving antiaircraft missiles into northern and southern Iraq. The world responded. The coalition held. And more than 100 United States, British, and French planes fired on missile stations. 
A year later--in 1993--still not having learned the price of his misjudgements, Saddam Hussein ordered an attempt on the life of former President George Bush. President Bush was visiting Kuwait. Not only was Saddam Hussein not humbled in the face of the victor; he planned an assassination leading to an American military response against his intelligence headquarters. 
In 1994, he sent battalions of Iraqis 20 miles north of the Kuwaiti border. Again, the United States needed to respond and 40,000 troops were again sent to the Persian Gulf. 
And, last year, despite a willingness by the United Nations to begin easing sanctions in order to ease the pain on the Iraqi people in a food for oil program that was instituted, Saddam Hussein responded by military attack against the Kurds in the town of Erbil needing a response with the oil for food program. 
There are few comparisons in contemporary history of any leader in any government that has so routinely miscalculated at the disadvantage of his government and himself. 
The Saddam Hussein that I met a decade ago may not have understood much about the world, or his place in it, the relative power of his country as opposed to potential adversaries, the use of technology, his measure of international will--his misunderstanding of the United States may have been legendary--but it is almost unbelievable that with these annual confrontations, this extraordinary record of miscalculations, that virtually nothing seems to have been learned. 
What more is necessary to be understood about the resolve of the United States? This Government is clearly prepared to pay the price to maintain the peace in the Middle East. This country has a deep determination to deny Saddam Hussein every and all classes of weapons of mass destruction. 
The United States will provide leadership for international response when necessary, but clearly is both capable and willing to act unilaterally if required. 
What is it, Saddam Hussein, that you do not understand about the world resolve? And what is it about us that could still be unclear? 
Last month, this long and extraordinary record of miscalculation added yet another chapter. Saddam Hussein barred access to U.N. weapons inspectors under the pretext that they included American citizens. He challenged the right of the United States to be a part of the inspection teams of the United Nations, and asked rhetorically by what right we would be present. 
Saddam Hussein, it comes to mind that the United States has about 500,000 reasons why we have a right to participate and will demand full compliance--a reason for every man and woman that left family, friends and home to put their lives on the line in the Persian Gulf war to end your occupation of Kuwait. And those 500,000 reasons have not yet run their course. They will stand for a long time. 
The record since the United Nations began the inspections to ensure compliance with its resolutions has not been without success. 
Since 1991, U.N. inspectors have found and destroyed more illegal weapons in Iraq than were destroyed during the entire Persian Gulf war. Surveillance cameras to monitor weapons activities were installed. This is a regime imposed by the United Nations of weapons inspection that has and can yield real results. But, as we now stand on the verge of yet another military confrontation, it is necessary to face the unmistakable and painful truth that there is no reason to believe that anything has changed in Baghdad. 
This week, the Washington Times revealed that Saddam Hussein has been intending to buy five electronic warfare systems that would allow him to detect and destroy radar-evading aircraft. 
The weapons markets of the world have routinely been contacted by Iraqi agents and representatives still seeking military technology. 
This is important lest we fail to understand that the strategy of frustrating U.N. inspectors and noncompliance is not happening in a vacuum. It is part of an ongoing strategy to restore military capability. 
The lessons of the Persian Gulf war and our experience through our sacrifices have yielded more than simply the destruction of these weapons. There is another great lesson that the Persian Gulf war has left the United States, the United Nations and the international community. It is, first, that the international community is capable of acting in concert for common purpose, but it is also that there is by definition a class of nations with leaders who are easily identifiable who are so irresponsible by their actions, who act in such contempt of international normal standards of conduct and international law that the international community will take it upon itself to deny them aspects of their own sovereignty. 
Of all the things that Saddam Hussein failed to learn about us and our resolve and our capability or the international community's ability to act in concert it is the single lesson that is the foundation of the current crisis. Saddam Hussein will not be allowed to have weapons of mass destruction or wage war on his own people or regain great military capability because as a consequence of the Persian Gulf war and the invasion of Kuwait, the international community has decided to deny him that sovereign right of other nations to possess certain weapons and conduct their own affairs today, tomorrow and potentially forever. 
It is not only a lesson of the Persian Gulf war; it is a gift of this generation to succeeding generations that something has been learned by the history of the 20th century. And the primary pupil of this lesson will be Saddam Hussein, in life or in death, today or tomorrow, one way or another. 
I know every Member of this Senate, indeed, the entire U.S. Government, is in prayerful hope that military confrontation is avoided. In an age when military weapons hold such power and the destructive capability is so great, conflict must always be avoided when possible. That is our nature. It speaks well of our people that this is our resolve. 
Saddam Hussein, with so many miscalculations, so many mistakes that caused so much harm for your people, do not miscalculate again. 
There is in this Senate, I know, nothing but affection for the people of Iraq, an abiding hope that there will be a day when not only we can meet them again in friendship but the Members of this Senate may vote to send an ambassador of good intention and good will to Baghdad to normalize relations. Between this day and that is either the learning of a fundamental lesson by Saddam Hussein against all odds and all experience or that the people of Iraq take their future in their hands against extraordinary odds and regain responsible leadership. 
I do not know, Mr. President, how this crisis will be resolved. Indeed, no one could predict. Only that somehow we be understood and that somehow the United Nations obtain the strength and resolve to see its judgments fulfilled. All the frustration of these years and all the sacrifice from the international community can still have real meaning if this lesson will be learned not simply by Saddam Hussein but by all the dictators, all the despots to come who would abuse their people and wage war. If we can stand together here, finally have the lesson learned, all this will have had real meaning. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.  
Mr. COATS addressed the Chair.

Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Early Detection and Prevention of Osteoporosis and Related Bone Diseases Act of 1997 along with my colleague from Maine, Ms. Snowe. 
Osteoporosis and other related bone diseases pose a major public health threat. More than 28 million Americans, 80 percent of whom are women, suffer from, or are at risk for, osteoporosis. Between three and four million Americans suffer from related bone diseases like Paget's disease or osteogenesis imperfecta. Today, in the United States, 10 million individuals already have osteoporosis and 18 million more have low bone mass, placing them at increased risk. 
Osteoporosis is often called the `silent disease' because bone loss occurs without symptoms. People often do not know they have osteoporosis until their bones become so weak that a sudden bump or fall causes a fracture or a vertebra to collapse. Every year, there are 1.5 million bone fractures caused by osteoporosis. Half of all women, and one-eighth of all men, age 50 or older, will suffer a bone fracture due to osteoporosis. 
Osteoporosis is a progressive condition that has no known cure; thus, prevention and treatment are key. The Early Detection and Prevention of Osteoporosis and Related Bone Diseases Act of 1997 seeks to combat osteoporosis, and related bone diseases like Paget's disease and osteogenesis imperfecta, in two ways. 
First, the bill requires private health plans to cover bone mass measurement tests for qualified individuals who are at risk for developing osteoporosis. Bone mass measurement is the only reliable method of detecting osteoporosis in its early stages. The test is non-invasive and painless and is as predictive of future fractures as high cholesterol or high blood pressure is of heart disease or stroke. This provision is similar to a provision in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 that requires Medicare coverage of bone mass measurements. 
Second, the Early Detection and Prevention of Osteoporosis and Related Bone Diseases Act authorizes $1,000,000 to fund an information clearinghouse and $50,000,000 in each fiscal year 1999 through 2001 for the National Institutes of Health to expand and intensify its effort to combat osteoporosis and other bone-related diseases. 
Funding for research on osteoporosis and related bone diseases is severely constrained at key research institutes like the National Institute on Aging. Further research is needed to improve prevention and treatment of these devastating diseases. 
Money spent now on prevention and treatment will help defray the enormous costs of these diseases in the future. Currently, osteoporosis costs the United States $13,000,000,000 every year. The average cost of repairing a hip fracture, a common effect of osteoporosis, is $32,000. 
Because osteoporosis is a progressive condition and affects primarily aging individuals, reductions in the incidence or severity of osteoporosis will likely significantly reduce osteoporosis-related costs under the Medicare program. 
Medical experts agree that osteoporosis and related bone diseases are highly preventable. However, if the toll of these diseases is to be reduced, the commitment to prevention and treatment must be significantly increased. With increased research and access to preventive testing, the future for definitive treatment and prevention is bright.

Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, today, Senators, Akaka, Feinstein, Kerry, and I rise to introduce legislation to end the use of the steel jaw leghold trap. I rise to draw this country's attention to the many liabilities of this outdated device and ask for my colleagues support in ending its use. 
This important and timely issue now takes on added importance as the European Union proposes to ban the importation of U.S. fur caught with this class of trap. By ending the use of the leghold trap within our borders, we will effectively set a humane standard for trapping, as well as protect the U.S. fur industry by keeping Europe's doors open to U.S. fur. 
While this bill does not prohibit trapping, it does outlaw a particularly savage method of trapping by prohibiting the import or export of, and the interstate shipment of steel jaw leghold traps and articles of fur from animals caught in such traps. 
The steel jaw leghold trap is a cruel and antiquated device for which many alternatives exist. The American Veterinary Medical Association and the American Animal Hospital Association have condemned leghold traps as inhumane and the majority of Americans oppose the use of this class of trap. Currently, 89 nations have banned these cruel devices, and have done so with broad-based public support. In addition, Colorado and Massachusetts have joined Rhode Island, Florida and my home State of New Jersey in banning the trap. 
One quarter of all U.S. fur exports, $44 million, go to the European market. Of this $44 million, $21 million would be eliminated by the ban. This would clearly cause considerable economic damage to the U.S. fur industry, an important source of employment for many Americans. Since many Americans rely on trapping for their livelihood, it is imperative to find a solution which prevents the considerable damage that this ban would cause to our fur industry. It is important to note that since the steel-jaw leghold trap has been banned in Europe, alternatives have been provided to protect and maintain the European fur industry. 
Our Nation would be far better served by ending the use of the archaic and inhumane steel jaw leghold trap. By doing so, we are not only setting a long-overdue humane standard for trapping, we are ensuring that the European market remains open to all American fur exports.

Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, this Congress is engaged in a great debate about giving the President of the United States virtually unrestricted authority to engage and negotiate with other nations in what has been termed fast-track authority. 
Capital markets and international political leaders are waiting to see whether or not this Congress will grant that authority to the President of the United States. 
To some, the debate has already been defined as either one of 
believing in free trade or returning to protectionism. I believe that that is a disservice to this Congress and indeed to the debate itself because the issue is extraordinarily more complex. 
The United States needs no lectures about the advantages or the pursuit of free trade nor, indeed, does this Congress. In Bretton Woods, the Kennedy Round, the Uruguay Round, the United States has both led and constructed the current system both in monetary and trade relations. 
This country understands that free, unfettered trade, the opening of international markets, is the very foundation of both our own and international prosperity. This generation's standard of living has been based on the lessons of each of these agreements. 
As a result, the United States has become the largest importing nation in the world. Indeed, although the United States has an economy that is smaller than the combined economies of the European community, we import more than twice the industrialized product from the developing world. 
This trade has been not without benefit to even those industries which seemingly have suffered the most. Although there have been serious dislocations in key industrial industries, like autos and steel and new products like semiconductors and computers, the current competitiveness and efficiency of even these industries have benefited by international trade and competition. 
Indeed, it is because of this enhanced efficiency in competition that I supported fast-track authority in 1988, supported the Canada-U.S. Free Trade Agreement and most recently the GATT agreement. 
I take the Senate floor today because I have reached my own conclusion that when asked to vote in this body, I will not support fast-track authority as currently requested by the President of the United States this year. I do so despite a long history of supporting similar authority and as one who believes strongly in free trade as enhancing American competitiveness and it being essential to America's quality of life, because I believe the United States has reached an important crossroads in our trade strategy. 
Like many Americans, I am simply not convinced that the U.S. Government has a strategy to maximize benefits in current trade agreements. I do not fear the competition of foreign trade. I simply fear that our negotiators are not prepared to protect and defend our national interests with a coherent strategy. 
I base my conclusion on four principal problems. 
First, over 4 decades, by necessity, through the cold war and in times of threats to our national security, it became necessary for the United States on occasion to compromise in our trade strategy in order to engage in the protection of other important national interests. 
By necessity, whether it was to secure Philippine military bases or the cooperation of Korean or Turkish or a host of other allies, the United States would set apart our trade objectives in order to secure national security concerns. 
Even now while American intellectual property rights are being compromised in China, we are being told that this is necessary for the political engagement of the People's Republic of China. 
Mr. President, my first objection to fast-track authority to the President is these agreements on trade must stand for economic purposes of their own weight. The American people and this Congress must be convinced the country is pursuing a coherent trade strategy without compromise for other purposes. 
Second, it is critical that this Congress be convinced that our trade negotiators are using the leverage of those seeking access to our market to its maximum advantage. In negotiating NAFTA, the United States afforded Mexico the most important advantage that any nation economically could ever seek. That is, to gain access to the American market for their products. But we did so without using all of the leverage available to the United States. So Mexico, a country that is a principal conduit for narcotics into the United States, a source of massive illegal immigration to the United States, a nation which does not allow access to American products or investment without reservation, was afforded the opportunities of NAFTA without, by necessity, conceding cooperation on all these fronts. So in my mind, Mr. President, the second reason for a reservation in proceeding with fast-track authority is that the United States is not using its principal leverage in negotiating with other nations. 
Third, Mr. President, in my mind, is the legitimate concern about the pace of international economic integration. Mr. President, during this debate, both in this body and in the other, no one will be quoted more often than Adam Smith. Indeed, to my mind, there is no man who has been read less and quoted more often than Adam Smith in his `Wealth of Nations.' For my third reason in objecting to fast-track authority, I return to his treatise of more than two centuries ago when he said, `. . . freedom of trade should be restored only by slow gradations, and with a good deal of reserve and circumspection. Were those high duties and prohibitions taken away all at once . . . the disorder which this would occasion might no doubt be very considerable.' 
Mr. President, free trade is a national objective, but like other human virtues, it may never be fully realized. It is forever pursued, but it requires so many changes in culture and values and so many complications that it must remain a goal, understanding it may never be realized. Every Member of this institution recognizes that fast-track authority and opening the American market involves a host, indeed hundreds, of different industries that compromise many communities and their economic strength. It is understood and recognized that, like manufacturing, certain high-labor-intensive industries have no long-term future in the American economy. 
As Adam Smith warned two centuries ago, that does not mean that with haste or even immediacy they must be subjected to their demise. There are industries in this country that employ thousands, if not millions, of people who live on the economic margins of our society who have no other economic choice. The 50- or 60-year-old textile worker who may have lived in this country for generations, or be new to our land, who may speak English or may not, who may be educated or may have the bare minimum of education, will not in a single generation or with the stroke of a pen be transformed from a textile worker to a computer technician. 
American trade policy with a goal of free trade must be realistic and fair to all elements of this society and must take into account the very disorder of which Adam Smith warned only that we be accommodating. 
Mr. President, finally, a fourth and final reason that I believe this Senate should withhold fast-track authority on this occasion. 
It is based on a series of judgments that this Congress reached a long time ago. It has become, I believe, standard in this country, almost without reservation, to believe that it is appropriate, from bans on child labor to a reasonable minimum wage, to the human rights organized labor unions, to just and fair environmental standards. But our country now, in the decision to engage itself in free and open global trade, needs to reach a judgment. How is it we keep these basic commitments without engaging in an extraordinary and even hypocritical contradiction? At this moment in time, the Nation wants both to maintain these high moral standards, some of which have transcended generations, but at the same time to take advantage of the inexpensive products, the economic opportunities of importations where workers have no right to organize, nonexistent or unenforced minimum wage and, in many cases, almost no protections against child labor, and a minimum of environmental standards. 
The difference, Mr. President, is whether or not the United States will, in some cases, engage in exploitation, not whether or not the United States will engage in free trade. I believe, therefore, Mr. President, that on this occasion, with a commitment to free trade and an understanding of the need and necessity for the United States to engage in free, fair, and open competition, this Congress should not grant unrestricted authority to the President of the United States to engage in trade negotiations, without reserving for ourselves the right to ensure that there is a trade strategy that encompasses the goal of reaching trade balance, dealing with structural imbalances that, by necessity, are arising from countries that continue to protect their own markets. And we deal with these inherent contradictions of how we maintain both a standard of living for those in our country who cannot quickly adjust to the competition, the contradictions of maintaining environmental labor standards, while allowing access to our market to those who do not. 
This will require a trade strategy by the Executive that, to my judgment, has not yet been defined and may not yet exist. I do hope, however, Mr. President, that this is understood for what it is--not a retreat, not protectionism, just forcing this country, at long last, to begin to define a real and lasting trade strategy. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, every year, over 14 million students and their parents agonize over where to attend college. They spend months researching schools and visiting campuses in an effort to find the perfect fit. At the top of the list of characteristics students and their parents look for in a school is a safe learning environment. Information is the key to choosing such an environment. Under current law, students and their parents do not have access to all the information necessary to make an informed choice. 
Current law requires colleges and universities to report statistics on crimes that occur on their campuses. However, colleges are only required to report those hate crimes that result in murder, rape, or aggravated assault. These three categories of crimes only represent 16 percent of the total number of hate crimes that occur on college campuses every year. Vandalism, harassment, and simple assault comprise the vast majority of hate crimes. Under current law, however, colleges are not required to report these crimes. 
Current law also does not require colleges and universities to report hate crimes against women and the disabled. Thus, parents of daughters or disabled students have no idea whether the college to which they will send their children is safe. 
Students and parents have the right to information about all hate crimes committed on their prospective college campuses. My bill, the Campus Hate Crimes Right to Know Act of 1997, will ensure that they have access to that information. 
The Campus Hate Crimes Right to Know Act does two very important things: it expands college reporting requirements to include all hate crimes, not just those that result in murder, rape and aggravated assault; and, it includes gender and disability in the class protected by the reporting requirement. Under current law, colleges need only report hate crimes motivated by race, religion, sexual orientation, and ethnicity. My bill will cover these four categories plus gender and disability. 
Our Nation's college campuses should be a refuge from crime, particularly heinous attacks motivated by hatred and bigotry. The disturbing truth, however, is that college campuses are often fertile ground for bigotry. A recent study done by the Maryland Prejudice Institute reported that 25 percent of minority college students attending predominantly white colleges have been victimized by hate. In 1996, 90 incidents of anti-Semitic activity on college campuses were reported to the Anti-Defamation League. 
In September 1996, 60 Asian-American college students at a California university received threats from another student via e-mail messages threatening that all Asian-Americans would be hunted and killed. Under current law, this offense would not appear on a campus crime report. 
The Campus Hate Crimes Right to Know Act will provide students and their parents with vital information so that they may better protect themselves against such crimes. It will also encourage college officials to raise awareness about these crimes and develop programs and strategies to combat them. 
The damage done by hate crimes goes beyond physical injury. Hate crimes, whether they take the form of painting a swastika on someone's dorm room door or gang beating a student believed to be gay, leave the victim feeling fearful, vulnerable, and isolated. 
Our children are our future. Their college years are among the most exciting and formative of their lives. By introducing the Campus Hate Crimes Right to Know Act of 1997, I hope to empower students and parents with all of the information necessary to ensure that those years are as safe as possible.

Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, under the original provisions of the Senate authorization bill for intelligence, Senator Shelby and Senator Kerrey contained in the authorization a provision reasserting the right of the Congress to know the truth about activities of the intelligence agencies. 
The provision directed the President to tell all Federal employees that they can inform the Congress without fear of reprisal and prosecution of activities in which the intelligence agencies were involved. It was put into a provision. Indeed, the purpose of the provision was whether or not intelligence agencies were involved in improper or illegal activities. 
The provision pointed out that Members of Congress have a clear right to know such information, and, indeed, constitutionally, since they are charged with oversight responsibility, cannot meet their constitutional duties without Federal employees knowing that they not only have the right and the responsibility but, indeed, are free to provide this information without retribution. 
Tragically, under the direction of some of the President's senior advisers, it was suggested that the President might veto the entire bill unless this provision were removed. 
I rise today to compliment Senator Shelby, Senator Kerrey, and the Intelligence Committee, and, indeed, this entire Senate for insisting upon this provision; and, at the same time to say with regret that it has been removed from the legislation. 
It is hard to exaggerate the potential impact of the removal of this provision. The secret agency of the Government is overseen by only two congressional committees--both select committees, which meet understandably in secrecy. Those committees are charged with overseeing all of the intelligence agencies of this Government. But they rely upon the fact that the leadership of the intelligence community will come to the committee with truthful testimony and report on its activities. There is no one to rely upon but the leadership of the intelligence community itself. All other committees of the Congress know about the whistle-blower statutes. Federal employees will come forward if there are illegal activities in this Government, or improper activities. 
The intelligence committee has no such assurance with regard to intelligence agencies of this Government. The Congress recognized this fact. Senator Shelby and Senator Kerrey recognized this fact. They acted appropriately. 
It is with great regret that in voting for this conference report today I must report and note that the provision--that simple protection to allow this Congress to meet its responsibility--is no longer contained in the bill. 
I do, however, note and compliment the Intelligence Committee for they have rejected unanimously the executive branch position as unconstitutional and have inserted language in the conference report making clear that the executive branch cannot unilaterally withdraw congressional prerogatives. So, while the original language is no longer contained in the bill, it is also made clear that the Congress is insisting upon its prerogatives. 
I hope, Mr. President, that President Clinton will rethink his position, and next year and in future years will return to the question of authorization of the intelligence community. We once again will be in a position to place into legislation clear and effective protections that this Congress will be assured that every employee of the Federal Government will know that they have a right and a responsibility to come to this Congress whenever they believe improper or illegal activities are taking place and that they can do so without fear of retribution. 
Mr. President, I support the conference report. But I do regret that the administration has insisted upon the removal of this very worthwhile provision. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. TORRICELLI. I thank the Senator from Georgia for yielding. 
Mr. President, through the years there has been no more compelling voice on the floor of this Senate for the interests of children and families than Senator Dodd. Today is no exception. Senator Dodd has made a compelling case for the need for child care in America. I could not agree more strongly. I wish he had a chance on this day to have his amendment offered, and I would join in voting with him. 
The choice before the Senate today is not a choice between Senator Coverdell's proposal and Senator Dodd. Both have merit. I would support each. Senator Coverdell's proposal is fully paid for by offsetting the elimination of a corporate deduction. It has no negative impact on the budget. It is paid for, as Senator Dodd's amendment, indeed, can also be paid for. 
What the Senate has before it today is a chance to escape this continuing nonproductive dialog about whether or not we will engage in vouchers for private school or leave the plight to private school students unanswered. Senator Coverdell has offered an imaginative answer by expanding what is indeed a proposal that the Senate adopted earlier in the year for HOPE scholarships offered by President Clinton. By that same concept of allowing families to save their own money to make their own choices for the education of their families, Senator Coverdell's proposal would be expanded to high school and grade school. 
It is an economic sense and a compelling answer to a real national dilemma. First, that the education of a child and some of those decisions be retained by families, where families use their own resources--not just mothers and fathers but aunts, uncles, sister and brothers--who may not be able to put away $2,000 or $2,500 in a year with limited resources, but can on every birthday and every anniversary and every holiday put away $10, $20, and $100 so that during the course of a child's life those resources are available, families are involved, using their money. 
Second, it isn't just a question of whether this money would 
be available for private school students. The Joint Committee on Taxation estimates that 70 percent of the families who would avail themselves of these resources would be public school students because under the proposal that money is available to buy home computers or transportation for extracurricular activities, school uniforms or, most importantly in my mind, after-school tutors to help with the advancing math and science curriculum in our schools. 
Third, also a compelling aspect of this case is not only is it private money, not only would much of it go to public school students, but it will also stop potentially the hemorrhaging loss of private schools in this country. A parochial school in America closes every week. We are not opening up enough public schools to make up the difference. At a time when education is the Nation's principal challenge to our economic well-being, the number of classrooms and chairs for American students is declining. This is the use of private savings, private resources, to stop that hemorrhaging loss. 
Critics argue this is money that is going to help the wealthiest families in America when we should be doing more for working families. On the contrary. First, there is a cap in the legislation of $95,000 for single filing taxpayers. Overwhelmingly, three-quarters of this money is going to families that earn less than $70,000 a year. This is the answer to giving working families a chance to get involved in the education of their children. 
Mr. President, I make no case for the procedures involved in this. There are worthwhile additions to this bill I would like to support. Senator Landrieu and Senator Graham have a worthwhile proposal for prepaid tuitions. I believe in Senator Dodd's proposal for day care and child care. I would like to see the Senate address both. Indeed, in time, I hope and I trust that we will. 
But on this day we address the question of whether or not families will be able to use their own resources to become involved in their own planning for their children's public or private education. This Congress has been presented with a series of challenges by the President. One was to address new resources to education. We do it. Second, to get families back involved. We do it. Third, he has stated a great national goal to get every school in America online into the new century. We go beyond it. Sixty percent of American families and 85 percent of minority students have no access to a home computer. They are not going to school on an equal basis with all other American students. They don't have it for their homework, they don't have it for composition, they don't have it for research. The Internet and those computers are the principal tool for American students in the 21st century. 
Under the Coverdell-Torricelli proposal not only will America schools be online but so will American families at home because these students can use these A-plus accounts to buy that equipment for home. 
Mr. President, I join with Senator Coverdell on this day, asking that this be a genuinely bipartisan answer for a genuinely bipartisan problem. Education is the American issue of these last years of the 21st century. It is the question of whether or not America maintains our standard of living and is economically competitive. Education is an issue without par in this Congress and in this country. This may not be a total answer. It is certainly not the last of the answer but it is an important addition for the labyrinth of issues and questions we must walk through in answering the education question. 
Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Georgia for yielding the time.

Mr. TORRICELLI. I thank the Senator from Georgia, Senator Coverdell, for yielding time to me. I am very proud to join with him in offering this proposal today. 
Mr. President, I think there is a growing awareness in our country that the status quo in education is no longer good enough, that there is a need for fundamental reform in the financing and the standards and our approach to educating our children in the grade school and high school levels. 
This legislation offers the promise of a new beginning in how we approach educational reform. In a time of limited budgets, as we seek to balance the Federal budget, we are marshaling private resources. At a time when families have been separated from the challenge of educating their own children, we are challenging families to get involved again. At a time when some are fighting between private education and public education, we seek to help both. 
Senator Coverdell and I do this in what I think is an imaginative approach, what really is no more than an extension of what President Clinton proposed to do and achieve with his HOPE scholarships for colleges, we do for high schools and grade schools. 
We do it in the following fashion: It is a challenge to all families of middle-income status--$95,000 and below. From the time of the birth of your child, you, uncles, aunts, grandparents, can put into a tax-free account, $10, $20, $100 a month, put money aside to prepare for the education of your child. In private school, parochial school, if you choose a yeshiva, or in public schools--indeed, the Joint Tax Committee has estimated 70 percent of this money will go for public school students--by allowing families to plan, recognizing that a public school education, is no longer a matter of 8:30 in the morning to 3 o'clock in the afternoon with just a teacher. The whole family has to get involved. 
Use this money to buy a home computer, pay for transportation after school so a student can get tutoring, extracurricular activities, or hire a public school teacher after school or on weekends to get involved in tutoring. It is the marshaling of family resources, family involvement, to help either complement that public education or allow for a private education. 
Now, the question becomes, is it wrong to even use these private resources to help with a private education? Unlike Senator Coverdell, I have, through the years, opposed the use of vouchers, because I thought it was a diversion of public resources at a time when the public schools cannot afford the loss of resources. I had constitutional reservations. On vouchers, we can all differ. This is not a voucher. There is not a constitutional issue because this is private money, not Government money. There is not an issue of compromising current resources for public education because this is private money, and it is new money. Not a single dollar is lost from the public schools by the use of these IRA's. But is it needed? For those who do not want to address the problem of private education, does it really help the 90 percent of American students who go to public schools? Absolutely. President Clinton has put a challenge down to the country: By the year 2000, every American school should be on line. But American students do their homework and research at home. Seventy percent of American students do not have a computer in the home. Eighty-five percent of black and Hispanic students do not have a computer at home. Under Mr. Coverdell's proposal, that would be allowed from these accounts. 
Mr. President, I thank the Senator for yielding the time. I am very proud to join with him in offering the A-plus accounts. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I am introducing this bill today, along with my colleague from New Jersey Senator Lautenberg, on behalf of Rosemarie D'Alessandro, the mother of a young girl murdered some 24 years ago in New Jersey. 
Mrs. D'Alessandro's 7-year-old daughter Joan was delivering Girl Scout cookies down the street from her Hillsdale home one day when Joseph McGowan, a high school chemistry teacher, destroyed her life and changed the lives of her family members forever. McGowan raped Joan, killed her, and dumped her broken, battered body in a ravine some 15 miles away--she was not found for 3 full days. 
For Joan's mom, Rosemarie, that shattering event was only the beginning of what would become a literal lifetime of trauma, pain and distress. Although the man who murdered Joan was put away for life, he has already had two parole hearings and is scheduled for another in 2003. 
And Rosemarie D'Alessandro cannot rest while these hearings go on. To make sure this murderer remains behind bars, Rosemarie must fight each and every day against the system that might free him, and must sit through appeal after appeal when he is denied release. 
But rather than becoming consumed with the tragedy that stole her daughter from her, Rosemarie D'Alessandro has used her grief and her anger to accomplish an astonishing goal--Joan's Law is now in the books in New Jersey, and now any child molester who murders a child under 14 in my State must receive life in prison without the possibility of parole. Rosemarie D'Alessandro stood up and told the world `enough is enough.' No other family should have to bear the double tragedy of suffering the loss of a child and then being forced to relive it over and over again through parole hearings and appeals. And no other family in New Jersey will ever have to again. 
Well, we do not have parole in the Federal system, but we can make sure that anyone who molests or commits a serious, violent crime against a child 14 or under will serve the rest of his life behind bars if that child dies. My bill states that any person who is convicted of a Federal offense defined as a serious violent felony should be sentenced either to death or imprisonment for life when the victim of the crime is under 14 years of age and dies as a result of the offense. 
Mr. President, with this bill, we intend to send the strongest possible message to anyone who would dare molest or attack a vulnerable child--do so at your own risk, because we will find you and we will put you behind bars for the rest of your life if that child dies. I hope my colleagues will quickly join me and Senator Lautenberg in passing this legislation, so that the inevitable tragedies that happen to children throughout America every day will no longer be compounded upon the families of those victims.

Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, within the next few days this Senate will vote upon a proposal that I have offered with Senator Coverdell, S. 1113--A-plus savings accounts. It is a proposal I know that many Members of the Senate are considering for the first time. I take the floor today to ask them to look carefully at its many provisions. 
Like many Members of my party, I have great reservation about the movement to vouchers in the various States and by the Federal Government. It has always been my concern that vouchers not only invite constitutional challenge, but inevitably results in a movement of resources from the public schools, where they are already too scarce, to private schools. 
The issue in my mind is not to move resources from public to private schools, but to increase resources for all schools. That is why, although I differ with Senator Coverdell and other Members of the Senate on vouchers, we have come together as Democrats and Republicans, provoucher and antivoucher Senators, on the issue of the A-plus savings accounts. 
Let us look at the facts about these savings accounts. 
First, there is not the use of public money. This is money that an individual or their employer or their labor union can put in a savings account for the education of a child in grade school or high school, therefore, there is not a constitutional issue and there is not a diversion issue of public educational resources to private schools. 
Second, where does this money go? And who does it help? The Joint Committee on Taxation estimates that almost 75 percent of the money that will be placed in these accounts actually would go to public school students because although we are allowing the accounts to be used to support tuition at parochial schools or other private schools, it also would be available for ancillary activities of public school students. 
Since 90 percent of American students go to public schools, these funds--available for computers, tutoring, after-school transportation--would, to a significant, indeed overwhelming extent, actually go to public school students. 
This is the right program at the right time, bringing the right resources to the students most in need. 
In many of our urban centers today, including in my own State of New Jersey--from Camden to Newark to Jersey City--if we lose our private schools, our parochial schools, we do not have the capacity in the public schools for those students. And many working-class, working-poor parents want this option. I do not know why we would deny it to them. 
Critics have said, `Well, this is only available to the rich.' But in fact for a single taxpayer, we have put a ceiling of $95,000. It is estimated that 70 percent of all of these resources would go to families that earn under $70,000 a year. 
An uncle can put $10 in an account every month for a favorite nephew or niece. A grandparent, at a birthday or Christmas, can put $100 or $200 in an account. A parent, from the time of birth, can put a few dollars away every month to ensure that their child is getting the high school or grade school education they want them to have. 
What can be wrong with that, getting the entire family involved in saving for a child's education? But if the option is public school--which it is overwhelmingly in the United States; and understandably so--then these funds are available to give a quality public school education. 
Sixty percent of all students in public schools in America today do not have a computer at home. Eighty-five percent of all minority students in the public schools do not have a computer at home. 
An overwhelming majority of public school students cannot afford a tutor, even if they are having trouble with math or science. These accounts are available for that tutoring and for that equipment. It gives a new advantage to parents who want to get engaged in their child's education in the public schools. 
For all of those reasons, I am asking, particularly members of my own party, to look once again at the Coverdell-Torricelli proposal for A-plus savings accounts. This escapes the central conflict over vouchers and strengthens both public and private education. 
No Member of this body today, no matter how they feel about vouchers, can possibly argue--when the United States is now being ranked 15th out of 18 nations in the quality of math performance by our students; near last in science education--no one can defend the status quo. No Member can honestly believe that a chance to bring new resources, private resources, to middle-income families who want to get engaged in their own child's education is a bad idea. 
We will, Mr. President, have a chance to obviously debate this at length when the bill is brought before the Senate. But here today, in anticipation of that debate, I wanted to ask Members of the Senate to use the time between this discussion and that debate to familiarize themselves with this proposal and the hope that we can genuinely have a good and bipartisan level of support in sending this bill, which has already passed the House, on to the President. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. TORRICELLI. I thank very much the Senator from South Carolina for yielding the time. 
Mr. President, I am very pleased to join in recommending to the Senate William Kennard to be Chairman of the Federal Communications Commission. 
By his record as general counsel, Mr. Kennard's tenure as Chairman of the Commission promises to be both able and insightful at a time of extraordinary technological change in the United States. 
Yesterday, at my request, this nomination was held until today so I would have an opportunity to meet with Mr. Kennard. What may be the best proof is former Speaker O'Neill's maxim that `all politics is local.' At a time when the Commission is dealing with great national and, indeed, global issues, in this moment of extraordinary change in the industry, I needed an opportunity to address with Mr. Kennard a continuing problem with the Commission in my own State of New Jersey. 
For 15 years my predecessor, Senator Bradley, brought to this body the continuing problem that the 8 million people of the State of New Jersey are largely without internal communication because of the dominance of Philadelphia and the city of New York in television and radio. Indeed, New Jersey alone, through most of this century, has been without a commercial television station until Senator Bradley led the effort to bring one of those licenses to the State of New Jersey. The State still, in its commercial, political and cultural development, is not properly served. That problem has now repeated itself with New Jersey's largest county, home to nearly a million people in Bergen County, NJ, which may be without FM radio service. I know in the great plethora of issues this does not seem like a significant question unless you live in the State of New Jersey. 
Bergen County, NJ, is host to more Fortune 500 corporations than all but a few counties in America. It is one of the highest income counties in the entire United States of America and, indeed, has more people than six States in the United States of America. But from everything from its internal political debate to news about emergencies within the county to the simple matter of school closings due to weather, people are unable to get basic information. Those licenses rest in the city of New York. Indeed, most of them should. But one, at least one of them, as, indeed, with one television station, should be in this area of suburban New Jersey. 
I spoke at length yesterday with Mr. Kennard. I am convinced that he is as sensitive to the problem that the Commissioners responded to for Senator Bradley on previous occasions and that under Mr. Kennard's leadership the Commission will respond as well in sensitivity to both the ongoing television problem but also this new dilemma of how to ensure a continued FM radio presence. Therefore, I was very pleased last night to have participated in asking that the nomination come to the floor today and am very pleased today to rise in support of Mr. Kennard's nomination. 
For years, the 840,000 residents of Bergen County have relied on local FM radio in order to receive valuable traffic, weather and news information, as well as popular music entertainment. Indeed, on multiple occasions, this service has served as a crucial link between the residents of Bergen County and critical emergency information. In 1996, when a water main break left over a half-million residents without water for nearly 3 days, a local FM station was the only source of live coverage from the scene of the break and the only source of continuous, round-the-clock reports throughout the emergency. Again during the recent explosion of the Napp Chemical plant in Lodi, NJ, a local FM station was the primary source of onsite news and information about the risks of possible toxic fumes which originated from the plant. Also, for years local FM service has provided extensive school closing reports during snowstorms, and notified the public of road conditions and other weather-related emergency information. 
However, the survival of FM service in Bergen County has recently been threatened by another Washington regulatory bureaucracy out of touch with the people it is supposed to serve: The Federal Communications Commission [FCC]. Mr. President, I am here today to ensure that the FCC does not succeed in ending FM service for Bergen County. This is a matter of principle, and it is the right thing to do for the residents of my State. Until the advent of local FM service, the residents of Bergen County had to rely upon radio stations in New York City to provide them with their news and information. Unfortunately, radio stations in New York City focus on the news and needs of the residents of that city, and oftentimes ignore those living in the New Jersey suburbs. 
Bergen County has more than 70 municipalities and school districts, six State legislative districts, two congressional districts, 231 square miles, and a population larger than the States of Alaska, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Vermont, Wyoming, and the District of Columbia. It is a county of tremendous size and importance, and it deserves an FM news and information source of its own. 
Yesterday, I met with William Kennard, the President's nominee to be Chairman of the FCC, and I am confident that the commissioners of the agency will work with my office to preserve FM service for Bergen County. If the FCC is to continue in its mission to ensure broadcast capability for the public interest, then the commissioners must end this instance of broadcast discrimination against the people of Bergen County, NJ. 
I yield my time to the Senator from South Carolina.

Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, today, Senators Graham, Mack, Sarbanes, Lautenberg, and I are introducing the National Estuary Conservation Act. I rise to draw this country's attention to our nationally significant estuaries that are threatened by pollution, development, or overuse. With 45 percent of the Nation's population residing in estuarine areas, there is a compelling need for us to promote comprehensive planning and management efforts to restore and protect them. 
Estuaries are significant habitat for fish, birds, and other wildlife because they provide safe spawning grounds and nurseries. Seventy-five percent of the U.S. commercial fish catch depends on estuaries during some stage of their life. Commercial and recreational fisheries contribute $111 billion to the Nation's economy and support 1.5 million jobs. Estuaries are also important to our Nation's tourist economy for boating and outdoor recreation. Coastal tourism in just four States--New Jersey, Florida, Texas, and California--totals $75 billion. 
Due to their popularity, the overall capacity of our Nation's estuaries to function as healthy productive ecosystems is declining. This is a result of the cumulative effects of increasing development and fast-growing year-round populations which increase dramatically in the summer. Land development, and associated activities that come with people's desire to live and play near these beautiful resources, cause runoff and stormwater discharges that contribute to siltation, increased nutrients, and other contamination. Bacterial contamination closes many popular beaches and shellfish harvesting areas in estuaries. Also, several estuaries are afflicted by problems that still require significant research. Examples include the outbreaks of the toxic microbe, Pfiesteria piscicida, in rivers draining to estuaries in Maryland and Virginia. 
Congress recognized the importance of preserving and enhancing coastal environments with the establishment of the National Estuary Program in the Clean Water Act Amendments of 1987. The program's purpose is to facilitate State and local governments preparation of comprehensive conservation and management plans for threatened estuaries of national significance. In support of this effort, section 320 of the Clean Water Act authorized the EPA to make grants to States to develop environmental management plans. To date, 28 estuaries across the country have been designated into the program. However, the law fails to provide assistance once plans are complete and ready for implementation. Already, 17 of the 28 plans are finished. 
As the majority of plans are now in the implementation stage, it is incumbent upon us to maintain the partnership the Federal Government initiated 10 years ago to insure that our nationally significant estuaries are protected. The legislation we are introducing will take the next step by giving EPA authority to make grants for plan implementation and authorize annual appropriations in the amount of $50 million. To insure the program is a true partnership and leverage scarce resources, there is a direct match requirement for grant recipients so funds will be available to upgrade sewage treatment plants, fix combined sewer overflows, control urban stormwater discharges, and reduce polluted runoff into estuarine areas.

Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, since the founding of our Republic, we have faced a dilemma as old perhaps as the concept of democracy itself. That is how the Nation is governed: With an informed electorate, but at the same time we can protect the national security by containing information which might be used against ourselves. 
This debate has largely, though not exclusively, been settled by the judgment that we are best served by informing the people so they can make the proper judgments about choosing the leadership of our country. 
Indeed, this is the philosophy that gave rise to the first amendment to the Constitution, but perhaps more exactly also to article I, section 9, which reads, `a regular Statement and Account of the Receipts and Expenditures of all public money shall be published from time to time.' 
There has, however, in spite of this general judgment of the need to govern the Nation based on the best possible information to the electorate, and in spite of this rather specific constitutional provision, been a notable and exceptional exception in the Nation's accounting. 
I speak obviously of the Central Intelligence Agency in its half-century determination to keep its accounting, its expenditures, private from the people of the United States. And, indeed, during both times of national conflict and in the broad period of the cold war it was a policy with a considerable rationale. 
The United States faced, in the Soviet Union, an adversary which if in possession of our expenditures of the intelligence community would learn a great deal about our national intentions and our capabilities. But now some 7 years after the end of the cold war, there is no longer a rationale for not sharing with the American people at least the aggregate amount of spending of the American intelligence community. 
I do not speak, obviously, of specific requirements for expenditures in individual programs or even broad categories of expenditures but whether or not the American people should be informed of the total aggregate spending since the United States no longer faces an adversary which, if in possession of that amount of expenditures, could make real use of it. 
Last Wednesday, George Tenet, the new Director of the Central Intelligence Agency, perhaps because of this changed situation, took a very important step. In response to a Freedom of Information Act request filed by the Federation of American Scientists, Director Tenet ended 50 years of what may have been unconstitutional secrecy and finally disclosed the aggregate budget numbers of the U.S. intelligence community. 
I take the floor today, Mr. President, to applaud President Clinton and Director Tenet for taking this first step, but note with some considerable regret that this judgment was made in response to a lawsuit filed against the administration not with the support of this Congress and, indeed, in spite of a vote taken in response to an amendment that I offered on the floor of this Senate. 
While I applaud Director Tenet, I also speak with regret that while the budget numbers were offered this year, they specifically were not made as a change in permanent policy, therefore, raising the specter that the American people are being provided this information in 1997, with the possibility they may never be given this information again. 
That perhaps leads to the most cynical interpretation of all, that what is really feared by the intelligence community is not the sharing of this aggregate amount of spending with foreign adversaries, but if the American people have this number they would be able to gauge this year to next, to next, and into the future whether or not the intelligence budget of this country is rising or falling, whether it is too large or too small. 
What is feared is that the American people will be as engaged in this debate as they are about Social Security spending or health care or education spending or even defense spending, which routinely is a part of the American political debate. 
A 1-year number provides precious little information for public debate about the adequacy or the excessive nature of our spending. What, of course, is peculiar about this inability to inform the public is that defense spending, equally or arguably far more important to national security, is so routinely debated. Perhaps that is the reason why defense spending in the Nation today, excluding intelligence, is now 4 percent lower than defense spending in 1980, why in real dollar terms there has been in the last 7 years such a dramatic reduction in defense expenditures, while according to the Brown report, intelligence spending since 1980 in the United States has risen by 80 percent, an increase in spending almost without parallel. 
It is worth noting as well, Mr. President, that in the bipartisan Brown Commission report, the commission could find no systematic basis upon which the intelligence budget is even created. In the Commission's words, `Most intelligence agencies seemed to lack a resource strategy apart from what is reflected in the President's 6-year budget projection. Indeed, until the intelligence community reforms its budget process, it is poorly positioned to implement these strategies.' 
Mr. President, other countries in the democratic family of nations have long recognized the need to include defense and intelligence priorities in their national debate over budgetary matters. Indeed, Australia, Britain, and Canada long ago lifted this veil of secrecy. I think, indeed, even the State of Israel, which today faces potentially more serious adversaries at the very heart of their democracy with a daily terrorist threat, long ago decided that its democracy was better served by sharing this information then continuing with the veil of secrecy. 
So, Mr. President, in this notable year when for the first time the American people are given access to this information about intelligence spending, the burden now passes to this Congress whether or not we will allow this to be a single exception, or indeed we will now take the challenge and make this a permanent change in how we govern the national intelligence community. 
I close, therefore, Mr. President, with the words of Justice Douglas, who in 1974 wrote in making a judgment about whether or not the budget should be revealed, `If taxpayers may not ask that rudimentary question, their sovereignty becomes an empty symbol and a secret bureaucracy is allowed to run our affairs.' 
More than 20 years later, Mr. President, this Senate still faces the same judgment. Director Tenet has met his responsibilities. I am proud that President Clinton allowed him to proceed. Now the question rests with us. 
I yield the floor. 
Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. TORRICELLI. I think the Senator from North Dakota makes an important point to the Senate, and that is that many of the American people are asking why, with all that we now know about campaign finance abuse and with the continued erosion of confidence in our electoral system, why a majority of this Senate is not prepared to vote for campaign finance reform. 
The simple truth is, a majority of the U.S. Senate would vote today for campaign finance reform, for the most meaningful change in how money is raised and spent and we govern our elections in a generation. But a majority of this Senate is being prohibited from casting votes for this fundamental change, first by the Republican leadership, which is so intent on preventing a vote of the McCain-Feingold bill that it will filibuster, and second, as the Senator from North Dakota has pointed out, by prohibiting procedurally the offering of any amendments to other legislation that will allow us to make campaign finance reform part of other legislation enacted on this Senate floor. 
It is cynical. It is a deliberate, partisan tactic to keep an advantage in the financing of campaigns in this country. The cost is enormous. The cost is enormous, not simply in delaying other legislation, in stopping the work of this Congress, but in continuing and even fueling the erosion of confidence in the American people in the ability of this Senate to solve a real and legitimate problem.

Mr. TORRICELLI. If the Senator would yield--and I am interested in hearing Senator Feingold on this issue--I think it is important that the American people now understand this is not a choice between a current campaign finance system in the country being governed under existing statutes or an alternative offered by Mr. McCain and Mr. Feingold. The simple fact is there is no governing law of American political campaigns today. 
The legal system, which for more than 20 years has governed the financing of our campaign system, has collapsed. Corporate money is flowing into this system. Independent organizations are beginning to dominate the system. Even the political parties risk becoming side voices in a larger chorus. The system in this country of governing our campaigns has ended. The only issue is whether this Senate is now going to allow the majority to govern by passing a new system which will install some new integrity into our system of government. That is, indeed, the issue.

Mr. TORRICELLI. Thank you, Mr. President. 
Mr. President, at the outset for my participation in this debate I congratulate Senator Feingold and Senator McCain for their months of effort in constructing a comprehensive program to deal with the problem of campaign finance and for bringing the Nation and the Senate to this moment of debate, but also Senator Daschle, whose tireless efforts have also brought us to this moment of judgment, and Senator Lott for scheduling this debate. 
I, also, in listening to this morning's discussion, want to compliment Senator McConnell. For, while I do not share his ultimate judgments on the McCain-Feingold bill, he reminds us of an important principle in the debate. And that is, there may be problems in how we finance our campaigns, the problems of money in American politics, but Senator McConnell reminds us there are real constitutional limitations in how we approach this issue and that ultimately the Nation does not suffer from too much political discussion or too much debate among candidates but too little. So while I differ with his ultimate judgment, I think the Senate is well served by his limitations in how we approach this question. 
Mr. President, for my own part, I enter this debate with a reminder to all of my colleagues that there is nothing short of the credibility of our entire form of Government that is at issue. The world's oldest constitutional democracy, founded on the principle of majority rule, is now threatened by the fact that only a minority of Americans participate. It is therefore a question of our entire credibility of governance. The United States has experienced for more than a generation the continuing relentless decline in voter participation. 
In the last elections in 1996, 49 percent of the American people participated in choosing the leadership of the Federal Government. It is, Mr. President, a serious issue. For a long time the leaders of the U.S. Government have found reasons to excuse the fact that most Americans do not participate in this form of Government, that the United States alone among the great democracies may now be governed by the judgments of a minority of our people alone. 
I have heard all of these debates. First, we convinced ourselves that it was not convenient for most Americans to 
participate in our elections. So we enacted postcard registration to make it simpler. But still the American people did not come. 
Then we convinced ourselves it was because people were not aware of the timing of elections. So through public service announcements and then the hiring of campaign workers, we filled the airwaves, we called people on the phone, we visited their homes to remind them, and still they did not come. 
On more than a few occasions we appealed to people's patriotism to participate in the electoral system. And after all these efforts, most Americans are still not participating. 
Perhaps, Mr. President, there is another reason, painful to admit, but unmistakable: The majority of Americans who are not participating in Federal elections did not forget to vote, it wasn't inconvenient to vote; but by their failure to participate they were expressing themselves. Not participating in an American election is a means of expression. It is a vote of no confidence, not simply in the candidates or the political parties, but in the process itself. 
In truth, there are myriad reasons. The sterility of the debate, perhaps because people perceive no real choices, no relevancy of the political discussion to their own lives. Perhaps it is because the decline in the quality of journalism itself, where character assassinations become a substitute for discussion of real issues. Or perhaps most important, most insidious, it is how we are financing our campaigns. The sense of most Americans that voting is not a determinant of a decision, where money has become the principal determinant of the outcome of struggles for political power. 
There is perhaps no better witness for this argument than one Roger Tamraz, who appeared before the Governmental Affairs Committee only last week. By his own words he had come to the conclusion that though an American citizen, he did not vote in Federal elections because contributing $300,000 was a better and more effective means of participating than ever casting a vote for a candidate of his choice. 
Mr. President, I will admit that I rise on the floor of the Senate today as an advocate of the McCain-Feingold campaign finance bill by a circuitous route. Like many of my colleagues, I have feared campaign finance reform because of the threat of Government regulation of political speech. 
I have believed that free, fair and open competition among the political parties was the best means to assure that all parties were heard and that the American people ultimately ruled by majority will. 
I can no longer, after the expense of the 1996 election and my own involvement in the U.S. Senate campaign in my own State of New Jersey, remain with that conclusion. The campaign reform bills of 1974 and their revision in subsequent years are no longer working. There is no governing electoral authority in the Federal statutes. 
Through a series of decisions by the Federal courts, the practical expense of the political parties, the governing statutes are being evaded, violated, or are simply irrelevant. There is no governing authority in this country today for the financing of Federal campaigns. While this Congress has addressed the issue innumerable times, we have made no progress. In a decade, this Senator has voted on 113 occasions to reform campaign finance and come to no conclusions. The Senate has considered 321 pieces of financial reform legislation, heard 3,361 speeches, and filled 6,742 pages of the Congressional Record with debate. It cannot go on. We are at a genuine critical point in the political history of this country. 
Some would argue that there are some modifications that can be enacted without fundamental reform, and we will meet our responsibility to improve the process, declare success and simply move on to another Federal election in 1998. I am of a decidedly different view. I believe it would be worse to deal with this problem in the margins and declare that we have done much than to deal with this properly and fail and at least be honest with the American people that the problem exists. That is the choice because many, I will predict a majority, of the 
U.S. Senate, will decide that we can ban the use of soft money in the political process, do nothing about independent expenditures, express advocacy, the cost of television time, overall campaign spending, and still declare success. 
To me, Mr. President, that will be the worst outcome because this problem is not only serious, it is complex, and goes to every aspect of the campaign finance system. 
First is the problem of controlling express advocacy groups. There is a real threat that the national political system is evolving into a debate where special interest groups will argue over the heads of the American people in multimillion-dollar campaigns in which neither candidates nor political parties are able to participate. Single-issue advocacy groups with virtually unlimited funding, distorting the issues, steering the campaigns, with candidates who are unable or without the resources to even participate. An American political system with campaigns by surrogates. 
The McCain-Feingold bill, by at least attempting to limit the ability of these organizations to distort candidate's positions or enter into the debates as their surrogates, addresses this issue. But without this provision, the overall legislation would be meaningless, and indeed in my judgment, counterproductive. 
There is, of course, the issue of foreign money where not only must the law be clear, but the penalties high, where people who seek to participate in our system but do not share our nationality. There is the obvious problem of soft money, unregulated, undeclared, unknown participants in the financing of Federal campaigns who opened a door which has now become a monstrous window through which millions of dollars flow, 
distorting the very purpose of campaign finance disclosure or control. 
There is the effort at the prompt disclosure of campaign contributions so that every American makes their own judgment about who is contributing, how much, what they represent, and whether they can then identify with a candidate receiving those contributions. They are all a part of the McCain-Feingold legislation, each critical, but each an integral part that if eliminated from the legislation weakens the whole effort at reform. 
But then finally there is one aspect of the McCain-Feingold bill that has not survived to this debate on the floor of the Senate, but in my judgment must be added before genuine reform has been achieved and this Senate concludes this debate. It is the issue of reducing the cost of television advertising. Behind the spiral of rising campaign costs is the issue of the cost of television advertising. There is no increased cost in American campaigning without the cost of television advertising. They are one and the same--inescapable in the conclusion. The cost of campaigns have increased 72 percent in the last 6 years alone. That is overwhelmingly driven by network television. In my own campaign for the U.S. Senate last year, 84 percent of all the money raised went to television advertising. 
An amendment will be offered to this legislation, appropriately called the challengers' amendment, because largely incumbents will always raise the funds necessary to feed the television networks but challengers cannot. Unless and until we reduce the cost of television advertising, this becomes a process open to incumbents or multimillionaires only. The average American will never be able to participate in this 
process and will be excluded at the Senate door. 
But make no mistake, the vote for campaign finance reform is not a vote for the McCain-Feingold financial legislation. It is a vote for the challengers' amendment. Consider a process where as in the State of New Jersey the average cost of a television advertisement is $50,000. Some single 30-second ads can cost $100,000. What is it that is being purchased? The television networks control this time by a public license. The air time belongs to the American people. It is granted to the television networks by license, for free. They then return to candidates for public office who seek to debate public policy issues, to communicate with the American people who own this air time and charge millions upon millions of dollars. 
Now here I agree with the Senator from Kentucky. The answer is not to reduce the amount of time that candidates have on the air to discuss their issues. It is not to regulate what those candidates communicate to the American people. 
The Senator from Kentucky said less than 1 percent of all the advertising last year in the most expensive political race in American history was political advertising. In the midst of deciding about the American future debating these important critical national questions, American people were still hearing more about the sneakers of choice, the best and worst toothpaste, or how it is they should feed their cats and dogs. There is not too much political discussion, but it is too expensive. It is wrong. 
In a proper process, the great corporations that own the television networks as a means of political responsibility should have come forward and offered this time for candidates to debate or reduce the cost of advertising to discuss their 
respective issues, but they have not. They were challenged and they failed. Now it is up to the Congress. 
Some would say it is unconstitutional. It is the taking of property of the television networks. But indeed we crossed that threshold a long time ago in reducing only marginally the cost of advertising for charities and political debates. The problem is we reduced it only marginally, leaving the cost far, far too high. There is no right of a corporation to own a license. It is a license for air time that belongs to the public. It is granted and it is responsible that costs should be reduced. 
Sometimes it is almost unbearable as a Member of the Senate to hear the television networks with their anchors on the evening news berating the political system, challenging the candidates for public office, 
the President and the Members of the Senate to do something about campaign finance reform, reduce its cost, reform the process. The problem is the cost being charged by the television networks themselves. What are all these fundraisers? What is it we are doing running around the country raising money endlessly, from interests where we should never be seeking money, spending time that should be spent with citizens debating issues? It is to feed the networks that are demanding this money. When the challengers amendment we will have a chance to do something about it, to reduce the costs. 
Mr. President, that comes to a final objective in McCain-Feingold and the whole system of reform. Every American knows that there is a problem of too much money. I have made clear my own belief that there is also a problem of too much cost in advertising. But there is one other element that drives this reform effort. If most of the problems of the American people were represented by those who had money, this reform legislation would be much less important because there is more than enough contact between candidates for the U.S. Senate and the House of Representatives and people who are able to donate and attend fundraisers. We see thousands of Americans at hundreds of fundraisers. There is no lack of communication or discussion of public policy issues. The problem is that most of the American people who have the most serious problems in their own lives don't have the money to attend these events. And since they cannot attend these events, they are not being heard and their problems are not getting addressed. They are outside the process. 
What is driving the need for campaign finance reform, in my judgment, is to free the candidates to once again discuss 
issues, to campaign on the streets of America with people who have no money but do have real concerns. 
Mr. President, this is a debate that it would be difficult to overestimate in its importance. The McCain-Feingold legislation is about campaign finance reform, but it is also about something much more fundamental. We are debating the integrity of the U.S. Government, whether or not the American people, a majority of whom no longer participate in this electoral process, can once again identify with the national political debate and at some point in the future return to participating in this system of government. 
I do not know how long, if we fail to reform this process, levels of participation will continue to decline while the Nation maintains political stability and a belief in this system of government. But I know it cannot go on forever. We may or may not succeed with the McCain-Feingold legislation. Perhaps some will succeed in passing a lesser measure dealing in the margins of reform and leaving the larger problem unanswered. If they do so, they do a disservice to the Senate and to the country. 
Mr. President, before this debate has concluded in the coming days and weeks, I will return again. But I am grateful for this chance to share a few opening thoughts on what is a critical moment in the life of the Senate. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. TORRICELLI. In response to the Senator from Kentucky--though it is not the thrust of his question--I will return to the major inquiry. I will share publicly what I discussed with the Senator previously privately; that is, my concern that if he is correct that the Federal courts will not allow McCain-Feingold, as currently written, to deal with express advocacy or independent expenditures, then we face a 
fundamental problem in that express advocacy and independent expenditures would be unregulated while we would be reducing the ability of the political parties or candidates to express themselves. We would, therefore, be dealing with campaigns by surrogates over the heads of the political parties and the candidates. 
In my judgment, that does not constitute reform, and it raises the question, as I expressed to the Senator privately, whether there should be a severability clause at all in this legislation because, in my judgment, if you cannot constitutionally deal with express advocacy and independent expenditures, I, speaking only for myself, do not believe that we can regulate the candidates in the political parties as envisioned by this legislation. That issue remains before the Federal courts. 
Now, finally, dealing with the Senator's question, it is my own belief that the Constitution can be satisfied, and I hope we can gain the Federal Court's approval, by allowing express advocacy of issues by people who do not name candidates or a campaign in their express advocacy and, hopefully, channel people's interest and finances to the political parties and the candidates separately. Therefore, every citizen has two routes of involvement--the political parties and a candidate of their choice or express advocacy without advocating an individual candidate independently. But I will concede to the Senator from Kentucky, I believe it is an open constitutional question. There is an invitation here to the Federal courts. I simply hope we can get an affirmative reaction from the courts. But I do not disagree with the Senator from Kentucky; it is an open issue.

Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I thank Senator Bryan for yielding this time. I rise in support of the amendment of the Senator from Nevada. 
There is not a Member of the Senate who has not shared with our colleagues, or their constituents, the extraordinary need to end both waste in this Government and corporate welfare in particular. This is the moment for those Members to give meaning to all those speeches, all those comments, and all those interviews, because the Bryan amendment is to corporate welfare what welfare reform in the last Congress was to social welfare. This is the moment. 
The scale of corporate welfare in the Federal budget is extraordinary. The Cato Institute estimates some $86 billion in expenditures. The Progressive Policy Institute estimates the number at $265 billion. This new age of fiscal discipline in which we live, when the Federal budget is being balanced, requires some sacrifice from everybody. In the last Congress it was people and families on welfare. In this Congress, at long last, it is time to have corporate welfare make its own contribution. 
The Bryan amendment deals with one specific part of this network of corporate welfare, the construction of timber roads. The Green Scissors Coalition estimates that, over a 5-year period, the Federal Government will spend $36 billion, not only on these expensive and potentially wasteful construction projects, but projects which at the same time have an extraordinary cost in environmental terms. The simple truth is, even if we could afford this construction, which we cannot, the environmental costs are enormous. 
These roads through our Nation's forests remove ground cover, create a channel for water to flow through--a cause of 
major soil erosion. Hillsides are weakened, streams are fouled, destroying the foundation of our recreational fishing industry--extraordinary--and some of the most important vistas and recreational properties in our Nation. It is believed that many of the channels created by these roads and the runoff are a major nonpoint source of pollution. According to the National Forest Service, 922 different communities in our country rely for their drinking water directly on streams that are impacted by the runoff of these roads in our national forests. 
The Bryan amendment is a chance to end this corporate welfare, preserve the quality of the water, and end the damage to these forests. It is a subsidy that may be $100 million to individual corporations, but that underestimates the true scale of the problem. Over the last 15 years, direct Government expenditures for construction and reconstruction of forest roads may total $3.2 billion. It is estimated that for the national forest road system alone, over the years, this has resulted in the construction of 380,000 miles in forest roads. For any citizens of America who have marveled at our Interstate Highway System, they can only understand the scale of this construction by recognizing there is enough mileage through our national forests to circle the globe 15 times. Indeed, we have built 8 miles of road through pristine national forests for every 1 mile that has been constructed in the National Interstate Highway System. 
The result of all these years of construction is that now we face $440 million worth of backlog of road maintenance. So we are continuing in the construction of millions of dollars' worth of new highways through new forests while the old highways are not maintained. They fall into disrepair with further erosion, damaging more streams, more drinking water--erosion of more forest. 
For those who are serious about the deficit, corporate welfare, and environmental protection, in a single vote for the Bryan amendment you are given a chance to make a statement about each. This is not a question of ending the foresting of trees. It is not a question of not making our resources available. It is a question about industry, like every other American, paying their own way. If these roads make sense, then they make sense for corporations to pay for them themselves. If they are to be built, then they should be built properly and maintained by the companies who want access to the resources. If companies want access to the resources, and it makes economic sense, then it should be reflected in the product, not by the taxpayers. It is that simple. The logic and the economics is no different than when we face individual spending programs for citizens, students, or senior citizens. At some point these programs need to be evaluated on their own merits, on their own economics. That is what Senator Bryan challenges us to do today. 
I enthusiastically support his amendment on budgetary grounds, because of the economic logic of his argument and, finally, and in my own judgment most compellingly, on environmental grounds. We preserve these lands for a reason. We should open them up, provide access to them for their destruction, judiciously and carefully. We failed to do so in the past. Senator Bryan gives us a last chance to make a proper judgment once again. 
Mr. President, I yield the remainder of my time to Senator Bryan.

Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I thank Senator Jeffords for giving me the opportunity to join with him in this amendment and offer not only my support by my appeal to our colleagues to not only support us in this effort tonight but in future years to keep the commitment to respond to the threat to battlefield sites and other aspects of American history, to give our true measure to protecting the history of this country. 
In his Pulitzer prizewinning book, `Battle Cry of Freedom,' James McPherson once wrote of the Civil War that: 
Most of the things that we consider important in this era of American history--the fate of slavery, the structure of both the North and South, the direction of the American economy . . . the definition of freedom, the very survival of the United States--rested on the shoulders of those weary men in blue and grey * * *. 
Most of those men, Mr. President, were simple volunteers, laborers, farmers. They were paid little and endured horrific conditions. Throughout the duration of the war, 620,000 Americans, black and white, North and South, soldiers and sailors, paid an extraordinary price to preserve this Nation or to define it as they would have had its future. 
Mr. President, I rise today with Senator Jeffords in memory of those brave men because the lands where they fought, the places where they sacrificed, face a new threat. The battlefields of America, which define this country, where they gave their lives, may be lost to history. Future generations who might have been instructed by their sacrifices or discovered America by understanding what occurred on these lands will be denied the opportunity. 
We rise, Mr. President, on an auspicious occasion in offering this amendment because it was 135 years ago today, only 
miles north of this Senate Chamber, when more than 125,000 Americans, Union and Confederate, gathered on the rolling fields near Sharpsburg, MD, for what we know as the Battle of Antietam. 
It is therefore a fitting evening as we gather tonight to consider saving the lands where they died, to remember that only 12 hours after they gathered, in what would be remembered tomorrow, 23,000 men lay dead in what was the bloodiest day in American history, a day in which three times as many Americans fell as died on D-Day. 
I remember this anniversary, Mr. President, because I come to this effort helping Senator Jeffords here tonight because, with friends, I visited the Antietam Battlefield only months ago. I stood in the Sunken Road where 5,000 men fell as a part of that battle. 
And as I stood in the Sunken Road, where so many men gave their lives, looking from the Confederate positions to where the Union assault would have come, I recognized something peculiar that did not belong, strange to a great Nation, a `For Sale' sign stuck into this sacred ground rested where brave men led an assault to save or define or to change the United States. 
Mr. President, when Abraham Lincoln dedicated the national cemetery at Gettysburg, he said: 
We cannot consecrate--we cannot hallow this ground. The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power to add or detract. 
I recall these words in this Chamber today because it is now for us to decide whether Lincoln was right or was wrong, because a `For Sale' sign is on lands where so many Americans fell, where generations will seek to visit to learn of their sacrifice and understand the rich and proud history of America. It is no place for commercial development, the sale and destruction of lands. It is, Mr. President, a desecration. 
The battlefield of Antietam is not alone. Today, hundreds of battlefields, where thousands of others died, face the similar threat of `For Sale' signs, a future as shopping malls, strip development, or suburban housing tracts. 
The battlefields of Antietam, where Senator Sessions and Senator Murray tell me that their own great-grandfathers lost their lives, will soon be housing tracts or the same commercial development that I fear. 
North of Antietam, in Gettysburg, home to Pickett's charge, Senator Lott tells me his own great-grandfather fell, on the left flank of what was the bloodiest battle where 55,000 Americans died in 3 days, more than in all the battles in the war of 14 years in Vietnam. 
South of here, in the lands around Fredericksburg, best captured by the photograph to my right--home to the battles of Chancellorsville, Wilderness, and Spotsylvania Court House--important Civil War landmarks 
have already been destroyed by housing tracts and shopping centers. 
Places where schoolchildren would have visited to remember their own relatives, learn about their sacrifices, understand how America came to be as we know it today will never have the experience. But it isn't just Gettysburg, it isn't only Antietam, it isn't simply experienced by Fredericksburg. It's Vicksburg, MS; Petersburg, VA; Mobile, AL; Fort Donelson, TN; Perryville, KY; Bentonville, NC; Chickamunga, GA. 
Indeed, two-thirds of the most important Civil War battlefield sites in our Nation in the next 6 years could be irrevocably lost to history. We are not, Mr. President, the first Senate to recognize this threat. In November 1990, under the leadership of Senator Bumpers and in the House of Representatives under the leadership of Congressman Mrazek of New York, with the signature of President Bush, we established the Civil War Sites Advisory Commission to advise the Congress on how to preserve these lands. This 15-member panel identified 384 critical Civil War battles or engagement sites that, in their judgment, should be preserved. 
Even 7 years ago, however, they recognized that 20 percent were already lost to history through commercial development. But they recognized that there are still 260 that could be saved. They warned then that time was short. Now, it is even shorter. 
Our amendment, through a sense of the Senate, will ask that the conferees use their best efforts to use funding available in the Land and Conservation Fund to immediately make available, within Park Service boundaries, funding to save those lands still available. It will use less than 10 percent of the funding available to the Congress this year out of the conservation funds. 
We offer this as a sense of the Senate because we have Senator Lott's commitment, and I believe his sincere pledge, to defend the interests of this Senate in preserving these lands, but mostly because Senator Gorton has given his own commitment. Because of his own sincere belief in this effort, he will lead us in this important cause. 
Mr. President, I am standing here tonight as a representative of a young country. We are challenged, I think, by the notion that if we stood not in the U.S. Congress but in the French National Assembly, the British Parliament, or any other great assembly in Europe, it would be unthinkable that the lands of Verdun or Stalingrad or Waterloo would ever be destroyed through commercial development. 
Perhaps our Nation is not as old, but its history is just as important. Our own children will look for instruction from what occurred in these important lands just as much as those of France, Russia or Britain. 
So, Mr. President, I offer this amendment with Senator Jeffords, giving my thanks to our colleagues who join with us and, indeed, to Professor McPherson, who has inspired yet another generation with his writing and battle cry of freedom and for writing to Members of the Senate today in support of this important amendment. 
Senator Jeffords, thank you for your leadership, and, Senator Gorton, thank you for your help in representing the Senate in the conference in preserving the sense of the Senate and dedicating these funds to this important effort. 
I yield the floor.

 Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today in recognition of the mayor of my hometown, Englewood, NJ. Mayor Donald Aronson's dedication to the Englewood community and the State of New Jersey make it an honor to be able to recognize him. After being elected mayor of Englewood three times he has decided not to stand for reelection. As his term comes to an end, I would like to convey my good wishes to a friend and valued colleague. 
Donald has made innumerable contributions to the residents of Englewood and to the State of New Jersey as a whole through numerous community service positions. He has served as commissioner and secretary of the Palisades Interstate Park Commission, president of the Bergen County League of Municipalities, and he has sat on the board of trustees for the American Red Cross. In addition, he has been a member of the Englewood Board of Adjustment, Englewood Chamber of Commerce, and Englewood Economic Development Corp. The list of his community activities is endless. The extent of his service to State and local organizations is evidence of his lifelong commitment to public service. 
Now, Donald is preparing for a new position as the president of the Englewood Chamber of Commerce. I ask that you join me in recognizing Mayor Donald Aronson for all of his hard work and his service to the State of New Jersey.

Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today to join with my colleague, Senator Brownback, in submitting a Sense of Senate Resolution on the Current and Future Status of Taiwan. 
This legislation expresses the sense of the Senate that the recent transfer of Hong Kong to the People's Republic of China does not alter the current or future status of Taiwan. The reversion of Hong Kong to China on July 1 has created the impression among some that the situations of Hong Kong and Taiwan are similar. Our resolution makes clear that there are deep differences between these two situations. 
Hong Kong reverted to China after the expiration of a treaty signed by China and the United Kingdom in 1898 granting a 99 year lease. 
No treaties exist which determine the future status of Taiwan, and Taiwan has maintained a de facto independence since 1949. 
The formula of `one country, two systems' applied to Hong Kong has no relevance to Taiwan. 
China continues to renounce the use of force against Taiwan and as recently as 1996 held military exercises in the Taiwan Strait in an attempt to intimidate the people of Taiwan. 
The Taiwan Relations Act makes it the policy of the United States to `consider any effort to determine the future of Taiwan by other than peaceful means, including by boycotts or embargoes, a threat to the peace and security of the Western Pacific area and of grave concern to the United States.' 
Based on these differences, our resolution expresses the sense of the Senate that-- 
First, the transfer of Hong Kong to the People's Republic of China does not alter the current and future status of Taiwan; 
Second, the future of Taiwan should be determined by peaceful means through a democratic process in accordance with the principle of self-determination, as outlined in the Charter of the United Nations; and 
Third, the United States should assist in the defense of Taiwan in case of threats or military attack by the People's Republic of China against Taiwan.

Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, the balanced budget agreement passed by the Senate today was an extraordinary and historical accomplishment. The American people can be proud that Congress took bipartisan action to provide not only the first balanced budget in a generation but also tax relief to working families, health care for uninsured children, financial relief for those seeking a college education and the promise of long-term solvency for Medicare. 
In another historic yet less worthy act, the conferees quietly included in the bill a provision to, for the first time, relax the cross-ownership rules that prevent television stations or newspapers from owning a television station within the same city. The FCC has rightly enacted and enforced cross-ownership prohibitions for 50 years to ensure diversity of opinion and views on our local airwaves. 
But the provision in the reconciliation bill would allow newspaper owners and broadcasters to bid on licenses within the same market during the 2002 auction of analog broadcast signals in markets with populations greater than 400,000. These signals will be made available as the current analog stations convert to digital transmission. 
This action could have a seriously detrimental effect on the diversity of the current mosaic of broadcast entities. Broadcast television remains the most prolific form of local broadcast news and it is critical that this diversity is continued. Indeed, I am deeply concerned by the effect that this provision could have on the FCC's current review of cross-ownership rules. 
Congress directed the FCC to review cross-ownership rules in the Telecommunications Act of 1996 and the results of this review are pending. While I believe Congress should revisit the reconciliation relaxation provision on its own merits and free from the rush toward passage of the agreement, it is also critical that the FCC, during its own review of cross-ownership, does not interpret passage of this provision as unobjected Congressional support for repeal or relaxation of cross-ownership rules. 
Indeed, it is important to note that this provision is intended to provide cross-ownership only when there is a doubling of broadcast outlets within a particular market and only in markets of populations greater than 400,000. If Congress had wanted to take further action, it would have done so and therefore, the FCC should not. 
Our broadcast spectrum is one of our Nation's most valuable assets and one of the most powerful yet limited resource for the dissemination of ideas and free expression. It is critical that Congress work to protect rather than dilute this resource and I will fight for the integrity of our airwaves as Congress continues to address these issues.

Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, only hours ago, in a market in Jerusalem, the plague of terrorism once again struck the people of the Middle East. Simple people shopping for their goods and wares were struck down by a terrorist bomb. People who do not have the courage to stand on the battlefield or the wisdom to sit across a conference table with diplomats have, once again, sought to impose their own will on the people of Israel. 
I rise on the floor of the Senate to express all of our sympathies for the families of the victims, the people of Israel, and to Prime Minister Netanyahu. 
I know in all of us, there is not only a prayerful sorrow, but also a great anger. The sacrifices and the works and the hopes of so many might be dashed by these few who would impose their will. The best message may not simply be our prayers or our condolences. Perhaps, Mr. President, as Americans, we are best to respond to this tragedy as Americans have always responded to those who act in violence and with such irresponsible actions. Our best message may be our uncompromising determination to pursue peace. 
It is, after all, the interruption of the peace process that terrorists desire the most. If they had a coherent argument that had intellectual weight, they would have sought an entry into the peace process to make their arguments to diplomats. If they could make a coherent case to either the electorate in Israel or the people of the Palestinian Authority, they would have taken their case through a democratic process to those peoples. Their terrorist actions are the best evidence that they have no such arguments. They can make no such case. They, indeed, do not have confidence themselves in the strength of their own positions. 
In responding to this terrorist action, President Clinton made clear that the United States will not be dissuaded, that we are not led away or apart from our current policy of seeking a peaceful resolution to events in the Middle East. I believe that President Clinton, when he speaks these words, represents all of us. 
It is, therefore, only right and proper that, when the mourning ends and the dead are buried, our diplomats return to the Middle East with all dispatch. If it was the intention of the administration that they were to return in several days, the best message to the terrorists is that they return sooner. If it was their intention to remain a month, it is the best message to the terrorists that they should remain 2 months. If it was the intention of this Congress to continue American assistance to Israel for several years, the best message to these terrorists is, it shall continue for more years. 
There are those through the years who do not understand the United States. They think that because we are a patient and a reasonable people, inclined towards peace and willing to talk, that we lack strength or resolve. Those who know our history, watched our actions, or understand us and our culture the best know that, in fact, nothing could be further from the truth. We are a people of enormous resolve. That resolve will best be demonstrated in the coming days when this administration sends our diplomats back to the negotiating table, this Congress continues with our commitments to Israel, and we make clear we will not be separated from our ambition of a strong and free Israel, with a Middle East with a lasting peace. 
To the Palestinian Authority and its leader, Yasser Arafat, we are all grateful that Mr. Arafat has expressed to Prime 
Minister Netanyahu and to the families of the victims his condolences. It is, however, on this occasion, not enough. The best expression of condolence to the victims and to the people of Israel is for Mr. Arafat to renew his commitment to the peace process without condition. It is not enough simply to express regret at the suffering of those who are victims or for Mr. Arafat to express his commitment to find those responsible and to cooperate with the Israeli authorities. 
It is also not enough to cooperate because of the deeds of this day, but to assure that tomorrow, and in all days that follow, the Palestinian Authority security forces will cooperate with Israeli law enforcement to share intelligence information, to open her borders and her files to ensure that this deed that has been suffered upon the people of Israel is not repeated. 
Mr. President, the people of Israel have suffered on many such days. Terrorism has not become the exception, but sometimes it seems the rule of the politics of the Middle East. 
In Israel, like in America, we are misunderstood. This much should be clear: There is no terrorist action so great, no number of victims so large, that the people of Israel will be convinced to compromise on the needs of their basic security, their determination that they and their children will live in an undivided Jerusalem. At times we seem so close to peace and yet more victims, more sacrifice is asked. 
Wherever these terrorists might be hiding tonight, whatever cave may conceal their cowardice, let this much be clear: Israel will remain free, Jerusalem will remain Israeli, the future will be secured. And if the sacrifice of the people of Israel through all these years has not convinced these terrorists, or those who would follow them, of that fact, then add this to the equation: The U.S. Congress, this Senate in representation of all the people of the United States, are determined to make it so as well. 
Mr. President, our prayers, our heartfelt sorrow go to the families of the victims of all the people of Israel. May the future at long last be different than the past. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Minnesota for yielding. And I want to offer my thanks to Senator Hollings and Senator Gregg for agreeing to this amendment. 
Mr. President, this is not the first time that I have joined with Senator Wellstone in legislation to help women who are the victims of domestic violence. 
In the last Congress we successfully led an effort to deny access to handguns to people who have convictions of domestic violence. We return here today because the plague of domestic violence has not abated. It is believed that there are 3 to 4 million women every year in America who are subjected to domestic violence. Every 18 seconds another victim is struck. Indeed, during the course of a lifetime, half of the women in this country will be abused by a husband or a boyfriend or someone with whom they live. 
One of the tragic ironies of this terrible situation is that in the moment when women need the help of the law the most they are denied. The Legal Services Corporation last year handled a quarter of a million cases of domestic violence and yet those women who may have needed the help the most could not get Legal Services assistance because the income of their husbands, the very people who might be striking them, the person from whom they are seeking a restraining order or a divorce, made them ineligible. 
The amendment we offer today would eliminate this tragic contradiction. I believe it is a good statement by this Senate, a realistic recognition of a terrible national problem and the ending of this real dilemma for American women, that in the future it can be said any woman, regardless of her husband's income, will be able to get legal assistance because of her own vulnerability, based on her own lack of resources. So she gets the protection she needs. 
I am very pleased to be offering this amendment with Senator Wellstone today and once again offer my thanks to Senator Gregg and Senator Hollings for their support. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today to join with my colleagues, Senators Mack, Helms, and Graham, in introducing the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] Accountability and Safety Act of 1997. 
This legislation will withhold from the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] a proportional share of United States assistance for programs or projects of that Agency in Cuba. It seeks to discourage the IAEA from technical assistance programs or projects that would contribute to the maintenance or completion of the Juragua Nuclear Power Plant near Cienfuegos, Cuba and/or to nuclear research or experiments at the Pedro Pi Nuclear Research Center. 
Our legislation makes clear to Cuba and to the international community that the United States considers the existence of nuclear facilities under the control of a government on the list of terrorist countries that has not ratified the fundamental agreements on the nonproliferation of nuclear weapons a threat to the national security of the United States. As such, the United States seeks to discourage all other governments and international agencies from assisting the efforts of the Cuban Government to maintain or complete the Juragua Plant or to advance nuclear research at the Pedro Pi facility. 
United States funds would be made available to the IAEA to discontinue, dismantle, or conduct safety inspections of nuclear facilities and related materials in Cuba, or to inspect or undertake similar activities designed to prevent the development of nuclear weapons by Cuba. 
The withholding of funds from the IAEA would be obviated if: Cuba ratifies the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons or the Treaty for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America (Tlatelolco); negotiates full-scope safeguards of the IAEA within two years of ratifying; and adopts internationally accepted nuclear safety standards. 
The legislation also requests reports on the activities of the IAEA in Cuba.

Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the Fiscal Year 1998 military construction appropriations bill, and would like to take this opportunity to thank Chairman Burns and Ranking Member Murray for all of their leadership and hard work on this legislation. I am especially pleased by two items which were included in this bill. First, the $1.3 million which will be spent on the design of a new software engineering center at Picatinny Arsenal in my home State of New Jersey, and second, language in the bill which urges the Army to place the construction of the center on its priority list for fiscal year 1999. I am hopeful that the Army will heed the advice of the Senate, and make this project a priority for next year. 
Throughout our Nation's history, Picatinny Arsenal has provided our men and women with the high-technology weapons that have helped achieve our military victories. Most recently, during Desert Storm our forces unleashed millions of M-77 submunitions on the Iraqi Army with devastating results. This grenade-like weapon uses a precision guidance system and a mini-computer to locate its target as it descends on a parachute-like device, before it attacks and destroys it. The Iraqis were so terrified of this weapons, that they dubbed it Steel Rain. I am proud to say that this weapon was developed by some of this Nation's finest scientists and engineers at Picatinny Arsenal. 
As some of my colleagues may know, Picatinny Arsenal is home to the Army Armament Research, Development and Engineering Center [ARDEC]. Virtually every piece of weaponry and ammunition in the hands of our soldiers is developed at Picatinny. In fact, Picatinny is responsible for 90 percent of the Army's lethality. 
Currently, the Fire Support Armaments Center [FSAC], which conducts the research, development, and engineering for weapons systems such as artillery, mortars, and the technology behind the fire control for the entire U.S. Army, has its functions dispersed at several facilities throughout the base. While our Armed Forces in general, and the Army in particular, have been subject to drastic downsizing in the post-cold-war era, the Fire Support Armaments Center workload has increased as our modern army relies increasingly on `smart' weapon technology. However, while the Center is responsible for a critical area of expertise in our national security plan, its economic and productive effectiveness is severely limited because its operations are dispersed throughout the base. This, combined with the limited space available, makes work on the larger vehicles like tanks and armored personnel carriers impossible in all but the best of weather conditions and makes coordination on the many different components of any given project nearly impossible. 
To remedy this, a new software engineering center has been proposed which would consolidate many of the Arsenal's operations, thus allowing work on these vehicles to proceed year round and enhancing Picatinny's capability to test and upgrade `smart' weapons. The proposed Software Engineering Center would also provide the Army with the ability to upgrade-technologically existing weapons systems, respond rapidly to problems encountered in the field, and save the Pentagon money. The Army estimates that this consolidation will also save $5 million a year, allowing the project to pay for itself in 3 years. I am pleased by the Senate's support of the center, and look forward to working with the subcommittee and the Army to ensure that this state-of-the-art facility becomes a reality.

Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, with the first phase of the hearings of the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee into the abuses of the electoral process through campaign fundraising having just concluded, and the second phase about to begin, it is perhaps an appropriate time to reflect on those things that we have learned in these first few weeks and those questions that remain. 
It is, I think, important to note that despite some incentive for partisanship, a tendency by the media to sometimes reach conclusions before the facts, and a persistent failure of some witnesses to cooperate, the committee has begun its work, I think, in the best traditions of the Senate. Democrats and Republicans are working together. We do have a common objective, and I think we are doing service to the institution. 
These things, however, have already been learned. First, it is a result of insufficient management and poor decisionmaking and the continuing upward spiral of pressure to raise campaign funds, the Democratic National Committee made a series of bad decisions during the last election that clearly resulted in some violations of Federal law and were a disservice both to the President and the Democratic Party. Among these were the inadequacy of any process of checking the names or backgrounds of contributors or the sources of their funds. The good work of some members of the Democratic National Committee and its staff was compromised, unfortunately, by the addition of some inexperienced people who were not properly supervised or trained for their positions. 
John Huang was clearly among them, and it is now clear from testimony before the committee that there is a substantial chance that the result was a violation of Federal law. 
Second, it is also becoming clear that the Chinese Government, the People's Republic of China, as a result or in reaction to the visit of President Li of Taiwan to the United States, planned and potentially embarked upon a plan to influence the 1996 Federal election. It is clear from the evidence provided to date that this plan targeted neither political party in particular, but probably both in general. It seems to have been primarily designed to influence the U.S. Congress. It is unclear to date the extent of those designs on the Presidential election. It is also clear that that plan involved both legal and potentially illegal means to accomplish its goal. The extent of its success, to what extent it was achieved, is not at this point known. The fact that it existed and there were any intentions implemented is disturbing enough to warrant the committee's investigation. 
Third, it is established, I believe, at this point, to at least some degree of satisfaction, that the illegal activities that may have been embarked upon by John Huang or others to seek and receive foreign contributions or otherwise violate Federal Election Commission regulations and the laws of the United States with regard to fundraising were not either known or encouraged by senior personnel at the Democratic National Committee. Richard Sullivan, who was the direct superior of Mr. Huang, denied under oath that there was any plan by the Democratic National Committee to solicit Chinese or other foreign contributions. It is, however, clear Mr. Huang's activities were not sufficiently monitored or known as should have been the case in an organization of the importance of the Democratic National Committee. 
Fourth, John Huang's own activities raise substantial suspicion. It is not enough for the committee to conclude that it was not properly supervised or to take any comfort in the fact that his superiors or other people in either the White House or Democratic National Committee did not have knowledge of his efforts to raise foreign contributions. Nor is it enough to simply dismiss his activities as a poor judgment to hire him because he was inexperienced or unqualified to be vice chairman of finance of the Democratic National Committee. 
His activities while at the Commerce Department in operating out of the Stevens Corp., where he both received and made telephone calls, received and sent faxes and perhaps, most suspiciously, received packages, raised continued questions. In the coming weeks, the committee will want to explore as to the nature of his activities, not simply while at the Democratic National Committee, but in the months preceding it while a Federal employee. The committee is also left with the unanswered question as to why he continued to receive briefings by the intelligence community and of what use he made of that information. 
The committee is also left with questions regarding the alleged Chinese plan. While it is comforting that there is no evidence to date that policy was impacted, it is also not enough for us to rest in a comfort that it was bipartisan and not apparently solicited by either political party, based on information known to date. The question remains of whether policy was ever changed as a result of these contributions, whether the plan was actually fully implemented, and whether or not it continues. This naturally is a first priority of the committee and remains of overwhelming importance. 
And questions, finally, remain with regard to John Huang. Of what use did he make of this information for corporate purposes of the Lippo Group or any other foreign interest? Were these questions both continuing before the committee and some of these preliminary issues answered? 
The committee next turns its work to the National Policy Forum, its relationship with the Republican National Committee and its chairman, Haley Barbour. The committee in the coming days will receive testimony, I believe, that will indicate that Mr. Barbour, while chairman of the Republican National Committee, designed a plan, which was implemented with his participation, to solicit and eventually did receive foreign contributions in excess of $2 million, which helped, through a series of transactions, to fund the 1994 Republican campaign to take control of the U.S. Congress. Evidence will be presented that this was an active plan, fully implemented. 
After a week of testimony, therefore, we will know the extent of involvement of the Democratic and Republican National Committees in these efforts to receive foreign contributions and their impact on the 1994 and 1996 elections. 
With those two phases of the committee's work completed, what we will not have done is get any closer to the question of genuine and complete campaign finance reform. Several weeks have now passed since President Clinton's deadline was passed for the July 4, 1996, consideration of campaign finance reform. No campaign finance reform bill has been considered or released by any subcommittee of this Senate. No date has been set for the Senate to even begin discussion of any such genuine reform. 
Indeed, there are some who would argue that the Governmental Affairs Committee deliberations are an excuse to wait until next year to even begin consideration of any campaign finance reform legislation. Using the deadline of the end of 1996 to begin consideration will assure that the 1998 Federal elections are conducted under the same campaign finance laws that bred the very problems now being discussed by the Governmental Affairs Committee. And it begs the question that, for all the important things that this Senate can learn from these hearings, all the unfortunate revelations the Senate is now experiencing, the tragic lessons the American people are now learning about this system, which Senator does not already know enough that we are raising too much money, spending too much money, and inviting both these abuses and violations of the law every day that we do not reform this system? 
I know that there is a perception in our country that this failure to initiate campaign finance reform is a genuinely bipartisan problem. The American people can be forgiven for believing this because both parties have abused the system, and our hearings are resulting in learning that both the Democratic and Republican National Committees have not only violated the vested policy but clearly violated the law in this downward spiral of campaign fundraising. 
It is, however, becoming less and less of a bipartisan issue when it comes to the question of reaching solutions. Last weekend, Jim Nicholson, the new chairman of the Republican National Committee, announced his opposition to banning soft money, his opposition to any limit on campaign expenditures, his opposition to controlling the costs of television. In essence, the Republican chairman of their national committee announced his opposition to any campaign finance reform. 
Indeed, that mirrors our experience in the House and in the Senate. The overwhelming majority of the caucus of the Democratic Party in this Senate is prepared to vote for campaign finance reform now. It has been endorsed by our leadership. President Clinton has indicated that he would sign such legislation. Yet, only three members of the Republican caucus are prepared to even vote for campaign finance reform, and no committee chairman has been willing to bring it to consideration. 
Mr. President, as our committee continues its work, we will continue to be saddened by revelations that both political parties have not challenged the best within us in raising funds for conducting these campaigns. Our only comfort is that the political leadership of this institution will at some point see the need to wait no longer and begin initiating real change. There is no room in this debate for anyone to take comfort in their actions to date. 
Not only have the political committees of both parties not conducted themselves in our best traditions, not only have both possibly violated the laws, but other institutions have equal fault. While the media each day reminds us of the problems of campaign financing, the cost of television advertising continues to spiral upward. The overwhelming costs of these campaigns is a result of the rising cost of television. While every night the media rails against the system, complains against the abuses, their lobbyists roam the Halls of Congress fighting efforts to control the cost of television advertising. 
So, in neither party, nor in the private institutions of the media, nor in the institutions of the political parties is there any reason for pride. Only this, that there are still people in this institution in both parties who continue the investigations, Members of the Senate who are prepared to vote to change the system, people not simply who have not succeeded in the system, but Members who have succeeded, who have raised the funds, conducted successful campaigns, but still recognize that even though individuals can succeed, it does not serve the national interests. 
Mr. President, the first phase of our investigation by the Governmental Affairs Committee has now concluded. We begin two more important weeks of our work. I believe we are conducting ourselves, pursuing our objective as this Senate has commanded us to do. Much has been learned. There remains much to be done. I hope every Senator will continue to follow our work, but, mostly, join us in the commitment to change this system, find those who have abused it in the past, ensure that the law is enforced, and then give the American people a political system financed by means in which they can take real pride. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the amendment offered by Senator D'Amato, which would protect funding levels for veterans' health care in New York and New Jersey. I understand that the amendment has been withdrawn, however, I appreciate the assurances given by Senators Bond and Mikulski that the subcommittee will give this request the serious consideration it deserves when this issue is raised in conference. 
I, and my colleagues from New Jersey and New York, are very concerned about a Department of Veterans' Affairs [VA] initiative which would change the way the agency distributes health care funds to veterans' hospitals. During the next 3 years, the Veterans Equitable Resource Allocation [VERA] Program is projected to divert as much as $148 million away from our region and send it to Sun Belt States in the South and West, whose veteran populations are increasing. 
I have heard from many of the 760,000 veterans in New Jersey, all of whom have legitimate fears that this funding shift will reduce the quality and availability of veterans' services in our State. Many of these individuals, who have courageously served our Nation overseas in combat, now fear becoming victims of the VA's restructuring and broken promises. 
The impact of this proposal would be devastating in countless communities across New Jersey. I believe that limiting access to the VA health care system may jeopardize the well-being and the lives of many veterans. This must not be allowed to happen. 
The House of Representatives has taken a strong stand against the VERA plan by including a provision in their VA spending bill which would delay the proposed funding shift for 4 months, while the General Accounting Office [GAO] examines the impact of this action on the quality of care for veterans in the Northeast. Until the GAO study is completed, the VA would fund our region's health services at 1996 levels, which are $12 million higher than the 1997 levels. 
I strongly support this course of action, and encourage my colleagues on the subcommittee to adopt this proposal. We simply need to ensure that while the VA is providing much needed resources to certain facilities, it is not doing so at the expense of veterans in other regions. There is no harm in the GAO doing a 4 month study on whether the VA's new funding scheme is equitable. I assure New Jersey's veterans that I will continue to monitor the progress of this provision as it is debated in the conference committee, and will work to ensure that our veterans receive the health care and services that they deserve. 
Again, I would like to thank Senators Bond and Mikulski for their consideration of this request and look forward to working with them on this and other issues of importance to the veterans' community.

Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise in support of the nomination of Joel Klein because of my confidence in his ability to be the kind of antitrust law enforcer the Justice Department and the country need to protect consumers and ensure vigorous competition. 
My confidence comes from Mr. Klein's record of great success during the past nine months during which he has headed the Antitrust Division. He has proven to be a strong advocate in promotion of competition. His accomplishments include suing Rochster Gas and Electric for impeding competition for electric power, suing to block a hospital merger that would have raised prices for patients on Long Island, NY, obtaining indictments of an insulation company executive for price fixing, blocking an acquisition that would have created a dominant provider of asphalt concrete in New Hampshire and Vermont, and blocking an acquisition by Gulfstar Communications that would have created unacceptable media concentration. 
His record also includes numerous guilty pleas and fines and settlements from antitrust violators, including a record $5.6 million penalty from German and Brazilian companies for violating pre-merger notification rules. 
With an already strong record in an acting capacity, we can look forward to great things from Mr. Klein should he be confirmed by the Senate.

Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, on February 24, 1996, under the directions of Fidel Castro, the Cuban Air Force encountered and destroyed a civilian aircraft in the Florida straits. Murdered on that day were four innocent civilians, including Americans. At almost the same time, 100 brave Cuban citizens demonstrating in the streets of Havana were arrested for demanding democratic reforms, and they remain in jail. 
In response to these actions, President Clinton, with the strong bipartisan support of this country, on that day made several changes in American policy. First, we suspended the very remittances that would be expanded by the Bingaman amendment today, and canceled flights that were encouraging tourism and travel in Cuba. It was a modest response to an egregious act. We were united then; I do not know what would divide us now. 
Since the murders on that day, there has been no change in Cuban policy. Although the price of progress in American relations has always been clear--a single opposition newspaper, the scheduling of a free election, the allowing of 
any dissent, the opening of Cuba's jails to anyone; not all of these things, not even in their entirety, but any one of these things, to any extent, would have brought about a change in our policy. 
I know people are impatient for democratic reform in Cuba and an ending of the embargo. It has been 5 years since we strengthened American law. I know patience is not always our greatest national attribute. But now--in the face of Fidel Castro, 5 years after embarking on this policy, only 18 months after the murder of these citizens, with no Cuban response, no concession and no change--to simply abandon our policy, I believe, would undermine a foreign policy objective of the United States for a free Cuba. 
Mr. President, does the Senator from Florida--we have consumed 3 minutes, I believe, Mr. President?

 Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today to acknowledge the monumental service and dedication of one of Sweden's finest Ambassadors ever to have served in the United States, Mr. Henrik Liljegren. After 4 1/2 years in Washington, Ambassador Liljegren is being reassigned to Istanbul, Turkey, and I want to take this opportunity to express my admiration for, and gratitude to, this skilled diplomat. 
Ambassador Liljegren has spent his time in Washington carefully fostering a new level of understanding between our two countries. The end of the cold war has created new perspectives for Sweden's foreign policy, and new opportunities for Sweden and the United States to further their relationship. Ambassador Liljegren is well respected for his willingness to promote closer ties between the people of our two great nations. 
His strategy for strengthening United States-Swedish ties has been multifaceted and creative. For example, he recently testified before the Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee to help determine whether or not neutral countries had profited from their policies during the Second World War. Ambassador Liljegren was aware of the State Department's Eizenstat Report, which was stern in its condemnation of neutral states during this period, and was forthcoming in explaining his country's policies vis-a-vis the Third Reich. His testimony was influential in drawing attention to the systematic effort on the part of the Swedish Foreign Ministry to assist the Jews during World War II. 
On behalf of my colleagues in the Senate and the entire Nation, I want to again express our gratitude for Ambassador Liljegren's service, and wish him the best of luck as he continues his career in Turkey.

Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today to address two of the current investigations that are taking place within the Federal Government on this day. They are very different and they involve different branches of the Government but are important to this country and many of our citizens. 
Mr. President, I will address first as a member of the Governmental Affairs Committee what I think is potentially an important new beginning in our investigation of the problems of the financing of the 1996 elections. 
Members of the committee have for some time had different perceptions about the most serious allegations involved in that investigation. This, of course, involves the question of whether or not there was an attempt by a foreign government, principally the Government of China, to influence our Federal elections in 1996. 
I believe that there is now a common understanding that while all sides previously acknowledged that there was probably such an attempt and regarded it seriously, there were differences about certain aspects of the allegations. 
I think the new common understanding is that while there was clearly such an attempt made by the Chinese Government, that it was bipartisan in its goals and primarily designed to influence the Congress of the United States and not exclusively the Presidential candidates in 1996, and that it also at this moment remains unclear whether or not to what extent it might have succeeded in either influencing the elections or more importantly the policies of the United States Government. These have been contentious issues that divided the committee until this day. 
I am very pleased, based on statements made by both Democratic and Republicans members of the committee, that I believe our investigation now proceeds with a common perception of these facts. I believe that is critical for the committee doing its work and in eventually uncovering whether and to what extent this foreign involvement violated our laws.

Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, on a separate second issue I want to address this morning the larger context of the continuing downward spiral in the national political dialogue, and specifically how it addresses the case of a single American. We have tragically in our time witnessed this deterioration in the public dialogue. We are now witnessing how its venom can influence the life of a single citizen. I am addressing, of course, the Whitewater investigation and the actions of independent prosecutor Kenneth Starr. 
Mr. President, I claim no expertise in the question of the Whitewater investigation. Indeed, it is not the focus of my remarks this morning. And I hold no brief for either President Clinton or the First Lady as I address this issue. Indeed, the injustice of which I speak does not involve anyone in the President's family, but rather a simple 42-year-old woman named Susan McDougal. 
Since September 9, 1996, Susan McDougal has been imprisoned for refusing to testify to an Arkansas grand jury convened by the independent prosecutor Kenneth Starr. And indeed, under the law a witness who refuses to cooperate and testify before a grand jury may be held for a civil contempt of up to 18 months. In this instance therefore the independent prosecutor initially acted within the law and probably appropriately. But that is where the problem begins. Because according to the legislative history of the statute, and indeed under the case law, the purpose of civil contempt and imprisonment `is to secure testimony through a sanction, not to punish the witness by imprisonment.' 
But according to briefings filed with the court, the prison conditions that Susan McDougal has endured up to this point sound more appropriate for a hardened violent criminal than a person jailed for civil contempt. 
In fact, while serving 3 months in the Faulkner County Detention Center in Arkansas, Susan McDougal lived under the following conditions. She did not see the light of day for 3 months. She was jailed in a unit that was constructed for 10 people but in reality usually held more than 20. As indicated by these photographs, she was usually shackled both by hands and feet whenever she went to court or to the doctor or to the dentist. This was not customary practice. Indeed, no other prisoner in that facility was shackled by hands and feet in this manner virtually at any time, no less when receiving medical treatment. 
When in transport, marshals were under instructions not to remove her shackles at any time including when she required to urinate. She was allowed one visit per week, and only through glass. She was forbidden any family or friendly contact through visitation. She was denied potable water. She could only drink from a rusty shower or a sink attached to a toilet. She was allowed no reading materials except for the Bible, of which I am sure she would have been grateful except she was forbidden to have any reading glasses, even when she offered to buy them with her own funds. 
After a brief stint at the Carswell Federal Medical Center in Fort Worth, where she was placed in a work camp with other women, many of whom were serving 30 and 40 years on narcotics charges, she was transferred to California. There in Los Angeles at the Sybil Brand Institute for Women, she was placed in isolation with one tiny slit in a door, the windows covered with barbed wire, with a single peephole where she could see the light of day. She was denied any reading material and was denied a chance to even meet with the prison chaplain. 
She was later moved to complete isolation from all other prisoners and was allowed out of her cell for 2 hours per day. So for 22 hours a day she was in complete isolation, no contact with anyone, no ability to see the light of day, with a single window covered with barbed wire, nothing to read, no one to talk to, not even counseling from a minister. 
During the evening hours, she is awakened every 20 minutes by a flashlight that is placed in her eyes. She is served breakfast at 4:30 in the morning where she eats alone in a 5-foot cell. If she should leave her cell, she is handcuffed behind her back and is forced to wear prison uniforms that are colored red, which is the color to indicate a murderer or an informant. She is routinely body searched and forced to strip naked for prison officials. She is escorted by a guard wherever she goes, including to the infirmary or the library. 
And finally, every time she uses the shower or on those occasions when she is allowed access to a telephone, every other 
prisoner is forced to be locked into their cells, which has heightened animosity toward her personally and led to dangerous, unlivable circumstances. 
Mr. President, I do not know Susan McDougal, and I confess I do not know a great deal about the Whitewater case. In many respects I rose today on the Senate floor to speak to neither, but to talk about justice. This is a barbaric set of circumstances that are indefensible and give rise to the question of whether or not Mr. Starr's investigation is being led by someone who seeks justice or is driven on the personal destruction of individuals to vindicate himself and his own investigation. 
Mrs. McDougal is not imprisoned for murder or robbery or any violent offense. She has faced no jury and is convicted of nothing. But for almost a year, she has been held on civil contempt. 
The Federal courts have ruled on a variety of circumstances, including in 1983 in the Sanchez case, and in 1984 in the Simkin v. United States case that a court is obligated to release an individual if it becomes clear that she will not testify after continued confinement. 
Indeed, in case after case throughout the history of this country judges have released individuals who have refused to testify after 6 or 8 months of imprisonment. 
Susan McDougal has now been imprisoned for 10 months. There is no indication that it will end soon. And it clearly is not going to result in her giving credible testimony. 
Indeed, it was argued before a Federal judge 2 weeks ago that not only is Susan McDougal's incarceration inhumane, it is counterproductive. 
If Susan McDougal were released from these extraordinary barbaric circumstances tomorrow, her testimony in the Whitewater case would be of absolutely no value. Her testimony would have no credibility. It clearly would have been coerced. No grand jury, no judge, and no jury would give it any validity. 
Her testimony is now useless. Any individual held in solitary confinement with no privacy, with no ability to consult with family or friends, denied access to a chaplain, shackled hand and foot, subjected to body searches, awakened during the night every 20 minutes, in some circumstances by a flashlight in her eyes, could not possibly at this point be giving voluntary testimony that would be usable in a court of law. 
Mr. President, Kenneth Starr should pursue the facts. If they produce further evidence that allows a case to proceed, it is his duty to do so. It is the obligation of every officer of this Government, in any of its branches, to first and foremost, however, pursue justice. 
Former Senator William Cohen, then a Member of this institution, said, `The appearance of justice is just as important as justice itself in terms of maintaining public confidence in our judicial system.' 
Mr. President, there is no confidence in our judicial system that can come from these facts. There is a cold tyranny on a single American citizen. It is time for the Federal judiciary to intervene to bring justice and to change the circumstances of Susan McDougal's life. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the Harkin amendment which restores OPIC, IMET, Trade and Development Assistance [TDA], and democracy-building institutions in Pakistan. 
This amendment provides us with a unique opportunity to strengthen and solidify our relationship with Pakistan. Pakistan is a friendly country and vitally important to the United States. By restoring these programs, we can influence the course that Pakistan's economic and political reforms take and improve the continuity of its democratic government. 
Pakistan has made great strides in these areas, and Prime Minister Sharif's election signals a turning point in Pakistani politics. As he moves to improve the quality of his country's government, the United States should provide the support necessary. Prime Minister Sharif has sponsored changes in the Pakistani constitution to end the President's power to dismiss the elected government. In the economic sphere, his government has embarked on an ambitious reform program intended to stabilize the economy. These are positive developments, but we need to encourage Pakistan to go even further. Our own Secretary of State has met with the Pakistani Foreign Minister to discuss options for more extensive reforms. 
It is in the United States' best interests to train Pakistani officials in how to conduct legislative procedure and build lasting democratic institutions. It is also in our best economic interests to resume OPIC support for investment in Pakistan. Prominent U.S. business leaders have expressed their support for such an initiative, and I believe this option can benefit U.S. industry. The United States will be in a prime position to support economic reform in Pakistan, as well as compete for investment and trade opportunities there. We cannot, and should not, penalize U.S. companies looking to expand into this area of the world. 
Neither should we jeopardize our stated goal of promoting nuclear nonproliferation. We have worked to prevent the nuclear arms race in South Asia, and future cooperation with Pakistan is now at stake. Restoring IMET in Pakistan is perhaps the best means we have of ensuring that nonproliferation becomes a reality. The Pakistani military controls the country's nuclear programs, but an entire generation of military officers has been denied access to training in the United States. By prohibiting IMET, we have succeeded in reducing our contacts within the leadership and limiting their exposure to U.S. values and institutions. If we allow IMET to resume, we will strengthen our position on nonproliferation by encouraging a Pakistani military that is as pro-United States as possible. Improved relations with Pakistan can only help our future nonproliferation efforts. 
Mr. President, I am pleased to be a co-sponsor of this amendment, and I look forward to a close relationship with Pakistan in the future.

Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I am proud to be an original co-sponsor of the Kennedy-D'Amato amendment, which would restrict aid to those countries which fail to comply with the United Nations sanctions against Libya. I rise today in strong support of its passage. 
Earlier this month the U.N. Security Council renewed international sanctions against Libya, as they have every 120 days since they were first imposed in 1992. Unfortunately, Mr. President, despite the fact that Libya refuses to comply with the will of the international community and extradite to the United States or Great Britain two Libyan nationals indicted as suspects in the murders of 270 people, the sanctions renewal was challenged by several African states. 
This challenge is just the latest episode in Libya's arrogant international campaign to avoid the justified opprobrium of the international community. Libya has gone so far as to intrude on the privacy of the victims of its criminality by writing directly to the American families of Pan Am 103 proposing their supposed `compromise' with international law directly to the families. Mr. President, I cannot overestimate how damaging it is to the interests of all democratic governments for Libya to be thrown a lifeline by the African members of the security council. Libya's U.N. Ambassador reportedly said after the Security Council vote, `We can from now on behave as if these sanctions were not there.' These sanctions are there, and they will remain. 
There are several episodes over the past two years that highlight the need for this amendment. Earlier this year, a Libyan-registered aircraft flew from Libya to Niger and returned to Nigeria despite U.N. sanctions. Last July, Muammar Qaddafi left Tripoli to attend an Arab summit meeting in Cairo. He arrived in Egypt by plane and left by plane, a clear violation of the ban on air travel. In December, the CIA revealed that Ukraine agreed to three different arms deals with Libya. The first involved the sale of $500 million worth of short-range ballistic missiles. A second deal called for Ukraine to provide maintenance services and spare parts valued at $10 million. The third agreement involved Iran's purchase of Ukrainian weapons with the intent of transferring them to Libya. 
Today we have made clear our determination to bring to justice those who destroyed 270 lives and brought suffering on countless other loved ones. I am pleased to join my colleagues in sponsoring legislation to deny United States assistance to any countries that violate international sanctions against Libya. We will make it clear to Libya that this pariah regime cannot escape the consequences of its lawless behavior.

Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I would like to thank Chairman McConnell and Senator Leahy for accepting this amendment expressing the Sense of the Senate that the State Department should list the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam [LTTE] as a terrorist organization. I believe that the LTTE meets the criteria approved during the 104th Congress to designate terrorist organizations, and I urge the State Department to carefully examine the evidence. 
Section 302 of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 defines a terrorist organization as one which is foreign, engages in terrorist activity, and threatens the security of the United States. There is no doubt that the LTTE is a foreign organization. Its main centers of activity are located in the United Kingdom and France, as well as Canada, Australia, and India. 
The State Department's Report on Human Rights Practices for 1996 details LTTE abuses which are undoubtedly terrorist activities. The LTTE regularly commits extrajudicial killings, and is responsible for disappearances, arbitrary arrests, detentions and torture. An attack on the army base at Mullaitivu in July 1996, orchestrated by the LTTE, killed more than 1,500 government troops. In the aftermath, an equally important fact came to light. It is clear that the LTTE regularly recruits children into its military forces. 
In the northern part of the island, the LTTE has expelled almost 46,000 Muslim inhabitants, almost the entire Muslim population, from their homes. These individuals have been threatened with death if they return. Lastly, the LTTE has been held responsible for the assassination of an Indian Prime Minister, a President of Sri Lanka, a Presidential candidate, and senior Sinhalese and Tamil political leaders. 
It is clear that these activities are of a terrorist nature, and I believe that they threaten the national security of the United States. Section 302 defines national security as that pertaining to `national defense, foreign relations, or economic interests of the United States'. In this sense, the promotion of democracy, free-market economies, and human rights throughout the world are fundamental to our interests. However, the LTTE does not follow the rules of democratic procedure. In fact, the LTTE espouses socialism and seeks to establish a socialist state in Sri Lanka. This stated ideology is far removed from the free-market policies that the United States promotes. 
With these facts in mind, I am hopeful that the State Department will move to list the LTTE as a terrorist organization. The safety and security of the United States, and our friends in Sri Lanka, depend upon it.

Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, countless thousands of American soldiers received their basic training at Fort Dix Army Base in my home State of New Jersey. However, the 1988 BRAC reassigned the basic-training mission of Fort Dix into a much more limited training role for our reserve forces. 
The economic impact in the surrounding communities was devastating. Local merchants whose business depended upon business generated by the Army personnel at Fort Dix suddenly saw their consumer base gone along with 3,500 jobs and countless others in the subsequent years. 
With funding assistance from the Federal Government and the Burlington County Department of Economic Development, a new master plan was drafted to reduce the area's reliance on the military and begin development of a downtown shopping area as well as new housing facilities. 
While the community struggles to re-build, the majority of the land formerly occupied by Fort Dix has been moth-balled and sits idle. For years, the community has been negotiating with the Army to acquire a 35-acre plot of land owned at Fort Dix owned by the Federal Government for use in the downtown development. 
I am pleased that this transfer now enjoys the support of the Army and that an amendment to transfer this 35 acres to the Borough of Wrightstown along with an additional 5 acres to the New Hanover Board of Education for an expected expansion of the school was included in H.R. 1119 that recently passed the House of Representatives. 
I had planned to offer a similar amendment to this legislation but after consultations with subcommittee chairman Inhofe and ranking member Robb I have decided to withdraw the amendment and would instead like to engage in a colloquy with my distinguished colleagues. 
Mr. President, I know you are familiar with this issue and are sympathetic to the plight faced by communities like Wrightsborough who have experienced significant economic difficulties in the wake of base closures. I am confident that based on my conversations with you that when this legislation goes to conference you and Senator Robb will give every consideration to the merits of this issue and the amendment adopted by the House.

 Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today to acknowledge the courage and sacrifice of 2d Lt. George A. Ward, of Hoboken, and S. Sgt. William Drager, of Hackettstown, NJ. Lieutenant Ward was the bombadier and Sergeant Drager the gunner on a B-24J airplane during World War II flying missions out of a base near Liuzhou, China. 
On August 31, 1944, Lieutenant Ward, Sergeant Drager and eight other crewmen off for what would be their second and final mission. The bomber successfully attacked Japanese ships and dropped mines near Taiwan before heading back to base. However, the plane was diverted because their base was under attack, and bad weather at the alternate landing site resulted in orders to circle while awaiting clearance to land. 
They never made it. Their B-24 crashed into a cliff 6,000 feet up the side of Maoer Mountain, southern China's highest peak, where dense bamboo and grotto-like slashes in the granite face swallowed the wreckage and the bodies of all 10 crewmen. 
The crash site lay undisturbed for 52 years until two Chinese farmers hunting for wild herbs found it last October. The discovery finally solved the mystery of what happened to the crew, and brought both some comfort and renewed heartache to the families of the airmen. 
As we approach the 221st anniversary of our Nation's independence, it is appropriate that we remember the bravery and commitment of individuals like Lieutenant Ward and Sergeant Drager. We continue to enjoy the freedoms that we have cherished since the founding of the Republic because of the sacrifice of millions of courageous men and women who heeded the call to duty when our Nation needed them. 
America is profoundly thankful for the patriotism of these men, and for this reason I stand today to recognize them for their accomplishments.

 Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Guyana as it celebrates the thirty-first anniversary of its independence. The Guyanese American community has a great deal of history to celebrate, and I wish to recognize the changes and advancements that have been made in Guyana in the past 31 years. 
For 32 years, the country of Guyana has worked to improve its standing within the international community and establish itself as a well-respected democracy. I am sure you will agree that Guyana has succeeded in these two goals. Participation in both the United Nations and the Caribbean Free Trade Area have meant better relations with the rest of the world. In addition, the smooth transition of power between President Hoyte and President Jagan in 1992 signify the end of political oppression in Guyana. 
I have been pleased with the United States' decision to reinstate the economic assistance to Guyana it had suspended in 1982 because it represents our willingness to take an active interest in Guyana. I hope that this partnership between Guyana and the United States will continue to flourish as Guyana capitalizes on the progress that independence has encouraged. Privatization, growth and decreased inflation are only a few of the ways in which the quality of life in Guyana has improved. These reforms can and must continue. 
The Guyanese have made tremendous achievements so far. With the continued commitment of its population, ongoing growth can be a reality. I look forward to 32 more years of positive news from this country.

Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, as the Senate has considered tax relief for people of means to encourage them to invest in a growing economy and people of more modest means to help with their education, I offer an amendment to deal with a different group of Americans, people not of high or medium income, but people of no income. 
Even in good economic times, through no fault of their own, through mergers, acquisitions, downsizing, or foreign competition, companies need to sometimes reduce their work force. And corporate America is responding responsibly by offering severance pay. 
My amendment simply takes the first $3,000 of severance pay offered to any American who loses their job through downsizing and makes that $3,000 tax free. It is offset. It is responsible. It is an appropriate Government response to a corporate policy which is the right way to help Americans to adjust to start their own businesses or retirement. 
I urge the adoption of the amendment.

Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, today, Senator Kerry and I are introducing the Save America's Forests Act. I rise to draw this country's attention to the management practices that threaten the health of our Nation's forest lands. When this country was founded over 200 years ago, it is estimated that there was 1 billion acres of forest land across this Nation. Today, 95 percent of those original virgin forests have been cut down. 
Forests are unique and valuable public assets. Large, unfragmented forest watersheds provide high-quality water supplies for drinking, agriculture, industry, as well as habitat for recreational and commercial fisheries and other wildlife. The large-scale destruction of natural forests threatens other industries such as tourism and fishing with job loss. As a legacy for the enjoyment, knowledge, and well-being of future generations, provisions must be made for the protection and perpetuation of America's forests. We must also set an example to poorer developing countries to preserve their vast forests so they do not make the same mistakes we did. We cannot call upon these countries to preserve large portions of their rain forests when we do not preserve the last fraction of our own ancient forests. 
Clear cutting, even aged logging practices, and timber road construction have been the preferred management practices used on our Federal forests in recent years. These practices have caused widespread forest ecosystem fragmentation and degradation. The result is species extinction, soil erosion, flooding, declining water quality, diminishing commercial and sport fisheries--that is, salmon--and mudslides. Mudslides in Western forest regions during recent winter flooding have caused millions of dollars of environmental and property damage, and resulted in several deaths. An environmentally sustainable alternative to these practices is selection management: the selection system involves the removal of trees of different ages either singly or in small groups in order to preserve the biodiversity of the forest. 
Destructive forestry practices such as clearcutting on Federal lands was legalized by the passage of the National Forest Management Act of 1976. From 1984 to 1991, an average of 243,000 acres were clearcut annually on Federal lands. During the same time period an average of only 33,000 acres were harvested using the protective selection management practices. Interpretations of forestry laws have also been used by Federal managers to include the promotion of even age logging and road construction. In addition, the laws are not effective in preserving our forests because in many cases judges do not allow citizens standing in court to ensure that the Forest Service or other agencies follow the environmental protections of the law. 
I am introducing this legislation to halt and reverse the effects of deforestation on Federal lands by ending the practice of clearcutting, while promoting environmentally compatible and economically sustainable selection management logging. It is important to note this legislation would only apply to Federal forests which constitute 20 percent of the country's harvestable timber supply, the vast majority of the 490 million acres of harvestable timber are privately owned and unaffected by the bill. This legislation puts forward positive alternatives that will achieve two principle policies for our Federal forests. First, the act would ban logging and road building in remaining core areas of biodiversity throughout the Federal forest system including roadless areas, specially designated areas and 13 million acres of Ancient Forests. Second, in noncore areas it would abolish environmentally dangerous forms of logging such as clearcutting and even aged logging. 
The act requires selection management logging practices to be used whereby timber companies would only be allowed to log a certain percentage of the forests over specified periods of time. Further it takes extra steps to protect watersheds and fisheries by prohibiting logging in buffer areas along streams, lakes, and wetlands. The act would also call for an independent panel of scientists to develop a plan to restore and rejuvenate those forests and their ecosystems that are damaged from decades of these logging practices. And finally, the legislation would empower citizen involvement in insuring compliance with environmental protections of forest management laws by making certain that all citizens have standing to pursue actions in court.

Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today with Senator Lautenberg to jointly recognize Larry Doby, the first African-American player in the American League. Mr. Doby's lifelong dedication to major league baseball, his community, and his country is truly remarkable and must be recognized. As an ambassador for baseball, Mr. Doby has served the league for nearly 20 years as a player, as a coach, and currently as a special assistant to the president of the American League. 
Mr. Doby, born in Camden, SC, later moved to Paterson, NJ, where he starred in four sports and ultimately garnered numerous offers for athletic scholarships toward his higher education. Although Larry Doby accepted an offer to play basketball for Long Island University, his collegiate athletic career was shortened as he enlisted in the U.S. Navy to serve our country in World War II. Following World War II, Doby played for the Negro League Newark Eagles, where he led the league with a batting average of .458 and 13 home runs. 
Some of Larry Doby's major league baseball accomplishments include being the first African-American player in the American League, the first African-American player on a world series team, and the second African-American to manage in the major leagues. Mr. Doby will be recognized by major league baseball at the all-star game in Cleveland. The naming of this post office in Larry Doby's honor in his hometown of Paterson would be a fitting tribute to this great American.

Mr. TORRICELLI. Madam President, I, too, would like to join in words of praise for Senator Byrd. Every Member of this institution knows the Senate of the United States has no finer scholar nor better defender of the U.S. Constitution than the Senator from West Virginia. I share his disappointment in the decision of the Court today that standing does not rest with Members of Congress. But, indeed, as Senator Moynihan noted, this is not only not a defeat, it is not even a retreat. The only two judges who were to consider this matter on its merits have reached the inescapable conclusion that by statute the Congress of the United States cannot rearrange basic constitutional powers as contained in the Constitution itself. 
There will be another day with other parties who will bring this matter before the Court on its merits. And on that date, this Court will again, as it has on so many occasions, preserve the basic structure of the U.S. Government as contained in the Constitution. On that day, Senator Byrd will have his victory. It is postponed, it is delayed, but it will not be denied. 
I once again offer my congratulations to the Senator from West Virginia on what will be his ultimate victory. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, throughout the course of this day, Members of the Senate have offered amendments which on occasion were of considerable benefit to people of great wealth, to encourage them to make investments for the benefit of our economy. As we have just witnessed, on occasion during the day, Members of the Senate have offered amendments for people of modest incomes, to encourage their savings, help them with the high cost of living and raising children. Indeed, many segments of society will find in this tax legislation various forms of benefits--to help with retirement and health and the rearing of children. 
Tomorrow, I will offer an amendment to the bill, not designed for those of high income and not specifically for those of moderate income. More particularly, it is designed for those of no income. 
The leading cause of unemployment in America for the last decade remains large-scale corporate downsizing. Even in a healthy economy, because of the introductions of new technologies, requirements of new skills, changes in trading patterns, acquisitions, mergers, people who are competitive, people who get up every day and work hard and are devoted to their communities, their families and their professions, their jobs, through no fault of their own, can find themselves in a situation without employment. 
Indeed, in the last decade 20 million Americans have been excused from their employment because of a large-scale corporate downsizing. But, in a considerable and rising tide of corporate responsibility, many of these companies have adopted the modern practice of giving severance pay to their employees. It is a chance, by the corporation, to give to the employee modest amounts of money upon their departure to reorganize their lives, seek new skills, move to a new location, start a business or go into retirement. 
Indeed, in a recent experience in my own State of New Jersey, one of the largest corporations in America, AT&T, only a year ago laid off 40,000 employees in a single announcement. A third of those employees decided to start their own businesses. A third went into retirement. Indeed, only a minority ever found employment in the short term under similar circumstances, and they were all offered severance pay. 
The problem, and it is the subject of my amendment tomorrow, is that while corporate America is offering this severance pay for people to continue and reorganize their lives in this competitive economic environment, the Government responds by taxing the severance pay up to a third, as if it were income. Imagine the circumstances. You have worked in a company all of your life and because of a merger or acquisition, a skill you may no longer possess, a change in the economy, even in good times you are excused from your employment, given $5,000 or $10,000, which you think goes best to continuing your education or opening a small business. Yet, when it is time to pay your Federal taxes, the Government takes a third of it from you, money that can make the difference in whether or not you can reorganize your life, move to a different place in the country to seek new employment, pay a tuition, or start your business. 
The amendment I offer tomorrow is as simple as it is important. The first $3,000 of any severance package offered to any employee in America whose severance package is less than $150,000, if that person does not get reemployment in 6 months, up to 95 percent of their previous compensation, that $3,000 is tax-free. The person should use it for what is best for themselves, their own families and their own future. 
I know at a time when our economy is growing, unemployment is low, a time of relative economic prosperity, few people are thinking about those who are without employment. In which State in this country, in what community have we not witnessed, through these extraordinary economic changes that indeed are the signature of our time, the dislocations of the marketplace? The times when many Americans would gain employment at the age of 18 or 22 or 25 or 30 and remain with a corporation most of their lives, those times have passed. The times when you gain skills in high school or college, and sought and obtained and retained employment all of your life with those skills, those times have passed. Even in good economic times, the length of employment with a single employer is shrinking. The consistency of employment with any employer is being reduced. 
What I offer is a response, a chance to make this tax bill relevant to those 20 million Americans who may in the next decade find themselves in similar circumstances. There is not a Member of this Senate who faces this amendment tomorrow who does not have a chance to address the people of their own State in a critical way, not just the 40,000 people of AT&T in my native State of New Jersey, but the 2,000 employees of IBM in New York State who are suing at this moment, trying to establish by law that their severance package is not income. 
In the State of Alaska, 1,200 people in the fourth quarter of 1996 were laid off; 88,000 people in the State of California; 22,000 people in the State of Illinois; 5,700 people in the State of Minnesota; 2,800 people in the State of Montana; 27,000 in Pennsylvania; 11,000 in West Virginia. In every State, in thousands of communities across this Nation, these dislocations have become a part of American life. 
I am very proud that tomorrow this Senate will adopt a tax bill, one that I am proud to vote for, that addresses so many different economic concerns of this country. It has a reduction in capital gains taxes for middle- and high-income people that is needed to encourage investment. I am for it. I am going to vote for it. It has a change in the inheritance tax to allow families to retain family businesses in higher incomes, upper-middle-class families; 
IRA's to encourage families to save for education for their children's welfare. Each and every one a legitimate response to a real problem. 
Mr. President, this is a problem, too. What is it we say to these people who want only to keep the money given them to reorganize their lives but are forced to share it with the Federal Government? 
Tomorrow I will offer this amendment and ask for the support of my colleagues. Thank you for the time, Mr. President, and I yield the floor.  
Mr. FRIST addressed the Chair.

 Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today in recognition of Tom Hartmann as he celebrates seventy-five wonderful years. Tom has been a cornerstone of academic life at Rutgers University, and he has made equally significant contributions to political and civic life in the State of New Jersey. It is a pleasure for me to be able to honor his past accomplishments. 
Prior to his academic career, Tom served admirably in the United States Marine Corps, flying 89 combat missions in the Pacific as a dive bomber pilot, during World War II. As a result of his efforts, he received the Navy Cross for valor. Upon returning to the United States, Tom transferred his sense of duty to the community. As the Associate Director of the New Jersey Office of Economic Opportunity, and then as Deputy Director of the Governor's commission on the Newark riots, Tom has played an important role in promoting better community relations within the State of New Jersey. 
As a Rutgers alumnus, I am proud to say that I have known Tom Hartmann personally. Tom's integrity and commitment to New Jersey's youth are two of the qualities I have admired most. He has worked to pass these same qualities along to the thousands of students who have sat in his classes or listened to him speak. There is no mistaking the sheer joy Tom has brought to his profession. 
Without his guidance and counseling, few Rutgers students would be as successful as they are today. This impact has been felt most in the political arena as Rutgers students have sought to make a name for themselves. A number of state and national government officials, including myself, have been the direct recipients of his advice. It is fair to say that Tom has a gift for crystallizing a student's goals and talents in order to make some of the most difficult career decisions easy. 
Tom's political astuteness is well-known at all levels of government. He worked closely with my predecessor, Senator Bradley, for many years on some of the most complex issues of our time. I have sought advice from Tom on more than one occasion, and his counsel has been welcome. Tom's ability to assess the political implications of any decision is truly invaluable, and I thank him for the years of support he has provided. 
Tom's contributions have done much for the future of New Jersey, and our nation as a whole. I congratulate Tom on a job well done, and I wish him the best for seventy-five more years of happiness.

Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce, along with Senator Sarbanes, the Quiet Communities Act of 1997. It is estimated that noise levels in communities across the country have increased more than 10 percent over the last decade. Studies indicate that noise affects one's ability to concentrate and can cause sleep deprivation, resulting in deleterious effects on health. Air noise is polluting our communities, and we must face and address this reality that affects the quality of life of our constituents. 
The Federal Aviation Administration predicts there will be 36 percent more flights in 2007 than there are today and that 60 of the 100 largest airports in this country are proposing to build new runways. A recent study by the Natural Resources' Defense Council found that the FAA's noise policy threshold is far too high for residential communities. Additionally, the study found there are over 250,000 people residing near Newark, JFK, and LaGuardia suffering from more noise than even the FAA deems fit for residences. 
In the 1970 Clean Air Act, Congress authorized $30 million for the establishment of the Office of Noise Abatement and Control [ONAC] within the Environmental Protection Agency [EPA] to study noise and its effect on public health and welfare, and to consult with other Federal agencies on noise related issues. In 1982, ONAC's funding was terminated and the Office has been virtually dormant since. 
Each year, new studies show potential links between high noise levels and health and quality of life issues. Few issues are as volatile or as controversial as air noise. The EPA has consistently differed with the FAA--and advocated stricter measures--on the selection of noise measurement methodologies, on the threshold of noise at which health impacts are felt, and on the implementation of noise abatement programs at airports around the Nation.

Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I want to identify myself with the remarks of my colleague, Senator Lautenberg, and I join with him in offering this amendment today. What we have before us is a classic case of adding insult to injury. The people of various communities in New Jersey have lived for 40 and 50 years with the problem of thorium. The stories are long and often involved, but the thorium is clearly dangerous in the case of Maywood and the thorium in Wayne. They are all the result of wartime production, the production of lanterns and bomb sights and other war material that required a low level of radiation. 
In an extraordinary story of success of the U.S. Government, in the case of Maywood all the thorium involving residential communities has now been removed. Now we are beginning to do the same in the community of Wayne. But it is not enough that the people of Wayne have the thorium removed. The question remains who will pay the bill? This was not an operation of the U.S. Government. This was not a question where the Government was operating the facility and it was left for the residents. This is a profitmaking corporation that had public and private contracts, earned money on the site, left it polluted, and the taxpayers are now left with the bill. 
To date, $50 million has been spent. It is estimated the final cost could be as high as $120 million to remove 100,000 cubic yards of waste material. 
Mr. President, only several months ago, I, as Senator Lautenberg, in concern that as we began to make progress in the removal of this thorium, wanted to know the progress and who was going to pay the bill. We pressed the Department of Energy to seek legal recourse in recovering costs and assuring future contributions. 
I, too, met with the W.R. Grace Corp., and I was very pleased after those meetings to receive this letter, as Congressman Pascrell, who represents this district, received this correspondence and claimed `we are entered into good faith negotiations with the Department of Energy in an effort to fairly resolve this matter.' 
The letter from the Grace Corp. concluded: 
Grace has acted in good faith and desires to achieve an amicable resolution to this problem. 
Only to discover in this legislation a prohibition in section (a) and (b): 
The Department of Energy may not recover from a party described in subsection (b) any costs of response actions for actual or threatened release of hazardous substances that occurred before reenactment of the act. 
The net result would be that all of our efforts to ensure the Department of Energy uses all legal recourse and continues in good-faith negotiations, that the private parties that profited by these operations also bear the cost of removal of the thorium contamination, would have been lost and the taxpayers would be left with the entire cost, $120 million. 
Mr. President, I am very pleased Senator Lautenberg and I have the chance today to strike this provision, and I am very pleased that Senator Smith, in his secondary amendment, will simply seek good-faith efforts in negotiations to resolve this matter. But let the record be clear to the Department of Energy, a good-faith resolution is nothing less than the Federal policy of polluter pays prevails. 
We fully expect the Department of Energy to seek those parties who profited and that they pay. We cannot allow an enormous environmental potential success to be transferred and transformed into a failure. As the communities of Maywood have seen much of the thorium now leave, Wayne is witnessing the first departure of that same thorium. We intend to see it not only removed, but the taxpayers not be left with a legacy of debt. 
I am very pleased we have a chance to offer this amendment today, and I am glad Senator Smith is now joining us in having good-faith negotiations proceed. I urge my colleagues to support both efforts. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, the Senate is faced with an issue as old as the Republic itself. It is the continuing debate between the public's right to know and the Government's need to retain information only unto itself. It is an old argument, but it is one that has largely been settled through time. 
We have decided as a country that the best source of good judgment in this Nation remains with the people and that they should be trusted with the public welfare in having a maximum exposure to the facts and judgments that govern our society. 
Indeed, it was that wisdom which led to the first amendment to the Constitution itself, and equally significantly as it led to article I, section 9, clause 7 of the Constitution, which reads: 
* * * a regular Statement and Account of the Receipts and Expenditures of all public Money shall be published from time to time. 
For a long time, Mr. President, despite these national ambitions, this consistency with our greatest national principles, we as a Congress determined this was not possible because of the dangers of world war and the continuing struggle in the cold war. 
It was the judgment of this Congress that even the total aggregate amount of expenditures for our intelligence agencies, including the Central Intelligence Agency, would remain private and not be published and shared with the people. 
The end of the cold war has raised this question anew. Not only for the intelligence community, but indeed for all of the U.S. Government. And most of this Government has responded appropriately. 
The Defense Department began to share information about programs it was developing, technologies that it possessed. Weapons hitherto unknown were shared with the press and the public. And perhaps predictably that is why since 1980, according to the bipartisan Brown Commission, defense expenditures of the United States in real terms have declined by 4 percent. 
Accountability by the people themselves led this Congress to adjust our national priorities to deal with the new emerging security situation internationally. No doubt, an equal reflection of the fact the intelligence community retained privacy of its budget is that the bipartisan Brown Commission found that since 1980 the intelligence community's budget, in adjusted terms, increased by 80 percent. 
Mr. President, what we are facing today in honest debate can no longer be concluded to be whether or not adversaries of the United States will gain information about our intentions and abilities of our intelligence community, because our adversaries have neither the means to respond nor probably the ability in all cases to understand the operations of our intelligence community. The only people being shielded from this information are not adversaries, but the taxpayers of the United States. 
Indeed, general accountings, in estimates, of American intelligence expenditures appear in all of our major newspapers. Only the exact aggregate numbers are denied, and not denied to adversaries; they are denied to the people of this country who need to make informed judgments as voters, as taxpayers about our national priorities. 
So I rise today with an amendment that this Senate has considered before. It is simply this: To publish, not the details of the CIA expenditures, not to reveal their programs, to share no numbers and no estimates on any technology, any element of spending of the intelligence community but one, the total aggregate amount of money spent in the U.S. Government for the Central Intelligence Agency. 
This one number would allow the American people, as an informed electorate, to make their judgments on a comparative basis about whether or not, as compared to defense, social programs, foreign assistance, and the intelligence community, this Congress is making the right judgments. 
And yet, it will be argued that our adversaries would have this information and use it for their own purposes. I understood that argument when we were concerned that the Russians, the Soviet Union with all of its capabilities, as our principal adversary would have this information and could adjust their own intelligence programs to respond. 
There is no Soviet Union; and the cold war has ended. The decline and change of our national defense expenditures give the best testament to the fact that this Senate has accepted that fact. 
Now we face new adversaries, terrorist organizations, a list of pariah states from North Korea to Libya, to Iraq and Iran. And so the question begs itself, what if these nations possessed this one aggregate number, of what value would it be to them? By most press estimates, total expenditures of the Central Intelligence Agency are not only more than the intelligence expenditures of each of those countries, it is more than all those countries combined. 
Indeed, the United States, by most published estimates, spends more on its intelligence community than the gross national product of every one of these potential adversaries of the United States. And so for those who will argue that we cannot share this information with the American people, I ask, what is it North Korea would do with this information or Libya or Iran? What possible change would they have in their own programs or their own expenditures? They have not the means to respond or to change. 
I repeat in my argument, Mr. President, as I began. There is only one people on this Earth that need this information to make important judgments about their future who are being shielded from it, and it is the people of the United States. 
Mr. President, if this argument seems familiar to Members of the Senate, it is because it is not new. This Senate voted on this question in 1991, a sense-of-the-Senate resolution in 1992, and again in 1993. 
Indeed, most Members of the Senate who in a matter of moments will vote on this question have already voted in previous years to share this information with the American people. 
Eighty members of the House of Representatives have cosponsored legislation to do so. 
The Federation of American Scientists have gone to Federal court to compel its release on constitutional principles. 
But perhaps most significantly, the President of the United States himself, our Commander in Chief, who has the ultimate authority for the security of the United States, suggested if the Congress would concur, he would release this information. 
This Senate on previous occasions has confirmed for the directorship for the Central Intelligence Agency Admiral Turner, Mr. Gates, Mr. Deutch. Each of those CIA Directors themselves have argued that concealing this information serves no purpose and it should be shared with the people. 
This Congress has disagreed on this issue before. And so a bipartisan commission, chaired by former Secretary of Defense Brown, and by our former Senate colleague, Senator Rudman, addressed this question in their own report. And they urged the public release of this information. 
To my colleagues, when you have voted on this question previously, when Directors of the Central Intelligence Agency, the President of the United States, and a commission charged for this very purpose argues that this single individual aggregate amount of spending should be released, by what possible logic do we continue to shield the American people from these facts? 
But if, Mr. President, in their individual judgment my colleagues are still convinced that because of the danger of these new pariah states and the rise of international terrorism, this expenditure must be concealed from our people, I urge them to consider the fact that we are also not the first of the allied nations to face this judgment. 
The British Parliament has had this debate. And Britain decided its people should share with this information. The Canadian Parliament, the Australian Parliament, and perhaps most significant, the Israeli Knesset--no nation on Earth is faced with the threat of terrorism more than Israel--but they have decided, in spite of the fact that their program cannot conceivably have our capabilities nor the relative advantage versus their adversaries as we face as opposed to our own, they share this information with the people of Israel. 
We remain the exception. 
Fifty years since the Second World War when a judgment was made that for national security, a judgment appropriately made for national security, that this information was best concealed, we retain this last relic of the cold war. 
Mr. President, this is a national policy to conceal the gross expenditures of the Central Intelligence Agency that has lost its rationale. It is time for this Senate once again, as it has on three previous occasions, to vote to allow the sharing of this information with the American people. But we do so not because we believe it is a compromise with national security that has become necessary, but because indeed many of us believe it would enhance our national security. 
Perhaps most significantly in the Brown report was a conclusion that, in the commission's words, `Most intelligence agencies seem to lack a resource strategy apart from what is reflected in the President's 6-year budget projection. Indeed, until the intelligence community reforms its budget process, it is poorly positioned to implement strategies.' 
Efficiency, accountability, proper judgments for national security, like all other aspects of the governance of the United States, are best made under the careful scrutiny of the people themselves. National security is not only the exception, it may be the best rule. It is the lives of the people of this country themselves--from terrorism and from a new group of potential adversaries--that we are charged with protecting. Allow the people of the United States to participate in this judgment. 
I urge my colleagues, once again, as you have done on several previous occasions, to join with the previous leadership of the Central Intelligence Agency in concurrence with the commission report that you commissioned to be done, and allow this single number, this one gross expenditure of the Central Intelligence Agency's budget, to be released to the American people. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I first thank my colleagues who have joined me in this effort today, most significantly, Senator Specter of Pennsylvania, who has led this effort previously and makes this a genuinely bipartisan effort to share this information with the American people, Senator Bumpers of Arkansas, who has argued so passionately on this cause previously, and, of course, the ranking member of the intelligence committee, Senator Kerrey of Nebraska. 
Mr. President, I know that many Government agencies would have liked the right to keep the information of their expenditures on a proprietary basis. This logic must have occurred to the Defense Department. Indeed, it was difficult for the Defense Department, at the end of the cold war, to begin to share some of the programs, exhibit some of the technology and the assets it possessed that previously had remained secret. 
This Congress and the leadership of this Government made a judgment that the people could not make the proper decisions about their elected representatives and we could not make the proper judgments for them without complete access to information. I want to remind my colleagues, we have faced this issue previously in 3 different years since the end of the cold war, and on each of those occasions this Senate has voted, even if contained in other legislation, either by law or by a sense of the Senate, to permit the publishing of this one single number. If we fail to do so today, it will be a change in the position of this Senate. It will be an inconsistency by a majority of Senators who served in this institution in those previous years. 
By what logic would we now change our minds? Because it will endanger an employee of the Central Intelligence Agency? On what basis and by what theory would anyone be endangered because they knew a total amount of money spent by the intelligence community? Because an adversary will change their plans, initiate a new program, compete with the intelligence community of the United States--when I have demonstrated that every and each potential adversary of the United States has a gross national product that is, according to published reports, smaller than the gross expenditures of the American intelligence communities? 
Mr. President, I conclude as I began: There is only one group of people who have real need of this information upon which to make decisions, and it is the taxpayers of the United States. This is the last cloud of secrecy necessitated by war, cold war and struggle, that should be removed by this Government. My colleagues have decided to do so before, but we have been frustrated in conference, and our will has not been done. It can be done now. 
I urge an affirmative vote to allow the public release of the aggregate expenditures of the United States intelligence community, a single number, published each year. The people of our country can make a good and accurate judgment. 
I want to thank again Senator Specter, Senator Bumpers, and Senator Kerrey for joining me in this and each of my colleagues who have voted previously on a majority basis to allow its release. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I thank Senator Specter and Senator Kerrey for joining me in this effort. We asked the Senate to do that which you have done three times before, that which three previous Directors of the Central Intelligence Agency have endorsed, that which the Brown Commission, in a bipartisan review of this issue, has endorsed--that is to share with the American people and the Members of this Congress the total aggregate amount spent on intelligence activities by the U.S. Government. No details, no programs, no internal facts--one aggregate number, so the people can make their own judgments whether the direction and the amount of intelligence spending is appropriate and proper for the U.S. Government. I urge an affirmative vote.

Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I am very pleased today to join my colleague from Pennsylvania, Senator Specter, in offering this legislation, and very proud, as a Member of this institution, that Senator Specter has taken the leadership in correcting what would clearly be an inexplicable action upon the execution of Timothy McVeigh. 
Mr. President, in the United States today there are 114 national cemeteries. They contain the bodies of 2.5 million brave Americans who have fought for over 200 years to protect this 
country, its people, and its ideals. Fifty-seven of those cemeteries remain open. And many Americans living in the last years of their lives who fought bravely for this country intend one day to be interred into that soil. 
I do not know how the Members of this Senate, how this Government could ever explain to those brave souls or their families who will visit those national cemeteries through the years, generation after succeeding generation, if by chance some of that soil, one of those graves, next to someone they love and they admire and respect, were to contain the body in a Federal grave of someone who committed a capital offense against the U.S. Government. 
Timothy McVeigh is responsible for the greatest loss of life in a terrorist act of anyone in the long and proud history of these United States. When he committed that act and took the lives of these brave Americans, including officers and employees of the U.S. Government, he forfeited, according to a jury of his peers, his life. 
Today, by the actions of the U.S. Senate, he can also have forfeited his right to be buried and have the honor of being in the sacred ground of a national cemetery of the United States. 
Mr. President, a person cannot both commit a capital offense and then receive the high honor of the U.S. Government for having served this country. They are in conflict. They cannot both occur. 
I am very proud today once again to be joining with Senator Specter in offering this legislation. I am very pleased to have received the support of Senator Rockefeller and so many of our colleagues. I am very proud today to be offering this legislation. 
By our action today, we let every family of every brave American who remains at rest in these national cemeteries to know these soils will remain sacred, these cemeteries will remain only the home for the brave. That is the exclusion we vote upon today. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor. 
Mr. SPECTER addressed the Chair.

Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today, on behalf of myself and the distinguished ranking member of the Terrorism Subcommittee Senator Feinstein, to introduce the Protection of the Sanctity of National Cemeteries Act. 
In so doing, I urge my colleagues to join me in my effort to close a huge loophole in our laws, which will allow Timothy McVeigh a hero's burial in a national cemetery--even after the Federal Government puts him to death for his heinous act of terrorism. 
Mr. President, current law lists a whole host of criminal acts by which even an honorably discharged veteran loses the right to burial in a national cemetery. These acts include espionage, treason, sedition, sabotage, rebellion and disclosure of national secrets, among other offenses. 
But for some reason, the use of a weapon of mass destruction against the property or persons of the U.S. Government is not included in this list. Nor is the murder of Federal law enforcement officers or the rest of the offenses already included in the definition of a Federal crime of terrorism. Each of these offenses is as clear a threat to the National Security of the United States as the crimes already listed, and should clearly disqualify the perpetrator from an honorable burial at Government expense. 
Because of this gaping loophole in the law, Timothy McVeigh--amazingly--remains entitled to burial next to true national heroes--men and women who have fought and died to defend this country and everything it stands for. He remains entitled to this hero's burial despite having committed the worst act of terrorism ever perpetrated on American soil. 
This situation is unacceptable. It is an insult to the memories of the 168 victims killed in the Oklahoma City blast. It is an insult to the memories of the truly courageous men and women who have earned and maintained the right to a hero's burial by the Federal Government. And it is an insult to justice, plain and simple.

Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Taking Back Our Neighborhoods Crime Fighting Act. This bill has already been introduced in the House by Representative Bob Filner, and I thank him for his efforts in crafting this innovative and exciting approach to neighborhood crime fighting. 
Mr. President, this is a very simple bill. Our legislation would provide a $50 tax credit to any American who actively participates in a Neighborhood Watch or other local crime fighting program. These local, citizen-run initiatives have proven extremely effective in reducing crime and restoring confidence in the safety of our local communities. 
Neighborhood Watch programs empower residents and bring neighbors together, creating a renewed sense of community, and common purpose. Working hand in hand with law enforcement, these groups are a vital part of the community policing which has been so successful in dramatically reducing crime over the last few years. It is no wonder that this tax credit proposal has received support from hundreds of public officials, including dozens of big city mayors, local sheriffs, police chiefs, and district attorneys. 
Mr. President, by providing this tax credit, we focus attention on the benefits of these local programs, and we reward those who already participate with a small token of appreciation. But more importantly, we also provide one more incentive to those who may have been reluctant to join a local group, or perhaps just didn't take the time to look into it. We hope that this additional incentive will create the final push needed to encourage everyone in our communities to join in the effort to stop crime and take back our streets. 
Even if people intend to go just a couple of times in order to qualify for the tax credit, I am certain that many of them will become active and lifelong participants once they are exposed to what Neighborhood Watch is all about. 
Mr. President, just a few months ago I traveled to a Newark townhouse and paid a visit to a courageous woman named Donna Cherry. Tired of the violence and the gunshots plaguing her neighborhood, Donna Cherry took matters into her own hands and formed a neighborhood watch organization to protect her community. Starting within her own townhouse complex, she and the group soon set their sights on surrounding areas. Members of the group patrol the streets, log and report suspicious activity, and plan youth conferences to educate local children about cooperation and making the right choices. By their actions--indeed simply by their visible presence on the streets of their community--these people undoubtedly deter crime. 
When I visited that neighborhood in March, I assured the group that the Federal Government would always stand behind efforts within communities to cooperate in the fight against crime--valiant efforts to save communities should not fail for lack of resources. We already provide indirect Federal funding for many of these groups, but funding is useless without the people to use it efficiently. Our bill will provide one more tool for community leaders like Donna Cherry to recruit new members and clean up our communities.

Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, almost 60 years ago, President Roosevelt, in his State of the Union Address, challenged the American people to not simply be content with our own freedom or our own economic progress but to fight for what he called, a world founded upon four essential human freedoms. He described them as the freedom of speech and expression, the freedom of every person to worship God as he sees him in his own heart, freedom from want, and freedom from fear of attack and aggression anywhere in the world. 
There was a sense of immediacy to President Roosevelt's remarks. He reminds us that these were not simply distant hopes for another time, but in his words, `It is a definite basis for a kind of world attainable in our own time and generation.' 
The world we live in, Mr. President, is largely the fulfillment of his vision on that day. After two world wars and a long-enduring cold war, we live in a time where democratic values have become common, markets are open, the rule of law governs the many nations of the globe. From South Africa to the former Soviet Union, across Latin America, freedom--free markets and free expression--have become the common coin of the realm in our time. 
But because these values are succeeding does not mean that they have met any final triumph. We have been reminded that in the fight for human freedom, there is no final victory. That is why, Mr. President, I take the floor today to remind our country and my colleagues that it is time to face the terrible truth about China. I raise this question not because China is not important but because it is central to the issue of prosperity and security in the 21st century. There will be no separate future. The free peoples of the world and those who live in China, because of its massive size, rising military power, enormous economic growth and even greater potential, the question about our own freedom and prosperity and most certainly the security of the United States and the allies and other free peoples of the world are inexplicably, inevitably tied to the fate of the Chinese people. 
We have learned in the 20th century the painful lesson that nations that may obtain great economic power inevitably translate that economic power into military means, and that military power invites its own use. We have also tragically learned that those nations that rule without the consent of their own people are inherently unstable and inevitably aggressive. 
These are truths we do not want to have to recognize. They are facts that I wish could be otherwise, but there is nothing in the history of our time that would lead us to any other conclusion and nothing that can lead us to believe that China in any way will be any different. 
Indeed, Mr. President, the record of the Beijing Government, for those who would promote most-favored-nation status and those who do not, for those who seek constructive engagement and those who argue against it, the record is not only remarkably clear but largely indisputable. 
In recent years, the Peoples Republic of China has shown little to no regard for commitments that have been made under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, the Missile Control Technology Regime, or the Chemical Weapons Convention. China has had a largely open policy regardless of international commitments or responsible policies of nonsignatories by selling technology of a nuclear and missile basis to Pakistan, Iran, and other governments. 
In a 1992 memorandum of understanding, China vowed to prohibit the export of any product manufactured by prison labor, but it has almost certainly systematically and knowingly ignored this pledge. Indeed, the activist Harry Wu has documented labor camps where millions of Chinese prisoners, against their own will, manufactured goods for export to the United States and other countries. 
In March 1996, the Beijing Government responded to the first ever free election held by a Chinese people on the island nation of Taiwan by firing missiles off the coast of Taiwan, seeking to intimidate its people and its government. 
Similarly, the human rights situation within China has continued to deteriorate since the horrible results of its policies in Tiananmen Square. These 8 years later, there not only is no progress on free speech or expression, there is no free speech or expression. Even today, 300 demonstrators who survived Tiananmen Square with their lives remain in jail. Indeed, Mr. President, not a single demonstrator or organizer or individual who spoke in sympathy of the events of Tiananmen Square and was jailed in the days that followed has been released. 
There is no freedom of religion. The Dalai Lama remains in exile, a prominent Catholic bishop was recently brutalized, and China has persecuted more Christians than any other nation on Earth for the single crime of worshiping their God. 
There is no freedom from want. The benefits of liberalized trade and high import tariffs flow to a small, corrupt, ruling elite while 300 million Chinese live on a single dollar a day. 
Finally, its neighbors live in increasing fear of attack. A China that cannot provide for its own people finds the means to build increasing military capability with new technology that it both exports at will and builds to potentially intimidate its neighbors, including the free government of Taiwan. 
Mr. President, the facts that I mention today are remarkably not in dispute. Those who even now decide their own position on free and liberalized trade with China and those who argue for or against constructive engagement will, in a matter of weeks, come to this floor to dispute not the facts, only the policy conclusion, because there are those who argue in good faith and will do so in this Chamber that regardless of these conclusions and all the evidence at hand, that if we will only put these facts aside and continue with a policy of liberalized trade, almost certainly as the day follows the night, the Chinese leadership will recognize the error of their ways, share their new prosperity with their people, allow free expression within their institutions and among the Chinese people, and in due course a new government more respectful of international commitments and of human rights will almost certainly evolve. 
Mr. President, the simple truth is 8 years have passed since Tiananmen Square. Free expression is not better; it is worse. Respect for the many faiths has not been enhanced; it has deteriorated. Commitment to arms control and a more responsible policy of restricting dangerous technologies for nuclear weapons and missile technologies has not been enhanced; it is also worse. 
Mr. President, we do the cause of freedom and the security of our country no benefit by postponing reaching the horrible truth. The 21st century, Mr. President, will be guided by whether or not there is progress in China in respecting her own people and being a responsible member of the international community. This relationship, more than any other in the world, will answer the critical question of whether the 21st century will be more peaceful, more respectful of humankind, 
and respect human life more than any other single relationship the United States will have with any other nation in the world. The facts would argue that this policy of constructive engagement is not leading us to that different future. 
Last year, the United States had a $40 billion trade deficit with China. This year, it will pass $50 billion. Patience and understanding is not leading China to recognize their obligations as a trading partner. From piracy of copyrighted CD's, to laser discs, to pharmaceutical products, the United States is losing billions of dollars' worth of intellectual property of our own people. In trying to continue to riddle our barriers with exports, with high tariffs, quotas, licensing agreements and discriminatory practices, patience is not leading China to become a responsible trading partner any more than it is leading to respect of rights, or religion, or arms control. 
Mr. President, last week in Detroit, the House minority leader, Mr. Gephardt, asked that we ground our policy toward China on principle and that it be consistent with other aspects of American foreign policy in our own history. He asked us to remember the words of William Allen White, who said, `Whoever is fighting for liberty is defending America.' 
The questions that we face with regard to policy on China may be larger because of the enormous power and size of the Chinese nation, but they are not novel. We have faced these issues before in Rhodesia, South Africa, Eastern Europe, and the former Soviet Union. We have found that trade sanctions--and in its most modest form, the denial of preferred trade status--is not only a legitimate but an effective means of promoting human rights and changing national policies. Jackson-Vanik was a remarkable success in leading the Soviet Union to change its immigration policy toward Jews and dissidents by withholding trade preference. Apartheid in South Africa was met by a denial of a policy of constructive engagement by simply refusing to allow our markets to be open until South Africa abandoned apartheid, and it succeeded. Those policies worked in the past. 
Today, we impose much stricter policies toward Cuba, Libya, Iraq, Iran, and North Korea--in many instances, for the same violations of arms control agreements, irresponsible sharing of dangerous technologies, violations of human rights, of religion and speech, for the very same instances that I take this floor today to cite in the case of China and which, ironically, will be ceded by proponents of most-favored-nation status for China, we have a policy of denying trade preference. For China, we seek to see a different conclusion, while we cede the same facts. 
Mr. President, I argue, however, for more than consistency. I argue that because China has violated these critical rights of her own people, because her Government continues without the consent of the governed and therefore is inherently unstable and potentially dangerous, because these rights have been violated, trade agreements with the United States have been ignored, because dangerous technologies are being shared with the world despite commitments to the contrary, China should not be the exception, she should be the rule. Withholding these trade preferences are not less important because of China's size and power. They are more important. 
Mr. President, regardless of our party, our philosophy, or our ideology, I know no Member of the Senate wants anything but friendship with the Chinese people. They have a rich culture, a great history, and in their hands, perhaps more than those of any other people on Earth, lies the question of peace, freedom, and prosperity for the many peoples of the globe. 
Mr. President, as President Roosevelt concluded in his State of the Union Address 60 years ago, he reminded us that we needed to be governed by reality and not hope. He concluded, Mr. President, by saying:  
No realistic American can expect from a dictator's peace international generosity, or return of true independence, or world disarmament, or freedom of expression, or freedom of religion--or even good business. Such a peace would bring no security for us or our neighbors. 
Mr. President, so be it. The world turns, generations succeed generations, but some truth remains eternal. The wisdom that Roosevelt brought to that dark day facing the authoritarianism of the Third Reich and of fascism, facing the prospect of a cold war he may not have been able to predict, but whose dimensions were beginning to become clear, the wisdom of that day can govern us as well. It is time to face the truth about China. 
I know every Member of this Senate wishes they had a chance to revisit in history the gulag, the concentration camps, all the blindness that we brought, the terrible problems of fascism and communism. We all wish that we could have seen the world as clearly as Roosevelt saw it on that day. We didn't all have his wisdom. We could not have all seen the future as clearly. 
Mr. President, there is no changing history, but there is still time for the 21st century. I rise today, Mr. President, to ask my colleagues to see China as it is, not as we would have it be. Someday, we will be accountable to the Chinese people themselves, and they will ask: Did you stand with us while we 
sought to worship our God? Did you defend us when we wanted to speak to our own future? Did you stand with us when we sought to choose our own government? Or, as you did in Iran, as you did often in the cases of communism, as you did in the early years of fascism, did you pretend to see the world as you would have it rather than the facts as they were presented to you? Were you part of change? Did you challenge our leaders? Did you put a price on their oppression? Or did you conspire with them in silence? 
Mr. President, that is the choice before us. It is not new. It has faced every generation that has ever stood on the floor of this Senate, every generation that ever succeeded the governance of this country. In a few weeks, when most-favored-nation status becomes an issue on the floor of this Senate, it will come again. I urge my colleagues to confront it with wisdom and reality, recognizing the extraordinary consequences for a new time and a new century, which we so desperately want to be different than the past. 
Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.

Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Electronic Mailbox Protection Act of 1997, in the hopes of addressing an increasingly serious threat to online commerce and personal privacy rights--the distribution of unsolicited, bulk e-mail by unidentifiable senders. 
It is an unfortunate side effect of the burgeoning and exciting world of online communication and commerce that more and more individuals are finding their electronic mailboxes filled to the cyber-brim with unsolicited messages. And many Internet service providers are facing slowdowns or even breakdowns of their systems due to uncontrollable and unaccountable senders of unidentifiable and unsolicited bulk e-mail. 
Mr. President, some have suggested that we simply ban all unsolicited e-mail. But some people do want to receive these unsolicited messages, especially when they are tailored to their personal interests. And legitimate businesses and organizations are increasingly using unsolicited e-mail to recruit new customers, new members, or even financial assistance. 
However, many people do not wish to receive unsolicited e-mail at all. And many new businesses are less than fully legitimate--all too frequently, unsolicited e-mail arrives with no return address, and no means of opting-out of future mailings. In fact, it is precisely because many bulk e-mailers know that their activities are going to meet massive opposition that they disguise their identities or alter their return addresses. 
Newly developed software and increasingly brazen cyber-promoters have only exacerbated the problem. In some cases, these messages have slowed down or even crippled Internet service through local or national Internet service providers. 
Many of these new cyber-promoters collect millions of addresses from service providers without consent, mail to those who have already expressed a desire to be kept off bulk e-mail lists, or purposefully disguise their identity or return address. They refuse to yield to public pressure, private suit or any other citizen action, and the more destructive of their tactics must be addressed before the situation overwhelms the Internet and paralyzes legitimate online commerce--something must be done. 
As a result, I have been working for some time now with privacy groups, marketers, online service providers, and others to develop strong but reasonable legislation to put a stop to the most destructive e-mail practices, while protecting the first amendment rights of all who wish to send legitimate e-mail of any kind. 
Mr. President, I have long been concerned about excessive--indeed any--Government regulation of the Internet. Many of the best qualities of American life are represented and enhanced by the Internet--the world's most democratic medium--and I do not wish to stifle speech or inhibit the freedom of commerce 
or expression. However, the problem of unaccountable junk e-mailers will not go away, and if we do not address this problem with legislation we risk the destruction of all legitimate expression and commerce on the information superhighway. 
After a long back and forth process with a wide variety of interests, I believe we are all finally in agreement that the bill I introduce today represents the strongest and most balanced approach to this growing problem. Specifically, my bill includes the following key provisions. 
First, and most simply, my bill will prohibit anyone from sending e-mail to a person who has asked not to receive such mail--either prior to receiving the first message or in response to an unsolicited message that made its way into the recipients mailbox. Mr. President, this provision requires no more than common courtesy and proper business sense. But unfortunately, this provision is sorely needed by the thousands--even millions--of recipients of repetitive and unsolicited e-mail. 
And the bill also contains a pro-active provision which effectively defines prior notice as including either direct notice or notice through a standard method adopted by an Internet standard setting body, like the Internet Engineering Task Force. In other words, we allow the IETF or another community-recognized organization to discuss, develop, and adopt a method of preemptively informing all senders that certain recipients do not want to receive any unsolicited electronic mail. This could take the form of an opt-out system, an opt-in system, or even some sort of address labeling standard--whatever the Internet community chooses to adopt. But once the standard is in place, my bill will require that senders comply with that standard. We have given the Internet community the tools to enforce their own pro-active steps, and I believe this achieves a proper balance between Government action and self-regulation. As much as is possible, Congress should avoid dictating the details of Internet architecture. 
Second, my bill will prohibit sending unsolicited e-mail from an unregistered, illegitimate, or fictitious Internet domain for the purpose of preventing an easy reply. Such tactics have become increasingly common in recent months, because the less responsible marketers know--they just know--that many of the recipients of their unsolicited junk will be unhappy and wish to respond. Rather than act responsibly and respond to complaints as they come in, these fly-by-night marketers prefer to make it impossible to respond. We have all heard from constituents who are simply fed up with these practices, and this bill will empower our constituents to do something about it. 
Third, my bill will prohibit the use of procedures designed to defeat or circumvent mail filtering tools. Consumers and service providers are getting better at using mail filters to block out unwanted mail. But these filtering programs, still in relative infancy, are no match for cyber-promoters with sophisticated techniques and all the time in the world to work on skirting the filters and making it into your mailbox. 
Next, my bill will prohibit anyone from using a computer program to harvest, or gather, a large number of e-mail addresses for the purpose of sending unsolicited e-mail to those addresses or selling the list to other senders of 
unsolicited e-mail--if such activity would be against the policy of the computer service from which the addresses are collected. In other words, if America Online or AT&T or Panix or Erols have policies against using a computer to harvest addresses of their subscribers, cyber-promoters would have to comply. 
My bill also puts a stop to so-called hit and run spamming, which occurs when someone gets access to a temporary e-mail account, sends out thousands of unsolicited messages, and then abandons the account and leaves the service provider to clean up the mess. Under my bill, registering an Internet domain or e-mail account for the purpose of sending unsolicited e-mail and avoiding replies would be prohibited. 
Finally, Mr. President, my bill directs the FTC to pay close attention over the next 18 months to the affects that this bill has on the junk e-mail problem. At the end of that time, the FTC will submit a report to Congress detailing its findings, and we can determine whether or not new action is necessary. 
And what will happen to those who break the rules we intend to set down in law? Well, there are two possibilities. First, there is a $5,000 civil penalty for each violation, to be imposed by the U.S. Government. 
But more importantly, this bill empowers the individual recipient or service provider suffering the effects of a violation of this bill to sue for damages. These damages range from $500 for simple violations all the way up to $5,000 for particularly egregious or willful abuses. And if we think about the possibilities for class action suits, we can quickly see the deterrent effect of these provisions. 
Mr. President, this bill will not prevent all unsolicited e-mail. Legitimate marketers, nonprofit organizations and others will still be able to send unsolicited e-mail, even in bulk. However, this legislation will make the senders of the e-mail accountable to the service providers and to the e-mail recipients. No longer will brazen promoters be able to disguise their identity and hide behind technology--from now on, they will be accountable for what they send and punished if their tactics are of the kind that merit such action. 
Put simply, Mr. President, my bill will empower consumers and Internet service providers alike to block, filter, reply to, or prevent unwanted and unsolicited electronic mail. 
We all recognize that we should not lightly enter into Internet regulation. But some practices are simply too destructive to ignore, and certain types of unsolicited e-mail must be stopped.

Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today, on behalf of myself and the distinguished Senator from California, Senator Feinstein, to introduce the Gun Kingpin Death Penalty Act of 1997. I hope that our colleagues will soon join us in sending a clear and strong signal to our most violent gunrunners--your actions will no longer be tolerated. 
Mr. President, the fight against gun violence is a long-term, many-staged process. We have already succeeded in enacting the Brady bill and the ban on devastating assault weapons. Last year, even in the midst of what many consider a hostile Congress, we told domestic violence offenders that they could no longer own a gun. 
And these laws have been effective: 186,000 prohibited individuals have already been denied a handgun due to Brady background checks--70 percent of these people were convicted or indicted felons. Traces of assault weapons have plummeted since the ban, and prices have gone up. And our law enforcement officers are no longer dying at the hands of criminals armed with assault weapons. 
As I said, we have been successful. But we cannot be satisfied with victories in battle--we must use every avenue possible to win the war against gun violence. 
Mr. President, it is for this reason that I rose just a few weeks ago with Senator Durbin to introduce a new prosecutorial tool in the fight to stop gun traffickers--the Gun Kingpin Penalty Act of 1997. That bill would institute a sliding scale of mandatory minimum penalties for the worst gunrunners, and I hope we can debate it soon. 
But we must also address the problem of the most violent and dangerous offenders--those who commit murder in furtherance of their gun trafficking crimes. So I rise again today to issue a new challenge--send a message to murderous gunrunners that their violence must stop. 
Our Gun Kingpin Death Penalty Act of 1997, which is modeled after the Drug Kingpin Death Penalty legislation already enacted into law, provides that any criminal who commits murder or successfully orders a murder committed during the course of trafficking in more than 25 firearms may receive life in prison or the death penalty. This provision gives Federal prosecutors one more tool in the fight against gun trafficking, and sends out a warning to all violent gunrunners--think twice before you act. 
Mr. President, when I rose with Senator Durbin last month to introduce the first in this two-bill attack on gunrunners, I cited recent numbers gathered by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms which clearly demonstrate what many of us already knew all too well--several key highways in this country have become so-called firearm freeways--pipelines for merchants of death who deal in illegal firearms. 
We learned from the ATF data that in 1996, New Jersey exported fewer guns used in crimes, per capita, than any other State--less than one gun per 100,000 residents, or 75 total guns. In contrast, Mississippi exported 29 of these guns per capita last year. 
Meanwhile, an incredible number of guns used to commit crimes in New Jersey last year came from out-of-State--944 guns were imported and used to commit crimes compared to only 75 exported--a net import of 869 illegal guns used to commit crimes against the people of New Jersey. 
In fact, the top six exporters of illegal guns used to commit crimes in New Jersey supplied 62 percent of the guns, 585, and only one of those six States--North Carolina--has strong gun control laws. 
This represents a one-way street--guns come from States with lax gun laws straight to States--like New Jersey--with strong laws. 
New Jersey has long been proud to have some of the toughest gun control laws in the Nation. But for far too long, the courageous efforts of New Jersey citizens in enacting these tough laws have been weakened by out-of-State gunrunners who treat our State like their own personal retail outlet. 
It is clear that New Jersey's strong gun control laws offer criminals little choice but to import their guns from States with weak laws. We must act on a Federal level to send a clear message that this cannot continue and will not be tolerated. And we must send an equally clear message that gunrunners who commit murder risk the ultimate of penalties.

Mr. TORRICELLI. I thank my colleague for yielding me the time. 
Mr. President, in my brief tenure in this institution I have never felt more motivated on an individual amendment and in addressing a higher national priority than endorsing and speaking today on the amendment of Carol Moseley-Braun regarding school finance. She has made an enormous contribution to this institution. 
Mr. President, like every Member of this Senate, I share the priority of balancing the Federal budget. It is due, it is required, and it is essential. 
We do no service to the country, however, if in our desire to balance the Federal budget we also lose sight of all other Federal priorities. Balancing the Federal budget is important, but it is not the only business of this country. It is noteworthy that the principle contribution in reducing the Federal debt in recent years has come from neither reducing spending nor raising taxes. It is the unmistakable result of a growing, expanding economy. 
The amendment before the Senate is relevant and not an obstacle to reducing the debt of the U.S. Government because education is the foundation of an expanding economy. My goal is not simply to see us balance the Federal budget for the next few years but for the next generation. That is unachievable in a Nation with a $100 billion inventory of crumbling schools, schools which cannot teach modern technology, where children cannot even sit safely in a classroom. 
The GAO has reported that 14 million of our own children are in schools with extensive need of repair or requiring total replacement. Half of our schools are unable to take advantage of the latest technology because of inadequate wiring. Mr. President, 74 percent have outlived their usefulness. 
Recently, I toured some of the most troubled schools of my own State of New Jersey. In Perth Amboy, Newark, Jersey City, and Paterson, I saw students sitting in classrooms trying to learn the latest of mathematics and science with buckets next to their desk to collect the rain, classrooms that were being held in school corridors because science classes were not safe, gymnasiums used for lecture halls because of inadequate space. 
It may be that what we do today involving the Federal Government and the rebuilding of our schools is a precedent. So be it. There was a time when the Federal Government had no role in the building of roads. It was local. Then we built a national economy. There was a time the Federal Government was not involved in transportation. Then we saw the need for expanded interstate commerce. 
Today there can be no misstating that this country will go no further and no farther in the education of our children and their preparation for the future. 
I respect my colleagues who may have a different view. But I would ask this: If you believe that this is not a crisis, that there is no Federal role, and that we can build a modern economy, pay our bills and balance our budget into the future without rebuilding these schools, come to New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Newark, or Camden and stand in those schools. Look those children in the eyes. Tell them they have a future and they can play a role in expanding the American economy competitive with other students around the world without rebuilding these schools. Tell them and convince yourselves that there is a strong and stable American economy without this effort. 
Mr. President, only a few months ago the President of the United States came to this Congress with a single new domestic initiative. He too recognized that we live in times of limits. The budget must be balanced. He provided the leadership that got us to this day in sight of a balanced budget. But his single new initiative, his single promise to this country for the next year, was the rebuilding of these schools. 
There is a $5 billion program represented today by the Senator from Illinois that will allow $20 billion worth of construction across America by reducing the local costs of borrowing; $20 billion will not solve the problem with a $100 billion inventory. But it is a real contribution. It is a real beginning by having this country address this extraordinary and deep problem. 
Mr. President, I, too, support the tax cut provisions of the balanced budget plan. I do not want to see it lessened or diminished in any way. That is why it is significant. 
The provisions by the Senator from Illinois will allow the Finance Committee to either eliminate some tax loopholes or provisions of corporate welfare to compensate so that we can reach a balanced budget and keep the current tax reduction plan.

Mr. TORRICELLI. Thank you, Mr. President. I thank the distinguished minority leader for yielding. 
Mr. President, for 25 years the question of abortion has been among the most divisive in our Nation. It divides our families and poisons our political debate. 
We come to this floor today still holding, I know, fundamentally different views on this question. I believe strongly that the issue of bringing a pregnancy to term remains with a woman in consultation with her conscience and her doctor. I know others have fundamentally different views. 
But there is a real chance at long last, at least for this moment, for one narrow part of this issue, to find some common ground. Because, on this day, there is a chance to address at least the issue of postviability, late-term abortions. And the question largely rests with those who have dedicated these years in opposition to abortion rights generally. 
The Senator from South Dakota [Mr. Daschle] has offered an alternative--that it is constitutional because it deals only with postviability pregnancies. It, and it alone, can pass the constitutional test of Roe versus Wade. It alone does not have an undue burden or a substantial obstacle, as outlined in Casey versus Planned Parenthood. And it alone will get the signature of the President of the United States. 
Yet, there are those who passionately want to prohibit this procedure but will not be voting with us on this occasion. It raises the question of whether they avoid this chance to end late-term abortions because they seek to preserve a political issue more than to end the procedure which many Americans find offensive. 
Mr. President, I will be voting with Senator Daschle because, while I strongly believe--as our Supreme Court has affirmed--that there is an inherent right to privacy, that every woman has a constitutional right to reach her own judgment about whether to bring to term or terminate a pregnancy before viability, there is a legitimate public policy question affirmed by the courts on whether or not this procedure or any other should be allowed to continue postviability. 
Senator Daschle, in the alternative that he brings to the Senate today, prohibits not only the late-term abortion procedure described in detail by those supporting Mr. Santorum's legislation, but he also prohibits other alternatives dealing with postviable fetuses. And he alone does so. 
It again begs the question whether or not this Senate is intending to actually prohibit late-term abortions, or whether, 
cynically and regrettably, this is genuinely an effort to maintain a political issue, because, if Senator Daschle fails, our opponents may, in fact, outlaw this single procedure, but at least three other procedures also dealing with postviable fetuses would be allowed to continue, and many women whose lives would be better protected, their health better assured, would be forced to use other procedures that are more dangerous. 
Mr. President, I urge the adoption of Senator Daschle's alternative. It is constitutional. It protects a woman's choice. It is a better balance. It is the only chance for common ground. Let us resume the fight tomorrow and today to end this late-term abortion struggle.

Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the efforts by the Appropriations committee to fund research into environmental risk factors associated with breast cancer as a part of S. 672. 
I would especially like to thank and acknowledge the efforts of the distinguished chairman of the Appropriations Committee, Senator Stevens, the distinguished ranking member of the Appropriations Committee Senator Byrd, as well as the efforts of the chairman of the Labor, HHS Subcommittee, Senator Specter and its ranking member, Senator Harkin for their attention to the concerns I have raised regarding this issue. All have been dogged advocates of breast cancer research and I am grateful for their previous efforts and for what they have done in the legislation before the Senate. I am especially grateful for their acknowledgement in the committee's report of the alarmingly high breast cancer rates in the Northeast and specifically my State of New Jersey. 
Few issues pose as significant health threat to the constituents I represent as does breast cancer. It is estimated that nationally 1 in 8 women will be diagnosed with breast cancer in their lifetime and over 46,000 women die annually from breast cancer. It is truly one of the leading health threats facing American women. 
However, it is an absolute health crisis confronting the women of New Jersey with mortality and incidence rates that far exceed the national average. New Jersey has the highest breast cancer mortality rate of any State and our incidence rate of breast cancer is 11 percent higher than the national average and the average for in the Northeast. It is estimated that there will be 6,400 new cases of breast cancer diagnosed this year and 1,800 women will die from breast cancer in 1997 alone in New Jersey. 
I have long believed that behind our State's history of environmental problems lies the reasons for our high breast cancer rates. I do not believe that it is a coincidence that the State, New Jersey, with more Superfund sites than any other, as well as thousands of other contaminated sites not listed under Superfund, has the highest cancer rates in the Nation. 
In response to this I recently introduced the New Jersey Women's Environmental Health Act with Senator Lautenberg that would authorize a 4 year $10.5 million study into the possible association between environmental risk factors and breast cancer. I believe this effort will provide not only answers to the women of my State but ground-breaking research into this association. 
In New Jersey, we are extremely fortunate to have one of the leading cancer research institutes in the Nation. The University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey is only 1 of 7 academic institutions in the United States which houses a National Cancer Institute designated clinical center and an NIH-designated comprehensive Center of Excellence for environmental health sciences. Indeed, not only does it have the State's only NCI-designated cancer center, but the University is also home to a HHS-designated Women's Health Initiative site. I believe that this unique institution is the type of multicenter institution envisioned by the committee to do this important research. 
Working with these scientists and clinicians, we have developed a proposal that would assess breast cancer in New Jersey at many levels, from molecular markers of environmental exposure to clinical evaluation and treatment. It also includes the involvement of the State Department of Health in a population-based epidemiological study. 
Mr. President, our leading environmental health scientists from Rutgers, our State University, and the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey, both partners in the State's NIEHS Center of Excellence, concur that there are several key elements of this study which must be pursued. These include the need to: (a) identify the disease patterns in the State--ethnicity, geographic location, occupation and education of the victims; (b) identify and characterize the potential etiologic factors--such as exposure to Superfund effluents, pesticides and occupational hazards; (c) analyze tissue samples and environmental samples for etiologic agents and tissue samples for genetic markers of disease; and (d) conduct a full scale case control study. 
That is why I am so encouraged by this committee's efforts to fund research into this important area and am thankful that the project I have developed in consultation with the University of the Health Sciences of New Jersey and the New Jersey Department of Health will have an opportunity to immediately compete for the funds necessary to begin its implementation. 
I would like also to thank the subcommittee chairman, Senator Specter, for his recognition that the issues this initiative proposes to address are the type of issues the committee envisioned to be studied with this funding. 
As I have stated earlier, I believe our initiative will not only provide answers to the women of New Jersey but will provide ground-breaking research into the association between environmental conditions and breast cancer in this Nation and greatly assist in this committee's goal of providing answers that may account for some of the startling regional variations of breast cancer in this Nation.

Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Alaska [Mr. Stevens]; the Senator from Vermont [Mr. Jeffords]; and the Senator from Massachusetts [Mr. Kennedy], for their assistance in what is, for the State of New Jersey, a very important matter. 
Mr. President, while the people of the Dakotas were realizing an extraordinary emergency of massive proportions, which the entire Nation was witnessing, the people of Ocean County, NJ, were witnessing an equally devastating, though not nearly so noticed, tragedy in their lives. Extraordinarily high rates of childhood cancer, brain cancers, and neurological cancers were occurring in only a few individual communities in Ocean County, NJ. 
I am extremely proud that the Department of Health of the State of New Jersey and, in the Federal Government, the Centers for Disease Control responded immediately in undertaking studies to find possible environmental causes for these high rates of cancer. Today, with the help of Senators Bond, Stevens, Kennedy, and Jeffords, we are responding in this emergency supplemental appropriations bill. We are authorizing the continuation of the study to try to find the reasons for these childhood cancers. 
I am very grateful for this Federal response. This legislation assures that these studies will continue to their conclusion, possibly, and hopefully finding the reasons for these tragedies. For this, I am very grateful to my colleagues, Mr. President. I wanted to express my thanks.

 Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, today I am introducing `The Personal Computer Truth in Advertising Act of 1997,' which is designed to ensure that consumers are provided with accurate information about the performance of what is becoming one of the most important consumer products in the Nation, the personal computer. 
My bill requires the Federal Trade Commission to investigate and conduct a study of the marketing and advertising practices of personal computer manufacturers and retailers with regard to possibly misleading claims made about the performance of their products. 
As we head into the next century, the personal computer is quickly becoming one of the most important consumer products. Indeed, the market for computers in the home has exploded in recent years with the market expected to double by 2000. Still, despite their growing popularity, purchasing a personal computer involves technology and terminology that can be very intimidating and confusing to the average consumer. 
Of particular concern to me is a practice by personal computer retailers and manufacturers in how they advertise the speed of the central processing unit (CPU) of the personal computer. Indeed, when marketing and advertising personal computers, the CPU speed is a prominent selling point and consumers are frequently charged hundreds of dollars more for models with faster CPU's. 
The CPU is to the personal computer as an engine is to an automobile. Measured in millions of cycles per second [mhz], the faster the CPU, the better the software performs. The CPU's in personal computers, including the popular Pentium chip, operate at two speeds, an external speed and an internal speed. The external speed affects computing activity the user sees in action--the scrolling of a web page or a word processing document, the smoothness of an animated interactive storybook and the complexity and frame rate of a flight simulator. The internal speed of the CPU involves activity invisible to the user--spreadsheet calculations, spell checking and database organization. 
Nonetheless, personal computers are commonly marketed according to their internal, and faster, speed. For example, a Pentium computer advertised as a 200 mhz screamer runs at only 66 mhz externally. Still, most advertisements fail to mention this discrepancy and retailers and manufacturers charge hundreds of dollars more for the 200 mhz than they would for a 66 mhz model. 
Moreover, driving the sales of personal computers has been the availability of advanced multimedia and interactive entertainment software. This is the very software whose performance depends greatly on the CPU's external clock speed. 
My legislation would require the Federal Trade Commission to conduct a study of the marketing and advertising practices of manufacturers and retailers of personal computers, with particular emphasis on claims made about the CPU. My bill requires the FTC to perform their study within 180 days of enactment of the bill. I had previously written to the FTC on this issue as a member of the House. 
Car manufacturers provide both highway and city mileage performance figures for the performance of their engines and computer manufacturers should follow the same logic with the engines of the personal computer, the CPU. 
I urge my colleagues to cosponsor this bill and I will work hard for its enactment into law.

Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of Senator Kempthorne's effort to provide Medal of Honor recipient Vernon Joseph Baker, and the heirs of Medal of Honor recipients Edward Carter and Charles Thomas, with retroactive compensation for their awards. 
During World War II, Mr. Baker was an Army 2d lieutenant serving with the 92d Infantry Division in Europe. During a 2-day action near Viareggio, Italy, he single handedly wiped out two German machinegun nets, led successful attacks on two others, drew fire on himself to permit the evacuation of his wounded comrades, and then led a battalion advance through enemy minefields. Mr. Baker is the only one of these three men still alive today, and he currently resides in St. Maries, ID. 
Edward Carter, of Los Angles, was staff sergeant with the 12th Armored Division when his tank was destroyed in action near Speyer, Germany, in March 1945. Mr. Carter led three men through extraordinary gunfire that left two of them dead, the third wounded and himself wounded five times. When eight enemy riflemen attempted to capture him, he killed six of them, captured the remaining two and, using his prisoners as a shield, recrossed an exposed field to safety. The prisoners yielded valuable information. Mr. Carter died in 1963. 
Charles Thomas, of Detroit, was a major with the 103d Infantry Division serving near Climbach, France, in December 1944. When his scout car was hit by intense artillery fire, Mr. Thomas assisted the crew to cover and, despite severe wounds, managed to signal the column some distance behind him to halt. Despite additional multiple wounds in the chest, legs, and left arm, he ordered and directed the dispersion and emplacement of two antitank guns that effectively returned enemy fire. He refused evacuation until certain his junior officer was in control of the situation. Mr. Thomas died in 1980. 
I commend Mr. Baker, Mr. Carter, and Mr. Thomas for their bravery and Senator Kempthorne for leading this effort. 
As a result of their heroics these men had clearly met the criteria for being awarded a Medal of Honor, the Nation's highest award for valor. This medal is only awarded to a member of the U.S. armed services who `distinguishes themselves conspicuously by gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of their life and beyond the call of duty,' with an act `so conspicuous as to clearly distinguish the individual above their comrades.' However, because of the racial climate of the time and the segregated nature of the Army in 1945, African-Americans were denied the Medal of Honor. It is a sad testament to America's legacy of discrimination that although 1.2 million African-Americans served in the military during the Second World War, including Mr. Baker, Mr. Carter, and Mr. Thomas, none received 1 of the 433 Medals of Honor awarded during the conflict. 
This past January our Nation took an important step in correcting this injustice by awarding Mr. Vernon Joseph Baker, and six of his dead comrades, the Medal of Honor during a long-overdue ceremony at the White House. This recognition of these men's extraordinary courage was a vindication for all African-American heroes of World War II. In order to further demonstrate our profound thanks to these brave men, I support Senator Kempthorne's effort to retroactively compensate Mr. Baker, and the heirs of Mr. Carter and Mr. Thomas for the money that they would have received from the Army for receiving the Medal of Honor. The other three heroes died as a result of the brave deeds which qualified them to receive the Medal, and thus would not have received any compensation by the military. 
Each recipient of this Medal is entitled to receive a token monthly stipend from their respective branch of the military after they leave active duty service. In 1945 the stipend was $10 and today it has risen to $400. Since he was denied the Medal more than a half century ago, Mr. Baker and the survivors of Mr. Carter and Mr. Thomas, deserve to receive the same amount of money that they would have received had they been awarded the Medal at the close of World War II. American is profoundly thankful for the patriotism of these men, and awarding retroactive compensation to them is a simple way to express our gratitude for their service. For these reasons I stand today to recognize Mr. Baker, Mr. Carter, and Mr. Thomas, and support retroactively compensating them for their accomplishments.

 Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr President, I rise today in strong support of Senator Kempthorne's effort to provide Medal of Honor recipient Vernon Joseph Baker, and the heirs of Medal of Honor recipients Edward Carter and Charles Thomas, with retroactive compensation for their awards. 
During World War II Mr. Baker was an Army 2d lieutenant serving with the 92d Infantry Division in Europe. During a 2-day action near Viareggio, Italy he single-handedly wiped out two German machinegun nests, led successful attacks on two others, drew fire on himself to permit the evacuation of his wounded comrades, and then led a battalion advance through enemy minefields. Mr. Baker is the only one of these three men still alive today, and he currently resides in St. Maries, ID. 
Edward Carter, of Los Angeles, was a staff sergeant with the 12th Armored Division when his tank was destroyed in action near Speyer, Germany, in March of 1945. Mr. Carter led three men through extraordinary gunfire that left two of them dead, the third wounded, and himself wounded five times. When eight enemy riflemen attempted to capture him, he killed six of them, captured the remaining two and, using his prisoners as a shield, recrossed an exposed field to safety. The prisoners yielded valuable information. Mr Carter died in 1963. 
Charles Thomas, of Detroit, was a major with the 103d Infantry Division serving near Climbach, France, in December of 1944. When his scout car was hit by intense artillery fire, Mr. Thomas assisted the crew to cover and, despite severe wounds, managed to signal the column some distance behind him to halt. Despite additional multiple wounds in the chest, legs, and left arm, he ordered and directed the dispersion and emplacement of two antitank guns that effectively returned enemy fire. He refused evacuation until certain his junior officer was in control of the situation. Mr. Thomas died in 1980. 
I commend Mr. Baker, Mr. Carter, and Mr. Thomas for their bravery and Senator Kempthorne for leading this effort. 
As a result of their heroics, these men had clearly met the criteria for being awarded a Medal of Honor, the Nation's highest award for valor. This medal is only awarded to a member of the U.S. armed services who `distinguishes themselves conspicuously by gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of their life and beyond the call of duty,' with an act `so conspicuous as to clearly distinguish the individual above their comrades.' However, because of the racial climate of the time and the segregated nature of the Army in 1945, African-Americans were denied the Medal of Honor. It is a sad testament to America's legacy of discrimination that although 1.2 million African-Americans served in the military during the Second World War, including Mr. Baker, Mr. Carter, and Mr. Thomas, none received 1 of the 433 Medals of Honor awarded 
during the conflict. 
This past January our Nation took an important step in correcting this injustice by awarding Mr. Vernon Joseph Baker, and six of his dead comrades, the Medal of Honor during a long-overdue ceremony at the White House. This recognition of these men's extraordinary courage was a vindication for all African-American heroes of World War II.

For these reasons I stand today to recognize Mr. Baker, Mr. Carter, and Mr. Thomas, and support retroactively compensating them for their accomplishments.

Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today, along with my colleague from Illinois Senator Durbin, to introduce the Gun Kingpin Penalty Act of 1997. In introducing this bill, Senator Durbin and I hope that our colleagues will soon join us in sending a clear and strong signal to gunrunners--your actions will no longer be tolerated. 
Mr. President, recent numbers gathered by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms clearly demonstrate what many of us already knew all too well--several key North-South highways in this country have become pipelines for merchants of death who deal in illegal firearms. 
My own State of New Jersey is proud to have some of the toughest gun control laws in the Nation. But for far too long, the courageous efforts of New Jersey citizens in enacting these tough laws have been weakened by out of State gunrunners who treat our State like their own personal retail outlet. 
We learned from the ATF data that in 1996, New Jersey exported fewer guns used in crimes, per capita, than any other State--less than 1 gun per 100,000 residents, or 75 total guns. In contrast, Mississippi exported 29 of these guns per capita last year. 
Meanwhile, an incredible number of guns used to commit crimes in New Jersey last year came from out of State--944 guns were imported and used to commit crimes compared to only 75 exported--a net import of 869 illegal guns used to commit crimes against the people of New Jersey. In fact, the top six exporters of illegal guns used to commit crimes in New Jersey supplied 62 pecent of the guns--585--and only one of those six States--North Carolina--has strong gun control laws. 
This represents a one way street--guns come from States with lax gun laws straight to States, like New Jersey, with strong laws. 
It is clear that New Jersey's strong gun control laws offer criminals little choice but to import their guns from States with weak laws. We must act on a Federal level to send a clear message that this cannot continue and will not be tolerated. 
Mr. President, once again this year Senator Lautenberg and I have introduced our one-gun-a-month bill, which would go a long way toward preventing bulk sales and massive trafficking in firearms. 
But today's bill is the next logical step--hitting illegal traffickers where it hurts with tough mandatory minimum sentences that will get these gunrunners off our streets.

 Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I introduce the Explosives Protection Act of 1997. I do so just over two years after the tragic bombing of the federal building in Oklahoma City, because I hope that this bill will, in some small way, prevent future bombings--whether by terrorists of symbolic targets, malcontents of random ones, or even spouses involved in marital disputes. 
This bill, while not directly related to the circumstances in Oklahoma City, is a first step towards protecting the American people from those who would use explosives to do them harm. 
Not many people realize, Mr. President, just how few restrictions on the use and sale of explosives really exist. While we have increasingly restricted the number of people who can obtain and use a firearm, we have been lax in extending these prohibitions to explosives. 
For instance, while we prohibit illegal aliens from obtaining a gun, we allow them to obtain explosives without restriction. And this same divergence applies to those who have been dishonorably discharged from the armed forces, those who have renounced U.S. citizenship, people who have acted in such a way as to have restraining orders issued against them, and those with domestic violence convictions. Each of these categories of persons are prohibited from obtaining firearms, but face no such prohibition on obtaining explosive material. 
Additionally, while this Congress has been moving to prevent nonimmigrant legal aliens from obtaining a gun, in response to the recent shooting at the Empire State Building, we have neglected to work towards this same goal with regards to explosives. 
Mr. President, many of these differences in the law are simply oversights--Congress has often acted to limit the use and sale of firearms, and has neglected to bring explosives law into line. And in so doing, we have made it all too easy for many of the most dangerous or least accountable members of society to obtain materials which can result in an equal or even greater loss of life. 
Congress has already made the determination that certain members of society should not have access to firearms, and the same logic clearly applies to dangerous and destructive explosive materials. It is time to bring the explosives law into line with gun laws, and this is all my bill does. 
Specifically, my bill would take the list of categories of people who cannot obtain firearms and would add any of those categories not currently covered under the explosives law. Additionally, my bill would insert the Durbin-Kennedy nonimmigrant provisions into the law to protect us from persons entering the country and quickly moving to purchase and use deadly explosive material. 
Mr. President, this is a simple bill meant only to correct longstanding gaps and loopholes in current law. I urge my colleagues to support the bill, and I hope we can quickly move to get this passed and protect Americans from future acts of explosive destruction.

Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, today, Senator Lautenberg and I are introducing the New Jersey Women's Environmental Health Act. I rise to draw this country's attention to breast cancer and the threat that it faces to all American women. It is estimated that more than one in eight women will be diagnosed with breast cancer in her lifetime. Over 46,000 women will die each year. The American Cancer Society estimates 6,400 new cases of breast cancer in New Jersey in 1997--an estimated 1,800 deaths in this year alone. It is for this reason that I speak today, in an effort to heighten the awareness of breast cancer in our Nation and its possible environmental causes. 
Breast cancer in New Jersey is much worse than the rest of the country. New Jersey has the highest breast cancer death rate of any State in the Nation. Overall, New Jersey has an 11 percent higher incidence rate of breast cancer than the national rate. Between 1988-92 New Jersey's rate was 110.8. For the United States the rate was only 105.6. The highest counties include: Warren, 34.8 percent; Morris, 20.7 percent; and Monmouth, 18.5 percent. During this time, 19 of New Jersey's 21 counties had a higher incidence rate of breast cancer than the national average and two-thirds of these counties had a 10 percent or higher incidence rate of breast cancer than the national average. 
Federal and national foundation funding is disproportionately low for a State with a significant academic and research presence, and an exceptionally high death rate from breast cancer. The per capita expenditure on breast cancer funding in New Jersey is only $0.15. Neighboring states with lower breast cancer rates have received significantly more funding per capita. New York receives $1.11 and Massachusetts receives $3.05. In general, New Jersey gets only $0.62 back for every tax dollar sent to Washington. We contribute $17 billion more to the Federal Treasury than we get back--the lowest return in the Nation. 
I believe that behind our State's history of environmental problems lies the reasons for our high breast cancer rates. It is not a coincidence that New Jersey, the State with the most Superfund sites, also has the highest breast cancer rates. The current breast cancer research efforts are not being focused on epidemiological studies that investigate the effect of environmental factors. The value of providing expanded research concerning the environmental factors for breast cancer in New Jersey is essential not only to New Jersey women, but to all women across the country.

Mr. TORRICELLI. I thank the Chair. I thank the Senator from Delaware for yielding. 
Madam President, tomorrow the Senate will exercise its historic constitutional powers of treaty ratification. It is a solemn power that we have exercised for two centuries. That power has often defined the security of the Nation and sometimes been determinant of war and peace itself. The issue before the Senate now is the ban on chemical weapons, probably the most important foreign policy question remaining before the United States in this century. 
Perhaps because the consequences are so great the choice is also clear. This treaty demands ratification. The treaty itself is a culmination of a process that began over 12 years ago under the leadership of Ronald Reagan. The United States began a review and then determined that it would eliminate chemical weapons. We did so because of the need to reduce the numbers of those weapons in the world and to restrict the ability of those nations that did not possess them to obtain them. 
Since Ronald Reagan's judgment a decade ago, we have made extraordinary progress. In 1985, President Reagan signed into 
law a judgment that would eliminate American stockpiles by the year 2004, having an important impact on the ratification of this treaty because, whether it is ratified or not, no matter what judgments are made by this institution, the United States is going to eliminate chemical weapons. Second, the United States then followed our own judgment by leading the international effort with 160 other nations to enact a multilateral ban. It is the result of that process that is now before the Senate. 
The process, it is important to note, did not culminate with the Reagan administration. In 1992, President George Bush announced a strong American support for the treaty and the United States became an original signatory. A year later, under President Clinton, the United States once again announced its support. Today, we have come full circle. From Ronald Reagan's first pronouncements, the treaty, now endorsed by a Democratic President, seeks ratification under a majority Republican Congress. 
The Secretary of State said only a week ago:  
This treaty has `made in America' written all over it. It was Ronald Reagan's idea, George Bush negotiated it and signed it, and Bill Clinton has embraced it. 
In truth, however, Madam President, the treaty is neither Democratic nor Republican. It reflects the bipartisan commitments of the United States toward our security, our values, and a century of learning the lessons of collective security because after 80 years of living under the threats of chemical weapons, it is the judgment of this administration and those that preceded it that it is time to eliminate these weapons. 
The treaty does several direct and important things. It bans the development, production, and stockpiling of chemical weapons. 
Second, it requires the destruction of all chemical weapons and their production facilities. 
Third, it provides the most extensive verification process in the history of arms control. 
Finally, it grants member nations the effective tools for dealing with those who refuse to comply, tools that will be denied the United States if we fail to ratify the treaty. And yet many of my colleagues have questioned the need for the United States to become a member state. They note two principal objections. First, that the burden of reporting requirements and verifications would be onerous on American industry; and second, the impact on American defense capabilities. 
Allow me to deal with each. First, the economic impact. In my State of New Jersey, the chemical industry represents fully one-third of the entire industrial capability of the State; 150,000 citizens of the State of New Jersey are employed in this vital manufacturing industry of chemicals. Let us be clear. The entire industry, from small companies to among the largest industries in the State of New Jersey, not only supports this treaty but has joined in demanding its ratification. 
Second, on the question of American defense capabilities, it should be self-evident that if the United States is unilaterally forgoing these weapons and rogue nations continue to embrace them, American military personnel will be more vulnerable and, indeed, endangered if the United States is not a signatory, allowing us to help enforce the provisions of the treaty and deny capability to rogue nations than if we are to 
remain on the outside. 
That is why this treaty has been endorsed by General Powell, 17 other four-star generals and every former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff--in the Carter, Clinton, and Ford administrations. 
I ask my colleagues who oppose this treaty, would all these members of the general staff, would each of these men who have held the principal responsibility for guiding and leading our Armed Forces have endorsed this treaty if there was any chance, if there was any judgment, that, indeed, our Armed Forces would be less safe?

Mr. TORRICELLI. Madam President, this is a moment of judgment that this Senate has faced before. History instructs us that we cannot afford to be wrong. Over 75 years ago, this body chose the wrong route and the toll was monumental. During consideration of the treaty for the League of Nations, the United States took the lead in forming the principles of collective security. It was our leadership which brought the world to understand that there was no separate peace, there was no individual security, and yet in that instance, as in this moment, the United States, after providing the intellectual and the political leadership, was a reluctant participant. The judgment then, we were told, was that there were reservations because of individual provisions of the treaty. But, indeed, history instructs us, and I believe would guide us now, that those reservations were not because of individual aspects of the treaty but because of a general ideologic opposition to arms control and the general notion of collective security. 
It is time for the United States, after all the painful lessons of previous generations, to simply understand there is no unilateral security in a multilateral world. From Pearl Harbor to the Persian Gulf, history demands us to recognize an essential truth: American security, because of a changing world and developing technology, requires and demands that we deal with other nations. 
The choice before this Senate is clear. From the doughboys who endured the horrors of mustard gas in the trenches of Europe, the Kurdish refugees who suffered in Iraq, to the refugees of Cambodia who suffered yellow rain, to our own veterans of the Persian Gulf, it is time to put an end to chemical weapons. That power is in the hands of the Senate. If we fail to do so, a host of rogue nations will take advantage of the opportunity. 
Before this Senate on July 10, 1919, Woodrow Wilson closed the debate saying, `We are the only hope of mankind. Dare we reject it and break the hearts of the world.'

Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, this morning, millions of Americans awoke to some startling revelations, news that was particularly painful to thousands of veterans of the Persian Gulf war. Yesterday the Central Intelligence Agency released a report that stated that as early as 1984 it had intelligence reports warning that chemical weapons held by the military of Iraq were stored at a previously undisclosed chemical weapons site. 
Indeed, in 1986, the CIA had received even more specific reports and obtained a copy of an Iraqi chemical weapons production plan that mentioned large storage facilities and the exact location and even the types of chemicals and other weapons that were being stored at that location. 
Despite each of these reports and the existence of this detailed information in the very files of the Central Intelligence Agency, the Pentagon was not informed at any level on any basis of any of this information when the ground war commenced in the Persian Gulf in January 1991. 
Without this information, tragically, American ground forces entered the specific chemical weapons storage facility named within Central Intelligence Agency files in March 1991. Fully 20,000 American soldiers were in the vicinity and potentially were exposed to the residue of those chemicals when this facility was destroyed. 
Two days later, after the destruction of the facility, potentially after 20,000 American soldiers were exposed to these chemical weapons, the Central Intelligence Agency informed the Pentagon of this information and a possible exposure. 
Mr. President, yesterday Dr. Robert Walpole, a CIA agency official investigating this incident on behalf of the Central Intelligence Agency, issued an apology to the Nation's veterans. It is not good enough. This Nation for several years has been agonizing about the cause of unknown illnesses among our soldiers. During all of that study, during all the long nights of wonder and doubt and pain, this information was not supplied to the President, the Congress, the commission studying this information or, most importantly, those veterans whose lives may have been permanently changed and damaged. And now we are given an apology. 
Mr. President, this is more than a failure in a single instant. It is another example of the fact that the American people and this Government are not being adequately served by the American intelligence community. 
Dr. Walpole stated the reasons, in his judgment, for this failure. He said, first, that there was tunnel vision in the American intelligence community; second, that there had been an incomplete search of the files; and, third and perhaps most chilling to all of us who share these concerns about the role of the American intelligence community in working with our military and civilian personnel, he said there was a reluctance by some CIA officials to share some of its most sensitive information with Government officials. 
It appeared that some CIA officials knowingly and consciously weighed the sources of their information with the potential of sharing that information with the U.S. military and made the wrong judgment, making victims, potentially, out of our own soldiers. 
Mr. President, this is not an isolated failure of intelligence policy. It is indicative of a continuing plague of bad judgment, and it is an indication of a need for large-scale institutional reform of how the intelligence community conducts its business, makes its judgments, and shares its information with elected officials and the U.S. military. 
We are experiencing again not only a failure of leadership, but an inability to share at the proper time in the proper manner with the leadership of this Government sensitive intelligence information. 
The intelligence community was created in this country to ensure that elected officials had the best information to make the right security judgments for this country, so that the U.S. military would have the best possible information to both prevail in conflicts and minimize casualties. Neither can be accomplished if officials of the intelligence community do not feel a responsibility, indeed, are not driven by the need to share the best information with the leadership of the U.S. Government. 
An apology has been issued to the Armed Forces of the United States and those who may have suffered as a result of this incident. It is not only inadequate, it is a disservice to every man and woman who wears the uniform of this country. The President of the United States and this Congress must respond to this latest incident by beginning institutional reform in the organization, the leadership and, indeed, the mission of the Central Intelligence Agency. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor and thank you for your indulgence.

Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, the months ahead will require a number of important decisions regarding the continuing evolution of U.S. policy in the region of the Taiwan Straits. 
Today, I am submitting a concurrent resolution to help clarify long-standing U.S. commitments in this regard. 
While the Clinton Administration and Congress attempt to improve relations with the communist authorities in Beijing, it is important for Congress to make clear the depth of the bipartisan commitment to the burgeoning democratic forces on Taiwan. Any improvement in U.S. relations with Taiwan, does not and should not come at the expense of our ties with the people of Taiwan.

 Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today to inform the Senate that Americans are still committed to economic progress and that local government is not powerless in the face of economic challenges. In my home State of New Jersey, the city of Hackensack has shown that dedication to solving long-term economic problems can be accomplished with practical leadership utilizing innovative solutions. 
Over the past few years, the city of Hackensack had seen its downtown population decrease and its economic stability put at risk. The people of Hackensack were not to be deterred from making their city the best it could be. So, instead of accepting an unsatisfying economic fate, Hackensack's mayor and city council called together local business leaders to establish the Hackensack Economic Development Commission. This pioneering commission set out to study the city's economic climate and propose steps toward its continuing development. 
This study, conducted by the Eagleton Institute's Center for Public Interest Polling at Rutgers University, is the first of its kind by a municipality in our State. The city's initiative and creativity in utilizing these research tools should be commended. Hackensack's climate study is unique in that it reached a broad range of people, over 5,000 residents and workers of the Hackensack area. The wide scope and depth of the study is a model for similarly situated cities in New Jersey. 
Yet, more than a model for New Jersey, the efforts of the commission serve as a model for the entire country to prove that with solid community commitment, ongoing economic growth can be a reality. Thus, I ask that you join me in recognizing the city of Hackensack in its devotion to be an improved economic development and commend its foresight and planning to other cities across the Nation.

Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I, too, would like to commend the distinguished Senator from the State of California, Dianne Feinstein, as well as the Senator from Georgia, Mr. Coverdell, and those who I believe in good faith have come together with this agreement. I respect their work. I know their purpose and their intent. 
I do not know whether other Senators will vote in opposition to this agreement on this day. I do not know if there are any, but I will not vote for it. I want, Mr. President, to make clear my reasons, because I look at the same facts and I simply come to a different conclusion. 
I remember, Mr. President, being told at the end of the cold war we were going to be free of some of the compromises of our own interests which were necessary when we were defending ourselves in that great international struggle. We would be able to speak the truth again and to put our own interests of our own people first. 
This is a test of that principle. It is argued that to tell the truth about Mexico and to decertify Mexico as an ally in the war against narcotics would involve offending Mexican sensibilities. Given the realities of Mexican history or the Mexican political situation, it would cause political complications. 
Mr. President, the question is not whether or not Mexico would be offended by a truthful analysis. The issue raised is whether or not Mexico is an ally in the war against narcotics. That is the only question that was asked. It is the only question that is relevant. 
The truth is unmistakable. Mexico is not assisting, is not an ally in the war against narcotics, and saying that it is or postponing the judgment, as would be done by this resolution, does not escape that truth. 
The truth, Mr. President, is that 14,000 Americans die every year from illegal narcotics. If this judgment is to be postponed until September 1, and March, April, May, June, July, and August are to pass, then another 7,000 Americans will be consumed in the spiral of death by illegal narcotics, and they will have died while we maintain a false conclusion. 
What is it, Mr. President, we would say to the law enforcement officers from New York to Los Angeles to Chicago, to small towns all across America, to DEA agents around the world, who risk their lives every day facing the truth, if we will not face the truth? 
Mexico has had an opportunity in the last year to choose sides in the war against narcotraffickers. They had a choice when the United States filed 52 extradition requests with the Mexican Government and no one was extradited. They had a choice when is 250 Mexican law endorsement officers were dismissed from their positions because of corruption, and none were prosecuted. They had a choice when the Mexican Congress passed money laundering statutes which were not enforced. Mr. President, Mexico has had a choice every day for the last year. 
Now, it may be the will of this institution to give them another 6 months to make that choice again. I believe, Mr. President, that given the extensive corruption in the Mexican Government, the compromising of Mexican law enforcement officials, and their pervasive operation of narcotrafficking criminal organizations in Mexico, Mexico may now not only lack the will, but may no longer possess the ability to control the flow of narcotics to the United States. We cannot construct a policy of interdicting narcotics in Mexico by becoming part of a silent conspiracy, where Mexico pretends to be helping interdict narcotics and we pretend to believe them. 
This judgment gets no less painful after 6 more months pass than it will be today. It was said, Mr. President, during the cold war that the United States and the Soviet Union went eye to eye and America never blinked. The United States and Mexico are now facing a war against narcotics, and we have made an unfortunate decision to turn our face away from the truth. The proper action of this Senate, in my judgment, would be to vote to decertify Mexico and place both Mexico and those who influence her on notice that a price will be extracted for the deaths of 14,000 Americans every year by illegal narcotics, a price will be extracted for failing to choose sides in the war against narcotics. 
Mr. President, I know this is a difficult decision for every Member of the Senate. But we do not face the hardest choices. The real choices are made by our agents in the Drug Enforcement Administration, by those on border control, by the families who wait up every night to see whether their fathers and mothers and brothers and sisters in law enforcement in our cities and on our borders will come home alive. Our choice is easy. Look at the facts, review the evidence, and tell the truth. There is an open season on the American border for narcotics. Calling Mexico an ally in the war against drugs will not make them a friend and not force them to choose sides. This is a painful choice that must be made by the citizens of Mexico and her business and political leaders. If some are voting for this postponement of judgment until September 1 because they believe it would cause political problems for the PRI, the current political leadership of Mexico, then let it be so. 
We serve no American or Mexican purpose by hiding from judgment the current political leadership of Mexico. It is a moment of truth by our own people. If elements of the leadership are corrupted or compromised against the interests of not only other nations against fighting narcotics, but against defending Mexico in the interests of our own people, then let the Mexican people understand that truth and vote accordingly. That is the decision, Mr. President. I believe that we postpone not only recognizing the truth about Mexico's participation in the war against drugs, but we postpone, by our silence, the Mexican people realizing the truth about their own government, at a time of political judgment in the Mexican electoral system. 
For Mexican interests and for American interests, I will vote against this resolution. 
A long time ago, we came to the decision that there would be a war against drugs. In wars, there are casualties. At the moment, the principal casualties are our own children and the police officers of our own country. It would be unfortunate if some in the Mexican political establishment have to face the wrath of their own people, or if the good name of Mexico is compromised. Perhaps, Mr. President, they will be added to the list of victims in the war against drugs. No war is ever won without casualties. It's time to get serious in the war against drugs. I believe decertifying Mexico is an important step. 
Mr. President, I will vote accordingly. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I am proud to include my name as an original cosponsor of the Estate Tax Relief for the American Family Act of 1997, which was introduced today. This is a critical tax reform bill that will modernize our antiquated estate tax policy, provide significantly improved economic security for family businesses, promote efficient and pro-growth economic policy and ensure sound financial practices for millions of American working families. 
This legislation gradually increases over 6 years the estate and gift tax exemption from the current limit of $600,000 to $1 million. The graduated time schedule would increase the exemption by $100,000 in each of the first 2 years following enactment and $50,000 in each of the next 4 years. 
For families with their own small business, the bill would provide a new small business exemption of $1.5 million of business-related assets above the first $1 million in an estate as well as 50 percent of the next $8.5 million of such assets. This proposal would provide new safeguards for family business solvency that is not currently provided under current law. 
These changes are desperately needed as our current estate tax policy has not been upgraded in a decade. Even worst, the current policy has proven to be a economic failure. Estate and gift taxes are one of the smallest sources of revenue, collecting only $10 to $15 billion per year, mostly because Americans have found legal means of avoiding the tax. Indeed, Prof. Douglas Bernheim of Stanford University has theorized that more income tax revenue may be lost through clever estate planning than is actually collected through the estate tax. 
Even worse, the current policy encourages Americans to spend capital on consumption items rather than save because saving their money would increase the value of their estate and, ultimately, their estate tax liability. Indeed, it has been estimated that the tax cost of a dollar saved increases by an amount somewhere between 7.4 cents and 55 cents because of current estate tax law. 
And for small business, the current policy is devastating. The family-owned pizza parlor, dry cleaning store, grocery and family farm are failing to provide the kind of generational economic continuity that national policy should be encouraging. Indeed, more than 70 percent of family businesses don't survive the second generation and almost 90 percent don't survive to a third generation. Most of these failures occur because current estate tax policy drains a family's financial ability to keep a business afloat as it passes from one generation to the next. 
The existing estate tax policy creates economic inefficiencies and places its heaviest burdens on the middle class. The rates of estate taxes are excessive, unfair, punitive, and contrary to the interests of both business owners and their employees. Indeed, these taxes destroy the work of a lifetime and the dreams of a generation of Americans. The time to make genuine and sensible changes is now. 
Enactment of the Estate Tax Relief for the American Family Act of 1997 is an essential part of any plan to balance the budget by 2002. It would likely provide a net increase in revenues while at the same time restore tax fairness for millions of Americans. I am proud to be an original cosponsor of this legislation and will be a tireless advocate for its enactment into law.

Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, From 1950 to 1953, the United States was in the midst of a bitter war on the Korean peninsula. As the inscription at the base of the Korean War Memorial says, our Nation's sons and daughters answered the call `to defend a country they never knew and a people they never met.' And they did so honorably. Today, though, the memory of those who made the ultimate sacrifice is honored once again. 
Earlier today, the Korean War Veterans Memorial Honor Roll Kiosk was officially unveiled in a ceremony by representatives of the American Battle Monuments Commission, the National Parks Service, the Samsung Group, and IBM. The Honor Roll Kiosk houses a high technology interactive computer base which contains all the verifiable names from the Korean war theater of those killed in action, still listed as missing in action, and those captured as prisoners of war. Touch screens allow visitors, friends, and family to research the service record of their loved one, and obtain a certificate of honor in the name of that soldier. This was made possible in large part through the generous donation from the Samsung group of companies. 
As part of the July 1995 Korean War Veterans Memorial dedication ceremonies, Samsung made a significant contribution to the memorial fund. It was with great honor and appreciation that Samsung recognized the sacrifice and commitment of the United States to the security of the Korean peninsula. It is a commitment America maintains today. We have worked together to establish close relations in defense of common principles and it is because of these shared beliefs that the United States and South Korea remain partners in peace today. 
In addition to contributing to the memorial, Samsung also created an educational endowment with the American Legion. Their gift of $5 million to the American Legion will be used to fund collegiate scholarships for the descendants of America's veterans. I commend and congratulate Samsung on their generosity and willingness to recognize the origin in which their success today is rooted. I am proud to have their North American headquarters located in Ridgefield Park, NJ. Lastly, I recognize the honor and dignity with which America's service men and women fought on the harsh Korean field of combat. As the dedication ceremonies remind us, your service--and your sacrifice--was not forgotten.

Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I do not know whether in the coming weeks the Attorney General will determine whether or not the threshold has been reached to name independent counsel. But I do know, in her tenure of service, Attorney General Reno has had an uncompromising sense of personal integrity. She was called upon in a number of instances to reach a determination about investigating high officials in this administration, including President Clinton. She has never hesitated to act in the interests of justice. So, while I do not personally believe at the moment that the circumstances exist for independent counsel as defined by the law, it is important, again, to reassure ourselves about the quality of justice in this country under the leadership of the Attorney General and, just as important, in the great traditions of the Federal Bureau of Investigation under the able leadership of the Bureau's Director, Louis Freeh. 
Though I recognize that today some disagree and in their own judgment believe that it would be better in the national interest to proceed to an independent counsel, whether you accept their evaluation on this day or perhaps mine in believing it should be left to another day, there is the question about whether or not the act is able to be properly implemented at this moment as intended in the independent counsel statute. It is my judgment that, while we may differ in this institution on whether or not the act should be applied, we should be able to agree on the underlying problem, and that is there is a problem in the court with the ability to appoint a special counsel. 
The statute requires that the Chief Justice appoint judges to serve in the special division for a term of 2 years. Three judges are to serve on the council that will, in turn, name a special counsel in this or any other instance. It was the intention of the Congress to facilitate a rotation of these judges to ensure their independence so that no one dominates the appointing process, for purposes of the confidence of this Congress and the interests of justice. For whatever reasons, what were to be temporary assignments on the court in this special division appear to be becoming lifetime appointments. Judge Sentelle, who chairs the court, is in his third consecutive term. Judge Butzner is in his fourth. Judge Fay has now begun his second term. 
Mr. President, this is not what was intended in the independent counsel statute, and as we debate today the relative merits of whether to appoint an independent counsel, every Member of the Senate needs to consider, if the Attorney General is requested to make this appointment, who will be making the appointment and what confidence do we have the congressional intent of independence and the integrity of the judgments will meet the necessary standards of justice? 
Most particularly is the question of Judge Sentelle. Judge Sentelle's position in leading this three-judge panel raises serious questions and, indeed, I believe inhibits the ability of the Attorney General to proceed with confidence when and if she reaches a determination the statutory requirements to name an independent counsel are reached. 
During the 1993 debate over reauthorization of the independent counsel statute, Senator Cohen perhaps said it best. He said: 
The appearance of justice is just as important as justice itself, in terms of maintaining public confidence in our judicial system. 
Mr. President, no one could possibly believe that the appearance of justice is served by having Judge Sentelle in these circumstances name an independent counsel. Judge Sentelle is a known political associate of two Republican Senators who have views on this issue. He has served as a member of Senator Helms' National Congressional Republican Club and was chairman of the North Carolina State Republican Party convention. He stands accused of engineering the removal of Whitewater counsel, Robert Fiske, and replacing him with an independent counsel who clearly has exercised his position with questionable judgment and clear partisanship. I speak, of course, of Kenneth Starr. 
The decision to appoint Mr. Starr came only days after Judge Sentelle had a private luncheon with two Members of this institution who had strong views on the subject, in what was an extrajudicial and clearly inappropriate meeting. 
Mr. President, despite poor judgment, inappropriate actions, Judge Sentelle was recently reappointed to his third term on the court. As senior judge in this position, with the other two judges serving in this similar capacity, both on senior status, he clearly has an extraordinary influence over the operation of the appointing process. 
Five former presidents of the American Bar Association considered these facts, these extrajudicial communications, and determined they give rise to appearance of impropriety. 
As long as Judge Sentelle sits on the special division, there will always be questions regarding the objectivity of the independent counsel appointments. I believe, therefore, whether you share my judgment that the trust should be placed in the Attorney General to determine whether or not the requisite requirements have been reached in the statute before appointing or requesting the appointment of an independent counsel or you agree with other Members of the Senate that those criteria have already been reached, we certainly, in the interest of fairness, can reach a judgment today that Judge Sentelle should recuse himself from his current responsibilities. Failing that recusal, it is certainly incumbent upon Chief Justice Rehnquist, given his general responsibility for the administration of the courts, to remove Judge Sentelle or request that he temporarily remove himself from the appointment process. 
I recognize the strong divisions in the Senate. I understand the passions that this issue brings to different Members of the Congress. But certainly despite our partisan differences or our interpretations of the facts, our common interest in justice should lead us to one determination. There is a need in our country and in this Senate to come away from this debate with a feeling that an impartial and a fair administrator of justice is required to implement the independent counsel statute, whether that determination in naming an independent counsel is to be reached now or whether the facts dictate that they are to be named later. 
Mr. President, it is a simple question of fairness and justice. I hope other Members of the Senate will join with me in calling upon Judge Sentelle, in the best traditions of the American judiciary, to recuse himself now, but I also hope, before any other Members of this Senate need to rise and express themselves on these facts, the Chief Justice of the United States will exercise his responsibilities to ensure that the courts are true to their traditions of justice. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today to commemorate an important event which took place on January 30 of this year. This day marked the 25th anniversary of Bloody Sunday which left 14 civil rights marchers dead in Northern Ireland. 
During the late 1960's, peaceful opposition to disenfranchisement, internment and anti-Catholic discrimination in Northern Ireland led to large protest marches throughout the region. On January 30, 1972, one of these peaceful protest marches was indiscriminately fired upon by a British regiment. Fourteen demonstrators were killed during the violence. 
The investigation conducted by Lord Widgery, and the subsequent Widgery Report, were conclusive. All of the victims were unarmed, and most were shot in the back, leaving the world to conclude that the killings were reckless. However, not a single British soldier was ever prosecuted for this crime. 
The victims sought only to establish the rights of equal citizens, but paid the ultimate price for challenging British authority. However, the perpetrators go unpunished, and the British Government continue to ignore the seriousness of the crime committed 25 years ago. 
I urge the British Government to recognize the innocence of the demonstrators who were killed or injured on Bloody Sunday, and work toward establishing justice for them and their families. The struggle for justice continues today in Northern Ireland, and the British should work to repair the rift in Protestant-Catholic relations.

Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, the decision by the administration to certify Mexico as an ally in the fight against narcotics raises a broader issue. In my judgment, it is time to reach several difficult but obvious conclusions about United States policy toward Mexico and our bilateral relations. Indeed, perhaps, if there was a contribution offered by the unfortunate decision to certify Mexico in the war against narcotraffickers, it is the growing sense in the United States of the need for a moment of honest reflection about Mexican-American relations. In short, it is time to simply tell the truth about Mexico. 
Mexican-American policy in these years has been based, in my judgment, on three broad deceptions, deceptions not only of ourselves but, perhaps more importantly, of the Mexican people themselves. Deceptions which I recognize have been made, sometimes, with the best of intentions. The United States has understood that some historic injustices create particular sensitivities in Mexico. There is always the need to account for nationalist pride and the obvious concern of internal interference. But not telling the truth to our own people, or to the people of Mexico, allows the Mexican people to avoid dealing with the realities of their own country. This conspiracy of silence about the realities in Mexico prevents the United States from constructing real policies to defend our own interests, and hampers our ability to work with Mexico in protecting its own interests. 
These three deceptions are, in my judgment, convincing the American people that Mexico is, in fact, making the transition to a vibrant democracy; that Mexico has a genuinely free economy; and, finally, that Mexico is, indeed, participating in waging a war on narcotics. I believe that an analysis of these assumptions will establish that none of them are true. 
First is the question of the Mexican economy. In 1993, in an effort to support the North American Free-Trade Agreement, the American people were told that if only Mexico had access to the American market, then Mexico would complete its historic transition to a free and open economy. I understood the reasons to support NAFTA. A free-trade agreement for North America makes sense. But a condition precedent of a North American Free-Trade Agreement is that each of the participants genuinely has a free and an open economy. Therefore, this Congress could not have affirmatively accepted the treaty without being convinced that Mexico, like Canada and the United States, would accept the rules of a market economy. 
The simple reality is that in 1997, despite assurances to the contrary, Mexico retains strong elements of a centrally directed economy, officially controlled and unofficially corrupt. The most important elements of the Mexican economy are either under state sponsorship or government control, including banking, finance, and petroleum. The result has been, predictably, anemic growth which stimulates increased migration and denys the Mexican people real economic opportunity. 
Last year, 1.2 million young Mexicans attempted to join the national work force, only to find employment available for a fraction of those seeking work. Since the 1980's, irregular or low levels of growth in the economy have been the exception in the region. Throughout that decade, annual growth in Mexico, the GNP, averaged 1 percent. In some years in the 1990's it grew, but the results were uneven for the people themselves. 
The reasons are clear. It is not enough for the national leadership to declare Mexico a free economy. Making pledges to the United States in order to get access to NAFTA accomplishes nothing if the fundamentals of a free economy are not established. Most obvious is the need to allow the development of a free trade union movement. But, indeed, Mexico will conclude the 20th century as one of the last nations in our hemisphere to still not permit the development of independent trade unions. 
The results are declining real wages of a magnitude of 70 percent in the last 20 years, a minimum wage which decreased by 13 percent in 1995 and fell by an additional 11 percent in 1996. 
A free economy means a free market for labor. Real competition requires that people can engage in collective bargaining. Similarly frustrating to the development of a free economy in Mexico has been the failure to privatize important sectors of the economy. In September of 1995, the Mexican Government announced the sale of 61 petrochemical plants that would be open to the free economy and to foreign investment. It was an attractive response to the promise of NAFTA. On October 13, 1996, the Mexican Government reversed its policy and has maintained Government control over this vital center of the Mexican economy. 
As a result of this failure to permit the free exchange of labor, foreign investment, and privatization, Mexico is one of the few countries in the world where, because of declining wages, life expectancy has leveled off and may actually be declining. 
The Mexican peso, because of a failure to adequately control both debts and the currency, literally collapsed in 1994, requiring $40 billion of external financing from the United States and other international institutions. And in 1997, the international community faces the same prospect, because the peso is, again, overvalued and, again, facing downward pressure. 
The first simple truth, therefore, is we need to be honest with ourselves, investors, and the Mexican people. The promise of establishing a free market in Mexico, the ending of state-sponsored industries, has not been kept. Words do not suffice. The promises mean nothing. Mexico remains a state-controlled and directed economy where market forces are not allowed to operate. And for whatever price that may hold for American investors, or Mexico's new trade partners in NAFTA, the price is principally borne by the Mexican people themselves, who, despite their labors and their sacrifices and their desire to free their economy, are on a downward spiral of opportunity and living standards. 
The second truth concerns the promise of democracy in Mexico. For 7 decades, the Mexican people have been victimized by a one-party authoritarian state. It is self-perpetuating and it is not a democracy under any contemporary definition. Successive Mexican administrations choose the next government. Power has been maintained through corruption and outright electoral theft. As recently as 1988, Mexico's ruling PRI party had to resort to outright fraud to guarantee the election of President Carlos Salinas. In 1994, the leading presidential candidate was assassinated, with credible allegations that elements of his own party conspired in the assassination because of his opposition to electoral reforms that might have fulfilled elements of the promise of democracy. 
The level of corruption and denial of democratic freedoms has not involved simply the presidency, but almost every level of government. This includes disputed state elections throughout the 1980's and during this decade. In at least four recent gubernatorial elections the opposition PAN party ultimately took control or demonstrated a strong presence because of court challenges and public opposition. 
In 1996, despite promises of electoral reform, the PRI majority in the Mexican Congress placed restrictions on electoral procedures and public financing that greatly restricted the ability of opposition parties to participate in, and have a chance of succeeding in, Mexican elections. 
Promises of electoral reform in Mexico have simply not been realized. Access to the media, public finance, and control of government institutions to the advantage of the ruling party have all gone without change. Despite public protests and international challenges which have resulted in some successes in state gubernatorial elections, the simple truth is the 20th century will end without Mexico having experienced the peaceful transfer of power from the ruling party to the opposition. That, Mr. President, is a contradiction of any claim that Mexico is operating 
under contemporary standards of democratic elections. 
Mexico has not been alone in having difficulty making the transition from one-party government to a competitive pluralist system. What makes Mexico different is that, unlike in Japan or Italy which had similar monopolies on power in the postwar period, but whose governments bore American encouragement and sometimes criticism, there has been a conspiracy of silence about the realities of Mexican politics and its economy. 
Those who remain silent or fail to inform our people or the Mexican people of the truth of their national experience bear responsibility. 
There are, indeed, many victims of the realities of Mexican politics. The failure to democratize has caused just as much suffering as the loss of economic opportunity. Suffering which forces thousands of Mexicans to migrate or live with the downward spiral of the Mexican economy. 
In 1996, Amnesty International's annual report accused Mexican security forces of outright human rights abuses including the murder and torture of leftist rebels. They also uncovered the use of torture, and the many disappearances which have occurred throughout the areas of conflict. 
The Mexican media are no less a target. Journalists have been intimidated, abducted, and even killed, with cases as late as 1995 still unresolved. 
Public financing of the media, the corruption of journalists, and the monopoly of government power still distorts the view of the Mexican people about their own country and its problems, with predictable results. The Mexican people are unable to express themselves equally through the media, and are unable to gain control of their own lives through the electoral system. They face a declining standard of living because of the monopoly of government power in the economy, and are tragically, but predictably, now involved in guerrilla operations in fully eight of Mexico's states. 
Third and finally, Mr. President, is the truth about narcotrafficking in Mexico. Not only is it true that the Mexican people are paying an extraordinary price for the failure to develop a genuine market economy, and democratic institutions, but they, together with the American people, are paying an enormous price for the failure to control or even cooperate in controlling illegal drugs. 
The administration has been asked a simple question: Is, or is not Mexico an ally in the fight against narcotrafficking? The administration has answered by explaining that we have to consider the past difficulties in Mexican-American history. They have responded that Mexico is an increasing source of American investment. Those, Mr. President, were not the questions. 
The question is this: Is, or is not Mexico cooperating? The simple truth is that the highest levels of the Mexican Government have been corrupted and are, at a minimum, working at cross-purposes with the U.S. Government in controlling the flow of narcotics. 
Indeed, the administration's own reports conclude that fully two-thirds of all of the cocaine entering the United States is being transshipped through Mexico. The State Department has concluded that Mexico is now the most important location in the Western Hemisphere for the laundering of narcotics funds. 
On March 1, we learned that General Gutierrez, the drug czar of Mexico, was himself arrested for complicity and conspiracy with drug traffickers. 
Mr. President, the decision to certify Mexico as an ally in the war against narcotics was a decision to protect the Mexican Government from criticism. It was the wrong decision. The simple truth is that every day, in every way, Mexican officials are permitting the transshipment of narcotics to our country. New laws to stop the laundering of funds in Mexican banks have not been enforced. Not a single Mexican bank has had to alter its operations to comply with new legislation. 
Of the 1,250 police officers dismissed for corruption because of narcotics in Mexico, not a single officer has been prosecuted. 
Despite 52 outstanding extradition requests to send corrupt officials to the United States, not one has been complied with. Indeed, not a single Mexican national has been extradited to the United States because of drug-related charges. 
Most discouraging of all, the head of the DEA, Thomas Constantine, concluded before this Congress:  
There is not one single law enforcement institution in Mexico with whom the DEA has an entirely trusting relationship. 
Mr. President, there were times during the cold war, indeed times during moments of national peril when the United States needed to compromise an honest look at the world because of issues of national security. The end of the cold war has ended that time. 
We need to honestly assess our relationship with Mexico. We need to tell the American people the truth about the state of Mexican democracy, its economy, and its fight against narco-trafficking. Change will never come without the truth. Ending the certification process will begin that national debate in this Chamber. 
I urge the Senate to reject the administration's conclusion, which cannot be borne out by the facts. Let us tell the truth about Mexico. 
Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.

Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I have the honor of serving on both the Rules Committee, under the able leadership of the Senator from Virginia, and the honor and distinction of serving on Governmental Affairs Committee, under the leadership of Senator Thompson. 
I witnessed, a month ago, a rare moment of bipartisanship. Democrats and Republicans came together in the Governmental Affairs Committee. We were apart from the glare of the television lights or the pressure of partisan leadership, and we reached what I think was a sound and a good judgment. Senator Thompson offered honest leadership, and he came to us with a proposed scope of investigation. Senator Glenn responded by not only accepting his scope of an investigation, but he expanded it. For several weeks, while we differed on the timing and the expense, we operated in a general belief that we had defined the parameters of a review of the 1996 Federal elections in the United States. That scope offered us a chance to not only look at specific misdeeds, but to inform this institution and to educate the American people generally about the need for general campaign finance reform and how individual parts of the system were now broken. 
Our concern was that we learn, not only about the 1996 Presidential campaign, but that campaign be put in perspective in how previous Presidential campaigns operated so we could learn if there was a change, and if there was a change why it happened--both to find those who may have committed wrongful acts, but also how to improve the future process. 
We also reflected, I think, the reality that Presidential campaigns do not take place in a vacuum. Indeed, there is no distinguishing line between where a Presidential campaign's financing operations stop and the congressional campaigns begin. The money, the advertising, the activities, are coordinated and intertwined. So our scope included both the Presidential campaigns and congressional campaign committees and those of individual Members. Our scope also reflected two other specific areas that probably represent the greatest change in electoral politics in the United States in 1996, the use of nonprofit organizations, often as surrogates for partisan political activity, and the use of independent expenditures, where soft money is used to influence Federal campaigns. 
This scope was broad, it was comprehensive, it is what this institution and the country requires. And only a month after reaching this agreement, before the first hearing is held, the first witness notified, the first lesson learned, it is being put to a premature death. There is enough cynicism in America about our electoral system. The system has already convinced enough Americans that it does not operate and it does not reflect their needs or provide room for their concerns. We risk, today, adding one more pile of dirt on this mountain of doubt. The resolution that now comes before the Senate is an extraordinary departure from the bipartisan scope that Senator Glenn and Senator Thompson reached previously. It has become, in my judgment, a proxy fight in the larger battle for campaign finance reform, a cynical effort that the Nation, and the Senate as an institution, can be focused on a few narrow problems so the underlying deterioration of the Nation's system of campaign finance laws will not be noticed or exposed, the pressure building in the Nation to change the laws generally will be avoided. 
So, in place of this bipartisan scope for what hopefully could have been meaningful hearings, the Senate, instead, is given a new scope of activities for the Governmental Affairs Committee. It differs in several important ways, but none more significant than that it identifies the scope of these hearings not as the Presidential campaign of the last two cycles generally, the operations of congressional campaign finance or nonprofits or independent expenditures--the new standard is illegal activities. 
If illegal activities are to operate as the scope of the Governmental Affairs hearings, we are then establishing a committee with sufficient money, enough time, but no purpose. Illegal activities in our system would have to be defined by the standards as a people we have come to recognize would constitute an illegal act. Illegal acts in our country are defined by a system of justice. They require a burden of proof and a requisite state of mind. Indeed, in our system of justice, we have the highest levels of establishing illegal activity, perhaps, of any nation on Earth. 
During the hearings in the Rules Committee last week, I asked Senator Thompson whether illegal activities in his mind were synonymous with a criminal act. Indeed, we were assured that this was the purpose and illegal activity was, by definition, it appeared, a criminal act. The Senate needs to consider this definition before it accepts this scope, because a violation of the campaign finance laws by the President of the United States, or Senator Dole, or any Member of the House or Senate is not a criminal act unless there was a willful intent. Indeed, virtually none of the allegations raised in the popular press regarding the financing of congressional and Presidential campaigns would appear willful or potentially to meet the standard required to even be the subject of these hearings. 
In the other body there were serious questions raised about the operation of tax-exempt foundations; whether or not the tax laws had been violated in order to engage in influencing political activity. 
The operations of a tax-exempt foundation are not a criminal act unless there was a willful intent, which appears to be missing in the allegations made to date with regard to tax-exempt organizations. 
Finally, there is the question of the operation of independent expenditures generally. The most significant change in the political culture in the United States in 1996 has been the operation of independent expenditures by philosophical or issue-oriented or partisan organizations to use soft money to enter the system. And yet, both that soft money and the operation of these independent expenditures would not rightfully be within the jurisdiction of this committee if we maintain the standard of illegal or criminal act. 
The Senate, therefore, Mr. President, is left with a broad question of policy as we approach these hearings. If it is our intention to find specific criminal activity in the 1996 Federal campaign system, then I believe Members can rest assured that the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Justice Department will find those acts and people will be brought to justice. 
But Democrats and Republicans in the Governmental Affairs Committee began these discussions and the planning of this investigation with a different purpose. It was our goal to assure the American people that we would find not only those acts that were illegal but those that were improper. We would disclose to the American people those activities which do not belong in our system of electoral politics, expose them to the light of day in the hope that the net result would be a change of the law and a rising standard for operating political campaigns in the United States, while reassuring the American public of the integrity of the system. 
That, Mr. President, is the question before the Senate: a narrow hearing, cynically designed to focus attention on one campaign of the President of the United States, or an honest conversation about the state of electoral politics in the United States today and what we can do to change it and be part of a rising standard. The vote on this resolution, on the amendments that follow, is a vote on that question. 
Mr. President, there is, finally, the additional issue of the date for concluding the committee's work that needs to be part of this discussion and fully explained. While Democrats and Republicans in the Governmental Affairs Committee had generally agreed to a scope, there was always disagreement about a concluding date. I believe that Senator Thompson came to the Senate with the best of intentions and good purpose in his belief that there should be no concluding date for the fear that witnesses would withhold information if they knew they could wait until the committee concluded its work. But there is another competing purpose, I believe, that requires the Senate to establish a concluding date, which I now believe both Democrats and Republicans accept. 
These hearings are about educating the American people and ourselves about our system of campaign finance. These hearings are about finding specific misdeeds or illegalities, but they are also about something much more practical and immediate. 
Within a year, the United States will begin a system of a general Federal election. With all that we now know about the breakdown of the campaign finance laws in the United States in 1996, it is inexcusable and inexplicable if the U.S. Senate were to allow this country to proceed to another general election in 1998 without a change in how this Nation governs its laws, governs these campaigns and finances this electoral system. It is imperative that the Senate retain a concluding date for these hearings so that the U.S. Congress and the American people have the benefit of everything that is learned to proceed to reform. 
It is also, I believe, Mr. President, necessary to note that while specific changes in the law may follow the conclusions of these hearings, it is generally not necessary to wait for these hearings to conclude or, indeed, even to begin to proceed generally with campaign finance reform. 
The hearings by the Governmental Affairs Committee may teach us a great deal about specific misdeeds or problems in the system, but every Member of this Senate already knows enough about the breakdown of the campaign finance laws in this country to proceed immediately for a review and a change in comprehensive campaign finance reform. 
And so, Mr. President, I conclude with the hope that partisanship for a moment could be set aside for a review of the 1996 elections and our campaign finance system; that this country, through the voices of this Senate, could have an honest conversation about the health of our democracy and the operations of our democratic elections. That will require a standard far different than illegal activities. It will have to be far more general in focus than the Presidential campaign of 1996. It will require a conclusion at a date certain so that we can proceed to changes in the law, and it will require that, through the exercise of honest leadership, we begin the process of campaign finance reform, even as we learn new and troubling problems about the operation of the system. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. TORRICELLI. I want to thank the Senator from Michigan for raising this issue because it appears to me we have come to the heart of the matter. 
The Senate has given conflicting interpretations that make all the difference in the scope of these hearings potentially. Senator Warner's views, as the author of the legislation, should be 
controlling. But it is important to note that they are in direct contradiction with testimony given to the Rules Committee by Senator Thompson. 
Senator Thompson's interpretation of `illegal' is that they had to constitute a criminal act. I am very reassured by Chairman Warner's interpretation that `illegal act' would include a violation of a civil code. I assume, therefore, that the Senate could conclude that a violation of the campaign finance laws, even if it did not include a criminal penalty, is included in Senator Warner's definition. 
I am also seeking his reassurance, through the Senator from Michigan, that a violation of the Tax Code, though perhaps not sufficiently willful to involve a criminal penalty, would be an illegal act and, therefore, part of the investigation. 
Indeed, I am hoping that we can be reassured that any violation of the regulations of the U.S. Government or any of its departments or agencies, any violation of the civil or criminal law, of which there is specific information that is sufficiently credible to warrant the attention of the committee, would be the subject of these investigations--meaning, that it does not require that a member of the committee have definitive proof to establish a criminal level of culpability and it does not have to relate specifically to a criminal penalty for violation. 
I was hoping to receive his assurance, as a member of both the Rules Committee and the Governmental Affairs Committee, that if I come before this committee with a specific act, based on a broad but credible allegation, for violation of code or regulation, that will be sufficient for the scope of this investigation. 
Through the Senator from Michigan, that is the assurance that I am seeking.

Mr. TORRICELLI. The discussion comes down to the phrase of Senator Thompson, saying that criminal and illegal may not in every situation be exactly the same. 
For purposes of these hearings, if we were to do justice to what we want to achieve, it needs to be established that they specifically are not the same. It is not sufficient for the Senate to know that there may be some circumstances where illegal does not mean criminal. The point is illegal is not criminal. We seek civil jurisdiction, we seek violations of regulations, and we seek here on the floor to disassociate the two words. 
I believe, for the record, the Senator from Virginia has done a great deal in allaying my fears, and I think we have separated permanently, irrevocably the two words. For purposes of this investigation they are unrelated, they are unconnected and never the two shall meet again. 
I think, therefore, this discussion has been helpful.

Mr. TORRICELLI. I thank the Chair. 
I thank the Senator from Vermont for yielding. 
Mr. President, several days ago, in an unfortunate and I believe in an intemperate moment that does not characterize the distinguished majority leader, he made some regrettable comments with regard to Members of this institution who as a matter of conscience have decided they either needed to change or oppose the resolution offered by the Senator from Utah. 
I will not respond in kind to Senator Lott's comments, but I do find it necessary today to rise to address once again the question of the balanced budget amendment. The issue was raised whether those of us who have supported a balanced budget amendment were keeping faith with our commitments to our constituents by opposing this resolution today. 
I would remind Senator Lott that not only have I supported a balanced budget amendment but last week I voted for a balanced budget amendment. It is simply not the version he preferred. 
I rise also, Mr. President, because I do believe as well there is a burden that has not been met in this institution to those of us who support a balanced budget amendment. And that is the concern raised by the Treasury Department. The amendment as currently drafted would forever preclude the development of a capital budget by the U.S. Government. We have asked the majority to address how in voting for a balanced budget amendment this concern could be accommodated. We have been met by silence. We have asked to have addressed the concerns of the CRS and the Treasury Department of how we could ensure the integrity and the continuance of our obligations to those on Social Security, and it has been met by silence. 
But most interestingly, last week during his otherwise unfortunate comments, we were assured by the majority leader that efforts were now being taken to reach an accommodation on Senator Feinstein's concerns about the development of a capital budget, Senator Johnson's concerns about the protection of Social Security, and my concerns with each, including the ability of the United States to defend itself militarily and to deal with serious economic recessions. Each of us waited since Mr. Lott's comments of last Friday for this attempt at reconciliation. I was certain, based on Senator Lott's comments repeated again in the news on Sunday, that there was a decision to seek some accommodation that would allow all of us who believe in a balanced budget amendment to vote affirmatively today. 
I regret to inform my colleagues that I have received no such communication. I know of no other Member of the Senate who has received such communication. I assume, therefore, that either Senator Lott misspoke or, somehow, there was something disingenuous about his offer. Because my concerns remain. I have voted for a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution last week. I would vote for this, but, like Senator Johnson, like Senator Feinstein, I have real and lasting concerns. 
I want to know that if there is military aggression against the United States, we are able to respond with other than a declaration of war. I offered an amendment to accommodate those security interests. It was defeated. I remain interested, and I believed I was going to receive from Senator Lott some communication to accommodate it. 
I remain concerned that, in a serious economic recession or depression, the U.S. Government is able to respond, to provide for economic needs. I believed, in Senator Lott's communication, he was interested in accommodating that concern. It has not happened. 
And I remain concerned, like other Members of the Senate, how we can ensure the integrity of Social Security and maintain that commitment to our constituents, and how, indeed, we could provide in the future for at least the possibility of a capital budget. 
Mr. President, now, only hours before the vote, I am left with this question. It seems to be relatively simple to reach some accommodation, to engage in some compromise, to reach the concerns of at least one Senator on at least one of these issues. The question, therefore, before the body is this: Did Senator Lott really ever seek to win this fight, or is this an attempt to amend the Constitution that was never really designed to succeed? We have waited these several days to hear what compromises or new communications the majority leader wanted to share with Members of the Senate. Since none have been received, I assume none were ever intended. 
I have said previously that I believe the Senator from Utah has a good amendment. I also concluded that good was not good enough in dealing with an amendment to the Constitution of the United States. The Senate can do better. National security, severe economic recessions, and the integrity of Social Security are real and lasting concerns. 
My commitment to my constituents is to use my best judgment. My best judgment is that there should and can be an amendment to the Constitution of the United States to provide for a balanced budget. But we accomplish nothing, indeed, do a disservice to the United States, if we cannot accommodate the real possibility of dealing with military and economic emergencies, and the genuine concern of our constituents in dealing with the problems, potentially, of interrupting Social Security checks. 
Therefore, Mr. President, with regret, I rise to inform my colleagues that what I supposed was an effort at accommodation was never tried and, therefore, inevitably failed. 
I thank the Senator from Vermont for yielding time.

Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, before this day is ended, the administration must decide whether or not to certify Mexico as an ally in the war against illegal drugs. 
Having served in the House of Representatives as chairman of the Western Hemisphere Committee for some years, and representing the State of New Jersey, which, among other centers of urban and suburban life in our country, has been plagued by narcotics, I feel a need and a responsibility to address the administration on this issue before it makes its final judgment because I believe, based on the actions of the Government of Mexico in the last year, the choice, though difficult, is very clear. The simple fact is that no country anywhere on the globe now poses a more immediate threat to our actions in curtailing the spread of narcotics than Mexico. Indeed, the administrator of the DEA has said, and I quote, `Mexicans are now the single most powerful drug trafficking operation in the world.' 
The State Department's 1996 World Narcotics Control Strategy Report outlines the threat that Mexico now represents. It cites Mexico as the principal transit route for cocaine entering the United States and a major source for heroin and marijuana. Indeed, Mr. President, it has been suggested that with the success of American operations in the Caribbean and the Bahamas, fully two-thirds of cocaine now entering the United States is being routed through Mexico. As we have succeeded in the Caribbean and the Bahamas pound for pound, dollar for dollar, Mexico has been available to compensate the drug cartels. The State Department's 1996 report further concludes, `Mexico is the most important money 
laundering center in the Western Hemisphere.' 
There is no escaping the fact that Mexican cartels now are bribing whomever can be bribed and killing those who resist. In recent months, eight Mexican prosecutors and law enforcement personnel have been murdered in Tijuana, all this since certifying last year that Mexico was assisting United States Government operations. In the last year, Mexico has failed to capture or extradite a single high-ranking member of any drug cartel. There are now 52 outstanding United States extradition requests for drug dealers, and Mexico has not complied with a single one of those extradition requests. Indeed, Mr. President, there is no record of any Mexican national ever being extradited to the United States on a narcotics charge. 
There has been considerable hope since certification last year that the use of the Mexican Armed Forces would represent a change. If, indeed, the narcotics strategy of Mexico included not simply law enforcement personnel who might have been compromised but Mexico represented and recognized that this was a matter of their own national security and involved their armed forces, that there might be a change. But the record is now clear. There has not been a change. The announcement of only last week that General Gutierrez, a 42-year veteran of the armed forces, had accepted bribes from the Carrillo Fuentes cartel makes clear that the entry of the Mexican Armed Forces is not only insufficient but inadequate and, indeed, potentially counterproductive. 
Changes in Mexican law lead us to the same conclusion. Last year the Mexican Parliament passed criminal money laundering laws, but they are both incomplete and completely not implemented. These laws at a minimum do not require banks to report large and suspicious currency transactions. Unfortunately, the Mexican Government, having not implemented its antinarcotics strategy, having now recognized that the entry of the armed forces is inadequate or counterproductive and taking no actions against laundering with the banks, it therefore, in my judgment, can be concluded that Mexico has not taken the certification process seriously. Previous certifications have brought no new cooperation, and now we must reach a different judgment. 
Indeed, Mr. President, in light of the evidence of the corruption of law enforcement personnel, new evidence of corruption of the armed forces, the failure to comply with American requests for extradition, the failure to enforce their own laws on money laundering, the United States Government should be answering the following question: What else would Mexico have to do to be denied certification? Having failed on almost any level of analysis, what else could they do? Here is what we see. 
The United States today will also readdress the question of whether or not Colombia should be recertified. It is an arguable question. In the last year, since we denied certification, the Colombian military genuinely seems to have at least undergone some change. They have mobilized 5,000 troops and through the use of joint military and law enforcement operations destroyed laboratories producing 1 1/2 tons of cocaine per day. 
They have issued 3,000 arrest warrants on drug charges and removed 450 million dollars' worth of cocaine from the production pipeline. 
The administration may or may not, on their own evidence, recertify Colombia. But the Colombian experience gives evidence that, while it is difficult to take action against a friendly government, people in Colombia or Mexico that we respect, it is successful. Our decertification of Colombia produced results. It is a question the administration must address before deciding on their actions about Mexico today. 
The President is faced with three possibilities in deciding whether to certify Mexico in the drug war. He can certify that Mexico is fully cooperating with the United States Government actions. That would be false on its face. There is no evidence to support a conclusion that Mexico is being cooperative. Indeed, it would make the entire certification process lose all credibility. No nation involved in narcotrafficking within its borders would ever feel any responsibility or pressure to cooperate with the U.S. Government activities if we were to so stretch our credibility by fully certifying Mexico. 
Second, the administration can decertify Mexico and bring a halt to all American foreign assistance except antidrug programs. 
Or, third, the administration can decertify Mexico but grant a national security waiver. The last of these options I would understand. People could legitimately argue the relative merits of decertification with a national security waiver, based on specific promises of the Mexican Government; to deny certification but, for 1 more year, to give one last chance for them to meet the responsibility to their own people, the international community, and their previous promises. But to certify, given that this other option is available, would be inexplicable to our own people, an insult to those engaged in this country in law enforcement, and contrary to the evidence. 
On occasion, in this country, we describe our efforts against narcotics as a war on drugs. But in dealing with foreign governments with whom we would like to have good relations, we seek to win a war without casualties. The sensitivities of the Mexican Government might be a casualty in this certification, but it is necessary if we are to be serious and produce real results. 
Finally, I hope the administration will reach the right judgment. The stakes are high. I urge the administration to take these comments and these facts into consideration in reaching its judgment. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I offer my amendment recognizing that the context of this debate is fundamentally different because of over 20 years of effort by the Senator from Utah, Mr. Hatch, and a Member in the House from Texas, Mr. Stenholm, who have worked diligently to bring before this institution of the Congress an amendment to require a balanced budget. 
While their efforts to date have not succeeded, the fact that we meet with a Federal deficit which has been reduced by over 60 percent in annual terms in the last 3 years is no small testament to their efforts. 
The national debate has been fundamentally changed. It is no longer a question of if there is going to be an operating balanced budget in the U.S. Government, but when and how it is going to be achieved. 
I take great pride in that, through the years, on three occasions I joined with them to do so, because, in my judgment, 15 years ago this country began a radical and even dangerous experimentation with changing the finances of the U.S. Government. There had been for some 200 years an unspoken compact among the generations--the Nation would borrow for its national defense or to provide for its domestic economy in times of danger or severe deprivation, but quickly return to an operating surplus and to pay those debts when the situation allowed. 
So from the War of 1812, and the Civil War, through the Second World War and the time of the Great Depression, succeeding giants of American history borrowed so much as was necessary to ensure the survival of the Republic, but almost immediately in each and every circumstance returned to an operating surplus and dealt with the principal of the debt in fairness to future generations and to assure the financial health of the U.S. Government. 
Our generation has the unfortunate distinction of being the first to break that compact. During the 1980's, the Federal deficit, from less than $1 trillion, grew to in excess of $4 trillion. Indeed, during the Reagan Presidency alone, the annual Federal debt grew at a rate in excess of 13 percent, 
reaching the extraordinary drain on the Federal Treasury for interest alone of 20 percent of all revenues. 
When the Clinton administration assumed office 4 years ago, President Clinton inherited an operating deficit of $290 billion. In 4 years we have experienced an extraordinary change, a 63-percent reduction in the annual debt of the U.S. Government as a result of the deficit reduction initiative of 1993. So at this point the United States has the lowest operating annual debt of any industrialized nation in the world with 1.4 percent. 
The question, therefore, is whether the United States has learned a valuable lesson from the excesses that began in 1981 and began to abate in 1993, or whether, indeed, this change of fortunes in the last 4 years is itself an aberration, and a permanent amendment to the Constitution is required. 
There have been few instances in the life of this Republic when any Congress has found it necessary to change the Constitution by which we govern ourselves. We recognize that the U.S. Constitution is a precious document in its balances, its allocation of powers. It is, I think, important to note, and no small achievement, that when the 20th century ends in but a few brief years there will be only two governments on this globe who will end the century with the same basic form of government, under the same Constitution, with the same allotment of powers with which they began the century. The United States of America is one. The certain genius of our Constitution, both how it was written and how it distributed powers, is certainly a reason. 
I rise, therefore, Mr. President, recognizing that any decision to amend the Constitution of the United States is extraordinarily serious and, indeed, sobering for every Member of the institution. I, therefore, believe if it is to be amended, it is to be done so carefully, and in every respect, ensuring that we understand the consequences. 
The amendment that I bring before the body today deals with three central elements of the resolution. First, whether or not the U.S. Government should continue to both have its current accounts and its capital budget reflected in a single accounting; second, how, indeed, under this amendment the Government will respond to times of economic recession; and third, how the U.S. Government would respond to threats to our national security under the provisions of the resolution. 
I begin, Mr. President, with a question of a capital budget. Throughout these last 20 years, much has been spoken about the mounting deficit of the U.S. Government. We have convinced the American people, I believe, of two conclusions that bear further scrutiny. First, that the principal and only debt of the United States that bears witness is the debt operational of the U.S. Government; and second, that the appropriate level of debt of the U.S. Government is zero. Neither conclusion, Mr. President, bears scrutiny. 
No institution which plans for its future, is properly taking advantage of its ability to borrow, has no operating deficit. Indeed, Mr. President, 43 States in this Union by calculation set the proper and appropriate level of deficit borrowing. The States do so through capital borrowing commissions. They evaluate the transportation, the infrastructure needs, the investment needs of their States and carefully calculate their ability to pay back those loans and what they will contribute to the economic performance of their 
States. 
Indeed, this has been so successful that for the last 50 years not only has no State defaulted, but, indeed, I know in no instance when there has been a serious issue of a Governor of either party or their respective legislatures engaging in inappropriate or excessive borrowing, or any borrowing, other than what was required for the economic future of their State. 
Unique in our society is the U.S. Government. Unlike all major businesses in each of these States, and all of our economic competitors, the U.S. Government has no capital budget. In our planning, we regard the construction of a road or a railroad or a school which may last for 20, 50, or 100 years the same way we regard the hiring of a new employee, the buying of a piece of paper, paying for the lights. The fact is that by any standard accounting--one is the exchange of financial resources for a lasting and productive resource, and the other is an immediate consumption--this has not been addressed and has never been changed. 
My fear, Mr. President, is that if we adopt the balanced budget amendment as now offered by the Senator from Utah without a capital budgeting provision, the thirsts of the U.S. Government for consumption will certainly begin to exclude what remains of long-term investments in this country. Because, indeed, over these years, we have seen a serious deterioration in the amount of investment by the United States. In 1960, 25 percent of the Federal budget was dedicated to long-term capital investments. The United States constructed a highway system that was the envy of the world. Our mass transit systems for railroads were still on the cutting edge. We built a university system that was without peer. By the time the 1960's concluded, no nation on Earth would want to be in a position to not be able to trade the American transportation or infrastructure or research base with their own. 
I doubt, Mr. President, few nations would make that trade today. The United States is now last in all developed nations in the world in our level of infrastructure investment in capital planning. Today, our Government invests only 7 percent of our revenues in capital expenditures, the Japanese having a rate of nearly 6 percent, as indicated on this graph, the Germans having a rate half again as great as our own. Our percentage of GDP dedicated to infrastructure investment is now barely 1.7 percent. 
The question, therefore, is if today we proceed to a balanced budget amendment without this exemption for capital expenditures, will this 1.7 percent rate of GDP, this 7 percent rate of all Government spending, deteriorate further? The irony, Mr. President, of this situation is the exact opposite of what has happened with American business. American business today operates a $4.5 trillion deficit. American businesses learned that deficit spending, if it involves productivity, new plant and equipment, and operating efficiency, is not only necessary, it is required for future economic growth. 
Mr. President, I attempt to bring that same lesson to the floor of this Senate. We are potentially putting a straitjacket financially on this Government and our ability to be competitive. 
In the United States today, there are a quarter of a million miles of roads that are substandard and in need of immediate repair. They will not serve us another century of efficient business performance. Twenty-five percent of all the bridges in America that are handling the cargo of our industry, servicing our towns, leading to the productivity of our businesses, are in need of immediate repair. The great ports of America, which once rivaled any in the world--and now, indeed, the port of New York, once the most efficient and busiest port in the world, now offloads cargo in the outer harbor because it is too shallow to take modern ships like Japan and Europe. We are disinvesting in America, transforming places in this country into the efficiency of Third World nations. This disinvestment in the American future cannot continue. 
The Senator from Utah, in previous discussions in the Judiciary Committee, makes a worthwhile point: Who is to ensure that worthwhile capital projects are not placed in the general operating budgets of the U.S. Government, or vice versa? Who is to draw the line? Well, Mr. President, in our corporations, in our homes, and indeed in our States, we have learned to draw that line. States have capital planning commissions. Every homeowner has learned the difference between a home mortgage and buying a new suit or paying for the evening meal. Indeed, every corporation in America has learned in the marketplace to distinguish. So can this Government, and so it must. 
Mr. President, I believe that, more perhaps than any other provision I offer in my amendment today, this call for capital planning in the U.S. Government will reflect how serious we are at long last about rearranging the spending powers of the U.S. Government and making them responsible again. And so the first of three provisions in my amendment to the balanced budget amendment is for dealing with capital spending. 
Mr. President, my second provision deals with the ability of the U.S. Government to respond to another set of contingencies, just as important as dealing with the long-term financial planning of this Government and its investments. I mentioned the question of dealing with national military emergencies. The Senator from Utah appropriately has placed in his balanced budget amendment a provision that, if the United States engages in a war, through a declaration of war, three-fifths of the Congress can waive the provision of a balanced budget. He is right to do so. But it is also inadequate. 
Mr. President, in the experiences of the 20th century, the most important military expenditures to defend this Union have not always been made solely after a declaration of war. Given the enormity of preparing for armed conflict, the complexity of technology and the time necessary to construct the implements of war, the most important expenditures have often been made in the months or years preceding armed conflict. Indeed, the principal battles of the Second World War, when the implements of war were considerably less costly or complex than those that we will meet in the 21st century, the principal investments for that conflict were made not only in the months, but in the years preceding the Second World War. 
President Roosevelt's decision to rebuild the U.S. Navy and double its size was made not after Pearl Harbor, but in the years before. The question, therefore, with this amendment, 
that we are to waive these provisions only after a declaration of war--what does that do to an American President and the American military that recognizes an imminent threat, can discern an almost certain conflict, and needs desperately to prepare the Union to defend itself? 
Indeed, Mr. President, in our own time, in the Persian Gulf war, on a far smaller scale, we recognized exactly these circumstances. It was 5 months from the time that Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait to the beginning of hostilities on the Kuwaiti-Iraqi border. In those 5 months, the U.S. Government was operating at a $220 billion deficit. President Bush consumed an additional $10 billion in deficit spending to prepare for the almost certain conflict with Iraqi Armed Forces. There was no declaration of war, but there was no mistaking what was going to happen. It was as certain as Franklin Delano Roosevelt saw an imminent conflict with Germany and Japan, and as certain as President Wilson knew there would be a conflict in Europe, and indeed as certain as in the opening weeks of his administration, President Lincoln knew the inevitability of a war between the States. Each began to plan for conflict. Each began to borrow. And when the conflict began, this country at least approached being prepared. 
And so, Mr. President, the second principal change that I offer to the balanced budget amendment--the first was to allow for a separate capital planning expenditure budget to deal with long-term economic investments. My second is to allow, by a joint resolution, the declaration of a national military emergency so that the country can properly plan. 
I do so in fairness to the Senator from Utah. I also want to mention that I do so without there being a declaration of war, but also changing to a majority vote, in recognition that I do not want any foreign adversary to ever miscalculate that because we are unable to reach a three-fifths vote, we will also be unable to defend the United States. 
It is worth noting that, at no point in the years preceding the Second World War, at no point preceding the First World War, and it was demonstrated at no point before the Persian Gulf war, did three-fifths of this institution stand for the proper preparations for war. Indeed, as a Democratic author of the Persian Gulf war measure in the House of Representatives, we never did get a three-fifths vote. With Germany having overrun half of Europe, these institutions of the Congress passed the Selective Service Act to prepare the United States for a war, which was almost certain, by a single vote. 
Therefore, not only do I provide for a joint resolution so the United States can prepare for imminent hostilities, but I do so by a majority vote. 
Third, Mr. President, I have an additional change which deals with an equally important matter of economic recession. There are those who come to the floor of the Senate and argue that deficit spending is necessary to maintain the economic performance of the United States, and they provide evidence that, indeed, the rapid growth of this economy in the latter half of the 20th century and the extraordinary standard of living that we have achieved is due in no small part to the ability of the United States to borrow. Others argue that that right has been abused. Indeed, we have drawn upon our credit to such an extent that we have placed a burden on the future which is unsustainable, and, with 20 percent of our tax dollars going not to build new roads, not to educate another generation, but to only pay interest on the debt, they are right. Indeed, Mr. President, both are right on the question of achieving a balance between the two. 
There has been in this latter half of the 20th century a notable and even extraordinary change in the business cycle of growth and recession. Indeed, between 1900 and 1950 there were 33 quarters of real negative economic growth. Through the experience of the Great Depression the U.S. Government learned, and then admittedly abused, the ability to adjust the business cycle through borrowing in times of recession to compensate for declining private investment and expenditures. The result is that in these last 47 years compared with the 33 quarters of negative economic growth in the first half of the century, we have experienced only four quarters of negative economic growth since 1950. 
The question then is, How do we achieve a balance? The Senator from Utah appropriately noted that the power to borrow has been abused with a mounting deficit which is unsustainable on its face versus losing this ability to deal with real economic downturns and provide adjustments. Indeed, Secretary Rubin in his testimony provided a warning that without some ability to stabilize we could `turn slowdowns into recessions and recessions into more severe recessions or even depressions.' 
The Treasury Department has estimated that during the 1992 recession, without the ability to engage in some deficit spending, the recession that lasted from 1990 to 1992 would have had in excess of 9 percent unemployment instead of 7.7 percent with an additional 1 million jobs being lost. 
Mr. President, I have attempted in my amendment in its final provision to strike a balance. That is where the institutions of the Congress could by joint resolution declare an economic emergency and allow it, only for so long as it believes that emergency exists, to engage in deficit spending to ensure that the public works programs and job creation ability of the Government is not lost. 
Mr. President, we will never know what would have happened in the Great Depression had there not been a Second World War or a New Deal and the massive deficit spending of that period to end the economic debt into which this country had gone. It was by any measure a real threat to American democracy. In the Second World War this country approached 60 percent of GDP in deficit spending. It is a debt burden which the Nation must bear. It also provided a foundation for a standard of living and an economic performance which in all of human history has 
never been equaled. 
My amendment seeks to use the creditworthiness powers of this Government to deal with those economic contingencies but making certain that they are used only in periods of economic emergency. 
In short, Mr. President, in each of these provisions I have attempted to do by constitutional amendment what common sense provided that we do through 200 years of American history. I do so with considerable regret. Succeeding generations in this country provided for capital spending because they cared about the future. The Constitution didn't require that they do it. They did it because it made sense for the American future. Succeeding generations borrowed to defend the Nation when it was threatened because they cared about the defense of the Republic, not because the Constitution required that they only borrow to provide for the national defense and not exceed that authority when the Nation was not threatened. Succeeding generations borrowed to deal with economic recessions and depressions because they cared about the economic future of the country and our people and did not abuse it. 
No Member of the Senate should take pride in the fact that in our generation it might be necessary to amend the United States Constitution to provide for these capital expenditures in dealing with military threats and economic emergencies, to assure that our country is responsible in dealing with that borrowing, and that the borrowing is done only to the extent and to the degree that it is appropriate. We should do so because we care about our people and the future of the Republic. Yet, like the Senator from Utah, I rise because there is the unmistakable fact that in our own time that power has been abused. 
Therefore, I rise with amendments to the resolution recognizing that amending the Constitution is unlike any other action taken by the Congress of the United States. We legislate not for our time; we write for all time. These are words that will govern contingencies that we cannot imagine, circumstances that we cannot foresee. If it is necessary to amend the Constitution of the United States, it is necessary to do so to the fullest extent possible with all the wisdom that we can muster. I believe the amendment of the Senator from Utah would be improved and enhanced by these changes. Indeed, I believe these changes are necessary to responsibly add to the work of our ancestors who wrote this great document and provided for the political stability of this Nation through these two centuries and allowed it to become the unique society and the extraordinary Nation that we have become. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. TORRICELLI. Thank you, Mr. President. While it is my hope to return the debate to the amendment at hand--it is my intention to yield to my colleague, the senior Senator from New Jersey--nevertheless, since our debate is in the Record, it should at least be accurate in this respect: I notice the Senator from Utah has the last 28 years of budgets of the U.S. Government. That means his books start in the fiscal year 1969. 
Debate between the Senator from West Virginia and the Senator from Utah seemed to be on the relative merits between the Reagan and the Johnson administrations and their responsibilities for the Federal deficit. It is extraordinary that the Senator from Utah stopped there before 1969, the last year of the Great Society, the last budget written by Lyndon Johnson and the last year the U.S. Government had a surplus. 
It is, I think, instructive, Mr. President, that as we assign responsibility, which is no doubt, at least as an aside, a useful exercise on this day, as someone who served in the House of Representatives during some of those years, I want the Record to clearly reflect one element of that responsibility. In 8 years of the Reagan administration, in all the appropriations bills passed, Mr. Reagan vetoed one. He vetoed one appropriations bill in 8 years, while the Federal deficit soared from less than $1 trillion to $4 trillion. And if you look at his veto message, it is because, in his judgment, spending was inadequate in that year. 
We will leave it for historians to gauge whether it was the Great Society that produced this deficit problem, in spite of the fact that he left office with a surplus, or it was the Reagan administration, which talked about fiscal austerity but left the Nation with a $4 trillion accumulated deficit and never exercised a veto of any appropriation. 
But perhaps the comments of my colleagues should be punctuated simply with this: The genuine level of debt that should be of concern to every American is the debt as a proportion of our national economy. Like in our households and our businesses, it is not whether you have a debt--the mortgage on your home, borrowing for expansion--it is your ability to pay it. Two Presidents in the last 40 years have administered the U.S. Government with a deficit under 2 percent of gross national product. One was named Johnson, and one is named Clinton. The others have exceeded that marker, which is now recognized by our friends in Asia and the European Community as the marker to which you do not want to pass. 
So while I hope we can return to the issue of the balanced budget amendment and look prospectively and leave to others, the historians, the question of relative responsibility, I did want, along with my colleague from West Virginia, to ensure the Record was accurate. 
At this time, I yield to the senior Senator from the State of New Jersey for 20 minutes.

Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I have listened patiently to the analysis of my amendment by Members of the minority and by Members of the majority for some time. I am also aware of the uniqueness of the moment. We are debating an amendment to the Constitution of the United States. The vote on that amendment is extraordinarily close. It is argued by my friend, the Senator from Utah, that the balanced budget amendment is as good as we can produce. Mr. President, the Constitution of the United States is as close to perfection as has ever been achieved in managing the affairs of men and women. This is one case when good is not good enough. There are those who say that providing for a capital budget and the ability to respond to international military emergencies or national economic crises are simply amending gimmicks of a balanced budget amendment. Mr. President, meeting our historic responsibility to defend the United States in military emergencies, or dealing with economic recessions, or depressions is not a gimmick. It is a profound responsibility. 
I have voted for a balanced budget amendment on other occasions, and I want to do so again. I approach it with extraordinary regret because I believe that our generation should be no less in managing the financial affairs of this country than all of those who preceded us. They did so because they cared about the future. They cared about the country, and they refused to abuse their ability and their power to borrow beyond their means. This generation has not so cared for the country. 
So it is with real regret on previous occasions that I have voted for a balanced budget amendment. But I rise today to amend this joint resolution to amend the Constitution of the United States because I seek for us to meet the same high standard as those who founded this Republic and those who have cared for it through the years; not an amendment that is good enough but one that approaches perfection. 
I have offered three principal changes. The first is for a capital budget. But I am told that it would be abused if we were to provide for a separate capital budget to ensure that we were building an infrastructure and maintaining a modern and productive means of commerce in the country, that it would be abused by regular spending and consumption. Yet, the Senator from Utah knows that, whether his amendment passes in its original form or with my amendment to it, enacting legislation will be required. His amendment is not operational on its face and neither is mine. This Congress would have to return after enactment by the States for enacting legislation to make it operational. And under the capital budgeting provisions we would clearly have to establish a separate and independent Government agency that would review the actions of the President and the Congress to ensure that anything in a capital budget is actually designed to enhance the productive capabilities of the country and its economy. We could not allow items of consumption to be part of a capital budget. That is the means by which every Governor operates in getting independent authority to ensure that it is a genuine bondable expenditure as I am sure my friend, the Senator from Wyoming, needed to operate as a mayor of his own community. 
But at the end of the day, Mr. President, I leave my colleagues with this reality because this isn't good enough. In our understandable and justifiable efforts to balance the budget of the United States, the principal victim is long-term investment in this country--2 million miles of substandard roads, a quarter of a million bridges that are not safe or operational, deteriorating ports, 100 billion dollars' worth of repairs needed in our schools. We are last among the industrialized nations of the world in planning for our future. Without a capital budget, the internal pressures of this institution are going to force protecting consumption and victimizing planning and investment. It is not enough to rise on in this floor and say that a capital budget might be abused but not provide an answer to this reality. 
Second, we are told that a war powers exemption, the ability to deficit spend if the United States is facing an imminent military threat, could not be accommodated despite the historic analogies that I have raised in World War II, the Persian Gulf, World War I, all of which required deficit spending in advance of a declaration of war. 
I am told by my friend, the Senator from Utah, that the cold war is evidence that my analogies are not sufficient because we could have used this as an excuse throughout the cold war for deficit spending unless we have agreement. In 1962, with a nation only hours away, during the worst of the cold war, during the Cuban military crisis, John Kennedy mobilized the American Armed Forces. The United States was in deficit. It was also facing an imminent threat of war. In the Berlin crisis, in succeeding crises of the cold war, the President of the United States and our military leadership needed the ability to respond immediately. The vision of the amendment of the Senator from Utah is that upon a declaration of war and a three-fifths vote we will then respond and defend the national interest. It is good. It is a good amendment. It does not approach the historic standards of the U.S. Constitution. 
Finally, we are told the country has the means and the ability to respond to the vagaries of the business cycle without the need or the ability to borrow. 
History teaches us a different result. This Nation has learned a painful lesson from a historic perspective when capitalism fails or goes through intense difficulties. The debate in Europe and in the United States in the 1930's was often between those who believed that the future belonged to fascism and those who believed it belonged to communism, democratic communism or fascism. Democratic capitalism, to many, was an anachronism that had failed in the depths of the Depression. Capitalism was saved by the easing of the business cycle. We learned how in times of high unemployment and deep recession to prevent the national economy from victimizing our own people. The triumph of capitalism, as certainly as it was earned on the battlefields and through ideological struggle, was also earned by our learning how to deal with the difficulties of recession, the pain of depression, by using the fiscal and budgetary powers of the U.S. Government to care for the Nation in times of real need. 
The Senator from Utah says his amendment is good enough; we can have a vote to ease its restrictions. Good is not good enough. The level of perfection required to amend the Constitution of the United States requires more. These are not theoretical problems, not in another century, not even in a different generation. Each of them has been experienced in our own time--dealing with the problems of recession, the regular and serious problems of international conflict, and the deterioration of national investment. 
I stand here prepared to vote to change the Constitution of the United States. It is something that I believe requires an extraordinary burden of proof. Anyone attempting to change this document must bear a higher burden than in any other Chamber and undertaking any other legislative goal because the Constitution of the United States has no peer. I am prepared to recognize that this burden would be met given the mounting problems of debt in this Nation and the need to restore some permanent fiscal responsibility, but it cannot be met unless these questions are answered. 
Constitutions are not written for any one time. Laws are written for our time. Constitutions are written for all time. I need the Senator from Utah to explain to me how a generation unborn, in circumstances unforeseen, will deal with renewed military hostilities, deep recessions, with the problem of international economic competitiveness in the face of declining national investment. I offer my vote for change, will accept that this burden of proof has been met and will otherwise change a document which I believe in only the rarest of instances we ever meet the burden of change----

Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise to address the Senate for the first time as a Member of this proud institution, and, indeed, it is an important moment in my life and that of my family. 
Although I stand where I know preceding generations have often become legends, I also stand tall because I am standing here today on the shoulders of genuine giants--a tailor and his seamstress wife who walked from their native village in Italy for a boat to New York, a German steelworker who settled his young family in my native New Jersey. 
Mr. President, a journey of generations brings me to this moment. I understand that I may be bound to some Members of this Senate by little more than a single common thread. Many families are more powerful, and most biographies are genuinely more compelling. But Providence has chosen what we share this moment to help define the future of our people and the Republic that they have chosen to serve them. 
The burden of leadership may be greater on some generations, and perhaps it has been less on others. The only certainty for our time is that it is different. The great debates of this Chamber in other times have been framed by events--the threat of conflict in the time of our fathers, the immediate threat of economic dislocation not so many years ago. Previous generations often read the national agenda simply by the history that was presented to them. The choices were fundamental and they were very clear. 
The principal issue of governance before us now is very different. The United States is largely without large-scale military strife. The successive defeats of fascism and communism leave the United States with a relative military advantage that is unprecedented. The greatest economic expansion in history has resulted in a standard of living and a scale of economic activity that was unimaginable only a generation ago. This is not to suggest that either providing for the national defense or building the national economy are complete. The world remains a dangerous place in the age of terrorism, and the blessings of America still elude too many. 
But our time is different. We inherit no agenda and few national commitments from which we are not freed by the end of the cold war. This opportunity presents an enormous opening, but has also led to an extraordinary national anxiety. As a nation, we have consumed almost a decade since the cold war has subsided without being clear about what we need to achieve to succeed with the reward of peace. 
In our domestic affairs, some view the success of civil rights, the completion of universal education for the construction of a national infrastructure as ends in themselves. 
In our family lives, many seem uncertain as to our own objectives as people. The comfort of a home, the completion of an education, seem to bring neither the security nor the fulfillment that we once envisioned. It is in short, Mr. President, a time of extraordinary anxiety in our affairs. Across the aisles of this Chamber, the conference tables of our businesses and even the living rooms of our homes, there is need for an honest conversation. It is time to ask the most fundamental questions about the objectives of our times and our goals as a people and as individuals. 
No one element of this debate is more fundamental than our new national objectives in our relations with other States around the globe. The foreign policy goals of the United States in the next century can best be explained relative to the experience of our own time. For although the 20th century has not yet concluded, it is already possible to predict that despite all the advances of science and culture this time will best be remembered for our inability to manage relations between nations. 
Any discussion of our foreign policy objectives, therefore, must simply begin with this simple commitment: the future must simply be different than the past. This century evolved through the lessons of collective security. A series of States with similar interests, political institutions, compatible military capabilities and goals found common cause. The NATO treaty was the best example and remains the foundation of our policy. But the first principal difference we are likely to face in the 21st century is that American security interests are no longer disproportionately European. In a world of global markets and intercontinental weapons, there are no regions of sufficient distance or size that they lack relevance. Treaties which restrict the global scope of our collective security including NATO are simply no longer acceptable. Creating new arrangements tailored to individual crises like the Persian Gulf are too inefficient and insufficient. Leadership requires the adoption of an established global structure of collective security. Whether under the NATO umbrella, under different sponsorship or a structure that is global in scale, collective security for our international security threats remains paramount. 
The second defining difference in American foreign policy is recognizing that international conflict on a scale seen in the 20th century must never be allowed to occur again because by definition such conflicts can never be won again. Technological change will place all nations within the range of secondary powers that retain weapons now reserved for more stable nations. 
Collective security, therefore, must be designed not only to prevail in conflicts but to avoid their ever occurring by denying capability to certain well-defined governments. These are States which by their systems of government, record of actions or temperament of leadership, should make themselves ineligible to ever possess or attempt to develop certain weapons. This policy of weapons denial already encompasses technological and trade restrictions. In the future, it must also include covert or overt actions by the United States or now collective international organizations to ensure weapons denial as an assurance of national security. 
A third national consideration will involve far more introspection by every American. As a decent people with deep religious traditions, it is time to recognize that technology presents a new moral dilemma. For two centuries Americans witnessed a world of famine and disease. Untold millions suffered and died with little more than passing commentary while we remained reconciled to both our moral principles and international realities by concluding that nature was sometimes cruel and divine actions difficult to comprehend. In critical moments, from the Marshall Plan to the Alliance for Progress, the Nation committed itself to confronting these tragic realities. 
During most generations, the national boundaries served to define our sense of moral responsibility. That was all enough. But something has now fundamentally changed. Perhaps it is because global communication now no longer allows us to be shielded from harsh realities. But, indeed, it is even more than that. The world population group now estimates that 35,000 children die from starvation every day, this year an estimated 18 million will contract river blindness, and over 100,000 children will suffer from new cases of polio. No American can feel comfort any longer in reaching conclusions about the inevitability of human suffering. There has been a cure for polio for 40 years. River blindness is treated by medication that costs $3. The simple truth is that some disease and much human suffering is no longer a question of divine providence or lack of understanding or a failure of technology. Most are the results of a political decision, a judgment to withhold technology, withdraw from efforts to relieve suffering because of shortages of funds or simply because we believe that political boundaries place us at sufficient distance. 
Reconciling our beliefs and our actions is no longer a simple affair. Suffering in the world and judgments made by individual Americans and their governments are debate long needed on the floor of our great institutions. Within our own communities, Americans need to decide a new set of national objectives as well. 
Americans have learned a lesson from the excesses of Government. Every citizen can recite a list of programs that failed or funds that were wasted. Our generation has concluded that the role of Government needs to be more limited. A previous generation learned from the lessons of child labor, the disabled, the failure to care for the elderly, that Government was sometimes too restricted in its role. Now it is time for us to decide: Is it too limited or is it too much? It is, indeed, extraordinary that after two centuries of the American experiment we are still debating the appropriate role and scale of the U.S. Government. 
In our time we must ask both the appropriate range and the scale of Government activities that are needed for our generation. 
The answer is likely to be somewhere in between. We must, obviously, be shaped by our own experiences. But I think most Americans will recognize that simply because Government sometimes failed, because we have learned that it cannot do everything, is not a reason to conclude that it can do nothing. We take enormous pride in the fact that America is a place with an unlimited ceiling of opportunity. But all too often we are also learning that the floor of American life is too hard. Because many, or most can succeed is not a reason to turn away from public responsibilities, because some will fail. 
We are also learning, for all the lessons of the past which we must remember, they are not instructive of the future. We are living in a different time. Indeed, we are discovering that the economic success of each family, many communities, and many States are now connected in a means that we never would have imagined. We are discovering that the operation of our railroads, our airports, our highways, the education of our children all inevitably will affect the quality of life of our own families. 
For two centuries our Federal Government was central to providing the private economy with certain elements that were needed for competitiveness. From inexpensive labor, through our immigration policy, to access to raw materials, competitive taxes, copyright laws, sometimes even direct subsidies, we understood an appropriate role for the U.S. Government in ensuring economic success. 
As we now face this debate again in our own time, reaching our own conclusion about the role, size and scale of the Federal Government, perhaps at least this one thing should be recognized as different. As certainly as those before us recognize immigration policy, raw materials, these other elements as central to economic success, education and knowledge is now the fodder of the private economy in our own time. Therefore, as certainly as local governments, as neighborhoods at one time confronted the need for quality schools, high standards and a quality education, now the Nation itself is confronted with this question, because it is no longer good enough to know that education meets standards in our neighborhoods or our towns or even our States. Our States collectively in our Federal system will meet success or failure in whether or not people we don't even know in communities we have never visited in States we hardly know meet those same standards and are competitive. 
Second, as a national community, redefining ourselves again, debating the appropriate role of the Federal Government, we are also faced with the most fundamental of issues that first confronted our Republic. It is the issue of providing security for our communities and our families. It is, in short, assuring domestic order. From longer prison sentences to direct assistance to local police, we have in recent years redefined our Federal system for a larger role because it was necessary to assure the security of our people. 
In the future, the Federal Government, as it redefines itself, will also play a larger role in other areas. We have begun to deny parents the ability to flee responsibilities to children by fleeing State jurisdictions. We have begun, indeed, to change Federal laws in relation to access to weapons. Three decades ago, in my State of New Jersey and in many other urban communities, we began to enact gun control laws. But recently, in the city of New York, it was discovered that fully two-thirds of all the weapons now found involved in serious felony crimes were not sold in New York or New Jersey or other States that had gun control laws, but were imported from other States. The Brady bill was an important beginning to assuring that, as a community, while some States did not, fortunately, share in the plague of crime, they nevertheless would begin to exercise responsibility by, through new national laws, beginning to separate criminals from the guns they use. 
A third unfinished piece of business in the American social compact also needs to be addressed. It began in this century with labor standards and grew to include Social Security, unemployment insurance and Medicare. Each of those in our social compact was a generational judgment. Now there is a need for another, because that list which began early in the progressive era and expanded through Medicare by way of unemployment and Social Security now leaves us with the question of health care insurance. Before the book is closed on the 20th century, in this great redefining of America's social commitments, surely access to affordable and quality health care needs to be added to the list. It is not a question of the Government supplanting private health care. It is not a question of the loss of private options or the private exercise of talents within the health care field any more so than Medicare meant that doctors were no longer working privately or unemployment insurance meant that private companies no longer managed their own affairs. 
But it is a question that what began with our grandparents and our great grandparents in assuring independence in the workplace, the right to bargain for your own wage, your freedom 
from want for the elderly through Social Security, that movement is not complete and that work is not finished without addressing the reality of 40 million Americans outside of the private health care insurance system, or their children who come of age without inoculation to disease or, indeed, often are born without access to a health care system for their mothers or in their infancy. 
All these are part of expanding our domestic agenda at a time when we redefine the role of Government. I recognize that there are many in this institution, as there are across this country, who would confront these issues differently. But in our time there is a new, greater threat to resolve in these questions. It is on the mantle of bipartisanship, part of the desire to settle all disputes. We are, in this institution and around the country, confusing the desire to end the noise of squabbling, the needless bickering of partisanship, with a new seeming desire of bipartisanship, to end all conflicts together. 
This is, Mr. President, in my mind, a new and compelling problem. American democracy is not served best by Democrats and Republicans, or liberals and conservatives, setting aside all their differences. The public believes we are in some new accord in which we have no differences. Democracy is served best by people who do put petty interests aside, who do not argue simply for partisan reasons, who do, indeed, come together in moments of great national crisis, but who, in honesty, come to this floor as they come to their dinner tables and their businesses and their places of work every day in honest disagreement where they have honest difference. 
Let us, therefore, debate the question of America's new role in the world with different perspectives. Because they are complex questions and difficult to answer. Let us begin to finally redefine the role of Government in our lives and our economy from our various perspectives, because Americans have different views, and they are difficult and complex questions. But let us not, because we want to end disagreements, where we were sometimes disagreeable, make bipartisanship a goal in and of itself. The goal is to answer the question and to serve our people, no matter the disagreements. 
This is, Mr. President, finally, an extraordinary time. None of the problems that I have tried to outline tonight should overwhelm us. None concern me because none are as big as the country we represent or as bold or as talented as the people who live in our generation in this Nation. 
This is an extraordinary time, and we are an extraordinary people. Indeed, I would dare to say what probably no other generation ever would have said on the floor of this Senate: That there is no time and no place when it is better to have been alive or to be an American than this moment. We have won the great conflicts in the world that threatened our democracy and the peace. We are the masters of a great new technology that can serve us, our interests and our families. There is a quality of life that awaits us if we learn to manage our affairs, raise the resources, deal responsibly with our economy and invest in our future. 
It is not to say that there will not be difficult days in our own time. There will always be difficult days. But we are a people who managed to carve out a new social order through Social Security and labor rights in the depths of a depression. 
We are a people who managed through economic despair to rise to win a great world war. 
We are a people who, in the midst of a cold war, conquered space, won the fight for civil rights, even enacted Medicare and began the greatest expansion of education in history. 
We are a people who, through difficult times, mastered the moment to achieve great things. 
Now, in far better times, though most certainly with some problems in our public and private lives, we are asked to rise again. In this, I have no doubts. Let us find a new role for America in the world where we simply do not respond to events, but help shape them; no longer see our responsibility simply to win international conflicts but to prevent them by negotiating the peace where possible, by taking action to prevent war by military means when necessary. 
Let us redefine the role of Government in our lives and our private economy to ensure that it is no more than necessary, but everything that is essential to ensure our competitiveness, our fairness in social justice. 
I pledge, Mr. President, in my 6 years in this institution, to simply be guided by this: The words given to me by a friend who came to me knowing that I would rise on this day and remembering that they were once spoken by Edmund Burke in a speech to the Electors of Bristol. He said:  
Your representative owes you not his industry only, but his judgment. And he betrays instead of serves you if he sacrifices it to your opinion. 
Mr. President, to the citizens of New Jersey and to this Nation, I promise simply in these years to be guided by my judgment. 
Mr. President, I thank you, and I yield the floor.
