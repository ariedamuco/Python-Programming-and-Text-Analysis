   Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise in tribute to a friend and colleague, Julian Dixon. Congressman Dixon honorably represented the 32nd District of California for more than 22 years. Julian and I were members of the Congressional Freshman Class of 1978. It was my pleasure to serve with him for more than two decades. 
   Everyone in the Senate knew him and I know no member of the House or Senate who did not like him, as well as respect him. His life exemplified public service and his actions were always motivated by truth, justice and compassion. He was without question a Distinguished Gentlemen. 
   During his tenure in office, Congressman Dixon accomplished many things. He was always magnanimous in victory and gracious in defeat and accepted difficult assignments, such as the Chairmanship of the House Ethics Committee in 1989. It is a responsibility that few members seek and only the most selfless accept. Congressman Dixon did so, and the House of Representatives is a better place for his service. 
   From 1957 to 1960, he served as an enlisted man in the United States Army, rising to the rank of sergeant. This experience made him a life long advocate for the men and women in the Armed Forces. He understood their hardships and needs as well as any member of the Congress. The military services have lost a good friend. 
   At the conclusion of the Cold War, our defense expenditures were cut dramatically. Literally, hundreds of military installations, large and small, around the Nation were slated for closure. Thousands of small businesses depended entirely, or mostly on work generated by the defense industry, and they were in danger of failure. 
   In an effort to help these businesses, Congressman Dixon sponsored legislation to assist small businesses in making the difficult transition to new markets. His efforts saved innumerable small businesses from going under and now many are thriving because of his foresight and stewardship. Most recently he was the very able Ranking Member of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. He was a voice of reason and restraint in an arena that often lends itself to hyperbole and grandstanding. Julian served his country well in this capacity. 
   Congressman Dixon was known for his intelligence, political savvy and strong character. While Julian surely had much lift to accomplish, he truly made a difference while he walked among us. He was a family man and a man of the people. He will be missed. Our prayers are with his family, friends and people he served so well.

   Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I am disappointed, but perhaps not surprised, to be back on the floor with the Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2001. 
   After 8 years of subordinating national security to political concerns, the Clinton-Gore administration now exits on a similar note. Three days before the election, in the face of hysterical, largely inaccurate, but extremely well-timed media lobbying blitz, the President overruled his national security experts and vetoed this bill over a provision designed to reduce damaging leaks of classified national security information. 
   Ironically, the White House--with the full knowledge of Chief of Staff John Podesta--had previously signed off on section 304 of the Intelligence bill, the anti ``leaks'' provision that prompted the veto. Section 304, which has been public since May and which represents the product of extensive consultations with the Justice Department and the Senate Judiciary Committee, would have filled gaps in existing law by giving the Justice Department new authority to prosecute all unauthorized disclosures of classified information. 
   Section 304 and the rest of the intelligence authorization bill were unanimously approved by the Intelligence Committee on April 27, and adopted by the full Senate without dissent on October 2. The President's Executive Office submitted to the Congress a ``Statement of Administration Policy'' in support of the leaks provision. The conference report was adopted by the Senate on October 12. 
   Let me take a minute to explain why the committee decided, after extensive consultations with the Justice Department, to adopt this provision. 
   While current law bars unauthorized disclosure of certain categories of information, for example, cryptographic or national defense information, many other sensitive intelligence and diplomatic secrets are not protected. And the U.S. Government, in the words of Director of Central Intelligence George Tenet, ``leaks like a sieve.'' 
   While leakers seldom if ever face consequences for leaks, our intelligence professionals do. These range from the very real risks to the lives and freedom of U.S. intelligence officers and their sources, to the compromise of sensitive and sometimes irreplaceable intelligence collection methods. Human or technical, these sources won't be there to warn of the next terrorist attack, crisis, or war. 
   If someone who is providing us intelligence on terrorist plans or foreign missile programs asks, ``If I give you this information, can you protect it,'' the honest answer is often ``no.'' So they may rethink, reduce, or even end their cooperation. Leaks also alienate friendly intelligence services and make them think twice before sharing sensitive information, as the National Commission on Terrorism recently concluded. 
   Some of section 304's opponents downplay the seriousness of leaks compared to traditional espionage. Yet leaks can be even more damaging. Where a spy generally serves one customer, media leaks are available to anyone with 25 cents to buy the Washington Post, or access to an Internet connection. 
   As important as what this legislation does is what it doesn't do. Media organizations and others have conjured up a parade of dire consequences that would ensue if section 304 had become law. Yet this carefully drafted provision would not have silenced whistle blowers, who would continue to enjoy current statutory protections, including those governing the disclosure of classified information to appropriate congressional oversight committees. Having led the move to enact whistleblower protection for intelligence community employees, I am extremely sensitive to this concern. 
   It would not have criminalized mistakes: the provision would have applied only in cases where unauthorized disclosures are made both willfully and knowingly. That means that the person both intends and understands the nature of the act. Mistakes could not be prosecuted since they are, by definition, neither willful nor knowing. 
   It would not have eroded first amendment rights. In particular, section 304 is not an Official Secrets Act, as some critics have alleged. Britain's Official Secrets Act authorizes the prosecution of journalists who publish classified information. Section 304, on the other hand, criminalizes the actions of persons who are charged with protecting classified information, not those who receive or publish it. Even under existing statutes, the Department of Justice rarely seeks to interview or subpoena journalists when investigating leaks. In fact, there has never been a prosecution of a journalist under existing espionage or unauthorized disclosure statutes, despite the fact that some of these current laws criminalize the actions of those who receive classified information without proper authorization.  
   Critics also cite--correctly--the Government's tendency to overclassify information, especially embarrassing information, the disclosure of which would not damage national security, the standard for classification. But these practices are already prohibited under the current Executive order on classification, E.O. 12958, which not only provides a procedure for government employees to challenge a classification determination they believe to be improper, but encourages them to do so. 
   The real issue is: who decides what should be classified? With commendable honesty, critic Steven Aftergood of the Federation of American Scientists went beyond ritual denunciation to spell out his real concern: Section 304, as he told the Washington Post, ``turns over to the executive branch the right to determine what will be protected.'' 
   In fact, designated officials within the executive branch have always exercised that authority. What Mr. Aftergood and the media want is to arrogate that authority to themselves and their sources. While designated classification officials may err, they--not disgruntled mid-level employees--are the ones charged under our laws and procedures with balancing the protection of our nation's secrets with the need for government openness. 
   Mr. President, I am disappointed that President Clinton chose to veto the Intelligence Authorization Act over this provision, and I am especially disappointed at the manner in which this occurred. 
   I believe, however, that it is in our national interest that the Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2001 be enacted into law. Therefore, the bill before the Senate is identical to the conference report vetoed by the President, but for the ``leaks'' provision.

   Mr. SHELBY. The Senator from Ohio is correct. The House and Senate intelligence committees agreed to combine the working groups for both the Nazi and Japanese Imperial Government declassifications in order to obtain economies of scale from both a substantive and financial perspective. However, the requirements set forth in the Japanese Imperial Government Disclosure Act in no way impact on the requirements set forth in the Nazi War Crimes Disclosure Act.

   Mr. SHELBY. Under title VIII, all still-classified records likely to contain such information should be surveyed to determine if they contain relevant information. If records are found to contain information related to actions by the Japanese Imperial Government during the Second World War, those records would be reviewed for declassification by the IWG under the criteria provided in the title. However, in the interests of safeguarding legitimate national security interests, the Director of Central Intelligence still maintains the discretion to protect the disclosure of operational files under section 701 of the National Security Act of 1947. Given the nature and age of the files it is unlikely he will need to exercise this authority. Title VIII requires an agency head who determines that one of the exceptions for disclosure applies to notify the appropriate congressional committees of a determination that disclosure and release of records would be harmful to a specific interest. It is the intent of title VIII that the IWG will be able to undertake an effort to search through U.S. Government records and disclose classified  materials under statutory guidelines regarding the activities of the Japanese Imperial Government during the Second World War.

    Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Mr. Robert L. McCurley Jr., of Tuscaloosa, AL for his dedicated work on behalf of the Kiwanis International Foundation. Mr. McCurley retired on September 30, 2000 after two terms as the president of Kiwanis International's charitable arm. I commend him for his commitment to helping the less fortunate throughout the world.  
   Bob McCurley's duties as Kiwanis International Foundation president have taken him around the world in his efforts to improve the lives of the underprivileged. Under his leadership, the foundation has provided grants to meet the needs of children from Bulgaria and Haiti to India and Cambodia. In particular, the Kiwanis International Foundation has raised millions of dollars to combat iodine deficiency disorders, the leading preventable cause of mental retardation in the world today. 
   Mr. McCurley earned degrees in both engineering and law from the University of Alabama. He is director of the Alabama Law Institute and an adjunct professor at the Alabama School of Law. He has also served as a municipal judge and has authored 12 books on law and government. 
   Mr. McCurley has been a member of Kiwanis in Gadsden and Tuscaloosa for more than 30 years. He led the Kiwanis organization in Alabama in 1983-1984, served as Trustee and then Vice President of Kiwanis International from 1987-1992, and since 1994 has served the Kiwanis International Foundation as a Trustee, Treasurer, and President. In addition to Kiwanis, he has served his community as a volunteer in leadership positions with the March of Dimes, Boys Club, Focus on Senior Citizens, and Association for Retarded Children. 
   Robert L. McCurley Jr.'s charitable work has made a difference in countless lives in Alabama and throughout the world. UNICEF estimates that Kiwanis support of iodine deficiency disorder programs is saving more than 8 million children each year from mental and physical disabilities. I would like to congratulate Mr. McCurley on a stellar term as President of the Kiwanis International Foundation, and wish him and his family the best in the future.

   Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, the Senate has before it the conference report to H.R. 4392, the Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2001. The conference report reflects the legislation, S. 2507, that was approved unanimously by the Select Committee on Intelligence on April 27, 2000, and amended and approved by the Senate on Monday, October 2. 
   I thank Senator BRYAN, the vice chairman of the committee for his assistance in expediting this conference report. This is Senator BRYAN's first year as vice chairman. It has been a pleasure to work cooperatively with him on a wide range of issues, and I regret that this also will be his last year on the committee and in the Senate. 
   The committee has been increasingly troubled by the NSA's growing inability to meet technological challenges and to provide America's leaders with vital signals intelligence, SIGINT. Success in NSA's mission is critical to our national security. Therefore, the conference report reflects the start of our investment in resources and support aimed at restoring the NSA's' capabilities. 
   I am proud to report that the conference report addresses the growing problem of leaks of classified information. The conferees endorsed the Senate provision that will close a gap in U.S. law to ensure the prosecution of all unauthorized disclosure of classified information. Successive directors of Central Intelligence have decried the growing problem of leaks of classified information and the damage it causes to our national security. DCI Tenet has publically stated that the U.S. Government ``leaks like a sieve.'' 
   Arguments that section 304 will stifle the freedom of the press simply don't pass muster. This provision has nothing to do with restraining publication. It simply criminalizes knowing and willful disclosure of properly classified information by those charged with protecting it. The Senate Intelligence Committee unanimously approved this provision and worked closely with the Attorney General and the intelligence community to 
   incorporate changes requested by the Department of Justice. The Departments of Justice and State and the CIA all support the provision as approved by the conference committee. 
   Another provision of the bill is designed to ensure that the State Department corrects the serious, systemic security weaknesses that have repeatedly placed at risk sensitive classified intelligence information collected at considerable risk and expense. This provision would require that the Director of Central Intelligence certify that the retention and storage of Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI) by any element of the State is in full compliance with all applicable DCI directives relating to the handling, retention, or storage of such information. 
   The bill requires the Director of Central Intelligence, in consultation with the Secretary of Defense, to create an analytic capability for intelligence relating to prisoners of war and missing persons. The analytic capability will extend to activities with respect to prisoners of war and missing persons after December 31, 1990. 
   Also, the bill strengthens the IG's requirements to be fully engaged in investigating and responding to possible wrongdoing by senior CIA officials. In the wake of the investigation of former Director of Central Intelligence John Deutch this provision will ensure that the CIA policies its senior officials. 
   The conference report also contains the Counterintelligence Reform Act of 2000. S. 2089 was introduced by Senators Specter, Torricelli, Thurmond, Biden, Grassley, Feingold, Helms, Schumer, Sessions, and LEAHY in April in the wake of Congressional and other investigations into PRC espionage against the Department of Energy's nuclear weapons laboratories and other U.S. government facilities, and the U.S. government's response. Those investigations focused attention on the application of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978, and highlighted coordination, information-sharing, and other problems within and among the Department of Energy, FBI, and Department of Justice. The amendment will correct some of the problems in coordinating and sharing information between federal agencies, and will  clarify procedures and the statutory roles of various agencies in the investigation and prosecution of espionage and other cases affecting national security. 
   I thank all Senators for their cooperation in this conference report, particularly the members of the committee. I also thank the staff of the Select Committee on Intelligence for their hard work in developing this legislation.

   Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate will have the opportunity to consider the conference agreement for the fiscal year 2001 Transportation appropriations bill. 
   I believe that this bill strikes a funding balance between the modes of transportation, funds critical safety initiatives, reflects the priorities of the overwhelming majorities of both the House and the Senate, and provides adequate flexibility and direction for the Department as it transitions into the next administration. 
   Mr. President, allow me to take just a few minutes to summarize and highlight a few of the provisions of the conference report that is now before the Senate. 
   Of the three issues that the administration indicated were critical to it in the safety arena, I'm pleased to report that we're three for three. And, so is the administration. These issues have been negotiated in a fashion and with a spirit of accommodating the interests of the House, the Senate, and the administration. Through some creativity and with an awareness of the specific concerns of all the parties, we have been able to meet everyone more than halfway. 
   The compromise language on the hours of service regulations in this conference report allows the Department to move forward with the analysis of the docket, issue a supplemental NPRM, and do everything short of issuing the final rule. I think that is a reasonable compromise and one that should provide the incentive for the administration to fully listen and solicit views on all sides of this issue. 
   As many of you know, I have a concern that NHTSA has ignored calls from consumer groups and critics of the proposes static stability factor rating system in its rush to publish a rollover rating as part of the NCAP program. Notwithstanding that concern, I have been convinced by the distinguished House Chairman, Mr. WOLF, that he believes that NHTSA, in light of our attention to the issue, will now act responsibly in this area. 
   Accordingly, the conference agreement maintains the Senate requirement to conduct a 9-month study at the National Academy of Sciences. The Academy is directed to investigate the usefulness of the information that NHTSA proposes to provide, the scientific underpinnings of the NHTSA approach, and consideration of whether dynamic testing is preferable to the static stability factor calculation--while simultaneously allowing NHTSA to move forward with its proposal. 
   This issue deserves all our attention as it evolved because rollovers are among the most deadly of accident types and providing bad information to consumers could well mean more highway fatalities. People have a right to expect that the information that the Federal Government provides is accurate, unbiased, and based on sound testing methodologies. I am pleased that in the conference agreement NHTSA will have to meet that standard, if not in the short term, at least in the long term. 
   The funding levels keep faith with the recently enacted AIR-21 capital and airport authorizations, and come very close to the President's budget request for FAA operations. 
   The Highway and Transit accounts are funded at the TEA-21 authorized levels; the Coast Guard, adjusted for some of the capital projects funded in the supplemental, is above the President's requested level for fiscal year 2001; NHTSA is above the President's request once it is adjusted downward for the RABA shift that was a non-starter with both the House and the Senate.  
   Amtrak is funded at the President's request and the remaining accounts: Pipeline Safety, the Inspector General, the National Transportation Safety Board are all at or above the President's request. 
   There is no tenable argument that can be made that there isn't enough money in this bill. The conference agreement includes approximately 14 percent more budget 
   resources than the fiscal year 2000 enacted levels. 
   In addition, we have tried to reflect and accommodate the priorities of our subcommittee members, full committee members, and the membership of both the House and Senate. We have listened to what our members have requested us to do and accordingly, the negotiated compromise reflects the priority that members have put on highway and transit spending. 
   There are other issues that have been the subject of some attention--the most notable of which is the .08 blood alcohol content. The Senate bill included a provision which would hold back a portion of highway funds from states which fail to adopt a .08 blood alcohol content standard. 
   The conference agreement modifies that provision by providing a more graduated, phased-in approach of the highway holdback and more time for states to adopt the .08 standard. I also want to point out that no state incurs the loss of highway funds if they adopt the .08 blood alcohol content standard by 2007. Whatever funds withheld from them starting in 2004 would be returned without penalty under the hold-harmless clause as long as a .08 standard is adopted by 2007. I think this is a reasonable and fair transition to a standard that we know will save lives. 
   Mr. President, there are a few people I would particularly like to thank before we vote. My ranking members, Senator LAUTENBERG, has been a valued partner in this process during his final year as the ranking member of the Senate Transportation Appropriations Subcommittee. While we have had our disagreements and differences, I have been privileged to work with him and believe this nation's transportation policy have benefitted by the substantial contributions he has made during his tenure in the Senate and on the subcommittee. 
   Senators STEVENS and BYRD have provided guidance throughout the year, and made a successful bill possible by ensuring an adequate allocation for transportation programs. 
   My House counterpart, Congressman FRANK WOLF and his staff: John Blazey, Rich Efford, Stephanie Gupta, and Linda Muir, have been particularly accommodating and collegial. 
   Finally, Mr. President, I want to thank Steve Cortese and Jay Kimmitt of the full committee staff for their invaluable assistance and advice throughout the process. 
   Mr. President, I urge adoption of the conference report.

    Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise today to honor Dr. Emmett O. Templeton of Birmingham, Alabama who recently received the American College of Radiology's (ACR) Gold Medal. Dr. Templeton currently chairs the department of radiology at Montclair Baptist Medical Center in Birmingham and continues to faithfully serve the community. 
   Dr. Templeton is an extraordinary individual who, as Chairman of the board of Chancellors of the American College of Radiology, made a lasting impression on Members of Congress by his straight-talking style. He served his specialty, radiology, and the nation's public policy in health by dealing with problems head-on and working to find solutions. Dr. Templeton has been an asset to all of us in Congress and is deserving of the ACR Gold Medal which recognizes his marvelous achievements. 
   In addition, I have included the remarks made in the ACR Bulletin about Dr. Templeton and why he has been awarded the Gold Medal. 
   Emmett O. Templeton, M.D. 
   At 53, Emmett ``Neal'' Templeton, M.D., is one of the youngest recipients of the ACR Gold Medal. A unique and talented radiologist, Dr. Templeton is perhaps best known for his outstanding contributions and dedicated service to the college. Never one to toot his own horn, Dr. Templeton's unassuming manner, excellent intermediary talents and astute guidance have earned him the widespread respect of his peers. He has played a significant role in the advancement and success of the ACR and has been an inspiration to many of his colleagues in the southeast. 
   An ACR Fellow, Dr. Templeton became actively involved with the ACR fewer than 15 years ago, yet has served on more than 20 commissions and committees and participated for several years on many of them. The wide range of committees he has assisted is a reflection of his avid interest in all aspects of radiology, including accurate coding, practice matters and relationships with clinics and hospitals. 
   ``Neal is an unusually bright and charismatic individual, which is immediately evident to those he meets. It is the reason he has so frequently been chosen for leadership,'' says Milton Gallant, M.D., director of radiology at The General Hospital Center at Passaic in New Jersey. ``Leadership opportunities, coupled with unusual statesmanship and hard work, have resulted in his endeavors being uniformly successful.'' 
   Dr. Templeton has selflessly shared his time and counsel in ACR leadership roles, beginning as vice chair for the Commission on Radiologic Practice, The Commission on Economics, the Committee on State and Economic Legislation of the Commission on Economics, the Committee on Coding and Nomenclature and the Commission on Government Relations have all benefitted from his direction as chair. From 1992 to 1994, he served as vice chair of the Board of Chancellors. The following two years he served as chairman of the board while also serving as chairman of the Commission on Government Relations. In 1996 he was elected ACR president. 
   Bibb Allen Jr., M.D., one of Templeton's partners at Birmingham Radiological Group, saw firsthand the sacrifices Templeton willingly made during his tenure on the Board of Chancellors. ``Neal spent the vast majority of his personal time away from the hospital conducting the business of the college,'' Allen says. ``All radiologists have benefitted from Neal's leadership and skill.'' 
   Dr. Templeton is also a member of the Radiology Residency Review Committee, the AMA Practice Expense Advisory Committee, AMA-CPT Editorial Panel, the Government Relations Oversight Committee and the Practice Expense Advisory Committee panel. 
   His effective management style has made him an accomplished mediator. He is well known for his concern and support for technologists, office managers and office staff, recognizing the importance of their role in the practice of radiology. According to Barbara E. Chick, M.D., past councilor, chancellor and vice president of the ACR, ``His availability to meet with anyone, at any time, to help problem-solve was a great asset to the field of radiology when the ``turf'' battles were so common.'' Chick adds, ``I believe his keen insight has been beneficial to many practices in their marketing and reimbursement activities.'' 
   Templeton has a unique knowledge of radiologic practice and economic matters. He has been appointed to the boards of HMO and PPO organizations as a result of the model hospital and imaging center practices he has demonstrated in his own practice. One of the highlights of his career was his stewardship of diagnostic imaging centers as an alternative to private office or hospital practice. He was an early expert in this concept during a time when the recognition of radiologists as ``physicians'' was not unequivocal. 
   Currently chair of the department of radiology at Montclair Baptist Medical Center, Birmingham, Ala., Templeton earned his medical degree from the University of Alabama in 1973 and completed his internship and residency at the University of Alabama's hospitals and clinics. Even after achieving the highest positions in the ACR, he continues to serve the college and radiology ``in the trenches.'' 
   Michael A. Sullivan, M.D., associate chairman of the department of diagnostic radiology at Ochsner Clinic in New Orleans, sums up Templeton's character nicely: ``Neal is a wonderful individual who is forthright, honest and hard-working. He exemplifies the term `involved radiologist.' ''

   Mr. SHELBY. I agree with the Senator from Delaware 100 percent, and I can assure this body that in passing section 303, no member of the Select Committee on Intelligence intended that it be used as an excuse for investigating the press. That is why the scope of this provision is limited to persons who disclose, or attempt to disclose, classified information acquired  as a result of authorized access to such information. Such persons have a duty to protect classified information has no right to disclose that particular information to persons not authorized to receive it, persons, even if he or she should later become a journalist. By the same token, however, the statute is not intended to lead to investigation or prosecution of journalists who previously had authorized access to classified information and later, in their capacity as journalist, receive leaked information.

   Mr. SHELBY. I understand the concerns of the Senator from Delaware. We expect that in almost all cases intelligence operations exempted from future treaty-implementing legislation will have been authorized in writing. I would note however, that many individual actions might be authorized through general written policies, rather than case-specific authorizations. 
   Neither would I rule oral authorization in exigent circumstances. The Committee believes that intelligence agencies would be well advised to make written records of such authorizations, so as to guard against lax management or later assertions that unrecorded authorization was given for a person's otherwise unlawful actions. Such written records will also protect the government employees from allegations that their actions were not authorized.

   Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I want to take a minute or two and talk about my colleague from Nevada, Senator BRYAN. He is going to be leaving the Senate soon. As the vice chairman of the committee--a long-term and long-time member of the Senate Intelligence Committee--he has been a delight to work with most of the time. Seriously. He puts a lot of effort into what we do on the Senate Intelligence Committee. 
   I would be remiss if I did not bring that up as we pass this bill tonight. We have a conference to go to. We will be spending a lot of time together in the waning days of this Congress. DICK BRYAN served this country well, first as a State legislator, as the attorney general of his State, as the Governor of his State, and in two terms in the U.S. Senate. I have worked with him on a lot of issues, and I can say this: He is a hard worker, he is smart, he is going to be prepared, he is going to be tough, and he is going to put the Nation first.

   Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise to express my support for the Thompson-Torricelli amendment, or the ``China Nonproliferation Act.'' 
   I do so as a Senator who has long been concerned about the threat posed by China's reckless proliferation of nuclear, missile and other technologies, and as chairman of the Intelligence Committee, with responsibility for our intelligence efforts against this critical national security threat. 
   While this amendment applies to other countries, including Russia and North Korea, we are considering it in the context of Permanent Normal Trade Relations for the People's Republic of China, or PNTR. Therefore, my remarks will, for the most part, focus on that country. 
   I should say at the outset that I intend to support PNTR because I believe that, on balance, taking this step will further U.S. national interests. 
   But China remains, in the words of the Director of Central Intelligence, a ``key supplier'' of sensitive technologies to Iran, Pakistan and other countries. 
   I remind my colleagues that the Intelligence Committee has prepared and made available to Members a summary and compendium of recent intelligence reporting on PRC proliferation. It remains available for your review. 
   I understand that only a handful of Senators have availed themselves of this opportunity. I urge each of you to review this very disturbing and revealing material. Without having done so, you will be voting on this amendment ignorant of the facts as we know them. 
   Whether you choose to vote for or against this amendment, you must not do so without a full appreciation of the facts. 
   Suffice it to say that China has not improved its poor proliferation record. 
   In light of the poor Chinese proliferation record, I believe that risks associated with approving PNTR are managed better if the Thompson-Torricelli amendment is enacted with our new trade relationship with China. 
   Since the sponsors and other Senators are addressing the threat to our national security posed by Chinese proliferation, I will focus primarily on some of those aspects of the problem of greatest concern to the Intelligence Committee. 
   Tracking the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction has been among the Intelligence Committee's very highest budgetary priorities. 
   This is because proliferation is one of our most daunting and resource-intensive intelligence challenges. The materials and technology to build nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons and the missiles to deliver them are not shipped in the open. They are smuggled across borders and shipped under false documents. 
   Vital technical support to a country's missile or nuclear program may fit on a single computer disk or take the form of clandestine visits by technical experts. 
   The materials used in making weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery are often dual use, meaning that they may also be used for peaceful purposes. 
   Our intelligence analysts must compile all the facts to determine the likely use of these materials. This really is rocket science, and nuclear science, and biological and chemical science. 
   Tracking proliferation is not only difficult, it is a critical mission. Timely intelligence provides us with the information we need to support our efforts to deter or dissuade countries, like the People's Republic of China and Russia, from selling nuclear, chemical, biological or missile technologies to rogue states or regions of instability. 
   When deterrence and dissuasion fail, timely intelligence also will support efforts to counter the proliferation and use of missiles and weapons of mass destruction. 
   What is especially frustrating for me, as chairman of the Intelligence Committee, is that while the Intelligence Community is doing its job, gathering intelligence at great expense and risk about who is selling and who is buying technologies of mass destruction, this intelligence is ignored by policymakers. 
   Policy makers have frequently circumvented our sanctions laws by avoiding reaching a determination that could trigger sanctions. They have ensured that the bureaucratic process for reaching a determination that would lead to sanctions is never started, or completed, or impossible standards of evidence are set, so that a judgment never has to be reached. 
   A case in point is the notorious M-11 missile. After years of closed door deliberations on this issue, in September of last year, for the first time, the Intelligence Community stated publicly its longstanding conclusion that ``Pakistan has M-11 SRBMs [Short Range Ballistic Missiles] from China. .....'' 
   Lest anyone miss the significance of these Chinese missiles now in the hands of Pakistan, or their contribution to instability in South Asia, the community assessed further that these missiles may have a nuclear role. 
   Sales of M-11 technology have twice triggered sanctions against the PRC under the Arms Export Control Act and Export Administration Act. The sale of M-11 missiles should, under current law, have triggered additional, even stricter, sanctions. 
   But despite the clear, and public, conclusion of the Intelligence Community, the State Department has suggested that the Intelligence Community's finding that the M-11 missiles were sold by the PRC to Pakistan did not meet its ``high standard of evidence.'' 
   Failure to follow through on the facts, however unpleasant the facts may be, undercuts the credibility of our entire nonproliferation policy. 
   I am hopeful that the Thompson-Torricelli amendment will force a more robust response to the intelligence collected on proliferation. Under this amendment, policy makers will be forced--on an annual basis--to collect the evidence of proliferation and provide a report to Congress. 
   This report will be more comprehensive and focused than those we have received to date. 
   The report must identify persons from China, Russia, North Korea and other states when there is credible evidence that this person has contributed to the design, development, production, or acquisition of nuclear, chemical, or biological weapons or ballistic missiles. 
   The report also will identify any person of a covered country that is engaged in activities prohibited under the  relevant treaties and agreements regarding the possession and transfer of chemical, biological, and nuclear weapons. 
   The President is directed in the China Nonproliferation Act to report information on noncompliance with international arms control and proliferation agreements by the covered countries. 
   Finally, the report must include an assessment of the threats to our national security, and that of our allies, resulting from proliferation--whether or not this proliferation can be determined to meet the legal or evidentiary standards the State Department asserts to avoid reaching sanctions judgements. 
   This will go a long way towards compelling the State Department to acknowledge serious instances of nuclear and other proliferation. 
   Furthermore, the Director of Central Intelligence is required to reach a determination regarding what transfer or sale of goods, services, or technology have a ``significant potential to make a contribution to the development, improvement, or production of nuclear, biological, or chemical weapons or of ballistic or cruise missile systems.'' 
   Again, mandating this report will allow us to avoid the unpleasant situation we have been in for years in which the President has been able to avoid reaching necessary judgements about proliferation activities and their consequences. 
   This report will contribute significantly to the ability of the U.S. Congress to conduct oversight and to make informed judgements on matters of national security. 
   The information detailed in the report should better enable us to judge the appropriateness and, over time, the effectiveness of the sanctions provided for in this amendment. 
   Some have complained that this bill forces the President to impose sanctions. This is not the case. 
   The amendment provides adequate flexibility to the President since he can waive the sanctions. 
   However, he must specify his reasons for doing so, and Congress may disagree through procedures set out in the bill. This legislation will make Presidential decision-making more transparent and will ensure that the President's decisions are based on the best intelligence available. 
   Mr. President, would our citizens want to continue to sell items on the United States Munitions List to an individual that has ``contributed to the design, development, production, or acquisition of nuclear, chemical, or biological weapons or ballistic or cruise missiles'' for a third party or state. 
   Would our citizens want to continue to license dual-use items that could contribute to this individual's proliferation of weapons of mass destruction? 
   Would our citizens want to continue to provide that individual Government assistance in the form of grants, loans, or credits? 
   Would our citizens want to continue co-development or co-production of items on our munitions list with that individual? 
   Of course not. Of course not. 
   I hope we can agree that the United States should neither reward nor contribute to proliferation of the weapons that threaten our own Nation. 
   Without question, the imposition of sanctions against another nation or foreign companies is always a serious matter. 
   The imposition of sanctions has significant foreign and economic policy consequences for the United States and should not be undertaken lightly. 
   Because sanctions can be costly for our own American industries, we must be sure there is a clear national security interest that will be advanced by the sanctions. 
   Curbing proliferation meets this test. The President has declared the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction to be a ``national emergency,'' and I think most of us agree with that declaration. 
   I support the Thompson-Torricelli amendment because it takes a balanced, measured approach to the problem of sanctioning Chinese proliferation activities, and similar activities of other countries. 
   In particular, it creates a process to ensure that the U.S. response to future activities of proliferation is never again the inaction, indifference, and self-deception that characterizes the current process. 
   I believe this bill will bring us closer to a situation in which the PRC and other supplier nations clearly understand--for the first time--that there will be serious consequences when they engage in proliferation of weapons of mass destruction that threaten the United States, its allies, and friends. 
   Mr. President, I again urge my colleagues to review the available intelligence. The facts speak for themselves, and they speak very loudly indeed. 
   I urge adoption of the Thompson-Torricelli amendment and yield the floor.

   Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise today to join some of my fellow Senators in remembering the extraordinary life and service of our friend and colleague, PAUL COVERDELL. 
   It is a somber day in the Senate Chamber, as we deal with this loss. PAUL COVERDELL served the people of Georgia with distinction for over 30 years. His passing leaves a significant mark on the many lives he has touched over his lifetime. On behalf of myself and my wife Annette, I offer my condolences to PAUL'S wife Nancy and his family. 
   Anyone who dealt with PAUL COVERDELL over the years came to respect him. He was honest, loyal, and dedicated to public service. It was these characteristics that PAUL brought to the table every day in his life. PAUL'S vision as a legislator and commitment to the principles and values for which he truly believed were demonstrated time after time in this Chamber. His commitment to improving education in the U.S. sets a high standard for all public officials. His hard work in the Republican leadership and his vision of a prosperous future for all Americans deserves tremendous praise. 
   Personally, it was truly my privilege to know and work with PAUL over the years. We sat next to each other recently in the Senate, as can be seen. 
   He will be remembered as a dedicated American who gave much of his life in service to his Nation. I offer my thoughts and prayers to those close to PAUL in this difficult time, especially to his family.

   Mr. SHELBY. I note to the distinguished chairman of the Armed Services Committee an issue in the committee report accompanying the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2001, S. 2549. on page 126, the report deals with acquisition programs at the National Security Agency (NSA). I fear that the language of the report could have unintended consequences for the on-going efforts to modernize the National Security Agency. The report mandates that the NSA manage its modernization effort as though it were a traditional major defense acquisition program. If this mandate were applied to each of the individual technology efforts within the NSA, such a requirement could impede NSA's flexibility to modernize and upgrade its capabilities. I would ask the Chairman of the Armed Services Committee whether this was the Committee's intent?

   Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, the Washington Times reported last week that the Chinese Government-owned news agency, Xinhua, had purchased property on Arlington Ridge Road in Virginia a location that overlooks the Pentagon and has direct line of sight to many of our key Government buildings including this Capitol and the White House. 
   In fact, the property is so appealing that the East Germans bought it in the early 1980s, which led Congress to amend the Foreign Missions Act. 
   The Secretary of State, through the Foreign Missions Act, has broad authority to oversee the purchase of buildings in the United States by foreign government entities. Under the Act certain identified governments are required to notify the State Department of their intent to purchase property in the United States. China is one such country. 
   The Secretary of State then has 60 days to review the sale, and receive input from the Secretary of Defense and the Director of the FBI. She has the option to disapprove the sale during this period. 
   None of this occurred--despite the fact that China was notified in 1985 that its news agency was required to follow these procedures--and on June 15 the sale was finalized. 
   The Foreign Missions Act provides the Secretary of State with the authority to remedy this violation of law. Under section 205 of the act, the Secretary may force the news agency to divest itself of the property. 
   The legislation I am introducing today will ensure that this broad authority is used. 
   The legislation has two basic requirements: First, it requires the Secretary of State to report to the Intelligence and Foreign Relations Committees whether she intends to force the news agency to divest itself of the property. 
   Second, the bill prohibits any State Department funds from being used to negotiate with the Chinese on the relocation of the Chinese Embassy in Washington until she certifies that she has instituted divestiture proceedings and will ensure that any further purchase of property by the news agency will be pursuant to the Foreign Missions Act. 
   By prohibiting funds for further negotiations until this violation of U.S. law is resolved, this second provision  will also ensure that this issue is handled separately from on-going negotiations to relocate both the U.S. Embassy in Beijing and the Chinese Embassy in Washington, DC. 
   The potential for this building to be a source of unparalleled espionage is not a theoretical matter. While there is nothing new about PRC spying, as an emerging economic and military power, China increasingly challenges vital U.S. interests around the globe through its aggressive security and intelligence service--employing both traditional intelligence methods as well as non-traditional methods such as open source collection, elicitation, and exploitation of scientific and commercial exchanges. 
   In December 1999, the Director of Central Intelligence and the Director of the FBI reported to the Intelligence Committee, in unclassified form, that:  
   As the most advanced military power with respect to equipment and strategic capabilities, the United States continues to be the [Military Intelligence Department of the People's Republic of China]'s primary target.  
   The DCI went on to report:  
   During the past 20 years, China has established a notable intelligence capability in the United States through its commercial presence.  
   And added that China's commercial entities play a significant role in pursuit of U.S. proprietary information and trade secrets. 
   One of China's greatest successes has been its collection against the U.S. nuclear weapons labs. As the U.S. Intelligence Community concluded last year:  
   China obtained by espionage classified U.S. nuclear weapons information, [including] at least basic design information on several modern U.S. nuclear reentry vehicles, including the Trident II (W88).  
   The special advisory panel of the President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board PFIAB concluded:  
   [T]he nature of the intelligence-gathering methods used by the People's Republic of China poses a special challenge to the U.S. in general and the [DOE] weapons labs in particular....... The Chinese services have become very proficient in the art of seemingly innocuous elicitations of information. This approach has proved very effective against unwitting and ill-prepared DOE personnel.  
   In another example, an investigation by the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence concluded that U.S. officials ``failed to take seriously enough the counterintelligence threat'' in launching U.S. satellites on PRC rockets. Technology transfers in the course of U.S.-PRC satellite launches:  
   Enable the PRC to improve its present and future space launch vehicle and intercontinental ballistic missile.  
   But the Chinese are also active in traditional methods of intelligence gathering, which brings us to the subject of my legislation. Especially in the wake of U.S. military success in the Gulf War, the acquisition of advanced U.S. military technology has been a primary thrust of PRC espionage and intelligence collection efforts. 
   If you want money, and if you are so inclined, you rob a bank because, as a bank robber Willy Sutton famously observed: ``that's where the money is.'' 
   If you want information on the most advanced military power in the world, the Pentagon is where the information is. 
   I am hopeful that this bill can be taken up and passed quickly by the Senate and the House in order to ensure that the divestiture occurs in an orderly and speedy manner. 
   Mr. President, this is a serious matter.

    Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, today, I recognize the outstanding service to our Nation of Lieutenant General Michael C. Short. Lt. General Short will retire on July 1, 2000, after an outstanding career in the United States Air Force. During a 35 year career, General Short distinguished himself as a fighter pilot, warfighter, and trusted leader. 
   Throughout his career, General Short commanded at all levels, both overseas and in the continental United States. A 1965 graduate of the U.S. Air Force Academy, he is a command pilot with more than 4,600 flying hours in fighter aircraft, including 276 combat missions in Southeast Asia. His impressive list of accomplishments include command of the 4th Aircraft Generation Squadron, 334th Tactical Fighter Squadron, 4450th Tactical Group, 355th Tactical Training Wing, 67th Tactical Reconnaissance Wing and the 4404th Composite Wing. 
   During his last assignment, General Short commanded the Allied Air Forces Southern Europe, Stabilization Forces Air Component, and Kosovo Forces Air Component, Naples, Italy, and the 16th Air Force and 16th Air and Space Expeditionary Task Force, U.S. Air Forces in Europe, Aviano Air Base, Italy. As commander of these forces, he was the air principal subordinate commander and the joint and combined forces air component commander for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's (NATO) Southern Region. He also was responsible for the planning and employment of NATO's air forces in the Mediterranean area of operations from Gibraltar to Eastern Turkey and air operations throughout the Balkans. General Short led the 16th Air Force during what was, without question, the most demanding period in its history--a time when it fulfilled a NATO mission of peace enforcement in Bosnia-Herzegovina and later, participated in a NATO-led air war, which removed Slobodan Milosevic's Serbian military and police forces from Kosovo. 
   A consummate professional, General Mike Short's performance of duty during the past thirty-five years of service personify those traits of courage, competency and integrity that we expect from our military officers. His career reflects a deep commitment to our country, to dedicated and selfless service, and to excellence. On behalf of the United States Senate and the people of this great Nation, I commend him for his exemplary service and offer heartfelt appreciation for a job well done. We wish him and his family Godspeed and all the best in their future endeavors.

   Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I was not going to comment on this provision today, as I am trying to expedite consideration of the transportation appropriations bill and did not want any statement by me to delay the conclusion of the Senate's consideration of the measure. 
   However, since I heard the chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee and the ranking member of the Environment and Public Works Committee come out in opposition to this measure, I could not miss the opportunity to stand with them in opposition to include this provision on the Transportation appropriations bill. Often we find ourselves in disagreement on individual amendments, so when the chance arises to be on the same side with them, I did not want to miss the chance. 
   Further, I do believe that in this particular instance flexibility is a dangerous tool to be giving Amtrak. It is one thing to grant special dispensation in the case of increasing service or in unique circumstances, but my concern here is that Amtrak will use the provision to leverage State to shift badly needed highway dollars to simply maintaining already failing Amtrak service. 
   This is one of those circumstances of needing to be careful what you wish for--many States may find the they have fewer highway dollars and the same Amtrak service at the end of the day if this provision were to pass. 
   I urge my colleagues to reject this provision on this bill.

   Mr. SHELBY. I thank the Senator for yielding and for his kind words regarding our legislation. We would be pleased to work with the Senator and I support the thrust of his request. 
   His request tracks very closely with the subcommittee's philosophy regarding FAA modernization. Funds provided in this bill for next generation navigation should not be used solely to protect programs which our bill report details are struggling to various degrees but to deploy the immediate benefits of satellite based technologies as quickly as possible. 
   I thank the Senator for his interest and look forward to working with him.

   Mr. SHELBY. I thank the Senator from California for the opportunity to clarify the committee's intent with respect to the committee's response to NHTSA's request to test the ``feasibility of using the 5th percentile dummy'' as indicated in the budget justification. The committee intended with this report language to ensure that NCAP would be expanded to include small size dummies until those dummies are certified for use in crash tests conducted to verify compliance with federal motor vehicle safety standards. I am very supportive of the expanding the number of crash test dummies to more accurately simulate the diverse height and weight of vehicle occupants. The intent was not to prevent the agency from using small dummies nor to prevent NHTSA from acquiring test data essential. To the contrary, the committee provides additional funding in the relevant Research and Analysis contract program. 
   I want to underscore how important it is for members of the committee and the entire body to have accurate and consistent information from NHTSA in order to proceed with expanded NCAP tests. Indeed, the committee has received conflicting information from NHTSA regarding the readiness of small size dummies for use in crash tests.

   Mr. SHELBY. I assure the Senator from California that I will continue to consult with NHTSA regarding the design and reliability of the small size dummies. I believe it is critical that these dummies be satisfactorily developed in time for compliance testing associated with the new advanced air bag rule in 2004.

   Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I am advised that the Senator from Mississippi did bring this matter to the Subcommittee's attention and requested the Subcommittee's consideration for funding. As the Senator from Mississippi knows, the subcommittee considered a number of requests for research projects that could not be funded within the allocations. However, I share the Senator from Mississippi's view that the research program proposed by Jackson State University would make an important contribution to multi-modal transportation research.

   Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I thank the Senior Senator from Colorado for raising the issue of highway ramps to improve safety on the roads in the Metro Denver area. Based on the Transportation Subcommittee's review of highways across the country, it is clear that Colorado, especially the Denver Metro area, has one of the fastest growth rates in the country and has specific transportation needs. 
   I support the Senator's request for assistance on the particular highway project he mentions, and will be happy to work with him to identify funding for this important safety and capacity project as we move towards Conference.

   Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I will try to be really brief. My colleagues have said much about what Senator LAUTENBERG has contributed to the country, to the Senate, and his persistent advocacy on behalf of the State of New Jersey. I will not repeat all those things that have already been said about our distinguished colleague. What I would like to share with the Senate today is a more overlooked but important perspective in FRANK LAUTENBERG. 
   Senator LAUTENBERG is appropriately characterized as a Democrat. I am appropriately characterized as a Republican. You might think we would have a difficult time working together in managing the Transportation appropriations bill. Make no mistake, we have our differences, as we all do. But in the 4 years that I have shared the responsibility of managing this bill with Senator LAUTENBERG, holding hearings on Transportation appropriations issues, working to improve transportation safety, working to improve the efficiency of transportation programs, and working to develop recommendations that reflect the will of the Senate and the priorities of our colleagues, I have found FRANK LAUTENBERG to be thoughtful, decisive, reasonable, and professional. I could not ask for more from a ranking member. 
   I could talk about his accomplishments when he chaired this subcommittee in years past, his advocacy on behalf of Amtrak and the Coast Guard, about his legislative accomplishments to ban smoking on airline flights and to shape highway reauthorization bills, about his love of aviation, about his significant place in shaping Transportation authorization and appropriations bills during his tenure in the Senate, about his vision for improving transportation services, not just in his State of New Jersey but more broadly for the entire Northeast region of the United States. 
   But that would not give the full measure of his contribution. Equally, if not more important, is his commitment to making the process here work, to applying pressure in his own way to get the issues before the Senate and the Congress that are timely and that are relevant. 
   Many have said the Senate will miss Senator LAUTENBERG, that New Jersey will miss his influence, and that the country will miss his leadership on transportation issues. That is all true. But what I will miss most is his friendship, his advice and support on the Transportation Subcommittee on which he has labored so long. 
   I would like to see Senator LAUTENBERG honored in an appropriate way as he departs his service to the Senate and to the Nation's transportation system. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, chairman STEVENS and the leader asked us to move quickly on this year's Transportation appropriations bill, and I'm happy to say that with the assistance of the senior Senator from New Jersey, we have reported a bill for the Senate's consideration. I am speaking of the Senate bill now. Considering that the Senate approved the Transportation appropriations bill in September last year, I suppose that presenting this bill during the second full week in June would qualify as moving more quickly this year. 
   I commend Senator STEVENS and Majority Leader LOTT for pushing this agenda. 
   Both Senator LAUTENBERG and I strongly support this package, though  neither one of us agrees with every decision and funding level that is included in the bill and report. However, this bill contains the essential elements of a Transportation appropriations bill that meets the challenge of adequately funding the Transportation programs within the budget constraints that we have set for Federal spending in fiscal year 2001. 
   I will spend a few minutes on the bill funding summary. 
   The bill provides a total of $54.7 billion, which is $4.7 billion more than the fiscal year 2000 enacted level. Because the firewalled highway and transit programs account for most of this growth--not to mention the increases in aviation capital investment anticipated in FAIR-21 that this body approved just a few months ago--we have been left with no choice but to constrain the growth in the FAA and Coast Guard operations accounts and Coast Guard capital account. Nevertheless, I am confident that, with responsible management, the funding levels for FAA operations and for the Coast Guard are adequate to meet the challenges of safely and effectively managing the nation's airways and the execution of the Coast Guard missions. 
   I note that the administration requested 15 percent growth in the Coast Guard operations account and 12 percent in the FAA operating expenses account. The bill before you today directly provides 9 percent growth in both those operating accounts with an additional 4 percent potential growth available to the FAA operations account if necessary to maintain aviation safety at the discretion of the Secretary of Transportation and the FAA Administrator. 
   That is a lot of money--and a great deal of growth under the budgetary constraints we are operating under. At the same time, the funding levels in our bill require the Secretary to balance the critical needs of both the Coast Guard and the FAA as he (or she) manages the Department. My concern is not that we haven't provided enough resources. My concern is that they won't be administered with an eye towards saving the taxpayers money or toward seeking efficiencies in program execution. 
   We have rejected the administration's proposal to divert highway funds in Revenue Aligned Budget Authority--or RABA--to other programs. This unrealistic proposal raised expectations, but is nothing more than a case of the administration wanting to say they support the highway firewalls while proposing to spend the money on nonhighway activities. You can't have it both ways. 
   We have also rejected the administration's proposal to levy new user fees. Three years ago during my first year as chairman of the Transportation subcommittee, we said no to the administration's new user-fee taxes, 2 years ago, we said no again to the new and improved user-fee taxes from the administration, and last year, we again said no thanks to the newly reconstituted user-fee tax proposal from the administration. Guess what? This is my fourth year as chair of the Transportation appropriation subcommittee, and the President's budget again includes $1.3 billion in new user-fees taxes--I am starting to recognize a pattern. Is anyone in the administration listening to what Congress is saying about new user-fee taxes? 
   Along these lines, I would note that the shortfalls that the administration will complain about in the FAA operations account in this bill are far short of the user-fee proposals that they have proposed for the FAA, not to mention the Coast Guard. If the administration would refrain from submitting budgets with new user-fee taxes as a budget gimmick that they know will never be enacted to hide other non-transportation spending, it would make all our jobs a lot easier to meet realistic targets and expectations for these operations accounts. 
   The bill before you meets the TEA-21 firewall levels for highway and transit investment. In highways, the RABA funding has all been distributed to the states in accordance with each state's share of the program consistent with last year's Senate appropriations bill. In short, every states gets more highway funds through the approach taken in the bill before you. I urge every Senator to refer to the table I will insert in the RECORD to see the total highway funds that will be available for highway construction in his or her state through the approach we propose. 
   The transit new starts and bus projects are not earmarked, which is the way the Senate has handled these programs the last 2 years. This is an approach that has worked well for the Defense appropriations process with respect to the National Guard equipment account, and I believe that it is a good model for balancing congressional and administration priorities in the allocation of discretionary transit projects. 
   The bill provides $4.4 billion for the activities of the U.S. Coast Guard, and, as I mentioned earlier, there is an 9 percent increase for the operating expenses of the Coast 
   Guard. I think we can all agree that it is essential to provide the Coast Guard with the resources they need to continue their tradition of maritime search and rescues, protecting the environment and our coastlines, and enforcing our laws on the seas. 
   There are a few general provisions that I would draw to your attention. One requires the administration to submit with their budget request an accounting of what programs are to be cut if the Congress does not choose to enact the next complement of new user-fee tax-budget gimmicks. 
   Although there are other issues that will be discussed during consideration of this bill, I will note one now. That issue is the national ``.08'' blood alcohol content provision. Senator LAUTENBERG, who is managing his last Transportation appropriations bill this year, makes a compelling case for why the states should adopt ``.08''. This language was included in the bill at his request and will vote to support its inclusion the bill the Senate passes. I urge you to look at it and consider it carefully. 
   The bill before the Senate sets the stage well for a conference with the House. The House 302b for Transportation appropriations has substantially more budget resources than the bill before us today. As a result, the House passed bill is higher in a number of accounts than the bill before the Senate today. Notably, the Coast Guard has $150 million more in the Operating Expenses account, $100 million more in the AC&I account--the Coast Guard's capital improvement account, and the FAA operations account is $200 million higher than the Senate bill. We have included a number of flexibility provisions for the Secretary of Transportation and for the FAA administrator to soften the impact of those cuts from the President's budget request, but the fact remains that we are below the House appropriated levels in those accounts in particular. In addition, there are a number of specific projects or procurements that are included in the House bill that are not in ours, and a number of initiatives in our bill that are not in the House-passed bill. I believe that we can resolve all of these issues in conference to the satisfaction of both bodies and present a conference report that the President will sign. 
   We know of a few amendments to the bill and we would encourage those Members who have amendments to come to the floor to offer them or to see if they can be accepted. We want to work with Members where possible and will seek time agreements on amendments so we can move the bill. 
   Mr. President, I also would be remiss if I did not note my colleague, Senator LAUTENBERG, has joined us. He is the former chairman of this subcommittee and is now the ranking Democrat. I have enjoyed working with him on this subcommittee. This will be the last Transportation bill he will help manage. I can tell my colleagues that he has rendered a great service to his State and to the country. He has been a lot of help to me as I have worked through this process, the same road which he has been down many more times.

    Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Mr. Filippo Milone, a well-known community leader who was recently given the Republican Congressional Committee's Businessman of the Year Award. Filippo runs the highly successful and well regarded Pillars restaurant in Mobile, Alabama which serves some of the best cuisine not only in the state, but in the entire country. This award is truly a testament to Filippo's reputation in the Mobile business community and to the high esteem in which he is held by his peers. I want to congratulate Filippo and his wife of 27 years, Geltrude, and offer my thanks for their dedication to the city of Mobile. 
   Born in Italy in 1938, Filippo came to the United States after fulfilling his duties in the Italian military. After traveling to various parts of the country, Filippo chose to settle in the Mobile area to establish a business and raise a family. Calling upon his extensive culinary training, Filippo opened the Pillars restaurant in 1975 with the idea of creating a unique dining experience for customers. Today, the Pillars restaurant continues to thrive. Filippo has 40 employees and enjoys the satisfaction that comes with creating opportunities for others. He is active in the community as a member of many local organizations, including the Restaurant Association, the Chef's Association, and Lion's Club. Indeed, Filippo's many activities truly entitle him to the recognition that comes with being named a Businessman of the Year. 
   Again, I would like to congratulate Filippo and his entire family on this award. I have had the pleasure of eating at the Pillars Restaurant on numerous occasions and can honestly say I have never been disappointed. Both the service and food are always first class, and being in the company of someone with such a deep sense of community is always a pleasure. His commitment to the Mobile area and to Alabama should be commended.

   Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the ``Freedom from Behavioral Profiling Act of 2000.'' This legislation would disallow financial institutions from buying and selling an individual's most personal and detailed buying habits without proper notification and without his or her permission. Put another way, financial institutions would only be allowed to buy, sell or otherwise share an individual's behavioral profile if the institution has disclosed to the consumer that such information may be shared and the institution has received the consumer's affirmative consent to do so. 
   Technology exists today that allows financial institutions to monitor and collect your personal buying and spending habits. According to the April 3 issue of Business Week magazine, Visa International is ``using neural networks to build up elaborate behavioral profiles. Over months, these systems ..... track a person's behavior online and off, then match it against models of similar personality and behavior types .....'' 
   What this means is that financial institutions have the ability to follow you to the grocery store to track your purchases--whether you are abiding by your doctors recommended diet--and then to the drug store to see what kind of drugs you are purchasing. The institution can also track where you go throughout the day and into the evening, and exactly what time you were there. 
   Business Week also reported that such ``far-flung threads'' as your ``taste in paperbacks, political discussion groups'' and clothing are being ``sewn into online profiles where they are increasingly intertwined with your data on health, your education loans and your credit history.'' What does this information have to do with getting a mortgage? More importantly, are these institutions sharing these behavioral profiles? Given the track record of some of the blue chip firms like Chase Manhattan Bank and U.S. Bancorp, I believe the risk is too great to assume otherwise. 
   Even more important, what happens when these behavioral profiles get into the wrong hands? That rarely happens you say. Guess again. A Russian teenager using the name ``Maxus'' stole 350,000 credit card numbers from CD Universe's Web site last December. He then told CD Universe that he would post the numbers on the Internet unless they paid him $100,000. When they refused to pay him he posted the credit cards numbers and thousands of visitors downloaded more than 25,000 account numbers between December 25 and January 7. 
   A similar case happened on March 24 of this year when two teens in a small Welsh village hacked into computers of several online merchants making off with more than 26,000 credit card numbers. The FBI says losses connected to the thefts could exceed $3 million. 
   Mr. President, if teenagers from around the world are gaining access to account numbers, there is no question they can steal data banks of behavioral profiles. In fact, they are. A front page article in the New York Times dated April 3, 2000, reports that ``Law enforcement authorities are becoming increasingly worried about a sudden, sharp rise in the incidence of identity theft, the outright pilfering of people's personal information and, with that information in hand, thieves can acquire credit, make purchases and even secure residences in someone else's name.'' 
   Mr. President, an important point here is that potential criminals do not even have to steal the information. Due to the significant loopholes in the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act passed last year, an individual's behavioral profile could legally be passed along without the affirmative consent of that individual. The unchecked growth of data banks and the business of profiling unquestionably facilitates identity theft. 
   Some may suggest that there is no harm in behavioral profiling. I disagree. Despite the fact that consumers are ``shielded'' in fraudulent cases, subject to only $50 maximum liability, the burden is on credit card owners to prove the fraudulent charges are not their own. If the fraudulent charge is not found immediately, continued purchases or applications for more cards by the criminal can wreak havoc on an individual's credit rating. In fact, one witness recently testified before the Senate Subcommittee on Terrorism, Technology and Government Information that she spent over 400 hours trying to clear her name and restore her good credit. 
   In ``card-not-present'' transactions, that is orders by mail, telephone or Internet where no signature is required, merchants are forced to cover the loss. Thus, identity theft and fraudulent purchases also take a toll on the small business man. Reports suggest that one out of every ten online purchases is fraudulent. My colleagues know that small businesses do not have the margins to eat the charge on one out of every 10 purchases.  
   Mr. President, the American people are only now becoming aware of the behavioral profiling practices of the industry. The more they find out, the more they do not like it. That is why I am offering this legislation ..... to give the consumer the ability to control his or her most personal behavioral profile. Where they go, who they see, what they buy and when they do it--all of these are personal decisions that the majority of Americans do not want monitored and recorded under the watchful eye of corporate America. 
   Mr. President, colleagues in the Senate, I hope you will join me in an effort to give the people what they want--the ability to control the indiscriminate sharing of their own personal, and private, consumption habits.

   Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Older Americans Tax Fairness Act. This legislation would eliminate--yes, eliminate--the unfair tax on Social Security benefits in this country. 
   Last week, this body, the Senate, took a historic step toward giving senior citizens more financial freedom and retirement security by passing legislation to repeal the earnings limit on Social Security benefits. We seized an opportunity to allow seniors to continue to work and contribute their skills and knowledge to the most vibrant economy in recent memory. 
   While the U.S. economy is currently reporting the lowest unemployment number in years, employers are finding that labor is difficult to come by and they are searching for ways to address this challenge. Increasingly, they are turning to senior citizens to fill the void. However, many seniors are finding that while they may want to work to better their standard of living or have to work to make ends meet, they are being hit by an additional tax burden, one that taxes their Social Security benefits--their retirement security, in other words--such that working, in many cases, is not financially beneficial to them. 
   When the Social Security program was first established by Congress, Congress did not intend for benefits to be taxed at all. In fact, Social Security benefits were exempt from Federal taxes for half a century. But because of a financial crisis within the program in the eighties and President Clinton's desire to fund new programs in 1993, seniors who earn a modest wage now find that anywhere between 50 and 85 percent of their Social Security benefits are taxed in America. This tax on Social Security benefits is misguided, I believe, and only acts to penalize hard-working and productive senior members of society. As workers, these senior citizens are taxed when they earn their money, as we all know, they are taxed when the Government returns it in the form of Social Security benefits, and if they are smart enough or lucky enough to save it to give it to their children or grandchildren, they will have to pay estate taxes, or a death tax, before anyone sees a penny, in a lot of cases. 
   Not only is this essentially double taxation to some of our most vulnerable citizens, our seniors, it is harmful to many seniors. Many seniors need to work in order to pay for costly health insurance premiums, prescription drugs, and other expenses which they incur as they grow older. For these seniors, working is not a choice, it is a necessity. 
   If we eliminate the tax on Social Security benefits in America, most seniors would have more disposable income to pay for many of these necessities of life. But rather than helping them, I believe we hurt them--that is, the seniors--by taxing their Social Security benefits, lowering their standard of living, and decreasing the amount of disposable income they have available to them. 
   What many fail to recognize is, working seniors continue to contribute to the economy not only in terms of knowledge and added productivity but by paying taxes on their earnings and paying into the Social Security trust fund without ever recognizing an additional benefit. 
   Clearly, the benefits seniors provide to our economy in terms of investment, knowledge, and skills far outweigh the minimal costs to the Treasury of repealing this unjust tax on Social Security. 
   This tax on Social Security benefits implies the Federal Government thinks senior citizens have nothing to contribute in the way of effectiveness, efficiency, experience, or knowledge to the workforce. You know and I know this is not true. 
   Senior citizens are our most valuable resource. They can provide knowledge, insight, and experience to our booming economy. And they do. We should treat them fairly and allow them to continue to earn and to save without imposing a discriminatory ``old age tax'' simply because they want to continue to contribute to society. 
   Responsible seniors--who plan for their retirement, who save and invest for the future, and who strive to leave something to future generations--are finding that it is just not worth it. At a time when we are trying to encourage savings and investment, it does not make sense to continue to tax Social Security benefits. 
   I am today encouraging my colleagues to join me in supporting the Older Americans Tax Fairness Act to bring additional fairness and freedom to the lives of millions of our most respected Americans. 
   Let's repeal the tax on Social Security benefits. Let's make it like it used to be. It is the right thing for the seniors in America.

   Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the RECORD a letter dated March 10, 2000, to Senators LOTT and DASCHLE from myself and Senator BRYAN regarding S. 2089, the Counterintelligence Reform Act of 2000.

   Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise today in support of H.R. 1883, the Iran Nonproliferation Act of 1999. 
   As chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, I am in a privileged position to have access to the volumes of intelligence information gathered at great expense and  even risk of life by our intelligence community. 
   Sadly, this intelligence leads me to the conclusion that our efforts thus far to stem proliferation have failed. As the Director of Central Intelligence told me in an open Hearing before the Senate Intelligence Committee just this month:  
   Mr. Chairman, on proliferation, the picture that I drew last year has become even more stark and worrisome. Transfers of enabling technologies to countries of proliferation concern have not abated.  
   Particularly in the case of Iran, the intelligence indicates that the proliferation of missile technologies as well as the technologies and expertise to enable their development of chemical, biological, and nuclear weapons, continues unabated. 
   Our nonproliferation efforts haven't failed because we haven't tried other things. They have failed because the tools we have used thus far have not been up to the task. 
   The task is indeed formidable. 
   Iran desperately wants these weapons. We wish they didn't. We wish the problem would go away on its own. But the evidence indicates that it won't. In the unclassified version of a report submitted to me on January 21st pursuant to a mandate in the Intelligence Authorization Act of 1997--a report available to all Members--the Director of Central Intelligence stated:  
   Iran remains one of the most active countries seeking to acquire WMD [weapons of mass destruction] ..... from abroad. In doing so, Tehran is attempting to develop an indigenous capability to produce various types of weapons--nuclear, chemical, and biological--and their delivery systems.  
   With regard to missile proliferation, in his testimony to me this month, the DCI reported that:  
   Most analysts believe that Iran, following the North Korean pattern, could test an ICBM capable of delivering a light payload to the United States in the next few years.  
   And, he added, Iran could become not just a recipient, but a proliferator:  
   While Russia, China, and North Korea continue to be the main suppliers of ballistic missiles and related technology, long-standing recipients--such as Iran--might become suppliers in their own right as they develop domestic production capabilities.  
   Iran is not just seeking missiles, but also biological, chemical, and nuclear weapons. Iran is seeking dual-use technologies to further the biological warfare program it began during the Iran-Iraq war. Iran also wants to maintain a prohibited chemical weapons capability. According to the January DCI report I just mentioned, Iran, despite its commitment to give up chemical weapons under the Chemical Weapons Convention, ``has manufactured and stockpiled chemical weapons, including blister, blood, and choking agents and the bombs and artillery shells for delivering them.'' They have continued to ``seek production technology, expertise, and chemicals that could be used as precursor agents in its chemical warfare program from entities in Russia and China.'' Finally, Iran wants a nuclear weapons capability. According to the DCI: ``Iran sought nuclear-related equipment, material and technical expertise from a variety of sources, especially in Russia, during the first half of 1999.'' 
   Importantly, Iran is seeking an indigenous capability. Their pursuit of WMD and delivery systems has lead to a maturing indigenous capability. This means that the window in which we can stop significant proliferation to Iran is closing rapidly. This means that the time to intervene is now. 
   Some have suggested that the recent elections in Iran should lead us to pause our consideration of this bill. I disagree. First, to the degree that the newly elected Iranian legislators seek to constrain efforts to develop and deploy weapons of mass destruction, I believe that this legislation will strengthen such an effort. It demonstrates the seriousness with which the United States Congress views proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Second, existing evidence indicates that we cannot count on the elections to bring an end to Iran's national policy of developing weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery. It is important to underscore that former President Rafsanjani, considered a moderate in Iranian political circles, was the very leader who initiated Iran's pursuit of those weapons. Indeed it was Rafsanjani who said that ``Chemical and biological weapons are poor man's atomic bombs......'' After he became Iran's President, he is quoted as saying: ``We should fully equip ourselves in the defensive and offensive use of chemical, bacteriological and radiological weapons.'' We cannot expect that Iran will therefore give up its pursuit of these weapons on their own. This bill will provide additional incentive for them to do so, and we will watch carefully for evidence of such a decision, but at this point, absent strong policy on our part, we must conclude that the policy of acquiring these weapons and their means of delivery will continue. 
   The task of stemming proliferation to Iran is made more difficult because individuals and the nations from which they proliferate have their own strong motives for aiding Iran. For some individuals, the motive is money. But why can't we simply rely on the governments in which they operate to stop them? In some cases, governments are too week to intervene. In others, the government looks the other way or even promotes proliferation to Iran because their leaders welcome the challenge an Iran with missiles and weapons of mass destruction poses to the United States. 
   We need the tools to offset the benefits of aiding Iran. We must ensure that there are financial and other costs associated with supplying the assistance Iran still needs in its drive for weapons of mass destruction and missiles. 
   H.R. 1883 gives the United States tools to attack proliferation on the supply side. 
   The first tool is the light of exposure to scrutiny. H.R. 1883 requires the President to submit annual reports identifying every person that, on or after January 1, 1999, transfers to Iran goods, services or technology on existing control lists or items with the potential to make a material contribution to Iran's development of nuclear, biological, or chemical weapons or ballistic or cruise missile systems. As a result, the Congress, the American people, and the community of nations will know who is supporting Iran's efforts to threaten peace and stability. We will shine a light on those lining their bank accounts by selling the tools of hideous death and unimaginable destruction to Iran. The threat of public exposure should serve as a significant deterrent to those who contemplate proliferation to Iran. 
   The second tool offered by H.R. 1883 is the authorization for the President to deny perpetrators of proliferation access to some U.S. trade. I highlight the word ``authorization.'' The sanctions provided by H.R. 1883 are not mandatory and exceptions are granted. 
   These tools, properly employed, will help stem the tide of proliferation to Iran. Are there costs? Yes. Some U.S. businesses may be called upon by the President to refrain from commerce with individuals that are shown to be materially aiding Iran's weapons of mass destruction and missile programs. But such a potential cost seems reasonable to me in light of the potentially far greater cost if we fail to act--the lives of American men, women, and children. 
   I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. 1883 in a bipartisan way, as our House colleagues did when they voted to pass H.R. 1883 by a vote of 419-zero.

    Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the work of the Cullman County Commission in Cullman County, Alabama, for its positive work in the community. I specifically want to pay tribute to Mr. George Spear, the Commission Chairman, as an individual who exemplifies the positive impact a public official can have on a community. Through his direct efforts, Mr. Spear has established the Cullman 2000 Committee, a year-long celebration bringing together both young and old in the area to honor the county's unique heritage and shared future. 
   Founded in 1873 by Col. John G. Cullmann, the county's roots are firmly entrenched in Alabama history. Cullman County is well known for its industry, modern health care, and agriculture production, which ranks at the top of the state. The many events planned throughout the year are designed to celebrate the county's history and successes and to give residents a sense of pride in their community and the common bond they share as members of the county. It will give all residents of Cullman County a sense of their place in county history. 
   I commend the Cullman County Commission and particularly Mr. Spear for his hard work and sense of civic pride. Without the efforts of the Commission, the Cullman 2000 Committee would not have been possible. As Cullman County looks toward the future, it is reassuring to know that the leaders of the county are keeping in mind the importance of the county's colorful past.

   Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise today to ask that my colleagues support the conference report on the Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2000. 
   I want to thank my colleagues in the House for their work on this legislation and especially Chairman GOSS and Ranking Member DIXON for their leadership in the conference. 
   I believe that the conference committee put together a solid package for consideration by the full Senate that fairly represents the intelligence priorities set forth in both the Senate and House versions of the Intelligence Authorization Act. 
   I am pleased to report that the conference committee accomplished its task in a bipartisan manner, and I want to thank my colleague from Nebraska, Senator KERREY, for working so closely with me to produce this legislation. 
   I believe that the conference report embraces many of the key recommendations that the Senate adopted in its version of the bill. 
   We recommended significant increases in funding for high-priority projects aimed at better positioning the Intelligence Community for the threats of the 21st century, while at the same time reducing funds for programs and activities that were not adequately justified or redundant. 
   In so doing, we authorized a moderate increase in overall funding for intelligence programs above the President's request. This is a positive step and I hope that next year the administration will follow our lead and begin to reinvest in our intelligence gathering capabilities. 
   The conference report includes key initiatives that I believe are vital for the future of our Intelligence Community. 
   These initiatives include: 
   1. bolstering advanced research and development across the Community, to facilitate, among other things, the modernization of NSA and CIA;  
   2. strengthening efforts in counter-proliferation, counter-terrorism, counter-narcotics, counter-intelligence, and effective covert action; 
   3. expanding the collection and exploitation of measurements and signatures intelligence, especially ballistic missile intelligence; 
   4. boosting education, recruiting, and technical training for Intelligence Community personnel; 
   5. enhancing analytical capabilities; 
   6. streamlining dissemination of intelligence products; 
   7. developing our ability to process, exploit and disseminate commercial imagery; and 
   8. providing new tools for information operations. 
   I believe that the conferees have provided the funds and guidance necessary to ensure that military commanders and national policymakers continue to receive timely, accurate information on threats to our security. 
   At the same time, we have found some critical areas within the Community that are in need of major improvements. 
   In the Senate, we had a distinguished panel of Americans with a broad range of expertise--our Technical Advisory Group--that took a look at some key areas within the Intelligence Community and brought forward some very important recommendations. 
   We thank all the members of the Technical Advisory Group for their time and efforts. 
   I will briefly summarize some of their findings, to the extent that I can in open session, along with some of the other findings of our conference. 
   First, our ability to collect and analyze information on the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction requires renewed emphasis and innovative thinking. 
   As our potential enemies seek out the ability to produce chemical, biological, and nuclear weapons, we must develop the ability to detect these efforts. 
   This bill places a great deal of emphasis on our ability to collect such information known as Measurements and Signatures Intelligence or MASINT. 
   Second, both the House and Senate Intelligence Committees agree that our Intelligence Community and our Defense Department must move quickly to address what our Technical Advisory Group identifies as a critical shortfall in our ability to properly task, process, exploit, and disseminate intelligence information collection by our airborne and overhead imagery assets. 
   As we modernize our Imagery Intelligence or IMINT architecture, the Intelligence and Armed Services Committees agree that we should not be spending the taxpayers money on collection architectures that we may not be able to utilize fully. 
   Third, we have once again placed strong emphasis on recapitalizing the National Security Agency's information technology infrastructure. 
   As we demand more from our Intelligence Community in a number of areas, we also demand fiscal responsibility. The conference report includes a number of reductions to programs that were not adequately justified or were redundant with other elements within the Intelligence Community. 
   The legislation contains some important new authorities for the Intelligence Community. I'll mention some of the highlights: 
   First, there are new protections for the identities of former covert agents and for the operational files of the National Imagery and Mapping Agency or ``NIMA.'' 
   Second, there are new counterintelligence authorities--these include provisions allowing access to government computers used in classified work by executive branch employees. Also, there are new requirements for the FBI to begin its consultation with agencies that they are investigating at a far earlier stage than before. 
   Third, we have established a commission to study the role and missions of the National Reconnaissance Office or ``NRO.'' This commission will look at the NRO from top to bottom--its findings and recommendations to us and the Senate Armed Services Committee will serve to guide our committees on the future funding and operations of the NRO. 
   I look forward to working with the chairman and ranking member of the Senate Armed Services Committee to ensure that the best candidates are selected for membership on this very important commission. 
   If any Member of the Senate wishes to review the classified portions of the bill, they are available off the Senate floor. 
   Finally, Mr. President, there is a significant piece of legislation in this bill that is intended to go after foreign international drug traffickers and those that support their illicit activities. 
   Title eight of this bill, the so-called ``Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act,'' is modeled after the Executive Order that targets the assets of named Colombian traffickers and those that assist them in their trafficking activities. 
   Mr. President, I support strongly efforts to target and destroy significant foreign drug trafficking organizations. I have placed significant emphasis on counter-narcotics in this and every Intelligence Authorization bill since I became Chairman of this Committee. The record is clear. 
   The existing Colombian program has been highly successful. I would be the first to support the President if he chose to expand the program in a thoughtful and measured way. In fact, the Chief Executive already has the constitutional and statutory authority to do so. The President does not need this legislation to expand the scope of this program. 
   Accordingly, Mr. President, I, along with other Members of Congress, have expressed concern with this legislation because it may have some very serious unintended consequences for innocent American citizens. 
   Although the express language of the ``Kingpin'' legislation deals exclusively with foreign persons and entities, it will affect American citizens. Lurking within the seemingly innocuous language is the real possibility of unwitting and innocent American citizens being caught up in its global net. For example, an American business owner may be a joint venture partner with a foreign company that has been designated as ``supporting'' the activities of a foreign narcotics trafficker. Although the American person may be completely unaware of the illicit activities of their foreign partner, their own assets will also be blocked if they are jointly held. 
   The ``Kingpin'' legislation does not provide an opportunity for an American person to seek judicial review of the blocking of their jointly held assets. The result is that Americans may be deprived of their property without due process of law. Let me repeat that, Mr. President, Americans may be deprived of their property without due process of law. 
   Mr. President, I strongly support the expansion of this successful program. I do not, however, support depriving innocent Americans of their fundamental right to due process. 
   Many attempts were made to amend the ``Kingpin'' legislation in conference to make it clear that American citizens have an immediate avenue into Federal District Court should they be snared unjustifiably in this trap. Unfortunately, the sponsors and proponents of this bill in the House and Senate opposed any effort to clarify this fundamental American right. In fact, I have been told that if we were to expressly state that a United States citizen has the right to immediate judicial review, this would, quote, gut the bill, unquote. I disagree. 
   Thomas Jefferson said that our ``Bill of Rights is what the people are entitled to against any government on earth.......and what no just government should refuse, or rest on inference.'' Mr. President, I also believe that our right to due process should not ``rest on inference,'' but rather we should state it clearly and without equivocation. We do not do that in this bill. 
   Mr. President, I fear that in our earnest to pass a ``tough drug bill'' we may have sacrificed part of our freedom. I applaud the sponsors and proponents of this bill for their dedication to protecting our shores from the scourge of illegal drugs. I caution them, however, that their enthusiasm may be dampened as the true implications of this legislation become known. 
   Notwithstanding my concerns, I am encouraged that the conferees did agree to include a provision in the so-called ``Kingpin'' legislation that creates a panel to study whether these  kinds of sanction regimes affect U.S. persons doing legitimate business with foreign partners, and whether there are adequate and fair remedies for honest U.S. persons. 
   I commend my colleague from Nebraska, Senator KERREY, for suggesting this study and also for other areas of leadership on which I have worked with the Senator during my tenure on the Intelligence Committee. He will be leaving the Intelligence Committee at the end of this year whenever his term is up, and we will miss him because he has certainly been a friend, but he has also been a leader to put America's national security first and foremost everywhere it comes up. 
   In my opinion, we have put the cart squarely before the horse dealing with due process. I am confident that such a panel as I alluded to earlier will confirm my concerns and the concerns of others and make substantive recommendations that my well-meaning colleagues will ultimately acknowledge and I hope will be able to accept. 
   The conference committee worked closely together in a bipartisan fashion to produce the comprehensive intelligence authorization act. I urge my colleagues to support its adoption.

As he knows, I have worked steadily with him over the past several years to address his well-founded concerns with respect to the way the POW/MIA issue has been addressed by our Intelligence Community. I agree that the provision to which he refers would help us with our oversight responsibilities. That is why I supported his amendment, as did my Vice-Chairman, when our intelligence bill passed the full Senate earlier this year. I want the Senator to know that I will work closely with him over the next few months to find a way to get the listing of POW/MIA reports he seeks provided to the Senate. He has a right to review these reports, as does every Member of the Senate. I would urge the Director of Central Intelligence and heads of each of our intelligence agencies to work cooperatively with the Select Committee on Intelligence on this matter. I also want the Senator to know that I will include his provision in next year's authorization measure if the information he seeks is not provided to the Senate in the next few months. I thank him for his leadership on this important matter.

   Mr. SHELBY. I am concerned with section 1134 which requires the DCI to provide certain information, including information contained in special access programs, to the chairman and ranking member of the Foreign Relations Committees. I note that this language on special access programs was added after the bill was passed by the Senate. I wish to clarify that the legislative intent of this provision does not wish to clarify that the legislative intent of this provision does not include expanded information relating to intelligence operational activities or sensitive sources and methods. 
   I ask for the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee's clarification regarding the companion section in the State Department Authorization bill, section 1131. Am I correct in understanding that this provision does not levy the same requirement upon the Director of Central Intelligence that is required of the Secretaries of Defense, State, and Commerce?

   Mr. SHELBY. 
   Mr. President, I rise today to offer the ``Consumer's Right to Financial Privacy Act'' for myself and Senator BRYAN. This bill would address the significant deficiencies in the Financial Services Modernization Act passed by this very body last week. 
   Our bill would provide that consumers have (1) notice of the categories  of nonpublic personal information that institutions collect, as well as the practices and policies of that institution with respect to disclosing nonpublic information; (2) access to the nonpublic personal information collected and shared; (3) affirmative consent, that is that the financial institution must receive the affirmative consent of the consumer, also referred to as an opt-in, in order to share such information with third parties and affiliates. Lastly, my provision would require that this federal law not preempt stronger state privacy laws. This bill is drafted largely after the amendment Senator BRYAN and I offered in the Conference on Financial Services Modernization, but failed to get adopted due to the Conference's rush to pass a financial modernization bill, no matter what the cost. 
   I know some think that opt-in is extreme, but I have to tell you that is what the American people want. Over the past year I have learned a great deal about the activities of institutions sharing sensitive personal information. Many may not be aware, but it had become a common practice for state department of motor vehicles to sell the drivers license information, including name, height, weight, social security number, vehicle identification number, motor vehicle record and more. Some states even sold the digital photo image of each driver's license. 
   I was not aware of this practice going on. When I learned about it and studied it a little closer, I found several groups who were outraged by this practice. One such group was Eagle Forum. Another such group was the ACLU. Still another group was the Free Congress Foundation. Before I knew it, there was an ad hoc coalition of groups not only supporting the issue of driver's license privacy, but demanding it. 
   Thanks to the hard work of these groups, I was able to include an opt-in provision for people applying for drivers licenses at their state department of motor vehicles. That provision sailed through the Senate and then the House. That bill was signed into law by President Clinton. Despite significant lobbying by the direct marketing industry, not one member of the House or Senate took to the floor and said, ``I believe we should not allow consumers to choose whether or not their drivers license information, including their picture, should be sold or traded 
   away like an old suit.'' No, no one objected to the opt-in. As a result, I believe very strongly that Congress has already set the bar on this issue. Opt-in is not just reasonable, it is the right thing to do. 
   Meanwhile, the ad hoc coalition, which is continuing to grow and includes every ideology from conservative to liberal, has signed on to four basic principles with regard to financial privacy. The principles include notice, access and consent, but also a requirement that weak federal laws not preempt stronger state laws. Our amendment incorporates those four basic principles. 
   Now my basic question is this, why would anyone oppose this bill? Only if you believe the financial services industry cannot make money by doing business above the table and on the level for everyone to see in the ``sunshine'' if you will. If you believe that financial institutions make money only by deceiving their customers or leaving those customers in the dark, then maybe you should oppose this bill. I do not subscribe to such a belief. 
   Industry will tell you that if they are required to include an opt-in, consumers will not, and therefore business will shut down. What does that tell you that consumers won't choose to opt-in? It means people don't want their information shared. If that is such a problem, it seems to me the business would spend more time educating the consumer as to the benefits of information sharing. That is where the burden to convince the consumer to buy the product should be--on the business. 
   During the financial modernization debate, the financial industry, along with Citigroup communicated to Congress that they would not be able to operate or function appropriately with an opt-in requirement. I find that very difficult to comprehend, seeing as Citibank signed an agreement with their German affiliates in 1995 affording German citizens the opportunity to tell Citibank ``no,'' they did not want their personal data shared with third parties. I have a copy of the contract to prove it. 
   Entitled, Agreement on ``Interterritorial Data Protection'' one can see this is an agreement on the sharing of customer information between Citibank (South Dakota), referred in the document as CNA, and its German affiliates. On page two paragraph 4, entitled, Use of Subcontractors, Transmission of Data to Third Parties, number 2 reads:  
   For marketing purposes, the transfer of personal data to third parties provided by the Card Service Companies (that is Citicorp of Germany and Citicorp Card Operations of Germany) is prohibited, except in those cases where such personal data is transferred to affiliated companies engaged in banking business in order to market financial services; the transfer of such data beyond the aforementioned scope to third parties, shall require the Card Service Companies' express approval. Such approval is limited to the scope of the Card Customers' consent as obtained on the application form.  
   That ladies and gentlemen, is an opt-in to operate in Germany, by none other than Citigroup, the number one proponent of financial modernization. Now if they can offer financial privacy to individuals in Germany, why on God's green earth can't they agree to an opt-in here in America? Do Germans have special rights over Americans? I should hope not. 
   Mr. President, simply put, this bill is what Americans want. This bill is workable as proven in the Citicorp agreement. The truth is that the American people do not understand the intricacies of banking law or securities regulation. They probably do not know or care much about affiliates or operating subsidiaries. What I do know, is that if you walked outside and polled people from New York City to Los Angeles, CA, and everywhere in between, they would not only understand financial privacy, 90 percent of them would demand financial privacy and the ability to tell an institution ``no.'' 
   Mr. President, in passing the financial modernization bill, Congress gave mammoth financial services companies significant expanded powers and unprecedented ability to collect, share, buy and sell a consumers nonpublic personal financial information. During the debate, many members promised they would address privacy, but only in a separate bill at a later time. Well, Mr. President, the time is now and the bill is the ``Consumer's Right to Financial Privacy Act.'' 
   The financial industry may have won the battle by keeping stronger financial privacy provisions out of the financial modernization bill. But I assure you they have not won the war. They cannot win the war on financial privacy because the American people just won't allow it.

   Mr. President, I rise to voice my stringent objection to the conference report of the financial services modernization bill. While I believe we need to modernize the laws that govern this country's financial system, I do not believe we should do so at any price. 
   My colleagues in the Senate should know this legislation comes with a very high price to the American people. In my judgment, the price is simply too high. Let me explain. 
   First of all, I want to say that there are some very good things in this bill, not the least of which is the repeal of two sections of the Depression-era Glass-Steagall Act which allow banks, securities firms, and insurance companies to affiliate. Congress has worked on this for many years. 
   Under Senator GRAMM's leadership as chairman of our Committee on Banking, this much-needed change will soon become reality. I think that is very positive in this bill. 
   That being said, I think it should be perfectly clear that there remains Depression-era laws on the books, and I hope Chairman GRAMM would be interested in working with others on the Banking Committee to repeal those laws as well. 
   In particular, I am referring to the 1930s price control on business checking accounts. To the extent that we are modernizing this country's financial laws, one would think we would eliminate this price control and allow small businesses across this country to receive interest on their checking accounts and enjoy the full benefits of financial modernization. 
   Let me talk just a few minutes on CRA expansion. 
   I also feel compelled to set the record straight on the floor this afternoon on the Community Reinvestment Act provisions in this bill. Make no mistake about it. This bill expands--yes, Mr. President, expands--the Community Reinvestment Act. I know a great deal about this because I, along with Senator GRAMM, killed this very bill last year because we were both opposed to the dramatic expansion of CRA in the bill at that time. 
   I don't understand what is different this year. I don't understand why no one is willing to stand up and oppose the expansion of CRA when it is very clear that this bill does, indeed, expand CRA. Why else would the administration support the bill? Why else would Rev. Jesse Jackson support the bill? We all know why. The bill expands CRA. 
   On page 15 of the bill, my colleagues will see a provision entitled ``CRA Requirement.'' This provision says that ``the appropriate Federal banking agency shall prohibit a financial holding company, or any insured depository institution from'' commencing any new activity or directly or indirectly acquiring control of a company engaged in any new activity, if the institution has a less than satisfactory CRA record on its most recent exam. 
   That is a very crucial ``maintenance'' requirement, as we call it in this bill. 
   Last year, the legislation gave the regulators the discretion to impose restrictions for falling out of compliance with CRA. This year, we have inserted a statutory prohibition of conducting new activities. 
   If the institution that was CRA-compliant when elected to become a financial holding company then chooses to engage in a new activity, the regulator could then use the enforcement authority in section 8 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act to impose civil money penalties on bank directors and officers. I am opposed to the maintenance requirement today just as much as I was opposed to the maintenance requirement last year. My position has not changed. 
   This expansion does not exist in current law today. If you have a certain bank charter, you can conduct all activities permissible to that charter whether you have a CRA-satisfactory record or not. 
   I believe we are making a grave mistake by expanding CRA. I am extremely disappointed because I know we have reached the point of no return. As conservatives, we will have no legs to stand on if and when we try to revisit this issue. My friends, we are, indeed, paying a very high price for this legislation. 
   Privacy is very important to all Americans. I pose a question to my colleagues: Does anyone know what issue brings together the American Civil Liberties Union, Consumers Union, and Ralph Nader of Public Citizen to Phyllis Schlafly of Eagle Forum and the Free Congress Foundation? It is the bill before the Senate, the financial privacy provisions. All of these groups have formed an unprecedented coalition to oppose this bill simply based on the lack of privacy protections. That is the price the American people are going to pay--their privacy--if we pass this bill for only a few large financial conglomerates. 
   In an article entitled ``Banks Sell Your Secrets,'' USA Today reported:  
   Consumers across the USA have been shocked and upset to learn banks have been selling their private financial data, from account balances to Social Security numbers.  
   Phyllis Schlafly of the Eagle Forum is quoted:  
   The checks you write and receive, the invoices you pay and the investments you make reveal as much about you as a personal diary, but instead of banks keeping your information under lock and key, it is being collected, repackaged and sold.  
   In September of this year, the Los Angeles Times reported that Charter Pacific Bank of San Fernando Valley, CA, sold 3.7 million credit card numbers to a felon who then allegedly ran up over $45 million worth of charges to the cardholders. It appears the felon also billed customers for access to X-rated web sites the customers never knew about. How do these people explain that to their families, their neighbors, or their church members?  
   The USA Today also ran an article on October 28, 1999, entitled ``Congress Passes Up Chance to Protect Your Financial Privacy.'' Reporting on this specific bill before the Senate today, the article read:  
   Technology already has made it far easier for disparate firms to collect, share and sell warehouses of sensitive data on individuals. And the banking bill would encourage banks, insurance companies, and investment firms to link arms, making data swapping from a wide range of sources much easier.  
   That, my friends, is the point. We are about to pass this afternoon a financial modernization bill that represents industry interests in a big way. However, we have forgotten the interests of the most crucial market participant of all in America--the consumer, the American citizen. Under this bill, the consumer has little, if any, ability to protect the transfer of his or her personal nonpublic financial information. Indeed, the so-called privacy protections in this bill are a far cry from the protection we give taxpayers on their tax returns. It is against the law for an unauthorized inspection or disclosure of an individual's tax return. Violation of this law is punishable by fines, imprisonment, or both. The Internal Revenue Code even prescribes civil damages for the unauthorized inspection or disclosure and the notification to the taxpayer if an unauthorized inspection or disclosure has occurred. 
   I can assure Members these large financial conglomerates 
   will have more information on citizens than the IRS, but we have done virtually nothing to protect the sharing of such nonpublic personal financial information for the American people. 
   Proponents of financial modernization will say the bill includes the strongest privacy provisions ever enacted by Congress. While that sounds great, the reality is the provisions are porous and do not provide the consumer with sufficient information to make an informed decision or the true ability to opt out of information sharing. 
   First, the opt-out requirement does not apply to affiliate sharing. This is significant because the bill allows financial holding companies to affiliate with entities engaged in activities that are ``complementary,'' to financial activities, as well as grandfather commercial companies and those acquired from merchant banking. 
   As a result, the holding company can share a wealth of nonpublic personal financial information with affiliated telemarketers selling nonfinancial products such as travel services, dental plans, and so forth. Should an insurance company be allowed to affiliate with a grocery store chain in order to track an individual's diet? Nothing in this bill prohibits this relationship or sharing of that information. 
   Second, the bill includes an exception to the porous opt-out provision that allows two or more financial institutions to share their customers' nonpublic personal information with telemarketers to market financial products or services offered under a so-called joint agreement. 
   While the financial institution must notify its customers about the sharing of that information, it does not have to provide customers with the ability to opt out of such information sharing. Furthermore, under the joint agreement provision, the nonaffiliated third party could then share the nonpublic personal information with its own affiliate. As a result, the opt-out provision provides no privacy protection at all. 
   For example, a financial institution could endorse a for-profit investment tip sheet service or stock day trading service targeting senior citizens. The financial institution could share confidential information with that tip sheet service or day trading service without affording the customer the right to opt out of it. To be more specific, the institution can give the tip sheet or day trading service a list of wealthy senior citizens or, in the case of an insurance company, a list of recent widows or widowers who recently received a large insurance payment. Is this really what the Senate wants to encourage and endorse? I hope not. 
   The bill also allegedly includes an all-out prohibition against the sharing of customer account number information for marketing purposes. What about sharing account numbers for the purposes of verifying customers' credit card accounts? The bill allows that. It is a way to get around it. Charter Pacific Bank in California claims they sell customer data files to merchants for data verification purposes, not marketing purposes. Therefore, the privacy provisions in the bill allow Charter Pacific to sell the customer account information to anyone, much less a felon, all over again. 
   As if that were not enough, all of a sudden new language has appeared in the conference report telling the regulators to allow for the transfer of personal account numbers to nonaffiliated third party telemarketers if the information is encrypted. Nothing in this bill says financial institutions are prohibited from giving the third party the key to unlock the encrypted information. In fact, that is common practice. This exception completely eviscerates the prohibition of third party telemarketers in the bill. This means U.S. Bancorp in Minnesota could sell the account numbers to MemberWorks all over again. This bill would not prevent it. 
   I believe these privacy provisions are a sham. I have said it before. They are a joke on the American people, and I will not sit by and be a party to this. When the American people, and they will, become aware of what Congress has done, it will be too late. This bill lets the genie out of the bottle. I am sure, as soon as this bill passes, if not before, a lot of people will be running for cover and introducing privacy bills. I bet President Clinton will set up a Presidential commission or something such as that, or a study group, to study the issue. That sounds nice. Too bad the President is not willing to make financial privacy a priority when it really matters, right here and right now, when we are giving financial institutions the unprecedented ability to collect, profile, share, and sell personal nonpublic financial information. 
   Critics claim that requiring a consumer to provide his affirmative consent before sharing information would be a hindrance to the free flow of information and basically unworkable. If this is the case, why did Citibank agree to an opt-in requirement for nonaffiliated third parties to do business in Germany? You heard me right. The biggest and most vocal proponent of this bill signed an agreement with its German affiliates in 1995 that basically required Citibank to obtain consent on the application form before they could share personal data to third parties. Citibank agreed to give Germans more privacy protections than we are giving our own citizens in the United States today. 
   Does that bother anybody else in this Chamber besides me? It should. I think this is a tragedy. I think it is absurd. The banking industry has told us they would oppose this bill if we simply give the consumer the ability to object to the sharing of nonpublic personal information. First of all, I think it is hypocritical of them to threaten us with that position, seeing as how Citigroup voluntarily agreed to provide consumers the ability to opt out in Germany. 
   Second, I believe Congress should not be dictated to by the financial industry or any other industry as to what provisions we put in on behalf of the American consumer. They should not write laws, ever. But Congress should. 
   I have heard many Members talk about empowerment and how we must empower the individual. We spend a lot of time discussing empowerment zones. Why are we ignoring the empowerment principle on this piece of legislation? Why is Congress going to take a walk on this issue? Why is Congress not going to stand up for the American people and assure them the ability to stop a financial institution from profiling individuals based on their most personal behavioral patterns and then selling that information at will? The American people clearly believe this is too high a price to pay for this bill. If we are going to allow the huge financial conglomerates to affiliate to provide services--and we are--why must we also give them the ability to sell, profit, and exploit an individual's personal nonpublic profile? 
   This is not a partisan issue. It does not matter if you are a Democrat or Republican, conservative, liberal, rich or poor. An individual's financial matters are very private to that individual. Families will not discuss how much money other family members make at the dinner table. It is too private. It is  too sensitive. They do not talk about it because they do not want to talk about it and they are in control of what information they share, even with their loved ones. 
   The bitter irony is that while the individual is practicing discretion in America, Congress is belligerently aiding and abetting complete strangers in accessing an individual's most private financial matters, including account balances, where they shop, and what they buy. We are aiding and abetting the felon in California who bought a list of account numbers and charged up to $45 million. We are aiding and abetting third party marketers such as MemberWorks, who bought a list from a bank and then automatically billed individuals' accounts. 
   I have said it before and I will say it again here, we are paying a very high price, a very dear price for this bill. The American people are paying a very dear price for this bill, and they will continue to pay it. It is very difficult for me this afternoon to celebrate this landmark achievement of financial modernization when I know we did so at the expense of every American. 
   I know this bill will pass with a lot of votes, but I urge my colleagues to vote against this bill mainly because of the lack of privacy provisions. Ask your mother, your father, your husband, or your wife about this. They will all tell you that one-stop shopping is not worth giving up their financial privacy. The price is too high--too high. 
   I yield the floor. 
   Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I join my colleagues today in mourning the loss of our colleague, John Chafee. John was a good and honorable man who served his state and his country with distinction. A devoted public servant and member of this body for 23 years, Senator Chafee's influence extended beyond the aisles and transcended partisan rhetoric. His accomplishments as a lawmaker and his unquestionable influence among his peers stand as a testament to his ability. 
   Senator Chafee will long be admired and remembered for his devotion to this country both as a soldier and public servant. His distinguished service in the military, including serving in the Marines at Guadalcanal and commanding a rifle company in Korea, were indicative of the man who would never shy away from duty or responsibility. 
   His record as a legislator, governor, and senator in Rhode Island indicate the amount of trust the people of Rhode Island put in John. 
   Although political views may vary from person to person, it is easy to put these differences aside and to recognize men of strong character and integrity. These are qualities which were abundant in John, and his steadying influence in the United States Senate will be truly missed. 
   My thoughts and prayers extend to his family and all those whose lives Senator Chafee touched.

    Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Jimmy E. Alexander, a prominent and respected lawyer from Athens, Limestone County, in northern Alabama. Mr. Alexander passed away last month after a long and distinguished career in law practice. His deep passion for his work took him on a journey from the smallest courtrooms in Alabama, to the great and hallowed halls of the U.S. Supreme Court. His dedication and heartfelt concern for the ``little guy'' was an inspiration. Jimmy will be missed by the many people whose lives he touched and affected. 
   Jimmy was born in Bear Creek, in Marion County, in 1939. After graduation from Russellville High School in 1957, Jimmy went on to continue his education at the University of Alabama, receiving his undergraduate degree in 1960, and his law degree in 1963. Jimmy's innate industriousness and work ethic were tailor-made for his chosen profession. Jimmy quickly developed a reputation as an outstanding criminal defense attorney and successful domestic relations lawyer. Joining the firm of Malone, Malone and Steel directly out of law school, he soon was made partner and ultimately became senior partner of the firm Alexander, Corder, Plunk, Baker, Shelly, and Shipman P.C., in Athens, AL. Jimmy was the city attorney for Athens and Ardmore for 17 years. He served on the city Board of Education for 5 years and was the Alabama Bar Association Commissioner for the 39th judicial circuit for 4 years. 
   It was through these professional forums that Jimmy was able to thrive in his work and gain a statewide reputation as a standout trial attorney. In private practice for 36 years, Jimmy has counseled businesses, commercial clients, and recently, had taken a strong interest in championing the cause of the ``little guy.'' Particularly for the last 15 years, he focused on representing the poor, under represented, physically injured, and financially cheated, many of whom had no where else to turn than Jimmy Alexander. Jimmy developed a particular fondness for taking on big business, insurance companies, and large industry. He represented many high profile cases, and in 1989, won the largest monetary judgment at the time in Limestone County and in another case, setting a precedent for the largest monetary judgement in the entire State of Alabama. His gifted ability even took him before the U.S. Supreme Court, where he argued a case against an insurance company. 
   Jimmy Alexander will be remembered as a dedicated attorney, who brought human compassion to his work. Many of his colleagues have expressed their respect and admiration for his approach to both his work and his life, and I join them in their prayers for him and his family. My thoughts and wishes extend to his wife Rose, and two children, Tonya and Eric, during this difficult time. Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the Resolution of Advice and Consent to the Ratification of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. 
   Last Thursday, I testified before the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, in my capacity as chairman of the Select Committee on Intelligence, to present my views on the ability of the Intelligence Community to monitor compliance with the CTBT. Today, I would like to make certain general observations, in addition to addressing issues involving CTBT monitoring and verification. By the way: monitoring and verification are different. Monitoring is objective. Verification is subjective; it involves determining the significance of information obtained through monitoring. 
   First, as a general matter, I believe that the treaty will serve as a stalking horse for denuclearization. I do not accuse all of the treaty's supporters of seeking that goal. Yet, a test ban agreement whose first operative sentence appears on its face to outlaw the explosion of nuclear weapons, even in a war of self-defense, surely raises profound questions about the long-term viability of any nuclear deterrent. 
   I fear that the treaty will both undermine and delegitimize our nuclear deterrent. When I say ``undermine,'' I refer to the effect of ratification of, and adherence to, this treaty on the weapons in our nuclear stockpile. 
   Senators KYL, WARNER, and others have ably addressed this issue in the course of the debate. I will not belabor it further, other than to cite, as others have, the conclusion of former Secretaries of Defense Rumsfeld, Cheney, Schlesinger, Weinberger, Laird, and Carlucci. These highly regarded public servants have determined that ``over the decades ahead, confidence in the reliability of our nuclear weapons stockpile would inevitably decline, thereby reducing the credibility of America's nuclear deterrent.'' This alone is reason for the Senate to withhold its advice and consent to the treaty. 
   With respect to delegitimizing our nuclear deterrent, Article I of the treaty prohibits ``any nuclear weapon test explosion or any other nuclear explosion.'' I understand that the U.S. Government does not view that prohibition as applying to the use of nuclear weapons. 
   The President's 1997 transmittal message to the Senate included an article-by-article analysis of the treaty. This analysis explains that the U.S. position in the negotiations was that ``undertakings relating to the use of nuclear weapons were totally beyond the scope'' of the CTBT. The analysis does not make clear whether all other signatories agreed with the U.S. view or whether they acquiesced in it or did something else. It is unfortunate that the CTBT text does not incorporate the U.S. understanding. We are asked to give our advice and consent to that text and only that text. 
   Article 15 of the treaty bars reservations, even one clarifying the meaning of Article I. Because the U.S. understanding of the scope of the prohibition on other nuclear explosions cannot be incorporated in a reservation to the treaty, the U.S. position may be subject to challenge as a matter of law. After all, one normally looks at negotiating history only if the treaty text is unclear. I hope the administration will address this issue to my satisfaction. 
   In the meantime, along with many other concerns about this treaty, I question the wisdom of negotiating an agreement that relegates our right of self-defense to the fine print. 
   I would also draw the attention of Senators to the language of the preamble to the CTBT. The administration points to the preamble for support for its narrow reading of the open-ended language of Article I. The administration notes, correctly, that the preamble does not refer to the ``use'' of nuclear weapons. In the administration's view, the treaty therefore cannot be read to apply to the use of nuclear weapons. Yet, a close reading of the preamble raises more questions than it answers over the ultimate purpose of the CTBT. I hope everybody shares my abhorrence of nuclear weapons. But merely wishing to put the nuclear genie back in the bottle will not accomplish that goal. 
   The one certainty about the CTBT is that, if ratified, the United States will obey it to the letter. Other countries' record of deception and denial with respect to nuclear testing is such that we cannot have the same confidence. And, in the world of the blind, the one-eyed is king. 
   I have supported well-negotiated, well-considered reductions in our nuclear forces. But it is a fact that the American nuclear deterrent has served our Nation well and has served the world well. The United States, under Democratic and Republican administrations, backed by a strong and credible nuclear deterrent, faced down the Soviet threat and served as a force for peace and stability around the world. 
   Therefore, Mr. President, I would not start down this path. Even if the Senate approved the CTBT today, it would be years before the treaty took effect. And by then, decisions would have been made affecting the future of our nuclear deterrent that may be irrevocable. 
   The second reason I intend to vote against advice and consent is that I am convinced that the treaty cannot achieve the goals its proponents have described: to prevent the nuclear powers from developing new nuclear weapons and to stop the proliferation of nuclear weapons. 
   While I cannot go into classified details, as my colleagues are aware, the Washington Post recently reported that Russia continues to conduct what may be low-yield nuclear tests at its Arctic test site. Russia reportedly is undertaking this action in order to develop a new low-yield weapon that will be the linchpin of a new military doctrine. These Russian activities are of particular concern. There is evidence, including public statements from the Russian First Deputy Minister of Atomic Energy, Viktor Mikhailov, that Russia intends to continue to conduct low-yield hydro-nuclear tests--that is, nuclear tests--and does not believe that these are prohibited by the treaty. 
   With respect to proliferation, Acting Undersecretary of State John Holum has stated that, with the CTBT in effect, it will be ``very difficult for new countries to develop nuclear weapons.'' Yet, Director of Central Intelligence George Tenet has stated that ``[n]uclear testing is not required for the acquisition of a basic nuclear weapons capability ..... [and] is not critical for a first-generation weapon.'' North Korea, Iraq, and Iran are seeking this kind of weapon. 
   Third, it is my considered judgment, as Chairman of the Intelligence Committee, that it is impossible to monitor compliance with this treaty with the confidence that the Senate should demand--I repeat, demand--before providing its advice and consent to ratification. 
   Simply put, I am not confident that we can now, or, in the foreseeable future will be able to, detect any and all nuclear explosions prohibited under the treaty. 
   I have a great degree of confidence in our ability to monitor higher yield explosions at known test sites. I have markedly less confidence in our capabilities to monitor lower yield and/or evasively conducted tests, including tests that may enable states to develop new nuclear weapons or improve existing weapons. 
   I should also repeat in this context North Korea, Iran, and Iraq can develop and deploy nuclear weapons without any nuclear tests at all. 
   With respect to monitoring, in July 1997, the intelligence community issued a National Intelligence Estimate entitled ``Monitoring the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty Over the Next 10 years.'' While I cannot go into classified details, I can say that the  NIE was not encouraging about our ability to monitor compliance with the treaty--nor about the likely utility of the treaty in preventing countries like North Korea, Iran, and Iraq from developing and fielding nuclear weapons. 
   The NIE identified numerous challenges, difficulties, and credible evasion scenarios that affect the intelligence community's confidence in its ability to monitor compliance. 
   Because the details are classified, and because of the inherent difficulty of summarizing a highly technical analysis covering a number of different countries and a multitude of variables, I recommend that Members review this document with the following caution: I believe that newly acquired information and other developments require a reevaluation of the 1997 estimate's assumptions and underlying analysis on certain key issues. I believe such a new analysis will increase concern about monitoring the CTBT. A preliminary summary of the Intelligence community's revised judgment was provided to the committee late last Friday. This document, along with the NIE and the transcript from last week's hearing is available to Members in S-407. 
   Proponents of the treaty argue, in essence, that we will miss no test of strategic significance. Despite the U.S. inability to monitor compliance at any test level, proponents place their faith in multilateral monitoring aids provided under the treaty: the International Monitoring System, a multinational seismic, infra-sound, hydro-acoustic, and radio-nucleide detection system; and the CTBT's on-site inspection regime. 
   Based on a review of the structure, likely capabilities, and procedures of these multilateral mechanisms, which will not be operational for a number of years, and based on the intelligence community's own analysis, I believe that these mechanisms will be of little value. For example, the IMS will be technically inadequate to monitor the most likely forms of noncompliance. 
   The IMS seismic system was not designed to detect ``evasively'' conducted tests. These are precisely the kind of tests Iraq or North Korea are likely to conduct. 
   In addition, the IMS suffers from having been designed with diplomatic sensitivities rather than effective monitoring in mind. Under the so-called ``non-discriminatory'' framework, no country will be singled out for attention. All countries--Iraq and Ireland, North Korea and Norway--will receive the same level of verification. 
   Lastly, it will be 8 to 10 years before the system is complete. 
   Because of these shortcomings, and for other technical reasons, I am afraid that the IMS is likely to muddy the waters by injecting questionable data into what will inevitably be highly charged debates over possible violations. 
   With respect to OSI, I believe that the onsite inspection regime invites delay and deception. For example, U.S. negotiators originally sought an ``automatic green light'' for on-site inspections. Yet, because of the opposition of the People's Republic of China, the regime that was adopted allows inspections only with the approval of 30 of the 51 countries on the Executive Committee. Proponents of ratification, especially, will appreciate the difficulty of rounding up the votes for such a super-majority. 
   I am troubled by the fact that if the United States requested an inspection, no U.S. inspectors could participate in that inspection, and we could send an observer only if the inspected party approved. I am also disturbed by the right of the inspected party to declare areas up to fifty square kilometers off-limits to inspection or to impose severe restrictions on inspectors in those areas. 
   I understand that these provisions mirror limitations sought by Saddam Hussein on UNSCOM inspectors. This leads me to believe that OSI stands for ``Option Selected by Iraq.'' Even if inspectors do eventually get near the scene of a suspicious event, the evidence--which is highly perishable--may well have vanished. 
   The recently-reported activity at Russia's Arctic test site raises questions both as to our monitoring capabilities and Russian intentions under the CTBT. The Washington Post reported that Russia continues to conduct possible low-yield nuclear tests at its Arctic test site. The Washington Post also reported that the CIA cannot monitor such tests with enough precision to determine whether they are nuclear or conventional explosions. 
   Mr. President, I have tried to convey some serious concerns about the practicality of this treaty, and that is extremely difficult to do in an unclassified forum and in such a short time. 
   I urge my colleagues, as they consider their position on this treaty, to immerse themselves in the details. For further information on treaty monitoring and the reported activities at the Russian test site, I urge Members to review the materials available in S-407. 
   In closing, Mr. President, I would like to make some general points. 
   First, I believe that, when foreign and national security policies come before the Senate, we must put the Nation's interests first. 
   Second, while arms control agreements may be useful to the extent they advance our national interests, they are not a substitute for sound policy. Good agreements are an instrument of good policy. Bad agreements, pursued for agreement's sake, do not serve our Nation's interests. 
   Lastly, some of my colleagues have held out the option of withdrawal from the treaty, should it be ratified yet somehow fail to lead to the Golden Age that proponents envision. 
   Let me be clear. If this treaty is ratified, there will be no turning back. 
   The history of cold war arms control agreements is instructive. In 1972, the United States signed the Interim Agreement on the Limitation of Strategic Offensive Arms, generally known as SALT I, together with the SALT I Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty. 
   On May 9, 1972, Ambassador Gerard Smith unilaterally declared that ``[i]f an agreement providing for more complete strategic offensive arms limitations were not achieved within five years, U.S. supreme interests could be jeopardized.'' He continued, ``Should that occur, it would constitute a basis for withdrawal from the ABM Treaty.'' 
   In fact, no such agreement was reached in five years or in ten years or in 15 years. Not until 1991, almost 20 years after SALT I, when START I was signed, did the United States and the Soviet Union reach such an agreement. At no point did the United States invoke the Supreme Interest clause to withdraw from the ABM Treaty. 
   It is difficult to imagine the circumstances in which an administration would withdraw from the CTBT. 
   In closing, Mr. President, I believe that there are many reasons to oppose this treaty. The effect on our nuclear stockpile, the inability of the treaty to achieve its goals, and our inability to monitor compliance are each sufficient reason to withhold advice and consent to ratification.

    Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I wish to recognize and pay tribute to Colonel Randall D. Bookout, Chief, Senate Liaison Division, Office of the Chief of Legislative Liaison for the U.S. Army, who will retire on January 1, 2000. Colonel Bookout's career spans 27 years during which he has distinguished himself as a soldier, leader and friend of the United States Senate. 
   An Ohio native, Colonel Bookout graduated from the United States Military Academy in 1972 and was commissioned as a lieutenant in the Infantry Branch of the U.S. Army. During his career, he has commanded at the platoon through the battalion levels, where he ably trained and led America's soldiers at home and overseas. In Fort Wainwright, Alaska, he commanded the 4th Battalion, 9th Infantry Regiment, ``The Manchus.'' He has also served in command and staff positions at Fort Carson, Colorado, the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York, the Pentagon and overseas in Panama and Korea. Prior to assuming his current duties, he served as the Aide de Camp to the Secretary of the Army. 
   Since January 1996, Randy Bookout has served with distinction as the Chief of the Army's Senate Liaison Office where he has superbly represented the Chief of Legislative Liaison, the Chief of Staff, Army and the Secretary of the Army, as well as promoting the interests of the soldiers and civilians of the Army. His professionalism, mature judgment, sage advice and inter-personal skills have earned him the respect and confidence of the Members of Congress and Congressional staffers with whom he has worked on a multitude of issues. In over four years on the Hill, Randy Bookout has been a true friend of the U.S. Congress. Serving as the Army's primary point of contact for all Senators, their staffs and Congressional Committees, he has assisted Congress in understanding Army policies, actions, operations and requirements. As a result, he and his staff have been extremely effective in providing prompt, coordinated and factual replies to all inquiries and matters involving Army issues. In addition, he  has provided invaluable assistance to Members and their staffs while planning, coordinating and accompanying Senate delegations traveling worldwide to over sixty countries. His substantive knowledge of the key issues, keen legislative insight, and ability to effectively advise senior members of the Army leadership directly contributed to the successful representation of the Army's interests before Congress. 
   Throughout his career, Colonel Randy Bookout has demonstrated his profound commitment to our Nation, his selfless service to the Army, a deep concern for soldiers and their families, and a commitment to excellence. Colonel Bookout is a consummate professional whose performance, in over 27 years of service, has personified those traits of courage, competency and integrity that our Nation has come to expect from its professional Army officers. 
   Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me in thanking Colonel Bookout for his honorable service to the U.S. Army and the people of the United States. We wish him and his family Godspeed and all the best in the future.

    Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Sergeant Major Gordon R. ``Randy'' Taft, United States Army, a native of Decatur, Alabama, who is retiring this month from active duty after twenty-six years of distinguished service to the country. Sergeant Major Taft, who currently serves as the Senior Enlisted Advisor to the Director of the Defense Logistics Agency in Fort Belvoir, Virginia, has devoted his professional life to supporting the personal, administrative, and logistics needs of military men and women assigned around the world in defense of our freedom. His accomplishments are many and his reputation for leading and developing young soldiers is legendary. Randy Taft's selfless contributions to the National Defense will be missed, so as he transitions to new opportunities, I want to say thanks to him on behalf of a grateful Nation. 
   Sergeant Major Taft's numerous military awards and decorations reflect the tremendous impact he has had on the lives of America's fighting men and women. His decorations include the Legion of Merit, the Meritorious Service Medal, the Army Commendation Medal, and the Humanitarian Service  Medal. But the medals and certificates do not say it all. Like all Sergeants Major in their day-to-day activities and accomplishments, Randy Taft has served as a positive role model for a whole generation of the Army's finest soldiers. Whether he was serving as a personnel specialist, a platoon sergeant, a recruiter, a member of the Army's premier Honor Guard, or as the Senior Enlisted Advisor for the 44,000 person Defense Logistics Agency, he has led by example. His greatest accomplishments are the young soldiers he has helped mold into the kind of citizens this country can be proud to call our Army. 
   Mr. President, I am proud and honored to congratulate Sergeant Major Randy Taft upon the occasion of his retirement from the United States Army.

   Mr. SHELBY. I, too, share the Senator's understanding, and would note that there is much to praise in both H.R. 1000 and S. 82 without regard to changing budgetary treatment of the aviation accounts. I would be very disappointed if the prospect of a multiyear reauthorization were frustrated by the House's intransigence on changing the budgetary treatment of the aviation accounts to the detriment of all other discretionary spending, including Amtrak, drug interdiction efforts of the Coast Guard, as well as many of the domestic programs funded in appropriations bills other than the one I manage as the Chairman of the Transportation appropriations subcommittee. 
   According to the Administration, the budget treatment envisioned in H.R. 1000 would create an additional $1.1 billion in outlays, which if it were absorbed out of the DOT budget would mean: ``elimination of Amtrak capital funding, thereby making it impossible for Amtrak to make the capital investments needed to reach self-sufficiency; and severe reductions to Coast Guard, the Federal Railroad Administration, Saint Lawrence Seaway, the Office of the Inspector General, the Office of the Secretary, and the Research and Special Programs Administration funding, greatly impacting their operations.'' Clearly, firewalls or off-budget treatment for the aviation accounts is a budget buster that would only further exacerbate the current budget problems we face staying under the spending caps.

   Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I am pleased that today the Senate has the opportunity to consider the conference agreement for the Fiscal Year 2000 Transportation Appropriations bill, and expect that we will reinforce the Senate's strong support for this legislation, which was passed just 18 days ago by a vote of 95 to 0. 
   The Transportation Appropriations bill provides more than $50 billion for transportation infrastructure funding, and for safe travel and transportation in the air and on our nation's highways, railroads, coasts and rivers. I am pleased that we have reached an accommodation between the House and the Senate Conferees on the Transportation appropriations bill. The House didn't win on every issue, the Senate didn't win on every issue, the Administration didn't get everything that they wanted--there was a fair amount of give and take on the part of all interested parties and I am confident that the result is a balanced package that is responsive to the priorities of the Congress and of the administration. 
   The 302(b) allocation was tight and constrained our ability to do some things that I would have liked to do-- but we have stayed within the allocation agreed to by the House and the Senate and we have a bill that the Administration will sign. I believe this bill represents a balanced approach and a model for how appropriations bills should be constructed. It stays within the allocation, it stays pretty close to the budget request with the exception of denying new user fee taxes and making some firewall shifts that the authorizing committee objected to, it adheres to the commitment made in TEA-21 on dedicated funding for Highways and Transit, it provides adequate--but constrained--levels for FAA, it maintains a credible Coast Guard capital base and operational tempo, and it continues to focus on making further strides in increasing the safety of all our transportation systems. 
   At the same time, Chairman WOLF, Ranking Member SABO, the senior Senator from New Jersey and I have gone to great lengths to craft a bill that accommodates the requests of members and funds their priorities. Scarcely a day passes where one member or another does not call, write, or collar me on the floor to advocate for a project, a program, or a particular transportation priority for their state. I received over 1,500 separate Senate requests in letter form over the last six months. This bill attempts to respond to as many of those requests as possible. 
   As many of you know, the current fiscal constraints were especially felt in the transit account, where demand for mass transit systems is growing in every state, but funding is fixed by the TEA-21 firewall. I won't belabor that point other than to say we did the best we could under very difficult circumstances.  
   It has been a constant challenge this year to ensure adequate funding for FAA operations, facilities, equipment and research, and for the Airport Improvement Program; for the Coast Guard operations and capital accounts; and for operating funds for the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration. This clearly illustrates the pitfalls of firewalls and the disadvantages of trying to manage annual outlays in multi-year authorization legislation. Our experience this year with this bill is one of many reasons the Congress should reject a proposal to establish 
   more budgetary firewalls around trust fund accounts in the future. 
   I want to mention one other issue that has been the topic of many conversations over the past couple of weeks. That is, the Senate provision concerning the release of personal information by state departments of motor vehicles. My concern is that private information is too available. The proliferation of information over the Internet makes it easy and cheap for almost anyone to access very personal information. 
   I think members would be shocked by what virtually anyone--including wierdos or stalkers--can find out about you, your wife, or your children with only a rudimentary knowledge of how to search the Internet. 
   I believe that there should be a presumption that personal information will be kept confidential, unless there is compelling state need to disclose that information. Most states, however, readily make this information available, and because states sell this information, a lot of information about you effectively comes from public records. 
   Section 350 of the conference protects personal information from broad distribution by requiring express consent prior to the release of information in two situations. First, individuals must give their consent before a state is able to release photographs, social security numbers, and medical or disability information. Of course, this excludes law enforcement and others acting on behalf of the government. Second, individuals must give their consent before the state can sell or release other personal information when that information is disseminated for the purpose of direct marketing or solicitations. I want to be clear: this applies only when the state sells your name, address, and other such information to people who are using that information for marketing purposes. 
   We recognize that states may need time to comply with this provision. And we've proposed to delay the effective date 9 months. In addition, there was concern expressed about this provision being tied to transportation funds under this bill, and the conference agreement eliminates the sanction language and expressly states that no states' fund may be withheld because of non-compliance with this provision. In addition, the Congressional Budget Office has performed a cost estimate analysis of this provision, and found that the total implementation cost for States is well below $50 million nationally. 
   I believe that the general public would be as shocked as my colleagues in the Senate if they learned that states were running a business with the personal information from motor vehicle records. 
   There are a few people I would particularly like to thank before we vote. My Ranking Member, Senator LAUTENBERG, has been a valued partner in this process, and I'm sorry that we only have one more year to do this together. Senators STEVENS and BYRD have provided guidance throughout the year, and made a successful bill possible by ensuring an adequate allocation for transportation programs. My House counterpart, Congressman FRANK WOLF and his staff: John Blazey, Rich Efford, Stephanie Gupta and Linda Muir, have been professional, accommodating, and collegial. This last week has been a blueprint for how conference negotiations should be conducted. Senator LOTT and his staff have been gracious and extremely helpful in moving this legislation forward. And on the Appropriations Committee staff, I want to recognize Steve Cortese and Jay Kimmitt for their invaluable assistance and advice. 
   I look forward to passing this bill and sending it to the President. I ask unanimous consent that the letter from OMB relating to this conference report be printed in the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD at the end of my remarks and after the table regarding federal highway aid. From the OMB letter, it is my expectation that the President will sign the bill in its current form. 
   Mr. President, I also ask unanimous consent to include the following table for the RECORD which shows the estimated fiscal year 2000 distribution of Federal highway fund obligational authority. This table illustrates the state-by-state distribution of non-discretionary highway funds under the conference agreement. It is important to note that none of the discretionary programs, including public lands highways, Indian reservation roads, park roads and parkways, or discretionary bridge are included in this distribution, as these funds are granted on an individual application basis. In addition, these figures do not include the carryover balances from prior years, the final computation of administrative takedown, or the final minimum guarantee adjustments. However, these figures are very close to the actual state distribution that will be made by the Federal Highway Administration based on the agreement outlined in the conference report.

   Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise at this time to engage in a colloquy with the Subcommittee Chairman, the Senator from Missouri. 
   Mr. President, I am concerned about what I feel is an apparent inconsistency and inequity created by two separate and conflicting actions that occurred last spring. One was EPA issuing a final rule implementing a consent decree under section 126 of the Clean Air Act that is triggered in essence by EPA not approving the NO  
   x SIP call revisions of 22 states and the District of Columbia by November 30, 1999. The other was by the United States Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit in issuing an order staying the requirement imposed in EPA's 1998 NO 
   x SIP Call for these jurisdictions to submit the SIP revisions just mentioned for EPA approval.
   Caught in the middle of these two events are electric utilities and industrial sources who fear that now the trigger will be sprung this coming November 30, even though the states are no longer required to make those SIP revisions because of the stay, and even though EPA will have nothing before it to approve or disapprove. 
   Prior to this, EPA maintained a close link between the NO  
   x SIP Call and the section 126 rule, as evidenced by the consent decree. I believe a parallel stay would be appropriate in the circumstances. EPA should not be moving forward with its NO 
   x regulations until the litigation is complete and those affected are given more certainty and clarity as to what is required under the law.
   A stay is very much needed, especially in light of EPA's most recent comments suggesting that it may reverse its earlier interpretation of the Clean Air Act regarding State discretion in dealing with interstate ozone transport problems. The effect of such a reversal would be to force businesses to comply with EPA's federal emission controls under Section 126 without regard to NO  
   x SIP Call rule and State input.
   The proposed reversal is creating tremendous confusion for the businesses and the States. Under EPA's proposed new position, businesses could incur substantial costs in meeting the EPA-imposed section 126 emission controls before allowing the States to use their discretion in the SIP process to address air quality problems, less stringent controls or through controls on other facilities altogether. 
   Indeed, the fact that these businesses almost certainly will have sunk significant costs into compliance with the EPA-imposed controls before States we required to submit their emission control plans in response to the NO

    Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Mr. Jack Warner, the former Chairman and CEO of Gulf States Paper Corporation. I recognize him for the contributions that he and his wife, Elizabeth, have made to Tuscaloosa and the surrounding community. 
   A man of strong character and a wealth of old-fashioned common sense, Jack Warner has persevered and triumphed no matter what the challenge; through wars, labor strikes, and tough financial and personal circumstances. Through it all, he has remained steadfast in his beliefs and a pioneer from which others might draw inspiration. He has made tough business decisions over the years, and through it all has kept Gulf States Paper privately owned, a challenging endeavor when so many other companies have felt the pressure to go public. His gritty determination has led to financial success, which has helped him to pursue his many philanthropic interests and also allowed him to give back to the Tuscaloosa community. 
   It was through many obstacles and achievements that Jack Warner developed the strong character and firm convictions that are with him today. A graduate of Culver Military Academy in Culver, Indiana in 1936, he moved on to college at Washington & Lee University to pursue a degree in business administration. Following graduation, he promptly enlisted in the U.S. Army to perform what he saw as his duty to serve the country. As a commissioned officer with the Mars Task Force in the Burma theater of operations, he served the United States in exemplary fashion. Assigned in the Army's last horse-mounted unit, his calvary outfit was sent to India to pack supplies along the Burma trail. Once there, Jack Warner's unit was confronted with difficulties and obstacles which would have taken the spirit out of most men. Jack persevered, however, and his regiment ended up making a significant contribution to the War effort. This short episode in the life of Mr. Warner encapsulates his great spirit and will. He has always demonstrated persistence through adversity, and a commitment to get the job done right. 
   Perhaps it is this quality which has led to the astonishing success of Jack  Warner's business endeavors. During his tenure as President and Chairman of the Board of Gulf States Paper Corporation, the company experienced enormous growth. The business which has become synonymous with his name today enjoys a very healthy portfolio. This success has paved the way for many other business ventures and activities for Jack. He is the past director of the American Paper Institute, the past chairman and three-term president of the Alabama Chamber of Commerce, the past two-term president of the Greater Tuscaloosa Chamber of Commerce, a Director of the First Alabama Bank of Tuscaloosa, a past director of the Alabama Great Southern Railroad Company, a past director of the First National Bank of Tuscaloosa, just to name a few. He is truly a fixture in the Tuscaloosa business community. 
   Jack Warner has not taken his tremendous business success for granted. In fact, he has used his position in the community to become actively involved in the growth and development of Tuscaloosa. Through his efforts, he has made a tremendous impact on Tuscaloosa and the surrounding area. His numerous civic activities attest to his unyielding commitment towards improving the community in which he lives. A few of his current civic activities include membership in the Mount Vernon Advisory Committee, the Decorative Arts Trust Board of Governors, active Director of the University Club of Tuscaloosa, Commodore of the North River Yacht Club, as well as Elder in the First Presbyterian Church of Tuscaloosa. His former activities include a term as the Chairman of the Alabama Council on Economic Education, President of the YMCA of Metropolitan Tuscaloosa, President of the Druid City Hospital Foundation, as well as a member of the National Board of the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C. He has received numerous honors and awards for his efforts, including the Distinguished Achievement Award from the President's Cabinet at the University of Alabama, the Frances G. Summersell Award from the University of Alabama, the Lifetime Achievement Award from the Alabama State Council on the Arts, the Lifetime Achievement Award from the Greater Tuscaloosa Chamber of Commerce, the Lifetime Preservation Achievement Award from the Tuscaloosa County Preservation Society, and induction into the Alabama Business Hall of Fame. 
   Jack Warner has truly been an integral part in all aspects of the Tuscaloosa community. It is with great pleasure that I recognize his efforts and rise in tribute to all that he has done for Tuscaloosa and the state of Alabama. His commitment and sense of civic duty is greatly appreciated.

   Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I have a few observations. My friend, the distinguished Senator from Texas, makes a lot of sense a lot of times. I agree with him most of the time. I especially agree with him on this. We certainly don't want the Government running the airlines. We want the airlines to be as responsive as they can be to the public, which is their customer. That is all of us. We have benefited. 
   As the Senator from Louisiana said in her remarks, we have benefited immensely from the deregulation of the airlines. We want to keep it that way. I want to deregulate just about everything I can think of, or see, or feel, because I think there is a benefit. 
   The Senator from Texas is absolutely right. There is something in private enterprise and a contract, and we should respect that. We have to respect that. But I hope the airlines are getting the message that we are getting from the public that there is a lot of unrest out there. Maybe it is lack of communication with the public. But if I buy a ticket and if it is a special ticket, I know it is a special ticket. That is a contract. I know that if I don't use it, I guess I will lose it. I certainly can't skip around on it. Maybe that is a communications problem with whoever is purchasing it. But whatever we do, let's not ever have the Government running any business, especially the airlines.

   Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I am aware of this issue due to the diligence of the Michigan Senators, and I understand the concerns they have regarding Coast Guard's proposal. I have seen the amendment filed by colleagues from Michigan to ensure the continued search and rescue coverage from the Muskegon Air Station during the high-traffic summer season. While I would be concerned if the closure of this facility would cause a degradation of search and rescue capability, it is not possible at this point to incorporate such legislative directives to the Coast Guard given the large number of other legislative initiatives regarding Coast Guard facilities that have been presented to the Subcommittee.

   Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I was pleased to support that designation in the drafting of S. 1143, and was particularly impressed that it is projected to reduce the cost of winter storm maintenance by 10% in Southeast Michigan, reduce weather-related accidents by 10%, as well as reduce by 5% the amount of salt used on those roads, while also creating a model for other states to improve their snow removal operations. Because of that, I believe that the Federal Highway Administration should consider the SEMSIM project as the top priority project within that $4 million distribution to Southeast Michigan.

   Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I agree that the RIMS project described by Senator ABRAHAM indeed appears to be worthy of federal funding, and I would recommend that the Federal Highway Administration provide funding for this project to the extent possible after fully funding the SEMSIM project discussed before. Furthermore, if the final appropriations bill will provide more ITS money for Michigan, I will press to have both of these projects funded as fully as possible, in accordance with the prioritization I have previously discussed.

   Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Michigan for his comments, and he is correct, we did face significant constraints throughout this bill which impacted upon the Next Generation High Speed Rail program. Furthermore, the Administration's funding request for this specific program was funded in part with a recommendation to transfer Revenue Aligned Budget Authority from the State highway formula to this and other programs, a proposal which was rejected by the Congress. I believe the Senator from Michigan opposed the RABA transfer from the States in the Budget Committee. 
   However, I believe the unallocated portion of the train control demonstration program under the Next Generation High Speed Rail Program should be allocated to the Michigan ITCS project, and as we enter the Conference with the House, I will work to ensure adequate funding for this project.

   All of us travel by the airlines. We want our airlines to do well. We want them to respond to all the people in the market. But we want it to be done upfront and, I think, upright. I am not sure that is going on today. That is why I believe this legislation is necessary. I think it is a step in the right direction. 
   We all go back to the deregulation of the airlines. I want to deregulate everything. But I want competition to be out there in the marketplace, including the airlines, to where people will have a choice. I am not sure we have a choice today in the airline industry because we have such concentration. We all fly. We want some basic rights. 
   I believe the passengers, who are the customers who support the airlines--without customers there will be no airlines--ought to have a say. I believe that is the thrust of the amendments offered by the Senator from Oregon. That is why I support them.

   Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I believe it is important that all Members of the Senate clearly understand the distribution of revenue aligned budget authority--that we called RABA--which the subcommittee integrated into this bill. 
   The philosophy of the Transportation Act for the 21st century was that highway funding is intrinsically linked to receipts to the highway account of the highway trust fund, and that increased gas tax receipts should be passed along to the States for highway construction and improvement projects. 
   The provision in TEA 21 that I described is a mechanism to guarantee additional revenue in the trust fund from greater than anticipated gas tax receipts would be spent for that purpose. The Transportation Appropriations Subcommittee's provision, which we have been talking about, ensures this intent is met and it is completely consistent with the spirit of TEA 21. 
   The President's budget submission, however, requested to divert a third of these funds away from the Federal aid highway program to fund other programs and their initiatives. The subcommittee rejected this approach. Instead, we adopted one that honors the commitment Congress made to the States when it passed TEA 21, which I supported along with others. 
   Our bill sends the funds directly to the States in order to maximize the Federal resources flowing to each State. I want to be clear this afternoon. This does not alter the TEA 21 formula. It, in fact, embraces the formula by strictly adhering to each State's individual guaranteed share under section 1105 of TEA 21. 
   This is one of those rare instances where Congress is able to put forward a proposal that benefits every Member in every State in the Union. Within a constrained Federal budget, it is an approach which increases the amount that is available to the States for highway construction. I believe it makes sense and at the proper time I believe my colleagues--I hope, at least, they will support it.

   Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I want to talk about germaneness for just a minute. I know the point of order has not been made yet, but I want my colleagues to know that the Senators who could raise the rule XVI point of order are trying to characterize the bill's RABA provision as not germane to this bill. But before bringing this provision to the floor, we checked again with the Parliamentarian, and he indicated the defense of germaneness did, in fact, exist on this provision by virtue of legislative language in the House-passed text. 
   This language was not drafted with the goal of creating germane language. If my colleagues will recall, the rule XVI point of order was reestablished after this bill had been reported from committee and we did not need to modify the provision in order to make it germane. It is germane because it is germane, and it is consistent with rule XVI. 
   What my colleagues are asking--if they do this--is to rule against a provision that is clearly germane pursuant to existing Senate rules under rule XVI. I urge my colleagues to reject at that time, if that is done, that proposition and uphold the germaneness of this provision. 
   My colleagues have probably thrown a lot of smoke at you as to why you should not support the existing Senate appropriations provision, things such as preserving the genius of TEA 21. Some Western or public land States may get hurt under this provision, but do not let this confuse you. 
   Be careful, I would suggest, when Members argue jurisdiction and in the same breath claim that your State might--yes, I repeat, might--be disadvantaged by a provision, and then raise a point of order--if they do--rather than voting on the merits of the issue. 
   Why? Because what the Appropriations Committee has done is simple and straightforward and directly benefits every State. Let me be clear again. Every State will receive more money because of this provision because all the money will go directly to the States with fewer strings attached than it would otherwise. 
   In addition, the money will get to the States sooner, so they can tackle the most critical transportation problems without having to wait on some Washington bureaucrats to deem their problems worthy of Federal funding. 
   I believe it is clear that we cannot--yes, we cannot--always count on the Washington bureaucrats to be fair and impartial when making decisions about these discretionary highway funding issues. 
   In fact, I have here a General Accounting Office study--a copy of the study is on the desk--that shows that the Department of Transportation does not always follow its own policies when distributing discretionary highway funds and that the distribution process can be highly politicized. 
   The Appropriations Committee provision does not hurt Western or public land States in any way. Each of these States will have a guaranteed increase in highway funds, and they will get their money earlier. They can use these additional resources on public lands projects or whatever they want. 
   So why raise a point of order--if, in fact, they do--as I anticipate, instead of voting on the provision? Because the opponents know they are asking Members to vote against their own States' interests. They are hoping you will not see that if the vote is on the point of order. 
   What the Members objecting to the appropriations provision are asking you to do is forgo two birds in the hand, we might say, on the off chance that there might be a smaller bird in the bush somewhere else. Think about it. Not a very good deal, in this Senator's estimation, and not one which is in the best interests of any Senator's State. If you think so, check with your Governor in your State.

   Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, just for a few minutes I would like to address some of the overview, as I see it, of this Transportation appropriations bill. 
   Mr. President, after being delayed by the objection to the Transit Equity Provision, I am pleased that the Senate will finally have the opportunity to consider the fiscal year 2000 transportation appropriations bill. Although the subcommittee's funding allocation is tight, I believe we are presenting the Senate with a balanced approach to meeting our Nation's transportation needs by providing adequate funding for all modes of transportation. 
   At the same time, the senior Senator from New Jersey, Mr. LAUTENBERG, and I have gone to great lengths to craft a bill that I believe accommodates the requests of Members and funds their priorities. 
   The current fiscal constraints were especially felt in the transit account, where demand for mass transit systems is growing in every State. But funding is fixed by the TEA 21 firewall. My proposal for managing an account in which Members' requests were more than 20 times the available funds was the Transit Equity Provision. 
   This measure, which I included in the original subcommittee mark of the bill, would have limited the amount of transit capital funds any single State could receive in fiscal year 2000 to no more than 12 1/2 percent of the total. 
   The two states that receive the lion's share of national transit funds--30 percent of the total in fiscal year 1999--are California and New York. 
   The provision would have redistributed any transit capital funds appropriated to these two states in excess of 12 1/2 percent to the remaining 48 states. This would have resulted in approximately $5 million more for every other state, for their own transit programs--while New York and California would still have received more than $693 million each. 
   Last Thursday, however, the Senate failed to reach cloture on the motion to proceed to the transportation appropriations bill if it included the Transit Equity Provision, and I have agreed to strip the provision from the bill in order to move this legislation forward. 
   The equity provision is not central to the appropriations bill. The total program funding levels, which are set at the TEA-21 firewall limits, remain unchanged. I included the provision to help create more room within those totals for the national transit program. 
   My colleagues have written to me with new start project requests totaling $2.84 billion and with bus project requests totaling $1.8 billion. 
   If the appropriations bill honors all the current and anticipated full funding grant agreement projects and the bus earmarks for fiscal year 2000 that were included in the TEA-21 authorization, we have left only $96 million in new starts funding and $235 million in bus funding--to accommodate not only the billions of dollars' worth of requests from my colleagues in the Senate, but also the earmarks that have been included in the House transportation appropriations bill. 
   This task is beyond challenging: It is impossible. There is no way to begin to satisfy the demand for discretionary transit capital funds. I do not want this fact to catch my colleagues by surprise. 
   I bring this bill to the Senate floor today without the Transit Equity Provision. By engaging in a lengthy and public debate on this issue, as well as a recorded cloture vote, I hope that my colleagues are now more aware of the pressures on this account nationally, and that they better understand why I have so actively sought a way to provide funds for what I thought were my colleagues' transit priorities. 
   The bill honors our commitment to increase the flow of federal funds for construction to improve infrastructure throughout the nation. 
   Within the framework of a $49.5 billion total bill, $37.9 billion is provided for infrastructure investment in highways, transit systems, airports, and railroads. This is 6 percent more than last year's level of funding and is greater than the administration's request. 
   This bill respects the Highway and Transit firewalls that TEA-21 imposed. I would like to point out to my colleagues that we adhered strictly to the TEA-21 firewalls, even though outlays will be greater than the amount anticipated when Congress enacted TEA-21. 
   By providing the funds above the firewall level, there were fewer dollars available to fund other priorities within the subcommittee's jurisdiction, including the Coast Guard and FAA. 
   I believe this illustrates the pitfalls of trying to manage annual outlays in multi-year authorization legislation and is one of many reasons the Senate should reject a proposal to establish more budgetary firewalls around trust fund accounts. 
   I yield to my colleague under the unanimous consent agreement, the senior senator from New Jersey, the ranking member of the Transportation Appropriations Subcommittee.

    Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce a bipartisan bill with my colleagues, Senators BAYH, BRYAN, ROCKEFELLER and BINGAMAN. Entitled the ``Manufactured Housing Improvement Act,'' (MHIA) this bill is designed to modernize the requirements under the National Manufactured Housing Construction and Safety Standards Act of 1974 and to establish a balanced consensus process for the development, revision, and interpretation of Federal construction and safety standards for manufactured homes. 
   Many do not realize that the majority of new manufactured homes of today are completely different from those of twenty or even ten years ago, and that this is the fastest growing segment of the housing industry. Today nearly one out of four new single family homes is a manufactured home, and the industry recently set a twenty-year sales record. There are good consumer-oriented reasons for this tremendous growth--manufactured homes offer quality and aesthetically pleasing housing at an average cost of $41,100, excluding the land. Today, manufactured housing has lowered the threshold to the American Dream of home ownership for millions of Americans, including first-time home buyers, senior citizens, young families, and single parents. 
   With 5.3 million American households in need of affordable housing, I believe it is imperative to update the laws that regulate the private sector solution to affordable housing. In order for the manufactured housing industry to remain competitive, Congress must modernize the National Manufactured Housing Construction and Safety Standards Act of 1974. 
   My bill would do just that. MHIA would establish a consensus committee that would submit recommendations to the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) for developing, amending, and revising the Federal Manufactured Home Construction and Safety Standards. In addition, the committee would be authorized to interpret the standards and recommend appropriate regulations. Consumers will still be protected by HUD because the Secretary will have absolute authority to reject any recommendations, for any reason, submitted by the consensus committee. 
   The Manufactured Housing Improvement Act would authorize the Secretary of HUD to use industry label fees for the administration of the consensus committee and the hiring of additional HUD staff in order to assure adequate consumer protection. The Secretary of HUD would also be authorized to use industry label fees to facilitate the availability and affordability of manufactured homes. 
   This legislation is a very significant step forward in that both consumer and industry groups such as the Seniors Coalition, 60 Plus, and the Council for Affordable and Rural Housing, the National Association of Affordable Housing Lenders, the North American Steel Framing Alliance, and the Community Associations Institute, along with the Manufactured Housing Institute and the Manufactured Housing Association for Regulatory Reform, have endorsed this legislation. 
   The industry participants have modernized the quality and technology of manufactured housing. It's time for Congress to modernize the laws that regulate an industry that provides affordable housing and contributes more than $33 billion annually to our nation's economy. 
   Similar legislation passed the House at the end of last Congress on a bipartisan basis under suspension of the  rules and has been introduced again this year. I hope this year the Senate will take the lead and send the MHIA to the House as soon as possible.

   Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, on July 27, 1953, the armistice was signed, ending the Korean War. On Sunday, July 25, 1999, nearly forty-six years after the fighting stopped, the Veterans of Foreign Wars gathered for the dedication of a Korean War Memorial in Fultondale, Alabama. I rise today, on the 46th Anniversary of the armistice, to honor the military personnel who faithfully served our nation in this conflict. 
   Many have wrongfully called Korea ``the Forgotten War.'' I want Korean War veterans to know that we have not forgotten their brave service to our nation. The courage and dedication of American troops who fought on and around the Korean Peninsula should never be forgotten. The names of Pusan, Inchon, Chosin Reservoir and countless other locations where our forces fought against Communist aggression continue to bring pride to the hearts and minds of all Americans. 
   We are constantly and correctly reminded of the thousands of Americans who lost so much in the Vietnam War. Vietnam left such a lasting impression on our history that there has been a temptation to overlook our nation's first stand against the Communist threat in Asia. I am committed to insuring that we do not succumb to this temptation. We must not forget either the 37,000 Americans who gave their lives in Korea, or the 8,000 MIAs whose fate remains a mystery. 
   Those who served their nation from 1950-53 suffered much, but have left a proud legacy. The 8th Army, Far East Air Force, 1st Marine Division, and 7th Fleet proved their mettle in Korea and remain among the proudest names in American military history. The peace and prosperity which the people of South Korea enjoy today is the direct result of the gallantry of our Armed Forces. The 38,000 American personnel who currently serve in South Korea are guardians of the liberty which their predecessors fought to establish nearly half a century ago. 
   Mr. President, I ask you and my fellow United States Senators to join me in recognizing the members of the Armed Services who sacrificed so much in defense of freedom and democracy on the Korean Peninsula.

   Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I commend Senator BINGAMAN for offering this amendment. I believe it is constructive in nature. It is something we believe will, at the end of the day, clarify what we are trying to do. That is what this legislation is all about--to restructure the labs, making it harder for espionage to go on at the labs. So it is a good amendment. I urge that at the proper time we adopt it.

   Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I will be brief. 
   First of all, I commend my friend and colleague, Senator BRYAN, who brought this to the attention of the Senate. We have discussed this before. He feels very strongly about it. I believe if you look at it in its entirety, it has some merit. But I also think this should be addressed at the level of the appropriate committee. At the time when he pursues this, I will tell every one of my colleagues to look at this very carefully because I believe what he is proposing should be evaluated in that light. Personally, I think it has some merit.

   Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the resolution that I offered yesterday with Senator SESSIONS and many of my colleagues which recognizes the 30th Anniversary of the Apollo 11 Lunar Landing. 
   Mr. President, for thousands of years, men looked to the sky and were fascinated by the moon. To our forefathers it was a source of wonder, hope, curiosity and fear. Near enough to draw their attention, yet so far beyond their reach to remain a constant mystery, the moon was an unattainable destination for the people of earth. 
   Undaunted by the significance of the task, President Kennedy called upon our nation ``to commit itself to achieving the goal.......of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to earth.'' With this challenge, a goal that had previously exceeded the grasp of every generation, became the mission of the United States to achieve within ten years. 
   Facing this great endeavor, the men and women of the American Space Program set to work with steadfast conviction. While their efforts produced steady results, there were tragic losses and technical setbacks that tested their resolve. Brave men gave their lives. Brilliant men and women spent countless hours trying to work through the numerous difficulties associated with such a complex undertaking. However, all remained dedicated to the goal of landing a man on the moon. 
   On July 20, 1969, 30 years ago yesterday, that goal was achieved. On that day, Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin closed the timeless breach that had separated the earth from the moon and landed on the Sea of Tranquility. With Neil Armstrong's first step on the lunar surface, the American Space Program met the awesome challenge set by President Kennedy. This important event marks America's ascendance to the preeminent role that it occupies today as the world's leader in space exploration. 
   While yesterday was an important anniversary for all the people of the world, it was especially important for the people of the United States. Landing men on the moon represents a great triumph of American endeavor. As the Spanish could be proud for having built the great ships that carried Columbus on his voyage of discovery, American scientists and engineers can feel equally proud for having built the Saturn V Rocket, the vehicle that carried the astronauts to the moon. That no other nation has produced a similar vehicle is a testament to the unparalleled achievement of our Space Program. 
   This resolution celebrates the anniversary of the great achievement of landing men on the moon. It celebrates the efforts of the many men and women who defied the odds and helped to make what was once believed to be  impossible, possible. Finally, it celebrates the courageous spirit of the American people.

    Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Mr. Jack Warner, a pillar of the Tuscaloosa business community and a man of deep passion both in his business and personal pursuits. The former Chairman and CEO of Gulf States Paper Corporation, I would like to recognize him for the work that he and his wife, Elizabeth, have contributed to Tuscaloosa in the form of time, expertise and money to many local causes. 
   The pragmatic approach that he has brought to his life combines old-fashioned common sense with a flexible philosophy. This philosophy has evolved over time, through two world wars, numerous labor strikes, and tough financial circumstances. Through it all, Jack Warner has remained steadfast in his beliefs and a pioneer from which others might draw inspiration. He has made tough business decisions throughout the years, and through it all kept Gulf States Paper privately owned, when so many other companies have gone public. His gritty determination has led to financial success, which has helped him to pursue his personal interests and also allowed him to give back to the Tuscaloosa community. 
   Jack Warner truly represents an era when a man presented his best effort to any obstacle in his path. As an officer in the Army's last horse-mounted unit, his cavalry unit was sent to India to pack supplies along the Burma trail during World War II. Once there, his unit was issued mules instead of horses, which would be enough to take the wind out of any proud soldier's sails. Jack Warner persevered however, and his regiment ended up making a significant contribution to the War effort when a traditional cavalry unit would have had little to offer. This story encapsulates the life of Jack Warner, demonstrating persistence through adversity, and a humble focus to get the job done right. 
   Jack Warner has made a tremendous impact on Tuscaloosa and the surrounding area. In fact, he has recently completed the redecoration of the University of Alabama President's Mansion at his own expense. Perhaps almost as importantly, Jack followed through with the renovation to the last small detail, going so far as to choose the drapery as well as replacing a smaller chandelier with an immense late 18th century Waterford crystal chandelier. Again, this typifies the man which has been so integral to the Tuscaloosa community, not only providing the money for the project, but following through and making sure everything turned out right. His commitment to Tuscaloosa and the State of Alabama is greatly appreciated.

   Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, on May 5 of this year the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence unanimously reported out of the Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2000. It subsequently referred to the Committee on Armed Services, where it was reported out on June 8. 
   Senator KERREY and I have once again worked very closely together to address our critical need for high-quality intelligence by allocating resources in a manner designed to ensure that this need is met. 
   In preparing this legislation, the committee conducted a detailed review of the administration's three major intelligence budget requests for fiscal year 2000. They are the National Foreign Intelligence Program, the Joint Military Intelligence Program, and the Tactical Intelligence and Related Activities of the Military Services. 
   The committee held briefings and hearings with senior intelligence officials, reviewed budget justification materials, and considered responses to specific questions posed by the committee. 
   As in the past, the committee also impaneled a group of outside experts composed of distinguished scientists, industry leaders, and retired general and flag officers to review specific technical issues within the intelligence community. 
   The panel is known as the Technical Advisory Group and is similar to the Defense Department's Defense Science Board in some ways. 
   This group brings an invaluable level of expertise to the committee's work, and we owe them a debt of gratitude for their service. 
   Many of their recommendations have been incorporated into this bill before the Senate this evening. 
   Once again the committee has focused on what we refer to as the ``five C's''. They are: counterproliferation, counterterrorism, counternarcotics, covert action, and counterintelligence. 
   The last of the five, counterintelligence, has received a great deal of congressional and media attention in recent months in light of revelations of espionage activities by the People's Republic of China. 
   I am proud to say that the Intelligence Committee has been attempting to address the shortcomings of the Department of Energy's counterintelligence program for nearly 10 years, often to no avail. 
   In fact, it was the Intelligence Committee that directed the study that finally led to the drafting and signing of Presidential Decision Directive 61. 
   Before I turn to the legislative provisions in this bill, I feel compelled to share with our colleagues some comments about the current state of our defense and intelligence preparedness. 
   In the immediate aftermath of the cold war, optimistic appraisals of our  intelligence and security requirements generated calls for dramatic cuts in defense and intelligence spending. 
   The first national security decision made by President Clinton on taking office in 1993 was to cut more than $120 billion from the defense budget. Substantial cuts were also made to classified intelligence programs. 
   Unfortunately, such optimistic estimates have proved sadly wrong. 
   Today we face a series of transnational threats spanning the spectrum of conflict from terrorist acts committed on U.S. territory to the development of weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery by Third World countries. 
   I recently traveled to the Balkans and reviewed some of our intelligence activities in Europe. Military and civilian personnel were routinely working in excess of 80 hours a week, and that pace was nonstop throughout the Kosovo conflict. 
   Regretfully, the problems the military and the intelligence community are experiencing are partly our fault. Congress accepted ``defense on the cheap,'' and we have gotten exactly what we paid for as we always do--an intelligence community and military force stretched to its limits. 
   I believe the result is clear: We are not prepared to meet the challenges of a complex and dangerous world. 
   National security cannot be had on the cheap, and we have attempted to address some of the shortfalls in this year's bill. 
   The bill's classified schedule of authorizations and annex--I remind every Senator--are available for review just off the Senate floor. I repeat: The bill's classified schedule of authorizations and annex are available to every Senator in this body for review just off the Senate floor. 
   I will now discuss the significant unclassified legislative provisions contained in the bill. 
   First, section 304 directs the President to require an employee who requires access to classified information to provide written consent that permits an authorized investigative agency to access information stored in computers used in the performance of Government duties. 
   This provision is intended to avoid the problems we have seen with the FBI's reluctance to access ``Government'' computers without a warrant in the course of an espionage investigation. 
   There should be no question--yes, there should be no question--that investigative agencies may search the computer of an individual with access to classified information. This provision makes that perfectly clear. 
   Second, sections 501 through 505 comprise the Department of Energy Sensitive Country Foreign Visitors Moratorium Act of 1999. 
   What is that? Section 502 establishes a moratorium on foreign visitors to classified facilities at Department of Energy National Laboratories. 
   The moratorium applies only to citizens of nations on the Department of Energy ``sensitive countries list.'' 
   Section 502 also provides for a waiver of the moratorium on a case-by-case basis if the Secretary of Energy justifies the waiver and certifies that the visit is necessary for the national security of the United States. 
   Section 503 requires that the Secretary of Energy perform background checks on all foreign visitors to the National Laboratories. The term ``background checks'' means the consultation of all available, appropriate, and relevant intelligence community and law enforcement databases. 
   Section 504 requires an interim report to Congress on the counterintelligence activities at the National Laboratories and a net assessment of the Foreign Visitors Program at the National Laboratories to be produced by a panel of experts. 
   Most importantly, the report must include a recommendation as to whether the moratorium should be continued or repealed. 
   The Senate Intelligence Committee has been critical of the Department of Energy's counterintelligence program for nearly 10 years. Beginning in 1990, we identified serious shortfalls in funding and personnel dedicated to protecting our Nation's nuclear secrets. 
   Yet year after year--and this year as well--the committee has provided funds and directed many reviews and studies in an effort to persuade the Department of Energy to take action. 
   Unfortunately, this and prior administrations failed to heed our warnings. 
   Consequently, a serious espionage threat at our National Labs has gone virtually unabated and it appears that our nuclear weapons program may have suffered extremely grave damage. 
   I believe we must take steps to ensure the integrity of our National Labs. We understand that a moratorium on the Foreign Visitors Program may be perceived by some as a draconian measure, but until the Department of Energy fully implements a comprehensive and sustained counterintelligence program, we believe that we must err on the side of caution. The stakes are too high. 
   The moratorium requires a net assessment to be conducted by a panel of experts; this is an integral part of a comprehensive report by the Director of Central Intelligence and the Director of the FBI on the counterintelligence activities at the National Laboratories. 
   Only then should we decide whether to lift the moratorium in favor of a comprehensive plan. I believe this is a very important point. 
   During our preliminary look in the committee into the problems at the DOE labs, we were convinced that the FBI could and should be required to inform an agency or department that they are investigating an employee of that particular agency. 
   Accordingly, section 602 of the bill requires the FBI to establish meaningful liaison with the relevant agency at the beginning stages of a counterintelligence investigation. 
   This section also amends the Intelligence Authorization Act for fiscal year 1995 to make clear that the FBI's obligation to consult with departments and agencies concerned begins when the FBI has knowledge of espionage activities from other sources or as a result of its own information or investigation. 
   In closing, I must remind the Members of this body, my colleagues, of an unfortunate fact. This is the last time that Senator KERREY, the distinguished senior Senator from Nebraska, will bring an intelligence authorization bill to the floor of the Senate as the vice chairman of the committee. 
   Senator KERREY's tenure on the committee will conclude at the end of this year. 
   This past March 14, as some of you will recall, marked the 30th anniversary of the day that Lieutenant, Junior Grade, BOB KERREY, leading his SEAL team on an operation on an island in the bay of Nha Trang earned our Nation's highest award for valor, the Medal of Honor. 
   No one who knows BOB KERREY's military record would question his physical courage, but I would like to talk for just a few minutes about another type of courage he has, and that is moral courage. 
   In a town like Washington that rewards neither, he is the rare man who has both, I believe. The wartime history of the United States Navy has documented his physical courage, but I want to recognize his moral courage. And I want to tell you why. 
   Senator KERREY has taken stands that many of us would consider politically unwise. 
   He took a stand on entitlements reform here in the Senate long before it was politically wise to do so. It can be said he laid his bare hand on the ``third rail of American politics'' and took the heat--something few in this body were willing to attempt. 
   As vice chairman of this committee, Senator KERREY has often taken issue with his own administration when he believed it was in the national interest to do so. Indeed, he always puts the interests of the Nation ahead of politics. 
   Also, Senator KERREY's knowledge of our intelligence needs is unparalleled in the Senate. And I will miss his service, as others will, on the Intelligence Committee. 
   Senator KERREY has set a very high standard for his successor, and I thank him for his dedication and integrity, and also for his personal friendship. It has been a pleasure and an honor to work with Nebraska's senior Senator. 
   I look forward to joining him on the floor one last time when the conference report for this bill reaches the floor later this year. 
   Until that time, though, we will continue to work closely to conduct vigorous oversight of the intelligence activities of the United States in the  nonpartisan spirit that created this important and unique committee.

   Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I also support the Kyl-Domenici-Murkowski amendment that is the pending business in the Senate. 
   I take just a minute to commend the Senator from Arizona, Senator KYL, and Senator DOMENICI and Senator MURKOWSKI for working together on this very important amendment. It is important for the restructuring of our labs following the Rudman recommendation and others. 
   Most Members know the horror stories that have been going on for years and years. This won't solve everything, but it will be a positive step in the right direction. 
   I also note my colleague from Nebraska, the vice chairman of the committee, Senator KERREY, and I both support this. That is unusual. We believe this is not a partisan issue. This is important for the Nation as far as national security is concerned. It is a step in the right direction. It is above politics, above party. 
   I mention again, as I did yesterday, the Rudman report, which was requested by the President of the United States, Bill Clinton, concluded that purely administrative reorganizational changes at the Department of Energy labs are inadequate, totally inadequate to the challenge at hand. He said:  
   To ensure its long-term success, this new agency must be established by statute.  
   That is exactly what the amendment of Senators KYL, DOMENICI, and MURKOWSKI does. 
   As an indication of how badly the Department of Energy is broken, I only have to remind my colleagues it took over 100 studies of counterintelligence, security and management practices by the FBI, other intelligence agencies, the General Accounting Office, the Department of Energy itself and others, plus one enormous espionage scandal to create the impetus for change that is before the Senate this evening. 
   I think it is time for the Senate to act. I believe this is a good amendment. It is positive. It has been worked. I believe we will pass it. 
   Mr. President, I support the Kyl-Domenici-Murkowski amendment to restructure the Department of Energy. 
   I am a cosponsor of that amendment, as is the distinguished vice chairman of the Intelligence Committee, Senator KERREY. 
   By now, my colleagues are familiar with the findings of the Rudman report, entitled ``Science at its Best; Security at its Worst: A Report on Security Problems at the U.S. Department of Energy.'' But I think certain key conclusions are worth restating, because they underline the need for action. 
   The Rudman report found that:  
   At the birth of DOE, the brilliant scientific breakthroughs of the nuclear weapons laboratories came with a troubling record of security administration. Twenty years later, virtually every one of its original problems persists. ..... Multiple chains of command and standards of performance negated accountability, resulting in pervasive inefficiency, confusion, and mistrust. ..... 
   In response to these problems, the Department has been the subject of a nearly unbroken history of dire warnings and attempted but aborted reforms.  
   Building on the conclusions of the 1997 Institute for Defense Analyses report and the 1999 Chiles Commission, the Rudman panel concluded that:   
   The Department of Energy is a dysfunctional bureaucracy that has proven it is incapable of reforming itself. ..... Reorganization is clearly warranted to resolve the many specific problems ..... in the weapons laboratories, but also to address the lack of accountability that has become endemic throughout the entire Department. 
   The panel is convinced that real and lasting security and counterintelligence reform at the weapons labs is simply unworkable within DOE's current structure and culture....... To achieve the kind of protection that these sensitive labs must have, they and their functions must have their own autonomous operational structure free of all the other obligations imposed by DOE management.  
   To provide ``deep and lasting structural change that will give the weapons laboratories the accountability, clear lines of authority, and priority they deserve,'' the Rudman Report endorsed two possible solutions: 
   Creation of a wholly independent agency such as NASA to perform weapons research and nuclear stockpile management functions; or 
   Placing weapons research and nuclear stockpile management functions in a ``new semi-autonomous agency within DOE that has a clear mission, streamlined bureaucracy, and drastically simplified lines of authority and accountability.'' 
   The latter option is the approach contained in the Kyl-Domenici-Murkowski amendment. The new semi-autonomous agency, the Agency for Nuclear Stewardship, will be a single agency, within the DOE, with responsibility for all activities of our nuclear weapons complex, including the National Laboratories--nuclear weapons, nonproliferation, and disposition of fissile materials. 
   This agency will be led by an Undersecretary. The Undersecretary will be in charge of and responsible for all aspects of the agency's work, will report--directly and solely--to the Secretary of Energy, and will be subject to the supervision and direction of the Secretary. The Secretary of Energy will retail full authority over all activities of this agency. Thus, for the first time, this critical function of our national government will have the clear chain of command that it requires. 
   As recommended by the Rudman report, the new agency will have its own senior officials responsible for counterintelligence and security matters within the agency. These officials will carry out the counterintelligence and security policies established by the Secretary and will report to the Undersecretary and have direct access to the Secretary. The Agency will have a Senior official responsible for the analysis and assessment of intelligence, who will also report to the Undersecretary and have direct access to the Secretary. 
   The Rudman report concluded that purely administrative re-organizational changes are inadequate to the challenge at hand: ``To ensure its long-term success, this new agency must be established by statute.'' 
   For if the history of attempts to reform DOE underscores one thing, it is the ability of the DOE and the labs to hunker down and outwait and outlast Secretaries and other would-be agents of change--even Presidents. 
   For example, as documented by Senator Rudman and his colleagues, ``even after President Clinton issued Presidential Decision Directive 61 ordering that the Department make fundamental changes in security procedures, compliance by Department bureaucrats was grudging and belated.'' 
   At the same time, we in the Senate should recognize that our work will not be done even after this amendment is adopted and enacted into law. As the Rudman report warned,  
   DOE cannot be fixed by a single legislative act: management must follow mandate....... Thus, both Congress and the Executive branch ..... should be prepared to monitor the progress of the Department's reforms for years to come.  
   Mr. President, it is an indication of how badly the Department of Energy is broken that it took over one hundred studies of counterintelligence, security and management practices--by the FBI and other intelligence agencies, the GAO, the DOE itself, and others, plus one enormous espionage scandal--to create the impetus for change. 
   Now is the time for the Senate to act. 
   I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I will take a minute this evening to thank Senator COVERDELL and also Senator FEINSTEIN for having the foresight and initiative to expand and to improve upon what is already a highly successful weapon in our Nation's fight against international narcotics trafficking. 
   The International Emergency Economic Powers Act was expanded 4 years ago under Executive order to target specific drug trafficking kingpins operating from Colombia. 
   Our colleagues' legislation expands upon that Executive order by allowing similar actions to be taken against additional kingpins worldwide. 
   Any future designation of foreign narcotics traffickers under this act would still be made by the President, but recommendations to the President will now come from the entire U.S. counter-narcotics community, to include law enforcement, intelligence, and regulatory officials. 
   Once designated, those foreign drug kingpins would soon see their access to the U.S. economy completely disappear. 
   Without the ability to place illicitly derived proceeds into commerce and trade in the United States, these kingpins and their illicit organizations will wither and fade away.  
   Denying these foreign traffickers the opportunity to participate in the vibrant and growing U.S. economy is truly a decisive weapon in the war on drugs. 
   I again thank my colleagues for their fine work on this measure. I also state for the RECORD that I fully support and approve incorporating their measure into the Legislation Authorization Act which is before the Senate. I also state that my colleague, the vice chairman of the Intelligence Committee, Senator KERREY, has asked I note for the Senate that he also concurs in this amendment and extends his congratulations. 
   I urge adoption of this amendment.

   Mr. SHELBY. Madam President, I have been listening in my office, before I came to the floor, to Senator KERREY's comments. While we don't agree on everything, we agree on most things working on the Intelligence Committee. 
   I want to say this about the distinguished Senator from Nebraska who is the vice chairman of the committee. We have tried to work together on very tough issues in the Intelligence Committee and tried to bring them to the floor of the Senate together--not separately. I think it says a lot when we can do this. I certainly have a lot of respect for the Senator from Nebraska and enjoy working with him. One thing about him, he is candid, and that goes a long way on anything. 
   I think we have to devote our time and our effort in the Intelligence Committee and in the Senate to what works, what works best on basic intelligence gathering, as well as counterintelligence, where there is a shortfall. 
   In that spirit, Madam President, I rise in support of the motion to proceed to consideration of H.R. 1555, the Intelligence Authorization Act of Fiscal Year 2000. 
   As chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, I am deeply disappointed that certain Members of the minority have decided to oppose this motion. I hope it will be short lived. The intelligence bill, I believe, is  a balanced, thoroughly bipartisan piece of legislation that is critical to our national security. 
   Some Senators are objecting to the Kyl-Domenici-Murkowski amendment to restructure the Department of Energy, not the underlying bill. I am a cosponsor of that amendment, as is the distinguished vice chairman of the Intelligence Committee, Senator KERREY. 
   Basically, this is essentially the same proposal that prompted a filibuster threat when it first was offered to the Defense authorization bill back before the Memorial Day recess. At that time, the argument was, ``it's too soon, it's premature, there haven't been any hearings yet.'' 
   Whatever the merit of those arguments at the time, I believe, they are wholly without merit today. The Intelligence Committee has held two open hearings on the Kyl amendment and DOE security and counterintelligence issues, including a joint hearing with the Energy, Armed Services, and Government Affairs Committees that more than 60 Senators had the opportunity to attend. The Intelligence Committee also held a detailed, closed briefing on the report of the President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board, also known as the Rudman report. 
   We heard testimony from Secretary of Energy Richardson twice, from Senator Rudman twice, and from the sponsors of this amendment. 
   I also should point out that, long before the current controversy, the Senate Intelligence Committee, on a bipartisan basis, identified problems in DOE's counterintelligence program and took steps to address those weaknesses. Most importantly, it sought to energize the Department of Energy to allocate the necessary resources, and take the necessary steps, to eliminate these vulnerabilities. 
   Since the Kyl et al amendment was first offered, the sponsors have negotiated extensively, and in good faith, with the Department of Energy in order to address the concerns that Secretary Richardson has expressed, without changing the underlying thrust of the amendment, which is to create a semiautonomous agency for nuclear security within the Department of Energy. 
   Last month, the need for action was dramatically reinforced by the publication of the Rudman report, entitled ``Science at its Best; Security at its Worst: A Report on Security Problems at the U.S. Department of Energy''--a report on security problems at the U.S. Department of Energy. 
   I commend former Senator Rudman and also Dr. Drell, and others, who were so involved in this work. 
   The Rudman report found among other things, that:  
   At the birth of DOE, the brilliant scientific breakthroughs of the nuclear weapons laboratories came with a troubling record of security administration. Twenty years later, virtually every one of its original problems persists. ..... Multiple chains of command and standards of performance negated accountability, resulting in pervasive inefficiency, confusion, and mistrust....... 
   In response to these problems, the Department has been the subject of a nearly unbroken history of dire warnings and attempted but aborted reforms.  
   Building on the conclusions of the 1997 Institute for Defense Analyses report and the 1999 Chiles Commission, the Rudman panel concluded that:  
   The Department of Energy is a dysfunctional bureaucracy that has proven it is incapable of reforming itself. ...... Reorganization is clearly warranted to resolve the many specific problems ..... in the weapons laboratories, but also to address the lack of accountability that has become endemic throughout the entire Department. 
   The panel is convinced that real and lasting security and counterintelligence reform at the weapons labs is simply unworkable within DOE's current structure and culture. ..... To achieve the kind of protection that these sensitive labs must have, they and their functions must have their own autonomous operational structure free of all the other obligations imposed by DOE management.  
   To provide ``deep and lasting structural change that will give the weapons laboratories the accountability, clear lines of authority, and priority they deserve,'' the Rudman report endorsed two possible solutions: 
   One was the creation of a wholly independent agency, such as NASA, to perform weapons research and nuclear stockpile management functions; or two, placing weapons research and nuclear stockpile management functions in a ``new semiautonomous agency within DOE that has a clear mission, streamlined bureaucracy, and drastically simplified lines of authority and accountability.'' 
   The latter option, or the second approach, is the one contained in the Kyl-Domenici-Murkowski; amendment. Examples of organizations of this type are the National Security Agency and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, DARPA, within the Defense Department. 
   The new semi-autonomous agency, the Agency for Nuclear Stewardship, would be a single agency, within the DOE, with responsibility for all activities of our nuclear weapons complex, including the National Laboratories--nuclear weapons, nonproliferation, and disposition of fissle materials. 
   This agency will be led by an Under Secretary. The Under Secretary will be in charge of, and responsible for, all aspects of the agency's work, who will report--and this is very important--who will report directly and solely to the Secretary of Energy, and who will be subject to the supervision and direction of the Secretary of Energy. The Secretary of Energy will have full authority over all activities of this agency. Thus, for the first time--yes, Madam President the first time--this critical function of our national Government will have the clear chain of command that it requires. 
   As recommended by the Rudman report, the new agency will have its own senior officials responsible for counterintelligence and security matters within the agency. These officials will carry out the counterintelligence and security policies established by the Secretary and will report to the Under Secretary and have direct access to the Secretary. It is very important that this happen. The agency will have a senior official responsible for the analysis and assessment of intelligence within the agency who will also report to the Under Secretary and have direct access to the Secretary. 
   The Rudman report concluded that purely administrative reorganizational changes are inadequate to the challenge at hand: They say: ``To ensure its long-term success, this new agency must be established by statute.'' 
   For if the history of attempts to reform DOE underscores one thing, it is the ability of the DOE and the labs to hunker down and outwait and outlast Secretaries and other would-be agents of change--yes, even Presidents. 
   For example, as documented by Senator Rudman and his colleagues, ``even after President Clinton issued Presidential Decision Directive 61 ordering that the Department make fundamental changes in security procedures, compliance by Department bureaucrats was grudging and belated.''

   I am encouraged by what appears to be some progress toward getting to this bill. I think we all are seeking--and I hope we are--the same thing: A better and more secure Department of Energy. This nation must have no less. 
   I ask my colleagues: please, do not let the Senate become the lastes obstacle to reform at the Department of Energy. 
   Stop the delay. Vote for cloture tomorrow morning, and let's get on with the business of the people and make our labs safe for our future and our country. 
   I yield the floor. 
   Mr. MURKOWSKI addressed the Chair.

    Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Coach Glenn Daniel, a dedicated man and an inspirational leader to the many football teams which he has led. The state of Alabama has been blessed with a very rich football heritage. The thought of the sport conjures images of Bear Bryant leading his famed University of Alabama teams to glory on the gridiron. Between interstate colleges and high school rivalries, there is no argument that the State's roots are firmly entrenched in the game of football. 
   It is from these roots that I pay tribute to the most successful coach in the history of Alabama high school football, Coach Glenn Daniel. With a lifetime record of 302 wins, 167 loses and 16 ties, Coach Daniel has stood the test of time and climbed countless obstacles in his relentless assault on the record books. Coach Daniel's 50-year career, spanning six decades, serves as a inspiration to the young people he coaches and as an example of the internal fortitude and a strength of character which few possess. He is truly the standard bearer for a high school coaching legend and the definition of a man dedicated to the sport of football. 
   Born on December 2, 1925, in Montgomery, Coach Daniel attended Albert G. Parrish High School in rustic Selma, Alabama. He earned a Bachelor's Degree in Education at Livingston University (now the University of West Alabama) and a Master's Degree from the University of Alabama in 1956. It was in 1947 that Glenn Daniel began his coaching career at the rural Alabama school of Pine Hill High. He was able to successfully resuscitate a football program which had been discontinued for several years due to World War II. Within 5 years of beginning his tenure at Pine Hill, he had established a perennial football powerhouse at the school. During this time, Coach Daniel lead his team to an undefeated season, while outscoring opponents 232-32 and receiving a Birmingham News regional championship. 
   Following his tenure at Pine Hill, Coach Daniel moved on to coach at Luverne High School in Luverne, Alabama. While coaching at the school for 38 years, Coach Daniel's teams finished with an astonishing 34 winning seasons. In 11 of his last 12 years, his team earned a spot in the state playoffs, including three semi-finals appearances. His remarkable 1991 team reached the ultimate promise land, winning the state 3A championship, the first in Luverne High School's history. Coach Daniel retired in 1993 and did not coach during the 1993 and 1994 seasons. However, he returned as an assistant coach for the 1995 season as Defensive Coordinator and helped his team earn a state championship in 1997. 
   Coach Daniel was named Alabama's Coach of the Year in 1981, 1987, and 1991 by various major newspapers in the state. In a coach's poll conducted in 1985, he was ranked by his peers as one of the ten best coaches in the state. In addition to these accolades, Coach Daniel served as head coach of the Alabama team in the annual Alabama/Mississippi All-Star Football Classic in 1992, and was named as Alumni Coach of the Year in 1992 by the University of West Alabama. In a fitting honor to cap his distinguished career, Coach Daniel was chosen as a member of the inaugural class of inductees into the Alabama High School Sports Hall of Fame in 1991. Mr. President, if a coaching career has ever proven deserving of these many distinctions, it is Coach Glenn Daniel.

   Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I recently introduced legislation that would amend our estate taxation laws to correct a highly unjust situation that regularly occurs throughout our country. The problem I am referring to is the difficult situation persons who inherit valuable timberland often find themselves. Because the timberland is usually the major estate asset, the estate frequently lacks the liquidity to pay the hefty tax burden. Therefore, many times persons are forced to harvest the timber or even worse, to sell portions of the land, just to be able to meet this large tax liability. 
   Besides essentially invalidating many testamentary gifts, such a tax policy creates numerous economic and ecological problems. As estate taxes are due nine months after a decedent's death, the current law strongly encourages persons to harvest the timber regardless of it's maturity, prevailing price or demand. Encouraging such behavior not only leads to economic waste, but also discourages responsible use of a valued natural resource. The decision of if and when to harvest timberlands should be made by the individual landowner after he has considered the current market, tree maturity and other relevant factors. It certainly should not be based on an uncompromising tax code that completely disregards these critical factors. 
   Mr. President, the decision to sell the land is in no way a viable alternative to premature harvesting. Selling portions of a contiguous tract leads to fragmentation of the land, which in turn can lead to legal disputes and other inefficiencies. Furthermore, wildlife and forestry conservation efforts by earlier landowners are often ignored by new owners who look to exploit the land in order to turn a quick profit. But most importantly, our tax code should never place someone in a position where they must sell a testamentary gift just to be able to pay the taxes on the transfer. Besides being inherently unfair, such a tax tramples upon the property rights of American landowners. 
   Mr. President, we must not allow the tax code to perpetuate these injustices. My bill, the Timberland Conservation and Tax Relief Act of 1999 eliminates these problems by removing mechanical and unthinking tax laws from the decision of when it appropriate to harvest American timberlands. It introduces a flexible deferred payment provision into the estate taxation scheme that will allow timberland owners to exercise their own good judgment in deciding what the most efficient use of their land would be. Furthermore, the Timberland Conservation and Tax Relief Act promotes the responsible use of our environment by no longer placing persons in a position where they must harvest immature or unneeded timber. For these reasons, I strongly urge my colleagues in the Senate to join me in support of this bill.

   Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I think we need to make a couple of things clear today about the bill before us and why it is so important to so many people. 
   First, I am a strong supporter of free trade, trade that is free and fair. I believe this bill is completely consistent with those basic principles. But while we engage in free and fair trade, many countries in the rest of the world do not abide by those same principles. We have trade laws to address this, but, as the distinguished Chair knows, they are slow to address the kind of serious economic injury that faces many companies and communities in America. 
   We can't afford to lose more industries to illegal trade practices, particularly the two we propose to offer short-term support to today: oil and gas and steel. 
   Second, I believe this is a reasonable response to a terrible crisis that threatens more than just companies but whole communities across America. This bill does not propose quotas. Indeed, it is GATT legal, and it is intended to provide only a short-term loan guarantee. 
   This is not some radical idea. Federal loan guarantees are used every day in the farm industry, the housing industry, the small business community, and for foreign countries. So let's be clear about how anathema this is to our free trade principles, because we do this all the time. 
   Third, this program is not a Federal handout or Federal grant or Federal award or Federal subsidy which Congress provides daily and, I might add, to millions of companies and organizations and industries in this country. It is a short-term loan guarantee program that provides that every dime--yes, every dime--is paid back. Contrary to some representations, the risk of the default is not that great, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Based on these calculations of cost, however, the program has also been completely offset. 
   Finally, I think it needs to be reemphasized that this program is not going to solve long-term problems that may face some companies in this industry. That is not what this is about. It is about trying to minimize the serious economic side effects that illegal trade practices have exacted on several companies in the steel industries. 
   If this program helps one company get through this tough time until our trade laws address these illegal practices, and if it saves one community in America, it will be worth it. 
   Mr. President, I believe Americans deserve to be treated fairly--and not inordinately suffer the consequences of our inability to minimize and protect against continuous and systematic illegal trade practices of other countries. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this short-term loan guarantee program, and I thank the Senators from West Virginia and New Mexico for their leadership in this area. 
   I yield the floor. 
   Mr. SESSIONS addressed the Chair.

   Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I oppose the Graham amendment as the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee. We should, as an institution, oppose all efforts to devolve the authority and the responsibility of any congressional committee to an outside group, such as this commission, when there is no compelling reason to do so, and there is certainly no compelling reason to do so in this instance at this time. 
   As my colleagues probably know, the Intelligence Committee is already  aware of the state of our counterintelligence capabilities. I have worked with the vice chairman, Senator KERREY, and other Members on both sides of the aisle, in dealing with our counterintelligence capabilities because we are engaged in the committee now in an ongoing legislative oversight of the intelligence community's approach to counterintelligence activities and espionage investigations. That is an ongoing, very much alive investigation. 
   We have a tremendous staff, I believe--and I believe the Senator from Nebraska, the vice chairman, joins me in saying this --a very able staff on the Senate Intelligence Committee that is deeply involved in a bipartisan way in this investigation. 
   The committee has recommended, and will continue to recommend as our investigation unfolds, substantive changes in this area. We are working with the majority leader, with the minority leader, and their staffs in this regard. 
   I believe the Intelligence Committee is completely capable--and I believe the vice chairman has already indicated this--of addressing this relatively small but very, very critical area within the National Foreign Intelligence Program. 
   Most important, though, this legislation presumes the 
   failure of congressional oversight, and that did not happen. It did not happen in this instance, and the Senator from Nebraska, who has just come back on the floor, was very involved as the vice chairman of this committee in pushing for more money for counterintelligence. That goes without saying. 
   The failure of congressional oversight, as far as the Intel Committee is concerned, did not happen. For nearly 10 years, the Intelligence Committee has repeatedly directed the intelligence community to improve its counterintelligence capabilities communitywide and specifically at the Department of Energy where our most precious Labs, our most important Labs are located. 
   I believe this is really a case of the executive branch failing to heed congressional warnings, and I think we will see more and more of this as the investigation unfolds. 
   Finally, counterintelligence has been a specific priority of the Intelligence Committee in the Senate and will continue to be a high priority, as it should, as long as I am chairman and as long as I am involved. 
   This amendment ignores the past and ongoing work of the Intelligence Committee in the Senate. I urge my colleagues to oppose it.

   Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise today to offer this amendment, entitled the American Bank Fairness Amendment, to S. 900, the pending bill. 
   This amendment, which, as I have said, is cosponsored by Senator DASCHLE, the minority leader, and Senators GRAMS, REED, BENNETT, EDWARDS, HAGEL, and LANDRIEU, would permit national banks to conduct equity securities underwriting and merchant banking activities in an operating subsidiary, much as their foreign bank competitors that are allowed to conduct such activities in the United States today. I note that six of the seven sponsors of this amendment are members of the Banking Committee. 
   We are talking this afternoon about defining a fair and an efficient framework to allow all--yes, all--financial institutions to better provide service to their customers in America. This country needs financial modernization. I support national modernization. 
   I have great respect for the chairman, the Senator from Texas, Mr. GRAMM, and I supported the chairman in the committee. He helped to get this bill to the floor. 
   Unfortunately, this bill does more for the institutions in the top world financial centers--New York, Hong Kong, London--than it does for the average bank that serves the average person in America. That is the issue at hand. 
   I know many of my colleagues have made up their mind on this issue. Besides, in all honesty, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, Alan Greenspan, may not even be the Chairman of the Federal Reserve after next year, although I wish that he would continue. It is often reported in the press that Laura Tyson, Alice Rivlin, or even Catherine Bessant will be the next person President Clinton nominates to the Federal Reserve Board. Therefore, I do not believe it is fair for the issues of this debate to revolve around any one individual, although it is an individual I hold in great respect. 
   The truth is, we are here today to write the laws that will determine the future of the American financial system for the next 60 years. We are talking about the issues of banking law, corporate law, industrial organization. 
   Senators GRAMS, REED, and BENNETT have been the lead proponents of the operating subsidiary for several years and they should be commended for their deep understanding of the issue and the banking expertise they bring to the Senate Banking Committee. 
   Let me say from the very beginning, this debate is not about Chairman Alan Greenspan. It should never be. As I said, I have a deep respect for Chairman Greenspan. I hold him in very high regard. He is a tremendous central banker. I am not here to dispute that in any way. 
   The operating subsidiary amendment is not about monetary policy. Let me repeat, the operating subsidiary amendment is not about monetary policy. It is not about inflation, the money supply, or even the unemployment rate. I plead with Senators to listen to the facts. The key banking committee Senators supporting this amendment are not from big cities. They are not doing this for Citigroup or Merrill Lynch, Dean Witter, or Chase Manhattan Bank. The truth is, the large financial institutions want a bill so badly, they have forced their associations to oppose this amendment based on press reports that this bill will be pulled if it passes. We all know it is the multibillion-dollar financial institutions that control the 
   associations, and they are the ones pushing this bill. 
   I just do not believe that, in passing a financial modernization bill, we should forget about the smaller, midsized, and regional banks that serve our local communities and our States. Those banks--the smaller, midsized, and regional banks--are the ones that are not being heard on this issue. They are being shut out and they have been discounted. 
   I am sorry, but I do not believe financial modernization should be only for the folks on Wall Street. I do not understand why this body would knowingly pass a financial modernization bill that would intentionally discriminate against domestic banks in favor of foreign banks. 
   If you want to talk about competition, free markets, and fair and equal treatment under the law, Senators should seriously consider the amendment that is before the Senate. The Shelby-Daschle and others amendment would provide more fair and equitable treatment of our national banks in comparison with our foreign competitors. 
   The American Bank Fairness Amendment, as we called it, would ensure  that foreign banks receive no competitive advantage over our banks here in America.

   Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I will be brief. 
   First, I point to the fifth paragraph of the Greenspan letter to Chairman GRAMM. It says, basically, that foreign bank-owned section 20 companies have substantially underperformed U.S.-owned section 20 companies. He goes on to say, ``The subsidy does not travel well.'' 
   Are you suggesting the subsidy travels from New York to 
   London but not London to New York? In other words, not from foreign banks to the United States? The Federal Reserve's own letter says the subsidy is nontransferrable. 
   Safety and soundness? In Chairman Greenspan's own words, he says:  
   My concerns are not about safety and soundness. It is the issue of creating subsidies for individual institutions which their competitors do not have. It is a level playing field issue. Nonbank holding companies or other institutions do not have access to that subsidy, and it creates an unlevel playing field. It is not a safety and soundness issue.  
   That is Chairman Greenspan's own words. 
   Lastly, is this a power grab? This legislation makes the Federal Reserve the monopoly umbrella regulator. I do not have to educate the distinguished chairman, who is a smart Ph.D. economist, on the abuses of a federally sanctioned monopoly. He has talked about it since I have known him, and he is right on that. 
   My amendment would allow for competition for banks to choose their regulator. It does not mandate that any bank in the United States must conduct such activities in an operating subsidiary. It allows the bank to choose. 
   I am sure a free market economist like Senator GRAMM understands more than I do the benefits of market discipline. Competition among regulators will not allow a national bank regulator to run amok. 
   Does Chairman Greenspan support the bill? Of course. We are granting him a monopoly. We are granting his successor a monopoly, whoever that is. I can't believe that Chairman GRAMM, a distinguished economist in his own right, is advocating a monopoly. 
   This amendment I am offering will promote competition. It promotes choice. I hope my colleagues will support it. 
   I yield back the remainder of my time.

   Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the Bryan CRA amendment. This amendment not only strikes the small rural bank exemption that we have in the Banking Committee bill and that we adopted on a bipartisan vote, but it also replaces that language with a significant expansion in CRA--the same language Chairman GRAMM and I vehemently opposed on the Senate floor this past year. 
   Community banks, as the Presiding Officer knows, by their very nature, serve the needs of their communities and do not need a burdensome Government mandate to force them to allocate credit or to originate profitable loans. And, contrary to the assertions of critics, there is no evidence whatsoever that the small bank exemption would have ``devastating consequences'' for low- and moderate-income rural communities. There remains no documented evidence to prove such an assertion, just as there is no tangible evidence that CRA has ever helped rural communities in America. 
   What is documented, though--and Chairman GRAMM has worked tirelessly to do so--is the kinds of blackmail agreements and extortion practices  that the Community Reinvestment Act enables community groups to engage in. The truth of the matter is that the small bank exemption would exempt less than 3 percent of bank assets nationwide. Thus, 97 percent of all bank assets would still be subject to the Community Reinvestment Act. 
   Just bear with me a minute on this chart. We have bank assets of $5.711 trillion. But banks above $100 million, rural and nonrural, control 97 percent of the bank assets in America. The small banks in America that we are talking about, those under $100 million in assets--there are 3,667 of them--control only $165 billion, or 2.9 percent of all the banking assets. Can you imagine? BankAmerica, for example, has $614 billion in assets. And I commend them for that. They are a well-run bank. But that is more than all 3,667 small rural banks in America put together; it is about 4 times more. So let's look at this in a realistic situation, as this chart here depicts. 
   Mr. President, critics will point out that the small rural bank exemption which I and Senator GRAMM have in the bill would exempt 3,700 banks. That is true. But to put that into context again, and to reiterate, one needs to understand that BankAmerica, as I have just shown, is four times the size of all small rural banks in America. 
   Indeed, BankAmerica possesses $614 billion in assets, or 10.7 percent of all bank assets in this country. If one looks at the list of large banks, one will soon realize that the vast majority of bank assets are concentrated in the large, multibillion-dollar banks that can most easily shoulder the burden of CRA. 
   The assertions of those who oppose the small bank exemption that we have in the banking legislation also do not comport with the comments I have received from small banks across the country. In fact, I have many letters from small bankers who complain about the burden of CRA, as well as the regulators' subjective reporting requirements dealing with CRA. 
   I would like to take a moment to read some letters from some small bankers in Alabama. I believe they have a right to be heard. I will quote from some of these. The first one says:  
   I don't think, in these small community banks, that we have to be examined by people who usually don't understand our purpose, to enforce us to service our community *.*.*. Small community banks are a Service Institution. I know because I have just completed 39 years this month. All this time in small home-owned banks that deliver services that are essential to rural life. Where services have been rendered over the years even before we knew anything about CRA.  
   That was from Charles Willmon, chairman of the First Bank of the South in the small town of Rainsville, AL. 
   I have another letter, from John Mullins, president and CEO of First Commercial Bank of Cullman, AL, which says:  
   Exempting small banks would be a wonderful opportunity for me to spend less time on unnecessary and nonproductive paperwork and more time helping the citizens of my market area improve their financial well-being ..... CRA examiners spend many unnecessary hours examining our loan track record. Banks our size are an integral part of the local community and we are always sensitive to the needs of our citizens. They are not faceless names, but people whom we know. We don't need a law to require us to help them with credit, we do it anyway.  
   I have another letter from a small banker in Clanton, AL. He is Leland Howard, Jr., of Peoples Southern Bank. He says:  
   We in the community banks feel that the CRA exception for banks with aggregate assets of $100 million or less is a very good start on the road to easing the regulatory burden.  
   I have a letter from John Hughes, CEO of First National Bank of Hartford, AL, a small town in south Alabama. He says:  
   Extra work created by the CRA is tremendous. Most rural banks know at least 95 percent of all their customers, their family, and their situation. The rating system that most examiners used is highly subjective and the rural banks have a hard time to achieve a grade higher than satisfactory. Again, it would be a great day in Alabama if you ..... could get this amendment passed.  
   Those are just a few letters, and they come from all over the Nation. 
   Mr. President, the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond published its 1994 annual report on ``Neighborhoods and Banking,'' where it reported its findings on the costs of CRA. The report found:  
   The regulatory burden [of CRA] would fall on bank-dependent borrowers in the form of higher loan rates and on bank-dependent savers in the form of lower deposit rates. And to the extent that lending induced by the CRA regulations increases the risk exposure of the deposit insurance funds, taxpayers who ultimately back those funds bear some of the burden as well.  
   The report goes on to say that, basically, the CRA imposes a tax on banks. CRA, then, is a tax on community banks and raises the costs of inputs to banks by increasing their regulatory burden and compliance costs. Mr. President, in addition, CRA forces banks to make loans according to a Federal quota, increasing the risks, and therefore the costs, of borrowing to consumers. Make no mistake about it, the Community Reinvestment Act raises the cost of borrowing through higher loan rates and punishes savers in the form of lower savings rates. 
   Critics of the small bank exemption claim that small banks get the worst CRA ratings. The truth of the matter is that one size does not fit all in any business. These critics point to lower than average loan-to-deposit ratios of small banks as evidence that they are not serving their communities. That is nonsense. That is like saying the average male wears a size 42 regular suit and that every male in America who does not fit in that size suit should be reprimanded by the Federal Government. 
   Every community in this great country is different. Most of us take pride in such diversity. That is the foundation on which this country was built. 
   However, the Community Reinvestment Act punishes banks who do not comport with national averages. Indeed, the loan demand in Prattville, AL, is not the same as in Lafayette, LA. Nor is it the same as in Shelbyville, TN. Nonetheless, CRA judges banks based largely on their loan-to-deposit ratios that the regulators deem to be appropriate. That, my friends, is nothing but a quota. When everything is said and done, CRA promotes quotas and creates a regulatory burden. 
   As if that is not bad enough, Mr. President, the Bryan amendment would also expand the reach and the scope of the Community Reinvestment Act. 
   Specifically his amendment would: 
   One, increase administrative enforcement authority of the regulators to fine directors and officers up to $1 million a day for CRA noncompliance. Just think about that. 
   Two, it would make expanded activities subject to CRA compliance on all depository institution affiliates on an ongoing basis. 
   And it would give the regulators the authority to shut down any affiliate within the holding company if just one subsidiary depository institution falls out of CRA compliance. 
   The Bryan amendment dramatically expands, Mr. President, CRA enforcement authority to allow civil money penalties for bank directors and officers, as I have pointed out. 
   The amendment would require bank holding companies who seek to become financial holding companies to be compliant with the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 just in order to be eligible. If even one subsidiary depository institution ever falls out of compliance, the holding company, including the nonbank affiliate, would then be subject to section 8 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, which is 12 U.S.C. 1818, which authorizes bank regulators to invoke cease and desist orders, civil penalties, and fines. 
   Regulators would be authorized to fine bank directors and officers up to $1 million a day. This, Mr. President, is a dramatic expansion in the enforcement authority and reach of bank regulators. 
   Such authority does not exist today. The Clinton Justice Department even agrees. 
   In late 1994, Comptroller of the Currency, Eugene Ludwig, tried to invoke the administrative enforcement powers under Section 8 of FDIA (12 U.S.C. 1818) to enforce CRA. The Justice Department issued a memorandum stating:  
   [T]o move from an enforcement scheme that relies upon a system of regulatory incentives to a scheme that entails cease-and-desist orders and potentially substantial monetary penalties is a leap that we do not believe can be justified on the basis of the text, purpose, and legislative history of CRA. We therefore conclude that enforcement under 12 U.S.C. 1818 is not authorized by CRA.   
   Bank trade associations were very pleased with the Justice Department decision. The Bankers Roundtable, the American Bankers Association, the Consumer Bankers Association, and the Savings and Community Bankers of America, filed joint letters focusing in substantial part on the regulators claims of enforcement authority. 
   The Bryan amendment also permits regulators to force divestiture since banks cannot ``retain shares of any company'' if ever out of CRA compliance. This provision also explicitly states that a bank holding company may not ``engage in any activity'' unless the institution is CRA compliant always and forever. 
   Think about it. 
   If just one subsidiary depository institution of a financial holding company falls out of compliance with CRA, the substitute authorizes the Federal Reserve Board to ``impose such limitations on the conduct or activities of the company or any affiliate of the company as the Board determines to be appropriate *.*.* '' This, too, is a dramatic expansion of enforcement authority under CRA. For the first time, regulators will be able to impose restrictions on activities throughout the entire holding company. This means a bank regulator could prohibit a securities affiliate from underwriting securities or an insurance affiliate from underwriting insurance. 
   Regulators do not have such authority today. Currently, CRA only allows regulators to prohibit the merger, acquisition or branch expansion of an institution that is not compliant with CRA. 
   Current law does not give bank regulators the authority to prohibit eligible activities of a given charter due to CRA non-compliance. The Bryan amendment requires an operating subsidiary who wants to engage in agency activities to maintain CRA compliance on all depository institution affiliates. 
   Thus, non-banking financial agency activities would be held hostage to CRA, with the bank regulators given the authority to enforce such law. This is the first time CRA has ever been expanded to cover the approval of non-depository activities. 
   I urge my colleagues to vote against the Bryan amendment and support what is in the bill. 
   I yield the floor. 
   Mr. SARBANES addressed the Chair.

   Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, there are few people in the United States Congress who are as familiar with war as is the sponsor of this joint resolution, my esteemed colleague from Arizona, Senator JOHN MCCAIN. I agree with the principles behind his resolution; that this Nation should not fight wars to a stalemate, it should fight them to win or not fight them at all. 
   Mr. President, for the past 6 weeks, American military forces have been participating in a NATO-led aerial campaign in the Balkans. In March, I voted to support the use of air power in this operation. It was my view then that the administration had already committed our forces to action. A vote against the President, when bombing was imminent, would have undercut our troops at the front. However, that is not the case with the resolution before us today. As a nation we have a choice to make. The choice should be an informed one. Our intentions in this operation have been noble and just. However, the boundaries of this conflict are not apparent to many in this body nor it seems to a majority of the American people. Before we give a blank check to the administration, I believe that the President should clearly articulate to both Congress and the American people the objectives and the national interest which require a resolution authorizing full scale war. To date he has not done so. 
   As have many of my colleagues, I have traveled to the region. I have been briefed by General Clark, spoken to troops in the field and visited refugee camps in Albania. There is no question that our military personnel are the best in the world and are doing an outstanding job under extremely difficult circumstances. However, I have grave concerns over NATO's ability to salvage the humanitarian situation through aerial bombardment and its policy of war by committee. I know that Senator MCCAIN shares this latter concern. The United States led a coalition force during the Persian Gulf war. Yet in that war it was our military leaders and not politicians in Brussels who called the shots. Mr. 
   President, we won the Persian Gulf war; we are not winning this war. My fear is that if we adopt this resolution now, it will be viewed as tacit approval of an overly bureaucratic and ineffective NATO command structure. The Senate can pass this resolution and authorize the President's ``..... use of all necessary force and other means .....'' but I fear the effect will be mitigated by the current command structure. It is a prerequisite that prior to any escalation of our involvement in this conflict, that NATO streamline its command structure and put professional soldiers back in charge. 
   A greater concern to me is the effect that this operation is having on the readiness of our military forces worldwide. Can we adequately defend South Korea, Taiwan, and Kuwait while waging a full scale war against Serbia? Some of the facts are alarming. We have no carrier battle group in the Western Pacific. The Air Force has committed one-third of its combat aircraft to the Balkans. The President has authorized the activation of over 33,000 reservists, including many Air National Guard tanker pilots from Birmingham, Alabama. The United States is still involved in an undeclared shooting war with Iraq. Last week, the administration informed the Appropriations Committee that the Nation's stated ability to simultaneously fight  and win two major regional conflicts is tenuous at best. And finally, our intelligence resources are being stretched thin due to this crisis. In short, we are pushing the envelope of our military capabilities. It begs the question: Is there a vital national interest in the Balkans which necessitates a commitment of the bulk of our limited military assets and endangers longstanding strategic interests? I don't have the answer to that question. The answer must come from the President. He must make his case for war to the Congress and American people prior to the passage of any resolution authorizing full scale war. I urge him to do so. It is his duty as the Commander in Chief. The stakes are very high. 
   I close with a reaffirmation of my support for our military forces throughout the world, especially those personnel fighting in the Balkans. Like their predecessors throughout history, the Americans who today go in harm's way wearing the uniform of their country lead a noble pursuit. Their service is not just another job as some would have us believe. Regardless of the outcome of this vote, I pledge my continued support to those soldiers, sailors, airmen, marines, and Coast Guardsmen who are in the field as I speak today. 
   This resolution authorizes the President to, ``..... use all necessary force and other means, in concert with United States allies, to accomplish United States and North Atlantic Treaty Organization objectives in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.'' I have no doubt that Senator MCCAIN knows what it takes to succeed in a military campaign. I am confident that our military leaders know what it takes to succeed in a military campaign. However, as of today, this administration has demonstrated neither the vital necessity for, nor the capacity to successfully prosecute, a full scale war in the Balkans. I urge the Commander in Chief to execute the duties of his office and make that case before Congress and the American people. Until he does so, I cannot in good conscience vote to support Joint Resolution 20.

   Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill to impose a moratorium on the foreign visitors program at the Department of Energy's (DOE) nuclear laboratories. The bill prohibits the Secretary of Energy from admitting any person from a ``sensitive country'' to our national laboratories, unless the Secretary of Energy personally certifies to the Congress that the visit is necessary for the national security of the United States. 
   A ``sensitive country'' is a country that is considered dangerous to the United States and that may want to acquire our nuclear weapons secrets. 
   Mr. President, the Senate Intelligence Committee has been critical of the Department of Energy's counterintelligence program for nearly ten years. Beginning in 1990, we identified serious shortfalls in funding and personnel dedicated to protecting our nation's nuclear secrets. Year after year, the Committee has provided additional funds and directed many reviews and studies in an effort to persuade the Department of Energy to take action. Unfortunately, this and prior administrations failed to heed our warnings. Consequently, a serious espionage threat at our national labs has gone virtually unabated and it appears that our nuclear weapons program may have suffered extremely grave damage. 
   Now, the administration has finally begun to take affirmative steps to address this problem. While I welcome their efforts, I am disappointed that it took a some bad press to motivate them rather than a known threat to our national security. Nevertheless, the Department of Energy has begun the process of repairing the damage caused by years of neglect, but it will take time to make the necessary changes. In fact, it may take years.  
   In the interim, we must take steps to ensure the integrity of our national labs. I understand that a moratorium on the foreign visitors program may be perceived as a draconian measure. Until the Department fully implements a comprehensive and sustained counterintelligence program, however, I believe that we must err on the side of caution. The stakes are too high.

   Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, in my capacity as Chairman of the Transportation Appropriations Subcommittee, I want to raise an issue of critical importance with my friend, the Chairman of the Budget Committee, Senator DOMENICI. Mr. Chairman, it has come to my attention that there is a substantial difference between the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) in terms of the estimated outlay costs of the highway and transit firewalls, as contained in the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century (TEA-21). 
   As the Chairman is aware, TEA-21 effectively established the aggregate obligation limitations pertaining to our major federal highway and transit programs for the six years covered by TEA-21. Despite the fact that the CBO and OMB are required to strive each year to minimize differences in their outlay estimates for each program in the federal government, we find that there is a dramatic difference between the outlay estimates that CBO and OMB attribute to the cost of fully funding the firewalls for highways and transit in FY 2000. Specifically, the Congressional Budget Office's estimate of the outlays associated with the highway firewall is a full $772 million higher than the amount estimated by OMB. Similarly, the CBO estimates that the outlays associated with the transit firewall is a full $569 million higher than the level assumed by OMB. Taken together, there is more than a $1.3 billion difference between the two agencies' estimates. 
   It is my understanding that, for purposes of developing this budget resolution, the Chairman assumed the lower of these outlay figures for the highway and transit firewalls. I want to inquire whether the Chairman of the Budget Committee intends to score the Transportation Appropriations Bill for FY 2000 in an identical fashion when the bill is reported by the Appropriations Committee later this year. If the Transportation Appropriations bill is scored with the much higher outlay estimates associated with the CBO estimate, it is possible that the Transportation Appropriations Subcommittee's entire outlay allocation could be needed solely to honor the highway and transit firewalls leaving little or no other resources for the needs for the Federal Aviation Administration, the Coast Guard, and the National Railroad Passenger Corporation. 
   This illustrates the danger of firewalls within budget functions. They create a perverse incentive for the Administration to underestimate the outlay impacts in order to shift budgetary resources to other priorities--but when the request comes to Congress it must be scored by CBO. Accordingly, the budget resolution and the appropriations bill run the risk of substantially higher outlay scoring on firewall accounts than the Administration assumed and accordingly must cut the firewalled functions or other discretionary programs to accommodate the increased outlays.

    Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution. This is the same amendment which I have introduced in every Congress since the 97th Congress. Throughout my entire tenure in Congress, during the good economic times and the bad, I have devoted much time and attention to this idea because I believe that the most significant thing that the federal government can do to enhance the lives of all Americans and future generations is to ensure that we have a balanced federal budget. 
   Mr. President, our Founding Fathers, wise men indeed, had great concerns regarding the capability of those in government to operate within budgetary constraints. Alexander Hamilton once wrote that ``..... there is a general propensity in those who govern, founded in the constitution of man, to shift the burden from the present to a future day.'' Thomas Jefferson commented on the moral significance of this ``shifting of the burden from the present to the future.'' He said: ``the question whether one generation has the right to bind another by the deficit it imposes is a question of such consequence as to place it among the fundamental principles of government. We should consider ourselves unauthorized to saddle posterity with our debts and morally bound to pay them ourselves.'' 
   Mr. President, I completely agree with these sentiments. History has shown that Hamilton was correct. Those who govern have in fact saddled future generations with the responsibility of paying for their debts. Over the past 30 years, annual deficits became routine and the federal government built up massive debt. Furthermore, Jefferson's assessment of the significance of this is also correct: intergenerational debt shifting is morally wrong. 
   Mr. President, some may find it strange that I am talking about the problems of budget deficits and the need for a balanced budget amendment at a time when the budget is actually in balance. However, I raise this issue now, as I have time and time again in the past, because of the seminal importance involved in establishing a permanent mechanism to ensure that our annual federal budget is always balanced. 
   Mr. President, a permanently balanced budget would have a considerable impact in the everyday lives of the American people. A balanced budget would dramatically lower interest rates thereby saving money for anyone with a home mortgage, a student loan, a car loan, credit card debt, or any other interest rate sensitive payment responsibility. Simply by balancing its books, the federal government would put real money into the hands of hard working people. In all practical sense,  the effect of such fiscal responsibility on the part of the government would be the same as a significant tax cut for the American people. Moreover, if the government demand for capital is reduced, more money would be available for private sector use, which in turn, would generate substantial economic growth and create thousands of new jobs. 
   More money in the pockets of Americans, more job creation by the economy, a simple step could make this reality--a balanced budget amendment. 
   Furthermore, a balanced budget amendment would also provide the discipline to keep us on the course towards reducing our massive national debt. Currently, the federal government pays hundreds of billion of dollars in interest payments on the debt each year. This means we spend billions of dollars each year on exactly, nothing. At the end of the year we have nothing of substance to show for these expenditures. These expenditures do not provide better educations for our children, they do not make our nation safer, they do not further important medical research, they do not build new roads. They do nothing but pay the obligations created by the fiscal irresponsibility of those whose came earlier. In the end, we need to ensure that we continue on the road to a balanced budget so that we can end the wasteful practice of making interest payments on the deficit. 
   However, Mr. President, opponents of a balanced budget amendment act like it is something extraordinary. In reality, a balanced budget amendment will only require the government to do what every American already has to do: balance their checkbook. It is simply a promise to the American people, and more importantly, to future generations of Americans, that the government will act responsibility. 
   Mr. President, thankfully the budget is currently balanced. However, there are no guarantees that it will stay as such. We could see dramatic changes in economic conditions. The drain on the government caused by the retirement of the Baby Boomers may exceed expectations. Future leaders may fall pray to the ``general propensity ..... to shift the burden'' that Alexander Hamilton wrote about so long ago. We need to establish guarantees for future generations. The balanced budget amendment is the best such mechanism available.

   Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I stand today in support of a very simple yet essential piece of legislation, the National Missile Defense Act of 1999. The bill states:  
   It is the policy of the United States to deploy as soon as is technologically possible an effective National Missile Defense system capable of defending the territory of the United States against limited ballistic missile attack, whether that attack is accidental, unauthorized, or deliberate.  
   That is all the language does. Mr. President, this bill may concern rocket science but it does not take a rocket scientist to realize the inherent necessity of this legislation for the safety of this country. 
   Currently, our nation is defenseless against the threat of ballistic missile attack. Some have shrugged their shoulders and said, ``So what, America won the cold war without a missile defense. The Soviet Union never attacked us and no one else will either.'' Yet the fact that the United States won the cold war is the very reason that America faces a new and very real missile threat today. 
   The world is not as simple in 1999 as it was during the cold war. Today, a much less stable Russia still maintains an awesome nuclear arsenal. Communist China is developing into a superpower with interests which are frequently adverse to our own. That development includes a force of ballistic missiles capable of striking the continental United States. And as we have seen in recent weeks, China is persistent in its efforts to acquire the technology necessary to make its missiles more accurate and deadly. 
   Equally disturbing, today's threat includes the use of ballistic missiles by rogue nations and terrorist groups. The disintegration of the Soviet Union has exacerbated the proliferation of missile technology and lethal payloads. Iran and North Korea are developing and testing longer range missiles. Both countries are potential adversaries in regions vital to the national interest of the United States. Both countries have ties to international terrorist groups. With proliferation rampant, these two countries will surely not be the last to acquire long range missile technology. The failure to deploy an effective national missile defense system could subject this nation to diplomatic blackmail from any rogue state or terrorist group that can purchase or steal ballistic missile technology. 
   Some have argued, as does the administration, that this bill will disrupt ongoing negotiations with Russia concerning the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty. Mr. President, if that is the case, then so be it. The ABM Treaty was signed with the Soviet Union. That state no longer exists and as such the treaty should be declared void. A number of constitutional scholars have adopted this view. Nevertheless, if it is the policy of this administration to honor the treaty, that policy should not be permitted to impede the deployment of a missile defense system. The administration can negotiate enough flexibility into the treaty to permit a viable national missile defense. 
   Mr. President, the bill we are considering states that this nation will deploy a system when it is technologically feasible. That technology is being developed as we speak and is nearly at hand. However, I would urge my colleagues in the months and years ahead to continue investment in missile defense support technology. It is an important yet often overlooked investment. Under funding support technology today will jeopardize the future effectiveness of any missile defense system. Rapid changes in technology and potential development of missile defense countermeasures by our adversaries require that this nation maintain its technological superiority. That superiority does not come without a price. However the cost of losing our technological edge is one I hope this body never has to consider. 
   Mr. President, some well intentioned opponents of this bill have stated that treaties and superior intelligence gathering will protect us from a future ballistic missile attack. This is nothing more than a gamble with the lives of the American people. Treaties have been broken throughout history. Intelligence is effective only when properly interpreted and disseminated. Ask the men of the U.S.S. Arizona at the bottom of Pearl Harbor. Intelligence collection did them little good. Mr. President, I am not willing to gamble with the lives of the American people. I continue to strongly support the National Missile Defense Act of 1999 and I urge my colleagues to do the same.

   Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleague Senator BOND, to introduce the Stealth Tax Prevention Act. Among the many powers given to Congress by the Constitution of the United States, the responsibility of taxation is perhaps the most important. The Founding Fathers rationale behind bestowing this power to Congress is that because, as elected representative, Congress remains accountable to the voters when they levy and collect taxes. Politicians are rightly held responsible to the public for producing fair and prudent tax legislation. 
   Three years ago, Mr. President, Congress passed the Congressional Review Act, which provides that when a major agency rule takes effect, Congress has 60 days to review it. During this time  period, Congress has the option to pass a disapproval resolution. If no such resolution is passed, the rule then goes into effect. 
   As you know, Mr. President, the Internal Revenue Service maintains an enormous amount of power over the lives and the livelihoods of the American taxpayers through their authority to interpret the Tax Code. The Stealth Tax Prevention Act, that Senator BOND and I are introducing along with Mr. COVERDELL, Mr. HAGEL, Mr. KYL, Mr. BURNS, Mr. GRAMM, Mr. ASHCROFT, Mr. THOMAS, Mr. ABRAHAM, Mr. GRASSLEY, Mr. HELMS, Mr. INHOFE, Mr. SESSIONS, Mr. GRAMS, Mr. COCHRAN, Mr. HUTCHINSON, and Ms. SNOWE, will expand the definition of a major rule to include, Mr. President, any IRS regulation which increases Federal revenue. Why? Because we need to return the authority of taxation to the United States Congress. 
   For example, if the Office of Management and Budget finds that the implementation and enforcement of a rule would result in an increase of Federal revenues over current practices or revenues anticipated from the rule on the date of the enactment of the statute, the Stealth Tax Prevention Act would allow Congress to review the regulations and take appropriate measures to avoid raising taxes on hard working Americans, in most cases, small businesses. 
   The discretionary authority of the Internal Revenue Service exposes small businesses, farmers, and others to the sometimes arbitrary actions of bureaucrats, thus creating an uncertain and, under certain cases, hostile environment in which to conduct day-to-day activities. Most of these people do not have lobbyists that work for them other than their elected Representatives. The Stealth Tax Prevention Act will be particularly helpful in lowering the tax burden on small business which suffers disproportionately, Mr. President, from IRS regulations. This burden discourages the startup of new firms and ultimately the creation of new jobs in the economy, which has really made America great today. 
   Americans are now paying a higher share of their income to the Federal government than at any time since the end of World War II. They, Mr. President, as you well know, pay State income taxes. They pay property taxes. On the way to work in the morning they pay a gasoline tax when they fill up their car, and a sales tax when they buy a cup of coffee. 
   Allowing bureaucrats to increase taxes even further, at their own discretion through interpretation of the Tax Code is unconscionable. The Stealth Tax Prevention Act will leave tax policy where it belongs, to elected Members of the Congress, not unelected and unaccountable IRS bureaucrats.

   Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, the legislation that abolished the Civil Aeronautics Board in 1978 and deregulated the airline industry has been a huge success. Americans are flying more, and more Americans are flying; at the same time, air fares have dropped and air travel has become safer. The average price of an airline ticket has decreased approximately 33 percent in real terms since market forces replaced the whims of federal bureaucrats in setting fares. The number of passengers flying domestic routes has more than doubled to approximately 600 million annually. It is not surprising, then, that air travel is no longer an exclusive privilege of the elite and today is accessible to most Americans. 
   While deregulation of the airline industry overall has yielded the benefits that free markets promise, there are growing pains. As the number of air passengers increases, so has the number of consumer complaints against air carriers. Some members of Congress have concluded that competition does not work for commercial aviation. They have stepped forward with proposals to reimpose federal control over air fares and carrier routes, to offer taxpayer subsidies to fledgling air carriers to compete against industry goliaths, or to levy a variety of new fines that would add to the Department of Transportation's duty the role of meter maid. We should be wary of any such effort to reintroduce the heavy hand of government under the auspices of protecting airline passengers. 
   Mr. President, lets not rush to throw out the baby with the bath water and undo twenty years of unprecedented growth and consumer savings under deregulation. Now is the time to reinvigorate competition in the air passenger market, even if the air carriers do not welcome it. The best way to increase competition is to regulate less, not more. Regulations that serve as barriers to the commercial aviation market should be removed. Regulations that promote the division of the marketplace into regional cartels should be abandoned. Regulations and FAA management practices that delay the installation of new technology that facilitates competition should be streamlined. 
   I believe that we can also increase competition in the airline industry by providing the traveling public with more useful information and by giving consumers ownership of the commodity they have purchased--their seat on an airplane. Today, I am introducing legislation that will provide passengers with greater information about their air fare and flight and with greater flexibility over unused or partially used fares. 
   The price of an airline ticket is as much a mystery as the Pyramids or the Hanging Gardens. In fact, The New York Times reported that on a single flight, passengers paid 27 different fares, ranging from $87 to $728. We should not adopt any measure that discourage air carriers from discounting fares or that chill the benefits airline consumers are now receiving. Air carriers, however, should not be allowed to continue bait-and-switch advertising. If an air carrier offers a discounted fare, my bill permits all passengers to make a confirmed reservation at that same price for a twenty-four hour period. 
   Under my bill, consumers will get more ticket and flight information. Airlines will be required to notify passengers about flight delays, cancellations, or diversions. Air carriers must also disclose if the passenger will be traveling on a carrier other than the one from whom the consumer purchased the ticket or if the flight will require the passenger to change planes. 
   At the same time, my bill will ensure that air carriers are penalized for canceling flights, bumping passengers, and holding travelers hostage on board an aircraft with inpunity. Whenever an airline passenger is unable to make a flight, the passenger will have the opportunity to board a similar flight on a standby basis. Whenever an airline cancels a flight for their convenience, it will have to offer to compensate each passenger. Whenever an airline keeps passengers on board an aircraft that sits on the tarmac for more than two hours, it will have to offer to compensate each passenger. 
   The Airline Deregulation Act of 1978 started a revolution in the airline industry, a revolution that according to a Brookings Institution study has benefitted consumers by $18.4 billion. That revolution is unfinished. I want to take the next step and promote new competition in the passenger aviation marketplace. My bill does this by taking away much of the mystery associated with flying.

   Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise today to urge my colleagues to vote in favor of the nomination of James M. Simon, Jr., to be the Assistant Director of Central Intelligence for Administration. As part of the Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1997 (S. 1718), the Senate Created the Office of the Director of Central Intelligence (ODCI), clarified the DCI's responsibilities for managing the Intelligence Community, and crated three new leadership positions in the ODCI: the Assistant Director of Central Intelligence  (ADCI) for Collection, the Assistant Director of Central Intelligence for Analysis and Production, and the Assistant Director of Central Intelligence for Administration. According to the Act, the ADCIs were to be appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate. 
   At Conference, the House agreed to create the three new positions provided that the position of Deputy Director of Central Intelligence for Community Management (DDCI/CM) also be created as a position requiring the advise and consent of the Senate. Therefore the Conference Report included the three ADCI positions and added the DDCI/CM position within he Office of the DCI. The ADCIs report directly to the DDCI/CM. This new leadership structure was enacted into law by P.L. 104-293. 
   The intent was to create a ``Goldwater-Nichols'' equivalent legislation for the intelligence Community by breaking down the barriers to effective community management erected by the very powerful directors of various intelligence agencies. In many cases, these directors act unilaterally on the day-to-day decisions concerning collection, production, and administration within the Community. On May 22, 1998, the Committee favorably reported the nomination of Joan Dempsey to be the first DDCI/CM. The Senate confirmed her on May 22, 1998. 
   A great deal of the responsibility for management improvement within the Intelligence Community will lie with the Assistant Director of Central Intelligence for Administration. Therefore, the position requires a strong and determined individual that is prepared to confront and overcome the inevitable resistance of an entrenched and calcified bureaucracy. 
   Mr. James M. Simon, Jr., a career intelligence officer, was nominated by the President to be the first Assistant Director of Central Intelligence for Administration, and the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence held open hearings on his nomination on February 4, 1999. On February 24, 1999, the Committee voted to favorably report the nomination of Mr. Simon to he full Senate. 
   Mr. Simon was born in Montgomery, Alabama on 1 July 1947. He is married to Susan Woods of Tuscaloosa, Alabama. 
   Mr. Simon was commissioned in the US Army in 1969, retiring in 1997 from the active reserve. Trained as a signal officer and in intelligence, he has commanded a SIGINT/EW company and has been operations officer of a psychological warfare battalion. He is a graduate of the Military Intelligence Officers Advanced Course, the Command and General Staff College, and has completed the Security Management Course from the national War College. 
   After discharge, Mr. Simon became a research intern at Radio Free Europe and served as teaching assistant to the Dean of the University of Southern California's Graduate Program in International Relations in Germany prior to returning to the United States to study for a Ph.D. 
   Mr. Simon has a B.A. in political science from the University of Alabama and a M.A. in international relations from the University of Southern California. He held both Herman and Earhart fellowships while pursuing a Ph.D at USC with emphasis in national security, bureaucracy, Soviet studies, and Marxism-Leninism. He has given lectures at Harvard, Cornell, Utah State, the Joint Military Intelligence College, the Command and General Staff College, the Navy War College, the Air War College, and the national War College. For two years, he taught Soviet war fighting at he Air University's course for general officers. 
   Mr. Simon left USC before completing his dissertation and joined the CIA in 1975 through its Career Training Program. He served briefly in the clandestine service before joining he Directorate of Intelligence's Office of Strategic Research as a military analyst specializing in tactics and doctrine. He served as chief of a current intelligence branch as well as of two branches concerned with Soviet military strategy, doctrine, and plans. From 1986 to 1990 he was in charge of the intelligence community organization responsible for asking the imagery constellation. In 1990, he was assigned as the senior intelligence representative to the US delegation for the Conventional Forces in Europe (CFE) Treaty in Vienna where he was principal negotiator for the Treaty's information exchange protocol. After ratification, in 1991, Mr. Simon was reassigned as Chief of ACIS Rhein Main in Frankfurt; the Community's facility responsible for the preparation, debriefing, and reporting of information gained by arms control inspection teams throughout Europe. In 1993, Mr. Simon became chief of a division in the Office of European Analysis and in 1996 was named Chief of the Collection Requirements and Evaluation Staff. 
   The Intelligence Committee believes that Mr. Simon is well qualified for this new position. Accordingly,I again urge my colleagues to support this nomination and vote in favor of the Nominee.

   Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Soldiers', Sailors', Airmen's, and Marines' Bill of Rights Act of 1999. 
   The Joint Chiefs of Staff and many members of this body have expressed concern over the state of our military forces. One of the most serious problems identified by the Joint Chiefs is the recruitment and retention of dedicated and highly trained personnel. This legislation begins the process of rectifying that situation. Our Armed Forces must not only be able to fight and win on the battlefield, they must be able to compete for high quality personnel against robust private sector employers. I am proud to say that this bill gives our military a much more equitable chance to recruit and retain the best persons this country has to offer. 
   This legislation authorizes a significant and long overdue military pay raise. It enhances two long time staples of recruitment and retention; the military retirement system and the Montgomery G.I. bill. It authorizes a subsistence allowance for enlisted personnel so that no military member will be forced to live on food stamps. Finally, I am very pleased that this bill includes an authorization for military personnel to participate in a Thrift Savings Plan similar to the plans afforded other non-uniformed Federal employees. 
   Mr. President, the bill which I stand in support of today should be considered as a beginning. Congress has an explicit constitutional duty to see that the Armed Forces are equipped and maintained. Their unique task is daunting and at times life threatening. The Congress and this administration should not treat military service as just another job. This bill represents the Senate's view that the personnel of America's Armed Forces are worth a significant investment. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation. 
   To every member of our Armed Forces, whether afloat, ashore or airborne, wherever they are in the world, I say thank you and well done!

    Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Daniel Pratt, a distinguished Southern Industrialist and founder of the city of Prattville, Alabama. A man whose vision guided the state on a course of industrialization and modernization. As a celebration of Daniel Pratt's 200th birthday, 1999 has been named the ``Year of Industry'' in Alabama. This is a significant tribute to honor a very important figure in the history of Alabama. Daniel Pratt's legacy not only includes the beginning of modern industry to the state, but also philanthropic deeds that were unrivaled for his era. Daniel Pratt's indomitable pioneer spirit serves as an inspiration to others who have faced adversity and conquered the unknown. 
   Born in 1799, Daniel Pratt was raised in Temple, New Hampshire. Brought up as a Congregationalist in a traditional Puritan family, Daniel Pratt grew up disciplined, structured, and religious. He received only a limited education, but took advantage of an opportunity to apprentice under a family friend, who was an architect and a builder. This new focus in his life helped to channel his natural inclination towards machinery and building. After his mother's death in 1817, Daniel Pratt acted on his ambitions and set out for the South, which he regarded as a land of opportunity. Daniel Pratt's formative years instilled in him a strong work ethic and religious convictions, along with a sense of compassion. These two attributes would help to guide him through difficult decisions throughout his life. 
   After sailing to Savannah, Georgia, Daniel Pratt did not immediately become a rich entrepreneur. Initially, he put the tools of his apprenticeship to work as a builder and planner for wealthy planters. After a few years, he moved onto ship building, adding to his burgeoning knowledge of construction and the industrial process. Daniel Pratt was willing to take the long road to success. He realized that the only way to succeed in life was through hard work and gritty determination. He also had the common sense to learn from others, which paid off when he befriended Samuel Griswold, who was a prominent cotton gin manufacturer in the area. Through friendship as well as a business relationship, Daniel Pratt learned the trade which would ultimately thrust him into the forefront of Southern industrialization. Daniel Pratt proved to be so adept at the manufacture and sale of cotton gins, that he became a partner in the enterprise within a year. At this point in his life, Daniel Pratt's unbridled vision was able to manifest itself in his actions. He saw that the expansion of the cotton gin into the West was a fantastic opportunity for his new enterprise. He realized that the center of distribution in the South would revolve around the great river systems which offered the advantage of water as a cheap source of power. Pratt had planned to stay in business with his partner, but with Indian uprisings in the Alabama area, his partner became apprehensive. This did not deter Daniel Pratt in the slightest. As his first biographer, Shadrack Mims wrote: ``The indomitable will of Daniel Pratt, that spirit of enterprise which characterized him through life, was not to be daunted nor discouraged by Indian uprisings. He purchased material for fifty gins, put the same on wagons, and in 1833, he with his brave wife headed for Alabama.'' 
   Daniel Pratt rapidly met the success he foresaw in his move to Alabama. He found quick sales among the planters of the Alabama Black Belt. He established a temporary site for his factory along Autauga Creek and immediately began to expand his operations. Within a period of five years, it was evident that he needed a larger area for a permanent site. He chose to settle on a marshy, heavily wooded piece of land only three miles from his original site. In only ten years, he turned this hostile area into a thriving manufacturing village of eight hundred people. This is the site that would eventually form the booming industrial town of Prattville. 
   Initially, the Gin Factory was the corner stone of the economy in the new settlement. But as business grew, Daniel Pratt reinvested the profits into new industries in the town. By the 1850's, Prattville, for its size, furnished the most diverse industrial pattern in the United States. In addition, the Pratt Gin Company became the largest gin factory in the world, with unrivaled quality in construction. Daniel Pratt's business was so successful, that he began to invest money in the state infrastructure. He presided over railroad conventions and sparked Southern railroad growth with his generous infusion of capital. 
   Daniel Pratt also used his good fortune to invest in the Red Mountain Iron and Coal Company, and he controlled the Oxmoor iron furnaces in the Birmingham Industrial district. In his honor, the great vein of coal west of Birmingham was named the Pratt Vein, and Pratt City was later incorporated into the town of Birmingham. These furnaces were destroyed by Wilson's Raiders during the Civil War, but Daniel Pratt was determined to rebuild them. With the help of his son-in-law, Henry Debardeleban, he did just that, and by 1873, they were back in operation. The name was changed to the Eureka Mining Company, and the towns of Birmingham and Bessemer began to thrive. Daniel Pratt is credited with being one of the driving forces behind the development of that entire area of the state. 
   In 1847, the University of Alabama awarded him the degree of Master of Mechanical and Useful Arts, the only one of it's kind the University has ever given. Pratt also served as a distinguished member of the Alabama House of Representatives throughout the duration of the Civil War. 
   However, it was Daniel Pratt's philanthropic deeds which set him apart from other industrialists of his time. Pratt built schools and churches for workers in his textile mill with his own money. His boundless paternalism towards his workers led him to teach in Prattville's Sunday Schools. It was his sincere desire to better both the town of Prattville as well as the entire South through his relentless efforts to preach the industrial gospel. He wrote numerous letters and articles professing his industrialist beliefs, which were published in southern newspapers and periodicals across the area.  
   Although born 200 years ago, Daniel Pratt serves as a shining example of a pioneer spirit which transformed the South into a thriving industrial center. His leadership, vision, courage, and generosity is an inspiration to everyone.

    Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1999. This bipartisan bill is designed to help America's energy consumers by repealing an antiquated law that is keeping the benefits of competition from reaching our citizens. I am pleased to be joined by Senator DODD, Senators GRAMM and SARBANES, Chairman and Ranking Member of the Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs, Senator MURKOWSKI, Chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, Majority Leader LOTT, and Senators MACK, CRAIG, and BROWNBACK in introducing this important legislation. Our bill, which is identical to legislation voted out of the Senate Banking Committee with bipartisan support in the 105th Congress, repeals the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 (PUHCA). 
   The original PUHCA legislation passed over 60 years ago in 1935. At that time, a few large holding companies controlled a great majority of the electric utilities and gas pipelines. No longer is a majority of the utility service offered by so few a provider. In fact, over 80 percent of the utility holding companies are currently exempt from PUHCA. 
   This legislation implements the recommendations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) made first in 1981 and then again in 1995 following an extensive study of the effects of this antiquated law on our energy markets. In the 1995 report entitled, ``The Regulation of Public-Utility Holding Companies,'' the Division of Investment Management recommended that Congress conditionally repeal the Act since ``the current regulatory system imposes significant costs, indirect administrative charges and foregone economies of scale and scope .....'' 
   The regulatory restraints imposed by PUHCA on our electric and gas industries are counterproductive in today's global competitive environment and are based on historical assumptions and industry models that are no longer valid. Repeal will not create regulatory gaps; the ability of the States to regulate holding company systems, together with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's powers under the Federal Power Act and the Natural Gas Act render PUHCA redundant 
   Our bill assures the FERC and the States access to the books and records  of holding company systems that are relevant to the costs incurred by jurisdictional public utility companies. As a result, the regulatory framework to protect consumers is not only protected in this bill, but enhanced. 
   In the competitive environment that we now find ourselves, it is imperative to remove a major bottleneck that constrains the ability of American gas and electric utilities to compete. 
   This bill has been reported out of the Senate Banking Committee in the last two Congresses, but due to time constraints, was never voted on in the full Senate. I am confident that we have the votes to pass this legislation this session. While it is unclear that a sufficient consensus exists to ensure legislative progress on comprehensive reform of the electric and gas industry, it is very clear that the first step to comprehensive reform is the repeal of PUHCA. I am pleased to announce, Mr. President, that a broad consensus for PUHCA repeal does exist, and the Senate should act on this very important legislation as soon as possible.

    Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to increase the retirement benefits for military personnel by allowing them to participate in the Thrift Savings Plan (TSP). 
   Many of us are concerned about the current state of readiness in our military forces, and rightly so. In the last decade, the number of Americans wearing their nation's uniform has decreased precipitously along with the funding that pays for their weapons, aircraft, ships, wages, housing, and benefits. Tragically, as the defense budget withers, our military's operational tempo soars. Overseas deployments have steadily increased in number, scope, and duration. Our troops are working harder than ever and yet, we have failed to support them. In addition to inadequately funding much needed weapons modernization, we have kept their wages low and slowly eroded their benefits. As we make it less and less attractive to serve, we  will not be able to recruit high quality people and those that now serve will continue to leave. Recruiting and retention are the backbone of our military services. Without either there is no readiness. Our service men and women are being stretched to the breaking point, and they are voting with their feet. We must act now. 
   Senior Pentagon officials have determined that retirement benefits are a key consideration in the decision to pursue a military career and therefore are critical to the retention of our best people. Because of reduced retirement benefits--commonly referred to as ``Redux''--an increasing number of mid-career personnel are deciding to leave the military. In recent testimony to the Senate, General Henry Shelton, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, stated that ``that is why, among a number of pressing needs, reforming military retirement and military pay remains the Joint Chiefs' highest priority.'' 
   The bill I am introducing today is simple and straightforward. It shores up the military retirement system by allowing military personnel to supplement direct benefits through participation in the Thrift Saving Plan (TSP). This legislation will provide ALL military personnel a retirement benefit that is available to federal employees and all of us in the Senate and our staffs. Furthermore, the inherent flexibility of TSP will give military personnel and their families greater control over their retirement benefits. For these reasons, this legislation is a priority for the leadership in the Senate. 
   Specifically, my bill will allow members of the armed services to contribute up to 5 percent of basic pay in a tax-deferred individual account where the funds are held in trust and invested and can later be withdrawn at retirement. As an additional incentive for a military career, personnel will be qualified to contribute up to 10 percent of their basic pay after 10 years of service. As is the case with the Federal Employee Retirement System (FERS), the government would provide up to 5 percent to match the individual's contribution. 
   So often we marvel over our high-tech weapons systems and we forget that they are useless without highly skilled and professional Americans to operate them. If the services continue to hemorrhage qualified people at current rates, there will be a reckoning the magnitude of which we are not prepared to endure. We must take action now to slow the exodus of qualified personnel from the military. I believe that this bill will be a powerful tool to assist the services in retaining personnel, and I urge my colleagues to cosponsor this legislation.

    Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in support of legislation that I am introducing which is intended to prevent foreign nationals from making financial contributions to federal elections. 
   Last October, in the trial of Charlie Trie, Judge Paul L. Friedman ruled that the Federal Election Campaign Act (FECA) does not prohibit foreigners from making campaign donations to political parties or Congressional Campaign Committees. The holding of this case is based on an extremely narrow reading of the language of the FECA. Judge Friedman ruled that because the FECA specifically prohibits foreign nationals from making direct contributions to the campaigns of candidates for federal office but does not specifically prohibit donations, or ``soft money'' expenditures to the parties, such donations are not prohibited by the FECA. While we can argue the merits of this decision and question whether it merely tracks the letter rather than the entire spirit of the FECA, it is quite clear that this ruling opens up our system of federal elections to the possibility of foreign influence. 
   My bill clarifies the law by amending the FECA to prohibit donations by foreign nationals to ``a national committee of a political party or a Senatorial or Congressional Campaign Committee of a national political party for any purpose.'' This new provision along with the existing prohibition of direct contributions by foreign nationals, will provide the Federal Election Commission with the ability to prosecute those who illegally attempt to influence federal elections. Ultimately, my bill will get us closer to achieving the desired effect originally contemplated by the FECA--ensuring that federal campaigns are free of foreign money. 
   Mr. President, regardless of any member's views concerning the direction that campaign finance reform should take, I believe that amending the FECA to prohibit foreign influence in federal campaigns requires swift action.
