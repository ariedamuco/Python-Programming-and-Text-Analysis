 Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Coast Guard Authorization Act. 
Since 1790 the U.S. Coast Guard and its predecessor services have done a truly outstanding job of protecting America's coasts and maritime interests. Today, the Coast Guard is recognized as the `Premier Maritime Service in the World' and a model of efficiency within the federal government. 
Despite drastic reductions in resources and personnel over the last several years, the result of government downsizing and shrinking budgets, the Coast Guard has admirably maintained a high level of service. The Coast Guard has met the challenges of a growing number of missions while continuously improving performance in its existing mission areas of law enforcement, maritime safety, marine environmental protection, and national security. With personal strength at the lowest level since 1967, and the smallest fleet of aircraft and seagoing cutters since 1989, the men and women of the Coast Guard continue to provide outstanding service to our nation. Since 1992, the number of fisheries boarding conducted by Coast Guard personnel has increased by 62%. Since 1983, the number of undocumented migrants interdicted by the Coast Guard has grown by 635%. Last year, arrests of cocaine traffickers were up 1000%, and cocaine seizures were triple the previous year. Through these incredible interdiction efforts, the Coast Guard kept more than 468 million cocaine `hits' and 100 million marijuana `joints' off American streets last year. The estimated street value of these seizures is more than $4.2 billion--$1 billion more than the Coast Guard's entire 1997 discretionary budget. 
The return on investment provided to the American taxpayer by the Coast Guard is not unique to its drug enforcement mission. In the area of Search and Rescue alone, the Coast Guard provided the American public with a 4-to-1 return on investment last year represented by 5,000 lives saved and 65,000 persons assisted. Further, Coast Guard prevention efforts have contributed to a 50% reduction in major oil spills over the past 10 years and a 43% decline in recreational boating deaths since 1970. 
Mr. President, many in this country have no knowledge of the U.S. Coast Guard. Many do not realize the Coast Guard operates throughout the world and, in addition to its many other missions, is this nation's fifth armed service. Many do not realize that the U.S. Coast Guard participated extensively in the Persian Gulf War and, in fact, still has personnel in the Persian Gulf enforcing the embargo against Iraq, as well as in other `hot spots' around the world. Coast Guard cutters, aircraft and personnel routinely deploy throughout the world in support of Coast Guard missions ranging from search and rescue, law enforcement, and environmental protection to ice breaking, port security, and vessel safety. 
Mr. President, the U.S. Coast Guard is an agency in which the U.S. should invest, not divest. This bill authorizes adequate funding and includes other provisions to allow the Coast Guard to continue to carry out its important work. For these reasons, I urge the passage of this important measure.

Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, since taking my oath of office in January of 1963, I have had the high privilege of serving with 323 senators. Among them were some of the giants we read about in history books, Richard Russell of Georgia, Everett Dirksen of Illinois, Mike Mansfield of Montana, and John Stennis of Mississippi. 
I have served with men and women of great moral strength and high intellect, but, of the 323 senators, I shall always look upon one person as my `best friend'--Senator Wendell Ford. 
How does one become a best friend of a stranger? I had some knowledge of Wendell before he was elected, because I was then a member of the Senate Campaign Committee and serving as the Secretary of the Democratic Caucus. I knew that he was a former State Senator, Lieutenant Governor, and the 49th Governor of the Commonwealth of Kentucky before he was elected to the Senate. I also knew that he was one of the most popular Presidents of the U.S. Junior Chamber of Commerce. 
When I first met Wendell in early 1974, I immediately liked what I saw. 
I could see that he was `truth in packaging' personified. There were no fancy frills, or bells, or ribbons around him. He was down to earth. He obviously loved his constituents and without question, understood them. Immediately, I concluded that he was a `man of the people.' Soon, I found myself serving with him on two important Committees--the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation and the Committee on Rules and Administration. 
Whenever he stood and raised his voice to defend, advocate, oppose, or support a measure, you knew that it related to people. 
Therefore, I was not surprised when he became the prime mover of the National Voter Registration Act which would ensure that every American who was of age, qualified and wanted to vote was given the opportunity to do so. He took away all of the obstacles that stood in their path. 
He also made certain that when a worker's spouse was ill at home, he or she was given the right to be with their loved ones in their time of great need. He knew what it was to be a husband and a father. And he knew what it meant to comfort wives and children in time of need. When Wendell became the Chairman of the Aviation Subcommittee, first and foremost on his agenda was passenger safety. 
He was always ready to carry the banner for the working man and woman. And during the recent tobacco legislation debates, Wendell's voice was one of the very few that spoke out for the tobacco farmer. His concern was not for the wealthy Chief Executive Officers. His concern was for the poor farmer who had to struggle, day in and day out, to eke out a livelihood. 
Wendell also spoke out for the miners who worked in the deep coal mines, and for those who had been discriminated against in employment because of their age. He was a `work horse,' never a `show horse.' When others would give eloquent speeches on cutting the cost of government, he did something about it. He led the movement to adopt a two-year budget, thereby saving millions of dollars by streamlining our budgetary process. 
He introduced the measure that is responsible now for using recycled printing paper by the federal government, thus saving millions of dollars. After all, the paperwork of the federal government today, with all the technological advances, still uses more than 480,000 tons of paper annually. However, before Wendell Ford got into the act, it was nearly double that amount. 
As a politician, he wanted to make certian that campains were carried out without corruption and without impediments. He streamlined voter registration procedures, and did everything to increase voter participation in federal elections. 
Wendell Ford's departure from the Senate will leave a huge void in the committee rooms and in the Senate Chamber. It is difficult for me to imagine that next year we will not hear his voice rising to defend the working man and woman. 
We will not hear his voice to insist upon safety for our traveling public. And we will not hear his voice for good and clean government. I hope that the people of Kentucky will someday come to the realization that they and the people of this nation were blessed with the service of Wendell Ford. 
Winston Churchill just prior to his retirement from active government service said, `Service to the community is the rent we pay for living on this earth.' Wendell Ford has been paying his rent throughout his life. 
It will be difficult for me to say goodbye to my good friend. It will be difficult no matter how good a person his successor may be, to fill his `huge boots.' 
But most importantly, I agree with my wife, Maggie, that what makes Wendell a good husband, a good father, and decent human being is the fact that he had the good sense to marry his beloved Jean. Without Jean, Kentucky and our nation would have been denied the great service of Wendell H. Ford. 
Wendell and Jean, you have my best wishes for continued happiness and fulfillment in the bright years ahead. We shall miss you immensely.

 Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise today to bring my colleagues' attention to a very exciting expedition. Last month, Mr. Michael `Mick' Bird completed the second leg of an unprecedented 24,000 mile voyage around the world. On August 19, 1997, Mick Bird started rowing out to sea from Fort Bragg, California in his vessel Reach. After 66 days of rowing, on October 23, 1997, Mick arrived in Hilo Bay on the Big Island of Hawaii. 
After putting the Reach in drydock in Hawaii, Mick returned to his home base in California to raise support and prepare for the next leg of his historic journey. Mick returned to Hawaii this Summer and put to sea in Reach on July 18, 1998 rowing for the Gilbert Islands, about 2,500 miles southwest of Hawaii and the halfway point between Hawaii and Australia. On September 22, 1998, 66 days and more than 2,200 miles from Hawaii, Mick made land fall on Majuro in the Marshall Islands, a bit north of his intended destination in the Gilberts. Mick is now happily home in California with his family preparing for his next leg to the north central coast of Australia; another 2,500 mile row. 
Mick Bird, a former U.S. Air Force officer, is of Pacific Island descent and has family ties to the State of Hawaii. His voyage is more formally known as Trans-Oceanic, which is the name of the non-profit organization sponsoring this attempt at the world's first solo circumnavigation of the globe by a rowing vessel. The goals of this expedition are, among others, to explore the limits of the human spirit, to raise awareness about ocean ecosystems, to be an example of individual achievement as well as teamwork, and to generate support for The National Tuberous Sclerosis Association. The expedition is also using its World Wide Web sites (www.naau.com and www.goals.com/transrow) to create a direct link between Mick's vessel Reach and educators and students to share experiences and practical applications of math, science and geography. 
I would like to congratulate Mr. Bird on his very impressive accomplishments to this point, and to express my good wishes for the safety and success of the rest of this voyage around the world. I also wish to commend him and Trans-Oceanic for enhancing public awareness and education. I encourage my colleagues to have a look at Trans-Oceanic's web sites and share them with educators at home to follow along with this amazing journey.

Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise to speak in strong support of this conference agreement. Chairman Stevens has once again done an extraordinary job in moving this bill forward while protecting the interests of the Senate, and supporting our Nation's defense. 
Quite often when we talk about defense we highlight the investment items such as tanks and missiles and ships and fighting aircraft. Mr. President, while these are all important, and in fact critical to ensuring a strong defense, whenever you meet commanders in the field, each one will tell you that the most important element of our defense is the men and women who are willing to serve us. 
There are 1,396,000 men and women in the Active Forces and another 877,000 in our National Guard and Reserve. This represents less than 1 percent of our population. And they are the ones who are willing to sacrifice everything to stand in harm's way to defend all the rest of us. 
Mr. President, we should be very grateful for their willingness to serve and, most important, we should demonstrate our gratitude by ensuring that they receive adequate compensation, good housing and quality medical care. 
In this bill, we have made some progress on each of these fronts. 
First, the bill provides for a 3.6 percent pay raise, one-half percent higher than requested by the administration. 
Second, the conferees have added $505 million to cover real property maintenance needs for barracks and housing for our military personnel and their families. 
Third, the bill has added $500 million for supporting our bases to make sure that there is enough money to adequately operate the bases. 
Finally, we have fully funded the Defense Health Program. 
Mr. President, many of us have a real concern that our military no longer believes that we are doing enough to respond to their needs. 
Last May, our chairman led a delegation to the Persian Gulf. It was very clear from the men and women with whom we spoke that there is growing dissatisfaction in our military with their working and living conditions, and pay. 
We have tried to address these within the funding constraints that we face, but we believe more needs to be done. 
We know we do not have all the answers on the best approach to fix this problem. 
Therefore, the conferees have directed the Defense Department to review all aspects of its compensation package, from recruiting incentives to retirement, including all quality of life programs. 
It is the intent of the managers that the Defense Department conduct this review in the next 3 months and provide the Congress with its recommendations in conjunction with its budget submission for fiscal year 2000. 
Mr. President, this is a good package. The bill provides more money in title II for operation and maintenance than was requested by the President. It does a great deal to help our men and women in uniform, not as much as we would like, but more than DOD requested. 
Considering the tough financial climate that we are living in, I must commend our chairman for forging this agreement and thank his staff too for their great assistance. 
Mr. President, this is a good package, I recommend it to all of my colleagues. 
Mr. President, I understand there is some concern regarding section 8115 in this conference report. It was my understanding that the provision regarded the deployment of additional ground troops to Yugoslavia, Albania, and Macedonia. We hope that those responsible for interpreting this legislation will understand this when they respond to this provision. 
Mr. President, before I close, may I add my commendation to the extraordinary work of our staff, led by Steve Cortese and Charlie Houy.

Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President. I would like to add my expression of support in this area to that articulated by the junior Senator from Alaska. I was pleased to work with my colleagues in the conference committee to shape this important provision. I look forward to reviewing this report from the Department of Defense early next year. I, too, believe that it is particularly important to focus on the qualitative balance now in 1998 as compared to that which existed in 1979, when Congress enacted the Taiwan Relations Act, with its Section 3 provisions regarding continued military sales to the Republic of China on Taiwan.

Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I, too, would like to thank the Senator from Massachusetts for his remarks. I have also supported funding for photonics research in the past. In the future, most of our weapons systems will depend on photonics for their effectiveness. If we are to maintain our competitive advantage, we must maintain an advantage in photonics research. I would also agree with the Senator from Alaska and his explanation of our Committee's legislative intent in providing additional funding for the Photonics Research Center.

Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the late Mrs. Minal Kumar, who throughout her exceptional career dedicated herself to public service. Mrs. Kumar's extraordinary humanitarian efforts and outstanding contributions have improved the lives of women, children and infants in Hawaii. 
As the sole nutritionist on the Island of Kauai for the State of Hawaii Department of Health's Women, Infants and Children program, Mrs. Kumar nearly tripled the program's caseload in six years. She opened clinics in the outlying areas of the underserved communities of Hanalei, Kilauea and Waimea, and was the first nutritionist to serve the Island of Niihau. The central theme of her work was encouraging and supporting mothers to breast feed their children, the infant feeding method recommended to improve the health of infants. 
In remembrance of her many accomplishments, her co-workers have built a garden at the Hawaii Department of Health's Kauai District office and a memorial fund in her name has been established by Hawaii Mothers' Milk, Inc. I ask my colleagues to join me in paying tribute to the late Minal Kumar for all she has done for the people of Hawaii.

 Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, the U.S.-Asia Institute, a non-profit organization, recently completed its 40th Congressional Staff Delegation to China and Hong Kong in cooperation with the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs (CPIFA). I am pleased to bring this milestone to the attention of the Senate. 
The Institute's commitment to promoting friendship and understanding between countries in Asia and the U.S. government goes back almost 20 years. Founded in 1979 by Esther Kee, Norman Lau Kee, and Joji Konoshima, the U.S.-Asia Institute has been steadily working to achieve its goal through international conferences, seminars, student exchange programs, and Congressional staff trips to Asia. 
Among its numerous activities in support of cultural understanding, the U.S.-Asia Institute's Congressional staff trip program to China and Hong Kong is unrivaled. Since its inception in 1985, the China program has hosted more than 320 Congressional staff members in numerous places throughout China--from Heihe in the North on the Russian border to Hainan in the South; from the dynamic coastal cities of Shanghai and Guangzhou to the remote city of Urumqi, an oasis on the ancient Silk Road; and to the capital, Beijing. Over 150 Congressional offices have benefited from the intense, hectic, fact finding programs that provide Congressional staff members a unique opportunity to observe this dynamic nation first-hand and to further their understanding of complex Sino-U.S. relations. This program has survived the sometimes tumultuous relationship between the two countries thanks to the steadfast commitment of the U.S.-Asia Institute and the CPIFA to promote dialog on issues of mutual interest to our two great nations. 
I congratulate the U.S.-Asia Institute and CPIFA for their remarkable achievements and hope their longstanding partnership will continue into the 21st century.

Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise today, as I have in prior years, to oppose the amendment proposed by my colleague, the Senator from Wyoming, Senator Enzi. 
Mr. President, I have had the privilege of serving on the Committee on Indian Affairs for over 20 years. And I believe that in order to fully appreciate and understand the matter before us, a brief review of the history of our relationship with Indian country might help, because over the course of those 20 years, I have learned a bit about the state of Indian country and the pervasive poverty which is both the remnant and result of too many years of failed Federal policies. 
Mr. President, there was a time in our history when the native people of this land thrived. They lived in a state of optimum health. They took from the land and the water only those resources that were necessary to sustain their well-being. They were the first stewards of the environment. And those who came later found this continent in pristine condition because of their wise stewardship. 
Even after the advent of European contact, most tribal groups continued their subsistence way of life. Their culture and their religions sustained them. And, Mr. President, they had very sophisticated forms of government, so sophisticated and so clearly efficient and effective over many centuries that our Founding Fathers could find no other better form of government upon which to structure the government of a new nation, the United States of America. 
So our Founding Fathers--Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson--adopted the framework of the Iroquois Confederacy, a true democracy, and it is upon that foundation that we have built this great Nation. But, unfortunately, there came a time in our history when those in power decided that the native people were an obstacle, an obstruction to the new American way of life and later to the westward expansion of the United States. 
So our Nation embarked upon a course of terminating the Indians by exterminating them through war and the distribution of blankets infected with smallpox. 
We nearly succeeded in wiping them out. Anthropologists and historians estimate that there were anywhere from 10 million to 50 million indigenous people occupying this continent at the time of the European contact. By 1849, when the United States finally declared an end to the era known as the Indian wars, we had managed to so efficiently decimate the Indian population that there were a mere 250,000 native people remaining in the lower 48. 
Having failed in that undertaking, we next proceeded to round up those who survived, forcibly marched them away from their traditional lands, and across the country. Not surprisingly, these forced marches--and there were many of these trails of tears--further reduced the Indian population because many died along the way. 
Later, we found the most inhospitable areas in the country on which to relocate the native people and expected them to scratch out a living there. Of course, we made some promises along the way; that in exchange for tribal lands in the millions of acres we would provide them with education--at least we promised them education--health care and shelter. 
We told them, often in solemn treaties, that these new lands would be theirs in perpetuity. There are many wonderful treaties in our archives, some that begin with phrases: 
As long as the sun rises in the East and sets in the West, and waters flow from the mountain tops to the sea, this land is yours. 
We promised them that their traditional way of life would be protected from encroachment by non-Indians and that we would recognize their inherent right as sovereigns to retain all powers of government not relinquished. Their rights to hunt, fish, gather food, to use the waters that were necessary to sustain life, were also recognized as preserved in perpetuity for their use. 
But over the years, these promises and others were broken by our National Government, and our vacillations in policies, of which there were many, left most reservation communities in economic ruin. 
It grieves me to repeat this, but there were 800 treaties solemnly entered into by the Government of the United States and the leaders of Indian country--800. It was the responsibility of this body, the U.S. Senate, to ratify these treaties. Mr. President, 430 of them were ignored. They lie in our files at this moment; 370 were ratified by the U.S. Senate. And of the 370, we proceeded to violate every single one of them. 
The cumulative effects of our treatment of the native people of this land have proven to be nearly fatal to them. Poverty in Indian country is unequal anywhere else in the United States. The desperation and despair that inevitably accompanies the economic devastation that is found today in Indian country accounts for the astronomically high rates of suicide and mortality from diseases. For Indian youth between the ages of 18 and 25, the rate of suicide is 14 times the national norm of the United States. 
Within this context, along came an opportunity for some tribal governments to explore the economic potential of gaming. It didn't prove to be a panacea, but it began to bring in revenues that tribal communities didn't have before. Then the State of California entered this picture by bringing a legal action against the Cabazon Band of Mission Indians, a case that ultimately made its way to the Supreme Court. 
Consistent with 150 years of Federal law and constitutional principles, the Supreme Court ruled that the State of California could not exercise its jurisdiction on Indian lands to regulate gaming activities. 
This was in May of 1987. In the aftermath of the Supreme Court's ruling, we got into the act, the Congress of the United States. During the 100th session of the Congress, I found myself serving as the primary sponsor of what is now known as the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act of 1988. There were many, many hearings and many, many drafts leading up to the formulation of the bill that was ultimately signed into law. 
Initially, our inclination was to follow the well-established and time-honored model of Federal Indian law which was to provide for an exclusively Federal presence in the regulation of gaming activities on Indian lands. The Constitution and the laws of our land say the relationship will be between the Federal Government and the Indian government. Such a framework would have been consistent with constitutional principles, with the majority of our Federal statutes addressing Indian country, and would have reflected the fact that as a general proposition, it is Federal law, along with tribal law, that governs most all of what may transpire in Indian country. 
But State government officials--Governors, attorneys general--came to the Congress, demanding that a role in the regulation of Indian gaming be shared with them. Ultimately, we acquiesced to those demands. After much thought, many hearings, much debate, the Congress of the United States selected a mechanism that has become customary in dealings amongst sovereign governments. 
This mechanism, a compact between a State government and a tribal government, would be recognized by the Federal Government as the agreement between two sovereigns as to how the conduct of gaming on Indian lands would proceed. 
The Federal participation in the agreement would be accomplished when the Secretary of the Interior approved the tribal-State compact as part of the law. In an effort to ensure that the parties would come to the table and negotiate a compact in good faith, and in order to provide for the possibility that the parties might not reach agreement, we also provided a means by which the parties could seek the involvement of the Federal district court, and if ordered by the court, could avail themselves of a mediation process. It is not for the Indian leaders to determine whether the process is being carried out in good or bad faith. 
The court will decide that, and the court is not an Indian court. It is the district court of the United States of America. That judicial remedy and the potential for mediated solution when the parties find themselves at an impasse has subsequently been frustrated by the ruling of the Supreme Court upholding the 11th amendment, the amendment that provides immunity to the several States of the Union. 
Thus, while there are some who have consistently maintained that sovereign immunity is an anachronism in contemporary times, in this area at least, the States still jealously guard their sovereign immunity to suit in the courts of another sovereign. 
In so doing, the States have presented us with a clear conflict, which we have been trying to resolve for several years. 
Although 24 of the 28 States that have Indian reservations within their boundaries have now entered into 159 tribal-state compacts with 148 tribal governments, there are a few States in which tribal-state compacts have not been reached. 
And the conflict we are challenged with resolving is how to accommodate the desire of these States to be involved in the regulation of Indian gaming and their equally strong desire to avoid any process which might enable the parties to overcome an impasse in their negotiations. 
The Secretary of the Interior is to be commended in his efforts to achieve what the Congress has been unable to accomplish in the past few years. 
Following the Supreme Court's 11th amendment ruling, the Secretary took a reasonable course of action. 
He published a notice of proposed rulemaking, inviting comments on his authority to promulgate regulations for an alternative process to the tribal-state compacting process established in the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act. 
Thereafter, he followed the next appropriate steps under the Administrative Procedures Act, inviting the input of all interested parties in the promulgation of regulations. 
When the Senate acted to prohibit him from proceeding in this time-honored fashion, he brought together representatives of the National Governors Association, the National Association of Attorneys General, and the Tribal Governments, to explore whether a consensus could be reached on these and other matters. 
In fact, a working group of those interests will be meeting this week in Denver to pursue the Secretary's initiative. 
In the meantime, my colleagues propose an amendment that would not only prohibit the Secretary from proceeding with the regulatory process, but which would prevent those State and tribal governments that desire to enter into a compact from securing the necessary Federal approval. 
By the latter formulation, my colleagues would federally pre-empt what is otherwise the prerogatives of sovereign governments--namely the State and tribal governments--to pursue that which is their right under Federal law and their right as sovereigns. 
Once again, there have been no hearings on this proposal--no public consideration of this formulation--no input from the governments involved and directly affected by this proposal. 
Last year, the Secretary of the Department of the Interior made clear his intention to recommend a veto of the Interior appropriations bill should this provision be adopted by the Senate, and approved in House-Senate Conference. 
I would suggest that it is unlikely that the Secretary's position has changed in any material respect--particularly in light of all that he has undertaken to accomplish, including frank discussion amongst the State and tribal governments. 
As one who initiated a similar discussion process several years ago, I am more than a little familiar with the issues that require resolution. 
However, in the intervening years, court rulings have clarified and put to rest many of the issues that were in contention in that earlier process. 
I have continued to talk to Governors and attorneys general and tribal government leaders on a weekly if not daily basis, and I believe, as the Secretary does, that the potential is there for the State and tribal governments to come to some mutually-acceptable resolution of the matters that remain outstanding between them. 
I believe the Secretary's process should be allowed to proceed. 
I also believe that pre-empting that process through an amendment to this bill could well serve as the death knell for what is ultimately the only viable way to accomplish a final resolution. 
The alternative is to proceed in this piecemeal fashion each year--an amendment each year to prohibit the Secretary from taking any action that would bridge the gap in the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act that was created by the Court's ruling and which will inevitably discourage the State and tribal governments from fashioning solutions. 
This is not the way to do the business of the people. 
There are those in this body who are opposed to gaming. 
As many of my colleagues know, I count myself in their numbers. I am opposed to gaming. 
Hawaii and Utah are the only two States in our union that criminally prohibit all forms of gaming, and I support that prohibition in my State. We don't have bingo or poker. 
Mr. President, like many of my colleagues, I have walked many miles in Indian country, and I have seen the poverty, and the desperation and despair in the eyes of many Indian parents and their children. 
I have looked into the eyes of the elders--eyes that express great sadness. 
I have met young Indian people who are now dead because they saw no hope for the future. 
I have seen what gaming has enabled tribal governments to do, for the first time--to build hospitals and clinics, to repair and construct safe schools, to provide jobs for the adults and educational opportunities for the youth--and perhaps most importantly, to engender a real optimism that there can be and will be--the prospects for a brighter future. 
It is for these reasons, and because of their rights as sovereigns to pursue activities that hold the potential for making their tribal economies become both viable and stable over the long term, that I support Indian gaming. 
If our country--this great Nation--had followed the provisions in our treaties and abided with our promises, then there would be no need for me to be supporting Indian gaming. 
Mr. President, it is for these reasons, that I must, again this year, strongly oppose the efforts of my colleagues to take from Indian country, what unfortunately has become the single ray of hope for the future that native people have had for a very long time.

 Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, it is with great pleasure that today, along with Mr. Akaka, Mr. Stevens, Mr. Hatch, Mr. Byrd, Mr. Thomas, Mr. Hollings, Mr. Roth, Mr. Ford, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Murkowski and Mr. Sessions to submit the Pacific Island Summit Resolution. 
Since the end of World War II, the U.S. has lacked a strong diplomatic policy and presence in the Pacific Region. This has become more prevalent in recent years. Often characterized as a policy of `benign neglect,' the current situation is insufficient to continue the role of the U.S. as the leading world power as we enter the new millennium. 
The Pacific region covers an immense area of the Earth, approximately three times that of the contiguous United States. Increasing enforcement of treaties demarcating exclusive economic zones are revealing Pacific Island countries that wield control over vast tracts of the ocean, marine fisheries and undersea minerals; resources that will play a major role in the future of the global economy. 
As natural resources around the world dwindle, access to the relatively untapped resources in this region of the world will become increasingly important. The U.S., as the leading world power, should seek to maintain strong ties to this region. By cultivating diplomatic relationships with these leaders today, we foster strong economic ties tomorrow. 
In October 1997, then-Prime Minister Hashimoto held a summit meeting in Tokyo, Japan with various Pacific Island heads of state. Clearly, Japan is aware of the unlimited potential of this region, its valuable resources, and the importance of gaining access to them. It is economically and strategically important that we not stand idly by while other countries step into the vacuum created by the present U.S. policy. 
This resolution, Mr. President, encompasses all of these ideas in expressing the sense of the United States Senate that a summit meeting between the President and leaders from the Pacific region would be an excellent opportunity for the U.S. to strengthen its position economically and strategically. These Pacific Islands in return will be provided the rare opportunity to share their interests, visions for the future, and concerns with the leader of the world's most powerful democracy. It is my sincere belief that this summit will rebuild a foundation neglected since the end of World War II and be the beginning of a mutually beneficial relationship between the U.S. and this great region. 
Congressman Eni Faleomavaega introduced similar legislation in the House of Representatives, which speaks to the importance of developing and maintaining close diplomatic and economic ties with the Pacific and that a Pacific Island Summit would aid the U.S. considerably in attaining this goal. It is my hope that this legislation will be considered and approved in both chambers expeditiously.

 Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I wish to thank Chairman McConnell and Senator Leahy for their work in putting together a foreign operations funding bill that provides for our national security interests while doing so under tough fiscal constraints. 
I would also like to commend the Chairman and Ranking Member on their recognition of the important role Tunisia has played in the Middle East Peace Process for the past several years. 
Tunisia has been a long-time friend of the United States. Tunisia has, since the beginning of the Peace Process, fully committed itself to this process, which is viewed as the only way to restore peace in the Middle East. 
They launched the first U.S.-PLO dialogue as well as the first preparatory talks between Israeli and Palestinian leadership in Tunis. Tunisia was the first Arab country to host meetings within the framework of the Peace Process. 
Furthermore, a trilateral meeting was held in Washington in October 1995 bringing together the three Foreign Ministers of the United States, Israel and Tunisia, followed soon afterwards by another trilateral meeting, in January 1996, in Washington, D.C. A decision was then announced to open, both in Tunis and in Tel Aviv, interest sections in order to encourage the process of normalization between Arab States and Israel. 
The Tunisian's have undertaken these diplomatic initiatives at some level of security risk. Tunisia's next door neighbor is Libya. Nevertheless the Tunisians have refused to engage in an arms race. In 1997, they participated in 20 joint military exercises with the U.S. and the European Command. 
I believe it is time that we demonstrate our appreciation and support for this country through funding commitments. I also encourage the Administration to begin exploring additional funding initiatives in fiscal year 2000.

Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, may I first thank my dear colleague from Alaska for his very generous remarks. It has been a pleasure to work with him for the past 10 years. We hope that together we have been able to present to the U.S. Senate a bipartisan approach to this very important subject. 
Mr. President, I rise to speak in strong support of the Department of Defense appropriations bill for fiscal year 1999, S. 2132, as reported from the Committee on Appropriations. 
This bill contains funding for the Department of Defense for the upcoming year, excluding amounts for military construction. 
The total recommended is $250.5 billion. This is about $840 million less than was requested by the administration, but about $2.8 billion more than funded for fiscal year 1998. 
Within these amounts, the committee has recommended full funding to support our men and women in uniform. 
This includes a 3.1-percent pay raise as requested by the President. Later today, the chairman will offer an amendment to increase that to 3.6 percent, the amount authorized by the Senate last month. I strongly support this amendment. 
Also at the chairman's initiative, the committee is recommending $50 million to initiate a new fund for morale, welfare, and recreation. 
This new appropriation account will support the personnel support needs of our men and women serving on contingency deployments in Bosnia and Southwest Asia. 
Last May, Senator Stevens led a delegation of members from the Armed Services and Appropriations Committees to Bosnia and Southwest Asia. 
It was apparent in our discussions with these units that the deployments for these contingencies were beginning to impair the retention of critically skilled individuals and that morale was starting to suffer. 
The delegation unanimously concluded that we needed to do more to support our troops serving in these areas. 
The chairman's initiative will help ease the burden of these long overseas deployments and show our men and women in uniform that the Congress has not forgotten them. 
Mr. President, this is a very good bill, which meets the national security needs of our Nation, but within the fiscal constraints that have been agreed upon in this balanced budget environment. 
I should point out to my colleagues that this bill does not provide any funding for Bosnia. 
The President submitted a budget amendment to the Congress requesting an appropriation of $1.29 billion in emergency funding to maintain our troops in Bosnia. 
When the committee marked up this bill, it was unclear what action the Senate would take on Bosnia. 
It is my hope that this matter will be resolved in conference or through a supplemental spending measure at a later date. 
Let me assure my colleagues that the committee will not shirk from our responsibility to support funding for our forces assigned overseas, no matter where they are located. This matter will be addressed at a later date. 
Mr. President, I want to close by commending our chairman and his staff for the fine work that they have done in putting this bill together. As many of you recognize, this is a huge bill. Nearly half of our Government's discretionary resources are contained in this one appropriations bill. 
There are an enormous number of programs that must be reviewed and recommended by the chairman and his staff before this measure can be reported to the Senate. That task is made more difficult by the thousands of requests for billions of dollars that are made by the Members of this body. 
I want to salute the majority staff which really has done yeoman's work in putting this bill together for the Senate. It is a small staff, many have been with the Appropriations Committee for several years. They transcend the political divisions that sometimes divide this Senate. The staff is led by Steve Cortese who has been by the chairman's side for the past decade and it includes, Sid Ashworth, Tom Hawkins, Susan Hogan, Mary Marshall, Mazie Mattson, Gary Reese, John Young, Justin Weddle, and on assignment as a legislative fellow, Ms. Carolyn Willis. 
Mr. President, the Senate owes them a deep debt of gratitude. 
Under Chairman Stevens' leadership, the resulting bill is a well-balanced product, crafted in a completely bipartisan fashion. It meets the needs of the military services and also fully considers the priorities of the Senate and the American taxpayers. 
This is a good bill. I urge all of my colleagues to support its passage. 
Before ending my presentation, I would like to reflect upon a few things that have just come across my mind in the past few minutes. 
Chairman Stevens and I are what some of us call dinosaurs of the Senate. Admittedly, we are chronologically a bit old. Both of us served in World War II, the ancient war. I would like my colleagues to recall that in that war 16 million men and women served--16 million. Today, we are calling upon less than 1 percent of our Nation's population--one-half of 1 percent--to stand in harm's way for us, to risk their lives for us. Some have suggested that this is too much spending. As far as I am concerned, if any person is willing to stand in harm's way in my behalf, he or she gets the best. 
There are many programs that have been carried out at the chairman's initiative that he is too humble to even mention. He has been in the forefront of medical research, and I am proud to say that, working with him, we have been able to come up with a breast cancer program that is being acclaimed worldwide--not just nationally. Scientists from all over the world come to work with the Army Research Center. It may not be evident to many of my colleagues, but some of the best research being done on AIDS is being done by the U.S. Army. The same can be said for prostate cancer and other tropical diseases. 
I began my closing remarks by saying there were 16 million American men and women who served with us in World War II. It was at a time when our population was about 100 million. Today, our population is over 250 million, and we are asking 1.3 million to defend all of us. 
I concur with my chairman: This is the minimum, this meets the minimum needs of our military. If budgetary constraints were not placed upon us, I am certain we would come forth with something a bit more generous. After all, Mr. President, you and I want our children and our grandchildren to go to college, we want to be able to have a car in the garage, three meals a day. That is part of the American way of life. I believe that men and women in the service should also aspire to the American way of life, and I am sorry to say that this measure may not provide all that is necessary, but we are striving for the best. 
I ask my colleagues to support this measure. 
I thank the Chair.

Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise today to raise a matter which I believe could revolutionize the way we finance our defense infrastructure, our family housing, barracks and other base facilities. If successful, it would allow us to recapitalize our bases with a much smaller investment than is currently required. In so doing, it could dramatically improve the quality of life of the men and women in uniform. 
Mr. President often Members rise and offer that theirs is a simple amendment. This is not a simple matter, and it will take some time to describe it, but I want all of my colleagues to understand what it would do for national defense. 
Several years ago, I sponsored legislation to sell defense property in Hawaii to the State. 
In return the proceeds were used to build a new bridge to connect the Pearl Harbor Naval Base to Ford Island, a piece of Navy property located in Pearl Harbor. 
Over the years Ford Island has been the home of Battleship Row, the site of the Arizona Memorial, and just last month it became the final home for the U.S.S. Missouri. It has had a small airstrip on which some of the Navy's earliest aviators trained. 
It has housed a few sailors and families, and has been the workplace for selected other military activities. 
But because there was no bridge connecting the island, it could never be fully utilized. The Island comprises 450 acres, about half the size of Pearl Harbor Navy Base, yet it contains less than one tenth of the working and residential population of Pearl Harbor. 
The only access to the island has been by ferry. For years, boats have shuttled passengers and cargo from the rest of base about once per hour. In short it has been a very inefficient use of space. And for a small State like mine, especially in and around Honolulu, space is a premium. 
In April of this year, this situation was changed forever. Ford Island was opened to the rest of Oahu by the new Chick Clarey Bridge. 
Ford Island is now poised to be a more useful part of the Pearl Harbor naval facility. However, as is unfortunately so often the case in these matters, there simply is not enough money in the Navy budget to build the facilities that could make this base more useful. And so, without action, Ford Island will remain underutilized. 
About two years ago, when he took over as the Commander in Chief of the Pacific Fleet, Admiral Clemins saw the bridge being constructed and recognized the prospect of developing Ford Island. He began to investigate how he could maximize its vast potential to improve the Navy in Hawaii. He quickly came to the conclusion that there simply was not enough money to build the new facilities the Navy needs. 
While some might have given up when faced with this obstacle, that is not the Admiral's way. Instead he directed his staff to keep studying this and identify other ways to achieve his objective. 
The Admiral took to heart what we have often heard coming from the Congress, that we need to revolutionize the way the Pentagon does business. 
He agreed that we have to become more efficient, more like the private sector. He noted that public/private venture legislation had been approved by the Congress at the request of former Secretary of Defense William Perry for a few family housing projects and he suggested that a similar but expanded approach was needed for Ford Island. 
At every step there were those that told him why he couldn't do this. 
Some said it would cost billions, others that the State would not support developing Ford Island, still others raised technical arguments on our arcane accounting practices in the Government. But, the Admiral kept after it. 
While the lawyers raised legal concerns, and the Navy staff and others raised objections, every decision maker, the leaders of the Navy, State, and local governments, and business leaders always had the same response. This is a good idea, we must figure out how we can do it. 
That was the reaction of the Commander in Chief of 
The Pacific Command, Admiral Prueher. Recently he testified to the Appropriations Committee that he has reviewed the legislation and believes it is the right approach to solving some of the critical housing and facility shortfalls for the Navy. 
But, because of the difficulty of moving the legislative proposal within the bureaucracy, the measure was not included in the President's formal budget request. Still the Fleet Commander and CINCPAC were undeterred. 
Admiral Clemins brought the idea to Washington directly, where he quickly won support from the uniformed Navy. 
The Chief of Naval Operations gave the proposal his approval. He then received personal support from the Secretary of the Navy. His arguments even won the informal support from the Deputy Secretary of Defense. Finally, the Navy gave the proposal its official blessing. And after many, many months, the legislation was finally forwarded unofficially to the Congress. 
Unfortunately, all of this took time and the delays in winding through the internal chain of command did not allow the Senate's Armed Services Committee time to review this matter prior to its mark up. 
I offered this same amendment to that bill and it was adopted. However, there are some in the House that do not agree with the Navy, DOD and the Senate Armed Services Committee and they hope to gut the proposal. 
This amendment requires DOD to report on the current legislative proposal and to submit legislation to carry out the proposal by December 1, 1998. That will provide sufficient time for the authorization committee to pass judgement on the matter next year. 
The amendment does not mandate any specific terms for the Defense Department to follow, but offers several Navy ideas to be considered. 
What the Navy seeks to do, as a pilot project only for this one base, is to provide authority to the Secretary of the Navy to use his resources in conjunction with the private sector to develop Ford Island. The plan would examine whether it is feasible to provide incentives and other guarantees to businesses to carry out this idea, and establish a framework to carry it out. 
It is important that we understand how this differs from our current system and how it might work. Under our normal course of operations, the Navy would identify how much the development of Ford Island would cost, and it would develop a spending plan. It is estimated that the costs of developing the island under normal procedures could be as much as $600 million. 
Judging from the military construction budget it would probably require 15 to 20 years to identify sufficient funds to pay for this. That means a whole generation of Navy sailors would enlist, serve and retire, before the base could be completed. This is simply unacceptable to Admiral Clemins as it should be to all of my colleagues. 
By relying on a joint venture, the Navy can use resources gained by leasing, exchanging, or selling property that it currently holds in Hawaii and use those assets and revenues to leverage development of the island. It is like taking out a long term loan. The Navy can put down the down payment using its property or newly generated cash resources, and, as is the case under the family housing pilot program, the sailors housing allowances can be used to make the mortgage payments. 
In theory, the Navy might offer a commercial developer the opportunity to establish a few small commercial facilities--like parking garages, child care facilities, shops and restaurants--on the base to support the families, and in return the private concern would be responsible for developing additional Navy facilities. 
In each case, the Secretary of the Navy would have to approve the specific uses and the Congress would have to allow the funding to be used for the proposed purpose. This means that sufficient oversight would exist at all levels to ensure that the project stayed on course. 
Let me tell my colleagues that the business community in my State is very excited about this proposal. 
They are positive that the legislation will provide a mechanism for creating a public-private partnership to develop the island. 
From Congress' viewpoint, the development will involve very few taxpayer dollars which is exactly what is needed in today's tight budget environment. 
Most important is what this will do for the men and women in the Navy. Today in Hawaii, the Navy is spread out throughout the island of Oahu at a number of small posts and with large numbers of military families living in poor conditions a long way away from their jobs at Pearl Harbor. 
The development of Ford Island will allow the Navy to move many of its sailors right to the base to live and work. This will cut down on their commutes, and it will keep them on base. 
It will also help ease what has become a very congested rush hour on the highways in the area. For many what was an hour commute will now become minutes. For families disconnected from the Navy community, they will now be living and working in a quality family environment--a nice home in a beautiful location, with the working spouse only minutes away. 
For our commanders this means many more sailors housed right on base and readily available if needed. 
It will probably come as a surprise to my colleagues to learn that my State has some of the worst housing in all the Defense Department. The Army says its worst barracks anywhere in the world 
are in Hawaii. Some of the Navy's housing is so bad that it is an embarrassment to the service. 
Several years ago, Mrs. Margaret Dalton, the wife of Navy Secretary John Dalton visited Hawaii and was taken on a tour of some family housing units. The conditions were so deplorable that she was very troubled. When she returned to Washington she insisted that the Navy provide her with a full briefing on its housing rehabilitation plans for the State. Single handedly she moved the Navy forward. 
Since then, the Navy has made great strides toward improving living conditions. But it has become painfully clear, that there simply isn't enough money to do what is required. There are many areas that still need to be torn down and rebuilt. Or, that property could be turned over for a new use by the private sector. Mrs. Dalton will long be remembered by the sailors who serve in Hawaii as the person who started to turn around the Navy's living conditions in my State. This proposal will provide us a means to expand upon her work, but this time without enormous investment in this constrained budget environment. 
The benefits of the proposal to the Navy and my State are enormous. 
I am sure many are now thinking this sounds good, but if it is that simple why hasn't it been done before. To that I would say, it is not simple. 
It will require great leadership and management by the Navy to work with the local authorities and business community to carry this out. But, I am confident that we have the right man for the job in Admiral Clemins. He was demonstrated his skills as both a warrior and as a manager and he has the skills necessary to accomplish this task. 
This approach has not been tried before, because no one put the time and energy into working through all the details to formulate a legislative plan to achieve this goal. Furthermore, how many opportunities arise when a military department, for all practical purposes, receives what amounts to a land grant adjoining a base? This is in some ways a unique opportunity because of the location of Ford Island and the new bridge. That is why a pilot proposal is proper. It could also serve as a model for other revitalization efforts at other bases, perhaps not on this grand a scale, but using elements from this approach. 
My colleagues all know that there will come a time when the Defense Department will want to establish a new base somewhere. This public private venture could be the method where building new bases could become affordable. 
Mr. President, this is an excellent idea, that has been shepherded this far by the Navy because they recognized that it is the only way that we can take Ford Island and develop it in a timely and cost effective manner. 
Ten years from now, we can be discussing how we will get enough money and authority to proceed to develop Ford Island for the Navy, or we can be discussing how this model pilot program established a method whereby we have begun to recapitalize our defense infrastructure affordably. This is our choice, there is only one answer, we need to approve this legislation to get the ball rolling. 
I think my colleagues for their attention, and I urge all to support this measure.

Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise in support of Senator Dorgan's amendment that would clarify the eligibility of small businesses to participate in the Indian incentive payment program. 
Mr. President, I can assure my colleagues that in establishing this program, it was our intent to provide incentives to Defense contractors who would enter into subcontracts with Indian tribal government-chartered entities and tribal enterprises. 
Mr. President, it was not our intent to exclude from the Indian incentive payment program, those small businesses that might enter into contracts with the Department of Defense. 
It is my understanding that because the original authorizing language which established the Indian incentive payment program refers to a subcontracting plan pursuant to 15 U.S.C. 637(d), the Department of Defense has interpreted that provision to exclude small businesses from participation in the Indian incentive payment program. 
Senator Dorgan's amendment would simply strike the reference to a subcontracting plan pursuant to 15 U.S.C. 637(d), to make clear that small businesses who enter into contracts with the Department of Defense may participate in the Indian incentive payment program by entering into subcontracts with tribally-chartered entities or tribal enterprises. 
Mr. President, I believe we should include Senator Dorgan's amendment in S. 2132.

Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I would like to commend the Senator from Wisconsin for presenting this amendment. I would have to speak against that. 
It is true that the budget request submitted by the administration for the National Guard had a shortfall for O&M activities in the Guard in the amount of about $770 million. On our chairman's initiative, we placed an amount of $320 million to make up for part of the shortfall. 
In addition to that, the administration had zero dollars for procurement of new equipment based upon the philosophy that if the regular services, the Regular Army, purchases equipment, some of the leftovers may go for the Guard. We did not concur with that. We appropriated $500 million for the Guard to get new equipment. 
Having said that, Mr. President, I believe it should be noted that every service, every component of every service, is faced with shortfalls. There is a shortfall in Navy O&M. They would like to have more steaming time. They want their ships to be out there for maneuvers. We can't do that. The Army Tank Corps would like to have more petroleum and gasoline so that the men who drive these tanks may get more experience and be ready for combat, if such is necessary. Artillerymen would like to have more ammunition for firing range practice. 
Mr. President, we have the sad chore of trying to balance all of the accounts and, at the same time, realizing that if this Nation is to continue being the superpower of this world and thereby deter any nation from any mischievous action, we have to provide funds to modernize. The accounts that may be affected by this amendment would stop the modernization program. 
Mr. President, although I agree that the Guard should be receiving much more, I will have to concur with my chairman's action when he moves to table this. 
Thank you.

Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I realize that standing and speaking in opposition would be condemned by some of my colleagues and my constituents. I also realize that my chairman will rise to table this amendment at the appropriate time. But I believe that something has to be said as to why some of us oppose this amendment. 
Mr. President, we are blessed to be able to live in a great country. We just celebrated the 222nd anniversary of our birth. We have had a very illustrious and a glorious history. Yet, there are many chapters in our history that we would prefer not to discuss; we would prefer to just pass them over. The countries that we are speaking up against in Southeast Asia and Asia do not have a 222-year history. Yes, they may have been in existence for 4,000 or 5,000 years, but keep in mind that most of these countries have been under the yoke of some European power until just recently. Indonesia, until the end of World War II, was under the control, and therefore a colony of, Holland. China has been controlled by various countries. The Japanese have been there; the British have been there; the French, the Russians--and Americans. North Korea had been under the control of the Japanese up until World War II. The Philippines was our colony until the end of the war. 
Our country is blessed with resources--all of the minerals that we need, all of the chemicals we need to make us the No. 1 high-tech country in the world, the most powerful military country in the world. These other countries are still struggling. I don't think we can expect these nations who are going through the evolutionary stage of just 50 years, as compared to our 222 years--we cannot impose and demand that our will be carried out. 
We should remind ourselves that we, the people of the United States, and the Supreme Court of the United States have said that slavery was constitutional. That wasn't too long ago. And there are many fellow Americans who are still showing the effects of slavery to this day. Well, we pride ourselves on human rights, but hardly a day goes by when we don't see statistics that may not be the happiest. For example, I am vice chairman now of the Indian Affairs Committee. The things we are confronted with on a daily basis in this committee are sickening. For example, the unemployment rate in the Nation is less than 5 percent. The unemployment rate in Indian reservations today is over 50 percent. In some reservations, it is as high as 92 percent. Yes, there are reservations that are doing well--doing very, very well. But most of the 550 tribes are not doing well. 
When you look at health statistics, they are worse than Third World countries. They are worse in cancer, worse in respiratory diseases, worse in diabetes. And this happens in these United States. And if some other country should condemn us for this, we would stand up as one and say: It is none of your damn business. 
Well, Mr. President, the question before us is, Do we contain and do we isolate China--a nation with a population of over one-fourth of the world's population? They have problems, as much as we have problems. The question is, Do we ignore them, realizing that they may someday acquire all the technology that they need to become a terrible world power? Or do we try to engage them and, hopefully, by practice and by model, convince them that our system is the best? 
We seem to have done pretty well in doing this with the Soviet Union. We are told that the cold war is over now, that the power the Soviet Union had once upon a time is no more. Why? Because we had a policy of engagement. We continue to talk to them. We continue to exchange views. Yes, we propagandize them and they propagandize us. But because of our attitude, because of our resources, we have prevailed. I think the same can happen elsewhere. 
Yes, we are dealing with countries that have a short contemporary history--Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos. These were European colonies. If one looks at the history of these colonies, the treatment was just as bad as the colonies in Africa. And now to suddenly say, `Now that you have freedom, we expect you to behave like Americans,' I think is asking too much, Mr. President. 
We speak of human rights. We will conclude this year the final payment of redress to Japanese Americans who were put in camps. Mr. President, I certainly recall that soon after December 7--on February 19, 1942--an Executive order was issued declaring that Japanese Americans were not to be trusted. Therefore, they had to be rounded up, with 48 hours' notice, and placed in 10 camps throughout the United States--no due process. No crimes were committed. Studies were made, investigations done, and there was not a single case of sabotage, not a single case of un-American activity. In fact, men volunteered from these camps to form a regiment, which I was honored to serve in, and we became the most decorated Army unit in the history of the Army. The United States is finally going to close that chapter. 
But these things have happened to us. As a personal matter, I resented that when, on March 17, 1942, my Government said I was to be declared 4C. 
In case people are not aware of what 4C is about, 1A is the Draft Board's declaration that you are physically fit, mentally alert. Therefore, you are qualified to put on the uniform of the United States; 4F, something is wrong with you, physically or mentally; 4C is a special designation for enemy alien. That was my designation. 
So when one speaks of the history of the United States, there are chapters that we don't wish to look at, because, if we start looking back to these chapters, you will find that we have gone through this painful evolution. 
So I am telling my colleagues that this is not a simple amendment. It is an amendment that requires deep thought on our part. I hope that we leave it up to those who we rely upon in our State Department to do the best. We can always watch what is going on. Yes, they have forced abortion. I am against that. I am against religious persecution. We try to convince ourselves that there is no religious persecution in the United States. But I am certain we know that there is. 
Mr. President, I will be voting to table this amendment.

 Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on an health issue of great importance now and in future years. As our population continues to increase, our elderly live longer, and healthcare technology advances, the need for access to care will undoubtedly also increase. 
Because of these monumental increases in the need for healthcare access for many Americans, I wish to take a few minutes to discuss the need for support of nursing school administered primary care centers. 
Nursing centers are university or nonprofit entity primary care centers developed (primarily) in collaboration with university schools of nursing and the communities they serve. These centers are staffed by faculty and staff who are public health nurses and nurse practitioners. Students supplement patient care while receiving preceptorships provided by colleges of nursing faculty and primary care physicians, often associated with academic institutions, who serve as collaborators with nurse practitioners. 
Nurse practitioners, and public health nurses, in particular, are educated through programs which offer advanced academic and clinical experiences, with a strong emphasis on primary and preventive health care. In fact, schools of nursing that have established these primary health care centers blend service and education goals, resulting in considerable benefit to the community at large. 
Nursing centers are rooted in health care models established in the early part of the 20th century. Lillian Wald in the Henry Street Settlement and Margaret Sanger, who opened the first birth control clinic, provided the earliest models of service. 
Since the late 1970's, in conjunction with the development of educational programs for nurse practitioners, college of nursing faculties have established nursing centers. There are currently 250 centers nationwide, affiliated with universities and colleges of nursing in Arizona, Utah, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Hawaii, Virginia, and New York. The Regional Nursing Centers Consortium, an association of eighteen nursing centers in New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Delaware, was established in 1996 to foster greater recognition of, and support for, nursing centers in their pursuit of providing quality care to underserved populations. 
Nursing centers tend to be located in or near areas with a shortage of health professionals or areas that are medically underserved. The beneficiaries of their services have traditionally been the underserved and those least likely to engage in ongoing health care services for themselves or their family members. In the 1970's, I sponsored legislation that would give nurses the right to reimbursement for independent nursing services, under various federal healthcare programs. At the same time, one of the first academic nursing centers was delivering primary care services in Arizona. 
As the Vice Chairman of the Committee on Indian Affairs, I am pleased to note that the University of South Carolina College of Nursing has established a Primary Care Tribal Practice Clinic, under contract with the Catawba Indian nation, which provides primary and preventive services to those populations. The University also has a Women's Health Clinic and Student Health Clinic, which are both managed by nurse practitioners. 
Another prime example of services provided by nurse practitioners is the Utah Wendover Clinic. This clinic, in existence since 1994, provides interdisciplinary rural primary health services to more than 10,000 patients annually. The clinic now has telehealth capabilities that provide interactive links from the clinic to the university hospital, 120 miles away. This technology allows practitioners direct access to medical support for primary care, pediatrics, mental health, potential abuse, and emergency trauma treatment. 
To date, nursing centers have demonstrated quality outcomes which, when compared to conventional primary health care, indicate that their comprehensive models of care have resulted in significantly fewer emergency room visits, fewer hospital inpatient days, and less use of specialists. The Lasalle Neighborhood Nursing Center, for example, reported for 1997 that fewer than 0.02 percent of their primary care clients reported hospitalization for asthma; fewer than 4 percent of expectant mothers who enrolled delivered low birth rate infants; 90 percent of infants and young children were immunized on time; 50 percent fewer emergency room visits; and the clinic achieved a 97 percent patient satisfaction rate. 
What makes the concept of nurse managed practices exciting and promising for the 21st century is their ability to provide care in a `spirit of serving' to underserved people in desperate need of health care services. Interestingly, nurse practitioners have consistently provided Medicaid sponsored primary care in urban and rural communities for a number of years, and have consistently demonstrated their commitment to these underserved areas. 
The 1997 Balanced Budget Act (P.L. 105-33) included a provision that for the first time ever allowed for direct Medicare reimbursement of all nurse practitioners and clinical nurse specialists, regardless of the setting in which services were performed. This provision built upon previous legislation that allowed direct reimbursement to individual nurse practitioners for services provided in rural health clinics throughout America. The law effectively paved the way for an array of clinical practice arrangements for these providers; however, per visit payments to nurse run centers, as opposed to individual practitioners, was not formally included in the law. 
Federal law now also mandates independent reimbursement for nurse practitioners under the Civilian Health and Medical Programs of Uniformed Services (CHAMPUS), the Federal Employee Health Benefits Plan (FEHBP) and in Department of Defense Medical Treatment Facilities. 
As the Ranking Member of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, my distinguished colleagues and I have listened to the testimonies of the three Service Chief Nurses each year, during the Defense Medical hearings. I am proud to report that the military services have taken the lead in ensuring the advancement of the profession of nursing. Military advanced practice nurses provide care to service members and their families at all of the treatment facilities. The Graduate School of Nursing at the Uniformed University of the Health Sciences (USUHS), which has a very successful nurse practitioner program, was recently recognized in the top 100 graduate schools in the United States. The Commanding General at Tripler Army Medical Center, a two star position, is a nurse. This is a first ever accomplishment for nurses in the military. I hope to see more nurse officers in these leadership roles, even at the three star level. 
At the beginning of this session of Congress, I proposed legislation to amend Title XIX of the Social Security Act to expressly provide for coverage of services by nursing school administered centers under state Medicaid programs, similiar to payments provided to rural health clinics. Today, as we debate a number of health care issues, I urge us to consider creative avenues for expanding health care access for all Americans, particularly the poor and underserved. Nursing centers, as new models of health care providers, offer quality services for lower payments. 
In closing, I would like to reiterate that nurse practitioners provide cost effective, preventive care in underserved areas across America. Their educational programs emphasize the provision of care to patients with limited resources, financial and otherwise. A recent article in U.S. News and World Report showcased the successful Columbia Advanced Practice Nurse Associates (CAPNA), a nurse run primary care clinic in New York City. Dr. Mary Mundinger, the Dean of the Columbia School of Nursing and a Robert Wood Johnson Health Policy Fellow in 1984, was the catalyst for the center, which she envisions as a `prototype of a new branch of primary care.' 
Nurse practitioners have proven themselves to be well trained providers of high quality, cost effective care. 
Nursing school administered centers offer viable alternatives to health care access for the poor and underserved, and allow Americans more choices in their selection of cost effective, quality care services. The issues surrounding quality, access and the provision of patient care services are, Mr. President, at the crux of our current debates over health care reform. We owe it to each and every American to provide the very best options for quality health care available.

Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I oppose this amendment which proposes to limit the Federal Election Commission's (FEC) general counsel and staff director to a term of 4 years unless four of the six Commissioners vote to renew their terms. The Commission is composed of six members--three Republicans and three Democrats. 
Consistent with the FEC's overall statutory scheme, requiring a majority decision to take official action, four votes are currently needed to remove the general counsel or staff director from office. If this amendment is adopted, four affirmative votes would be required for these officials to retain their position. That means three Commissioners from the same party voting as a block could force the termination of either the general counsel or the staff director and hold hostage either of the two top career officials at the FEC. 
This amendment injects partisanship into the carefully balanced bipartisan structure at the FEC. Further, this could cause the staff to make recommendations based on partisan considerations in order to protect their jobs. These consequences would be extremely detrimental to the administration of the FEC and the enforcement of our campaign finance laws. 
There appears to be little question that the purpose of this provision is to retaliate against the general counsel, Lawrence Noble, for certain actions. The general counsel recently made several controversial recommendations to the Commission. In response to 1997 rulemaking petitions filed by President Clinton and others, Mr. Noble recommended that the FEC seek public comment on a proposal to prohibit the use of soft money in connection with federal elections. 
Acting on the general counsel's recommendation, the Commission also pursued cases in court that have received negative reactions from some Members. A review of Mr. Noble's record indicates that he has been nonpartisan, balanced and fair. Mr. Noble has aggressively pursued enforcement of campaign finance laws against Democrats and Republicans alike. 
In a year in which the need for campaign finance reform has received so much attention, Congress would be sending the wrong message if it passes a provision designed to weaken the very agency responsible for enforcing campaign finance laws. 
I urge you to oppose this amendment. 
Several Senators addressed the Chair.

Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise to address some of the statements that were made in our debate last evening on Senator Craig's amendment on Senator Kyl's amendment on internet gaming. 
First, Mr. President, I want to make clear that the amendment we propose absolutely would not exempt Indian tribal governments and Indian gaming from the purview of the Internet Gaming Prohibition Act. 
Rather, the amendment allows only the conduct of those games with the application of technology--not internet technology--but the application of television and satellite-generated technology that we envisioned could be used for the conduct of bingo or games that are subject to a tribal-state compact under the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act. 
The language on page eleven of Senator Kyl's amendment makes it abundantly clear that each person placing or receiving or otherwise making a bet or wager must be physically located on Indian land and that class III games must be conducted consistent with a tribal-state compact and only in the state to which the compact applies. 
So we are not proposing to exempt Indian gaming from the internet gaming prohibitions outlined in Senator Kyl's amendment. 
Secondly, I would want my colleague from Arizona to know that as we read it, there is an ambiguity in the amendment. 
States are authorized to enforce the provisions of this amendment, should it become law, for violations by a person. 
The term `person' includes `any government'--which must refer to tribal governments, because all other levels of government are specifically mentioned. 
Thus, while one section of the bill would restrict state authority to what is provided in tribal state compacts, another section of the bill gives states broad authority to enforce the act as it may relate to the conduct of tribal governments. 
Senator Craig's amendment would simply preserve the status quo and maintain the integrity of the pervasive federal regulatory scheme in which federal criminal laws are enforced by the United States on Indian lands--a framework, which as I said last evening, has been in place for over one hundred years. 
I thank my colleague from Idaho and I wish to assure my colleague from Arizona that I look forward to continuing to work with him as this bill proceeds to conference to address these two matters that I have outlined.

Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise in support of Senator Craig's second-degree amendment to the amendment proposed by Senator Kyl. 
Mr. President, I am privileged to represent the State of Hawaii together with Senator Akaka. The State of Hawaii is one of two States--Utah being the other--where all forms of gaming, gambling, are prohibited. To play bingo in Hawaii would be a crime. I support Hawaii's position. 
There have been countless attempts made to introduce gaming into our islands, but in each case I am happy to report that the political leaders of Hawaii have opposed it and we have prevailed. So it may sound strange to some of my colleagues to see me standing here supporting the second-degree amendment of Senator Craig. 
Eleven years ago, there was a very important decision rendered by the Supreme Court of the United States, the so-called Cabazon case. The decision in the Cabazon case was a most important one, because it once again declared clearly that Indian nations were sovereign. Our Constitution declares that Indian nations are sovereign. The laws of our land and the laws that we have passed in this Chamber have consistently indicated that Indian country is sovereign, whether we like it or not. 
The Cabazon decision was a simple one. It said if a State does not prohibit gaming, then it cannot prohibit gaming in Indian reservations. California did not prohibit gaming. Therefore, the Cabazon Tribe had the authority to do that. 
Immediately, many of us in this Chamber saw the potential for utter chaos in the United States if all of the Indian reservations rose as one to claim their right under Cabazon to conduct gaming in the various States. There would be no regulation, no supervision. Therefore, we took it upon ourselves to pass the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, and we did so not by consultation but by advice and by the recommendation of how the law should read, from the States, the Governors, and the AGs of the States, who told us how they wanted this law to be passed. 
The law that is now regulating Indian gaming is the creature of the States. We took away a bit of Indian sovereignty to bring this about because, as we all know, the sovereignty of Indian country results in a trust relationship between our Government and an Indian government; it is not a relationship between Indian government and State government. 
This Kyl amendment has an ambiguity because, on one hand, it says the Feds will implement the law in Indian country, but there is another provision that says the State government will enforce the provisions of this amendment in Indian country. 
What we have tried to do here is to simply carry out the intent of the amendment as set forth by Senator Kyl. 
I was very encouraged by the statement made in Senator Kyl's recent `Dear Colleague' letter in which he stated his amendment `will neither explicitly or implicitly amend the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act.' 
Mr. President, Senator Craig's amendment is a very simple one. It would simply accomplish what Senator Kyl has indicated as being his intention. The amendment will accomplish two objectives: First, make clear that gaming, which is lawful under the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, would not be rendered unlawful by the Kyl amendment. Secondly, the amendment would conform the enforcement of Federal laws on Indian lands to the Federal regulatory scheme that has been in place for over 100 years; namely, that the United States is, and will continue to be, responsible for the enforcement of Federal criminal laws on Indian lands. 
The Craig amendment is necessary because the Kyl amendment will otherwise shift the responsibility for the enforcement of this new Federal criminal statute to the States. Mr. President, I don't think that was the intention on the part of Senator Kyl. 
Therefore, I urge my colleagues to support the second-degree amendment submitted by Senator Craig, because that will assure that there is no unintentional effect of our action on the provisions of the Kyl amendment on the lawful conduct of gaming on Indian lands. 
Mr. President, if I had my way, I would recommend that gaming be outlawed. With the Craig amendment, I will be supporting the Kyl amendment to make certain that Internet gaming is not made wild and widespread throughout this whole Nation and world. I urge my colleagues to look upon the Craig amendment with seriousness. We do believe in what our Constitution says and what the Supreme Court decision has so declared.

Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I wish to congratulate Chairman Gregg and Senator Hollings on their leadership in crafting the Fiscal Year 1999 Commerce, Justice, and State, the judiciary, and related agencies appropriation bill. Given the broad reach of this measure and our budgetary constraints, this was no easy task. 
From a parochial standpoint, I wish to thank the Chairman and Senator Hollings for their sensitive consideration of programs of importance to the State of Hawaii, including the East-West Center, Hawaiian monk seal recovery, endangered sea turtle research, and coral reef research, assessment, monitoring and management, to name a few. 
I would also like to acknowledge the outstanding work of the staff: Jim Morhard, Kevin Linskey, Paddy Link, Dana Quam, Vasiliki Alexopoulos, Lila Helms, and Emelie East. 
Finally, I would like to thank Scott Gudes for his many years of dedication to the Senate Appropriations Committee, and in particular, the Defense and Commerce, Justice, and State Subcommittees. Throughout the years, Scott worked tirelessly and conscientiously, and garnered the deep respect of Members and staff who had the privilege of working with him. Scott recently left the Senate to become Deputy Under Secretary at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. I wish him much success and fulfillment in this new endeavor.

 Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, on behalf of myself and Senator Daniel K. Akaka, I would like to say a few words about Mr. Kenji Sumida who is retiring next month from the post of President of the East-West Center in Honolulu, Hawaii. The East-West Center is a national education and research institution established by the United States Congress in 1960 to promote better relations and understanding among the nations of Asia, the Pacific and the United States. 
During his tenure as President of the East-West Center, Mr. Sumida effectively led the Center through a particularly difficult period of reduced funding and budget cuts while maintaining and building upon the Center's reputation as the premiere United States institution dealing with major issues in the Asia-Pacific region. He substantially increased the visibility of the Center in Washington, DC and reached out to the Center's many alumni in the United States and throughout the Asia-Pacific region. 
In addition to his leadership role at the East-West Center, Mr. Sumida has served his native State of Hawaii in numerous other capacities, including high-ranking administrative posts at the University of Hawaii, the State of Hawaii, and City and County of Honolulu; director of administration of the Pacific International Center for High Technology Research; and chief of staff and commander of the Hawaii Air National Guard, retiring with the grade of Brigadier General. His long-standing involvement and commitment to numerous community service activities is commendable. 
In all of his pursuits, Kenji Sumida has worked tirelessly and conscientiously to create bonds of friendship, respect and mutual understanding in his home state and the nation, as well as with our neighbors in Asia and the Pacific. 
We would like to acknowledge and pay tribute to Kenji Sumida for an outstanding career of service to our great nation and to extend our best wishes in his retirement.

Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment to S. 2057 offered by my colleague from Nevada, Senator Reid. 
The Reid amendment would strike from the bill an amendment adopted by the Armed Services Committee during its markup of S. 2057. 
That amendment, offered by Senator Kempthorne, would withdraw 12,000 acres of land from the public domain for use by the United States Air Force for a project known as Enhanced Training in Idaho, or E.T.I. 
It would ratify the Air Force's recently announced selection of this land--known as the Juniper Butte Range--for addition to an existing 109,000-acre training range. 
The Air Force plans to invest thirty million dollars to outfit the area for training pilots in electronic warfare, tactical maneuvering and air support. 
Over the past several years, the Air Force has failed to gain public approval of similar proposals to expand its training area in Idaho to provide more cost-effective training for pilots at Mountain Home Air Force Base. 
These proposals, like the current Juniper Butte proposal, have been controversial in large part due to their potential impacts on proposed wilderness areas, wildlife, and human populations. 
These impacts--principally from the anticipated increase in air traffic and the noise associated with it--are significant and very difficult to mitigate. 
Increased air traffic and noise are of particular concern to the Shoshone-Paiute tribes of the Duck Valley Indian Reservation, which straddles the Idaho-Nevada border. 
Low level overflights of the reservation and sonic booms associated with the existing Idaho training facilities have long been a source of friction between the tribes and the Air Force. 
As a result of litigation brought by the tribe against the Air Force over these issues, the tribe and the Air Force entered into an agreement concerning training flights in the vicinity of the Duck Valley Reservation. 
Regrettably, the tribe currently regards the Air Force as being in violation of this agreement. 
It is therefore not surprising that the Duck Valley tribes view the Juniper Butte proposal as an additional threat to their culture, religion and resources. 
Nevertheless, I would like to commend the Air Force for entering into a contract to evaluate the impacts of Air Force activities on the cultural practices and sacred sites of the tribes. 
However, my understanding is that these ethnographic studies are ongoing, and that we at present do not have the benefits of their findings or recommendations. 
Given the difficult history in the relationship between the Air Force and the tribe, I question the wisdom and the need to move precipitously on the Juniper Butte withdrawal. 
Typically, when a Federal agency announces a record of decision on a proposal such as the Juniper Butte withdrawal, other Federal agencies have an opportunity to review and comment on it. 
The Department of the Interior, whose Bureau of Land Management currently manages the Juniper Butte lands, has a wide array of concerns about withdrawing the lands for a bombing range. 
The department has concerns about potential impacts to some 22 proposed wilderness areas, big horn sheep and other wildlife. 
In addition, as trustee for the Shoshone-Paiute tribes, the Department is concerned about the potential impacts that adding Juniper Butte to the bombing range would have on the Duck Valley Reservation and its people. 
While Interior and Air Force representatives have been meeting in an effort to address Interior's many concerns, there has been no effort to address the tribal concerns. 
Given the past and present concerns about this matter, it is appropriate to ask, `What's the rush?' 
Why is it necessary to short circuit the normal public process of review and comment, of congressional review of a proposal of this nature? 
While it may be desirable for the Air Force to provide an additional area for training, there is no lack of existing facilities and no crisis that requires hasty action by the Senate. 
There have been no congressional hearings on the decision to go ahead with the Juniper Butte land withdrawal since the Air Force announced it in March of this year. 
Accordingly, the Senate has no record of discussion of the relative costs and benefits of the proposal, much less of the need for it. 
Indeed, a June, 1995, report by the Defense Department's inspector general concluded that `establishing the Idaho training range would be an exception to the overall DoD attempt to downsize infrastructure'. 
Anyone familiar with my record in Congress knows that I believe in a strong national defense. 
I support the desire of the Air Force to have the best possible training facilities so that our pilots will remain the very best in the world. 
And I have no doubt that the Air Force has labored long and hard to address the various criticisms that have been made of its proposals to expand its training facilities in Idaho. 
However, I also believe that the Senate has a duty and an obligation to be sure that the questions of need, of costs and benefits, have been answered fully. 
We also have an obligation to review the adequacy of the measures being proposed to mitigate impacts on the environment, wildlife, and human populations. 
Until and unless these concerns have been fully addressed, I see no compelling reason to go forward with this project at this time. 
Accordingly, I support Senator Reid's amendment to strike the Juniper Butte provisions from S. 2057.

 Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, today I have the sad duty of announcing to this chamber that America has lost a hero, and a friend who had a large impact on my life. On June 20, 1998, Col. James Hanley died in Palo Alto, California after living a life marked by service to his country and commitment to the ideals for which this nation stands. 
I had the privilege of serving with Col. Hanley in battle during WWII. He was the Commanding Officer of the 2nd Battalion, 442nd Regimental Combat Team, of which I am proud to have been a member. Those trying days seem like yesterday and I can recall Col. Hanley being a source of strength for us. He was admired and respected by his men. 
The story of the 442nd is rich and dramatic, but mostly it paints a picture of bravery and courage. When America learned of the news that Pearl Harbor had been bombed by the Empire of Japan on December 7, a widespread distrust of anyone of Japanese ancestry began to grow. Despite a prejudice which had many of them and their families incarcerated in concentration camps, brave Japanese American soldiers volunteered for military service following the attack. Those courageous volunteers were kept together and eventually became the 442nd Regimental Combat Team and Col. Hanley became one of its leaders. 
To give you a flavor for Col. Hanley's leadership, sensitivity, and wisdom, I would like to read for the record a letter he wrote to a newspaper editor when that individual made ethnic slurs against the Japanese. Keep in mind that the letter is dated March 10, 1945, when the war with Japan was at its bloodiest. 
Dear Charlie: Just received the Pioneer of Jan. 20 and noted the paragraph enclosed. 
Yes, Charlie, I know where there are some GOOD Japanese Americans--there are some 5,000 of them in this unit. They are American soldiers--and I know where some of them are buried. I wish I could show you some of them, Charlie. I remember one Japanese American. He was walking ahead of me in a forest in France. A German shell took the right side of his face off. I recall another boy, an 88 had been trying to get us for some time--finally got him. When they carried him out on a stretcher, the bloody meat from the middle of his thighs hung down over the end of the stretcher and dragged in the dirt--the bone parts were gone. 
I recall a sergeant--a Japanese American, if you will--who had his back blown in two--what was he doing? Why, he was lying on top of an officer who had been wounded, to protect him from the shell fragments during a barrage. 
I recall one of my boys who stopped a German counterattack single handed. He fired all his BAR ammunition, picked up a German rifle, emptied that--used a German Lugar pistol he had taken from a prisoner. 
I wish I could tell you the number of Japanese Americans who have died in this unit alone. 
I wish I could tell you the number of wounded we have had, the sightless eyes, missing limbs, broken minds. 
I wish I could tell you the decorations we have won. 
I wish the boys in the `Lost Battalion' could tell you what they think of Japanese Americans. 
I wish all the troops we have fought beside could tell you what they know. 
The marvel is, Charlie, that these boys fight at all--they are good soldiers in spite of the type of racial prejudice shown by your paragraph. 
I know it makes a good joke--but is the kind of joke that prejudice thrives upon. It shows a lack of faith in the American ideal. Our system is supposed to make good Americans out of anyone--it certainly has done so in the case of these boys. 
You, the Hood River Legion Post, Hearst, and a few others make one wonder just what we are fighting for. I hope it isn't racial prejudice. 
Come over here, Charlie, I'll show you where `some good Japanese Americans' are buried. 
J.M. Hanley, Hgq. 442nd Inf. APO 758. 
Mr. President, in conclusion, I offer my deepest sympathy for Col. Hanley's family and his dear wife, Joan. I want them to know of my deepest admiration for him, as they reflect on his significant life.

Madam President, before I proceed, I thank my dear friend from Utah, the distinguished chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Mr. Hatch, for reporting out the nomination of Susan Oki Mollway. I also thank my friend from Vermont, the ranking Democrat on the committee, Mr. Leahy, for his encouragement throughout this process. And, if I may, I acknowledge and thank the majority leader of the Senate, the distinguished Senator from Mississippi, Mr. Lott, for scheduling this matter this afternoon. I am certain the people of Hawaii are most grateful for this. 
Madam President, I am pleased to recommend to my colleagues for their approval the President's nominee to the U.S. district court for the district of Hawaii, Ms. Susan Oki Mollway. Ms. Mollway was nominated to fill a vacancy created more than 3 years ago by the untimely and unexpected death of the Honorable Harold F. Fong. 
An empty judgeship is considered a judicial emergency after 18 months. This seat has been vacant for more than twice that time. In 1990, under Public Law 101-65, the Congress determined that Hawaii's Federal caseload called for increasing its Federal bench from three to four positions. However, the Honorable Helen Gillmor was not confirmed for that fourth seat until October 31, 1994. 
Then Judge Fong passed away on April 20, 1995, returning Hawaii to three sitting district judges. Thus, Hawaii has had the benefit of the fourth judgeship for less than 6 months since its authorization in 1990. 
For the year 1997, the weighted case filings for the three sitting district judges in Hawaii was 706 cases per judge. To give you a sense of what this means, the Federal Judicial Conference's standard indication of the need for additional judgeship is 430 weighted case filings per judge. Ours is 706. Needless to say, Hawaii has justifiably requested that a fifth judgeship be approved. 
When Judge Fong passed away, Senator Akaka and I undertook the job of interviewing and considering nearly 40 candidates for this judgeship. After personally meeting with these candidates and reviewing their individual backgrounds, Senator Akaka and I were pleased to recommend Ms. Susan Oki Mollway to the President. 
Ms. Mollway is ready for the position of U.S. district judge, and I believe she is absolutely worthy of your favorable consideration. The majority of the American Bar Association Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary has given her the highest rating of `well qualified' for this judicial position. 
By way of professional background, Ms. Mollway graduated at the top of her class from the University of Hawaii with a degree in English literature. She received later her master's degree in the same field. Then Ms. Mollway went on to Harvard Law School where she graduated cum laude in 1981. 
For the past 17 years, Ms. Mollway has had a very successful litigation practice with one of the largest and most respected law firms in the State of Hawaii. She has been a partner in that firm's litigation department since 1986. Her impressive litigation experience includes a wide array of areas from Federal labor law to contract disputes to lender liability and appearances before every level of the State and Federal courts, as well as a successful appearance before the U.S. Supreme Court in 1994. 
Ms. Mollway has also taught appellate advocacy at the University of Hawaii's William S. Richardson School of Law and has participated as an arbitrator with Hawaii's court-annexed arbitration program. I have no hesitation in giving my highest recommendation to Ms. Susan Oki Mollway. 
Questions have been raised about Ms. Mollway's former membership on the board of directorship of the American Civil Liberties Union of Hawaii. More particularly, she has been asked to give her personal views on such matters as same-sex marriage, mandatory minimum sentencing, the death penalty, and employee drug testing. Ms. Mollway has responded to these questions and I believe has given a complete account of her own activities with the ACLU. With respect to her personal views, in most instances, Ms. Mollway has stated that she has not formed any personal opinions. 
More important, as one who may become a Federal trial judge, she clearly understands that her personal opinions are not relevant to the decisions she will make as a judge. Rather, Ms. Mollway has unambiguously and repeatedly recognized in her responses the authority of the Constitution, Federal statutes as passed by the Congress, and case precedent from higher courts. 
Furthermore, Ms. Mollway has unwaveringly stated that there is nothing whatsoever that prevents her from abiding by and applying applicable law and precedent in cases that may come before her as a Federal district judge. I am certain she will do just that and serve the Federal judiciary and the State of Hawaii with reason, balance, and integrity. 
Madam President, on a more personal note, I would like to make a few comments about Ms. Mollway's family background, because I have known Susan Oki Mollway virtually all her life. 
The question that comes before us is why did she join the ACLU? People do things because of background or some experience in life. 
As a young law student, she began to research the life of Japanese-Americans in the United States. And she came across rather strange decisions made by the Court and also by the Congress of the United States. These are chapters in the history of the United States that many of us would like to forget. But I think it might be well if we reviewed them at this moment. 
Ms. Mollway found out, for example, that in 1922 the Supreme Court of the United States declared that Japanese were not qualified for citizenship; in other words, they were singled out among all the peoples of the United States and said, `You cannot be a naturalized citizen.' Everyone else could be. 
Then in 1924, the Congress of the United States, in enacting the immigration laws, declared that if people are not qualified for citizenship, they may not immigrate to the United States. So once again the Japanese were singled out and told that they may not come here as immigrants. 
Then we all know that on December 7, that day of infamy, the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor. Soon thereafter, on February 19, 1942, an Executive order was issued authorizing the Army of the United States to establish, throughout the United States, 10 concentration camps and to place in these camps, for the duration of the war, all Japanese, whether they be citizens or not; and the vast majority were citizens. They were never tried. They were never charged with any crime. Due process was totally ignored. But there they were. 
Then on March 17 of that year, 1942, a strange decision was rendered and made known. The Selective Service System declared that Japanese-Americans would be designated 4-C. Most Americans may not be aware of what 4-C stands for. Madam President, 1-A is that that person is physically and mentally fit to put on the uniform; 4-F is just the opposite. 4-C is the designation for `enemy alien.' And so on March 17, 1942, I was declared an enemy alien. Ms. Mollway's father was also declared an enemy alien. But we proceeded to petition the Government, and I am glad to report that, about 9 months later, the President of the United States issued an order saying that Americanism is not a matter of race or color, Americanism is a matter of mind and heart, and authorized the formation of a special combat team of volunteers. 
The response was astounding to everyone. In Hawaii, over 85 percent of those eligible to put on the uniform volunteered. What is more astounding than that, hundreds of men who were behind barbed wires in these camps also stepped forward to volunteer to be given the opportunity of demonstrating their Americanism and their loyalty. 
Many Americans may not be aware of this, but this combat team, at the end of the war, was declared to be the most decorated in the history of the United States Army. There is no evidence or history of any subversive activity on the part of any member. Furthermore, in all of the investigations that were held since the end of that war, they could find not one instance of Japanese involvement in sabotage of fifth column activities. 
Ms. Mollway read these things, and she did research. And it is obvious for any young person who comes across information of that nature to be quite concerned. And she found that the ACLU was an organization that was concerned about the Constitution, to preserve and defend that most sacred of documents of Americans. And she was especially concerned about the Bill of Rights. So it was natural for her, just as I joined the ACLU because of my concern about the Constitution. But that does not make me any less an American. 
But this chapter in our lives ends with a burst of glory. I am certain Americans will remember that for the first time a mighty nation, a superpower, admitted their wrong and apologized, and apologized to the 120,000 Americans of Japanese ancestry who were incarcerated without due process of law. 
I am pleased to tell you that Susan Oki Mollway's father and I volunteered and we served in this regiment. And Susan could have no better role model to guide her life, professionally or personally, than her own father, who happens to be a lawyer also. I am certain that she mirrors her father in her love of country, in her commitment to the Constitution, and in her patriotism. 
Once again, Madam President, I wish to thank my distinguished friend from Utah, the chairman of the committee, for reporting this measure. I also wish to thank Mr. Trent Lott, the majority leader of the U.S. Senate, for scheduling this matter. We will be forever grateful. 
Thank you very much.  
Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.

Mr. President, my amendment will provide the Secretary of the Navy with authority to use up to $300,000 in funds available for operations and maintenance in fiscal year 1999 to pay unpaid back wages and benefits to former employees by Airspace Technology Corporation. The 141 employees affected by this case, from Hawaii, California, Guam and Oklahoma, have gone unpaid for their services due to bankruptcy of the corporation and an error in the Navy's disbursement of monies due the corporation. 
I am introducing the amendment in response to constituent requests. In addition, the Navy is willing to make the payment, but has indicated that legislative authority is needed to disburse the funds.

 Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I am introducing a bill today to direct that the vessel Foilcat, Official Number 1063892, be accorded coastwise trading privileges for a fixed duration and be issued a certificate of documentation under section 12103 of title 46, U.S. Code. 
The Foilcat was originally constructed in Norway, in 1992, and is a hydrofoil vessel presently under renovation in a U.S. shipyard. It is 84.2 feet in length and is expected to be less than 100 U.S.C.G. registered tons. 
The vessel is owned by Steven Loui of Honolulu, Hawaii. Mr. Loui would like to utilize his vessel to evaluate the use of hydrofoil technology in the establishment of a high speed ferry demonstration project. However, because the vessel was built in Norway, it did not meet the requirements for coastwise license endorsement in the United States. 
The Hawaiian islands are exposed to high and rough surf and it is incumbent that we utilize high speed technologies in order to overcome the impediments of high surf and transportation distance requirements. Foilcat utilizes advanced hydrofoil technologies enabling the vessel to travel at high speeds while also providing safe and comfortable passenger ferry service. Should this technology as applied in passenger ferry service, prove successful, a series of these types of vessels will be built in the U.S: using U.S. workers. Mr. Loui is planning to invest almost three times the amount of the vessel's purchase price in repairs and upgrades in a U.S. shipyard. My reflagging request would be for a limited time period, which would provide adequate time to evaluate the use of this technology in the establishment of inter and intra-island passenger ferry service. 
The owner of the Foilcat is seeking a waiver of the existing law because he wishes to use the vessel to evaluate high speed technology in passenger ferry service. His desired intentions for the vessel's use will not adversely affect the coastwise trade in U.S. waters. If he is granted this waiver, it is his intention to comply fully with U.S. documentation and safety requirements. The purpose of the legislation I am introducing is to allow the Foilcat to engage in the coastwise trade and the fisheries of the United States.

 Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, on the evening of May 6th, I had the honor of being in the audience to witness the presentation of the 1998 James Forrestal Memorial Award by the National Defense Industrial Association to the distinguished senior Senator from Alaska, the Chairman of the Appropriations Committee and Chairman of the Defense Subcommittee, Senator Ted Stevens. The first recipient of this impressive award was President Dwight D. Eisenhower, followed by a number of most distinguished citizens who were personally involved in helping our nation during difficult times, and who guided the development of a close working relationship between our government and private industry toward the requirements of National Security. 
I have had the privilege of working with Senator Stevens for nearly 30 years. It is no secret that I admire and deeply respect our colleague. Our nation is truly fortunate to have as Chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, an individual as dedicated to public service and to the maintenance of military strength and readiness. 
Upon receipt of this award, Senator Stevens shared with the audience his views on the status of the military and our nation's future. These, perhaps provocative, but, definitely profound remarks should be studied and restudied by all who believe in the importance of our military forces.

 Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, on May 2-4, 1998, more than 1200 students from across the nation will be in Washington, D.C. to compete in the national finals of the We the People . . . The Citizen and the Constitution program. I am proud to announce that a class from Lahainaluna High School from Lahaina, Maui will represent the State of Hawaii. These young scholars have worked diligently to reach the national finals by winning competitions in their home state. 
The distinguished students representing Hawaii are: Iao Eisenberg, Tiffany Fujiwara, Jasmine Hentz, Erin Lockhart, William Myers, Leah Nakamura, Ryan Ott, Michael Prieto, Julie Reed, Sal Saribay, Justin Serrano, Jeffrey Shelton, Yee Ning Tay, Kerry Tsubaki. 
I would also like to recognize their teacher, Ms. Ruth Hill, who deserves much of the credit for the success of the class. The district coordinator, Ms. Jane Kinoshita, also contributed a significant amount of time and effort to help these students reach the national finals. 
The We the People . . . The Citizen and the Constitution program is the most extensive educational program in the country developed specifically to educate young people about the Constitution and the Bill of Rights. The three-day national competition simulates a congressional hearing whereby students are given the opportunity to demonstrate their knowledge while they evaluate, take, and defend positions on relevant historical and contemporary constitutional issues. The simulated congressional hearing consists of oral presentations by the students before panels of adult judges. 
Administered by the Center for Civic Education, the We the People . . . program, has provided curricular materials at upper elementary, middle, and high school levels for more than 75,000 teachers and 24 million students nationwide. Members of Congress and their staff enhance the program by discussing current constitutional issues with students and teachers. 
The We the People . . . program is designed to help students achieve a reasoned commitment to the fundamental values and principals that bind Americans together as a people. The program also fosters civic dispositions or traits of public and private character conducive to effective and responsible participation in politics and government. 
I wish to extend my best wishes to these constitutional scholars in the upcoming We the People . . . national finals and commend them for their great achievement of reaching this level of competition.

 Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I would like to join my colleagues in support of the Hutchison amendment to S. 414, the Ocean Shipping Reform Act of 1998. I believe that this amendment further improves upon the bill as reported out of the Commerce Committee and takes into account and alleviates many of the concerns raised by interested parties who may be affected by the bill. As is true with all compromises, you cannot please everybody. Nonetheless, I believe this amendment represents a workable solution to the regulation of our waterborne foreign commerce and should serve us well for many years to come. I would like to commend my Chairwoman, Senator Hutchison, for her effort in moving this bill forward, and also thank Senators Breaux, Lott, and Gorton for their invaluable imput into the process. 
I am pleased to note that the bill preserves antitrust immunity for the conference system which has been an integral part of our ocean transportation regime since 1916. While it may be best for everyone if the antitrust laws were applicable on a global basis, it is unrealistic to believe that we could achieve a global recognition of the value and utility of the Sherman Act. However, the Shipping Acts of 1916 and 1984 balanced the inability to apply our antitirust laws to foreign corporations, with a realistic approach allowing us to operate in comity with international shipping regulatory practices, and the need to protect our citizens from potential abuses brought on by a lack of antitrust law enforcement. 
This bill, however, makes several changes to the conference system to make it more `user-friendly' for its shipper customers. For example, the bill requires shipping conferences to allow their members to offer rates that are different than those of the conference--so-called `independent action.' As a result, individual conference carriers can offer their own service contracts unimpeded by conference action. I am further pleased that the notice requirement for all independent action has been reduced from 10 
business days to five calendar days. This will ensure that independently negotiated rates or service contracts will quickly become effective. I also support the prohibition against conferences requiring their members to disclose service contract negotiations. 
The bill as reported out of committee treated all service contracts equally. Subsequently, there were several attempts to develop a bifurcated treatment for service contracts, with one set of rules governing carrier agreement service contracts and another dealing with individual carrier contracts. I am pleased that the current amendment returns to a version more closely resembling that which was reported out of committee and, more importantly, treating all service contracts the same. While there was some merit to the bifurcated treatment approach, it may have been very difficult to have implemented in practice. 
The amendment will require that all service contracts be filed confidentially with the Commission, that they contain certain essential terms, and that a limited number of those terms be published and made available to the general public. I believe that this compromise represents the best approach to service contracting. It allows carriers and shippers a certain degree of confidentiality with respect to the bargains they have struck, while at the same time informing the general public of the types of arrangements being made for certain commodities, for certain minimum volumes, in specific trade lanes. I also believe that the continued filing of the actual contracts with the Federal Maritime Commission ("FMC") will enable it to monitor them and take appropriate action if necessary. It will also help the U.S. port community in monitoring trade developments and reacting accordingly. 
Like many of you, I am particularly pleased to see that the amendment maintains the FMC as an independent agency overseeing the ocean transportation industry. The Commission has time and again 
proven its worth in administering Congress' system of regulation and combating unfair foreign shipping practices, most recently in Japan. And the Senate unanimously backed the FMC in its action to address the unfair practices of Japan in passing S. Res. 140. The Commission has developed considerable expertise in implementing the Shipping Act of 1984. It will now be able to bring this expertise to bear on the new era of ocean shipping reform engendered by this bill. 
Another aspect of this bill that is particularly commendable is the new provision dealing with the disclosure of certain terms of service contracts to labor organizations. A labor organization which is party to a collective bargaining agreement that includes an ocean common carrier now has a mechanism for obtaining information concerning movements of cargo within port areas and the assignment of certain work within those areas. It is my understanding that this type of information is especially relevant to labor organizations and this bill should ensure that they will have easy access to it. This information will enable them to make sure that the terms of their collective bargaining agreement are complied with. 
This amendment, in my opinion, achieves a balance in S. 414 which provides the best possible compromise among the broad array of interests in shipping. It has not been easy to balance the many disseparate interests involved, but I think that we have reached an approach which accomodates many of these interests. It fosters one of the bill's primary goals of stimulating U.S. exports through a more efficient and market-reliant ocean transportation system. It provides for a more effective system of industry oversight, regulating where we need to and not regulating where we do not. And it keeps the FMC as an independent agency, unfettered by political or other influences as it performs its critical international trade functions. I support this amendment, and urge my colleagues to do the same.

 Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, the Pediatric Emergency Medical Services Program was enacted into public law on a truly bipartisan basis on October 30, 1984. Children are not `merely little adults.' They have their own unique health care needs, respond to illness and trauma in their own individualized manner, and although children constitute between 20 to 35 percent of hospital emergency department services, too often their families are not really considered an integral component of their treatment and eventual rehabilitation. When President Reagan signed Public Law 98-555, a new era of hope and opportunity had arrived. 
Over the years, I have been very pleased with the steady growth this program has experienced. The landmark 1993 Institute of Medicine report reminded us, however, that much more still needs to be done. `Each year, injury alone claims more lives of children between the ages of 1 and 19 than do all forms of illness. . .. Overall, some 21,000 children and young people under the age of 20 died from injuries in 1988. . .. Clearly, preventing emergencies is the best `cure' and must be a high priority, but as yet, prevention is far from foolproof. When prevention fails, families should have access to timely care by trained personnel within a well-organized emergency medical services (EMS) system. Services should encompass prevention, prehospital care and transport, ED and inpatient care at local hospitals and specialty centers, and assistance in gaining access to appropriate follow-up care including rehabilitation services. For too many children and their families, however, these resources have not been available when they were needed. . ..' I would suggest that the Institute of Medicine has raised a very critical issue for all of us in our nation, and particularly for the well-being of our families. 
This year, the Administration in its Fiscal Year 1999 budget requested $11 million to continue the Pediatric Emergency Medical Services Program. This figure represents a decrease of $2 million from last year and we might be somewhat distressed by the recommendation. However, I am very pleased that in this time of significant budgetary constraints, Secretary Shalala requested funding. And, I am confident that again this year our colleagues serving on the Appropriations Committees, on both sides of the aisle and in the House and Senate, will enthusiastically respond to the truly pressing needs of our nation's children. I am also confident that we will continue to have the vocal support of the American Academy of Pediatrics and the National Association of Children's Hospitals. But for their active support in the past, it is fair to say that Congressman Bill Young and I would not have been able to be as effective as we have wished. 
The Department's budget justification continues to point out all too graphically the real need for this program. They point out that: `Each year over 20,000 children die from injuries. Another 31,447,000 children and adolescents are seen in emergency departments, accounting for $8.6 billion per year in medical costs. Government sources pay all or part of 40 percent of the pediatric emergency department visits, or about $3.4 billion. . ..' Without question, having appropriate and high quality care available in a timely fashion is an investment in our nation's future. 
Every one of us should be aware that there is still much to be accomplished in our efforts to protect the lives and future of our loved ones. Even today, only two states require that Basic Life Support vehicles carry all the equipment needed to stabilize a child and only five states require all such equipment for Advanced Life Support ambulances. 34 percent of EMTs and paramedics report that they still do not feel comfortable treating children. In 1996, 66 percent of persons who failed the national EMT exam did so because they failed the pediatric/OB section. A recent study found that paramedics' skills and knowledge for treating critically ill or injured children completely decayed by six months post-training; yet no state requires even annual retraining in pediatric care. Children with special health care needs present major complications for emergency treatment. Yet, only six states have approved continuing education courses that address this topic. Only nine states have the capacity to produce reports on pediatric emergency medical services care using statewide emergency medical services data. Perhaps most significantly, however, is the finding that LESS THAN HALF (46 percent) of hospitals with emergency departments have necessary equipment for stabilization of ill and injured children, and only 40 percent of our nation's hospitals with emergency departments have written transfer agreements with a higher level facility to ensure that children receive timely and appropriate hospital care when they need it. Many public policy experts have also raised the issue of how pediatric emergency care is being covered under managed care programs. 
Earlier, I referred to the impressive report which the Congress had received from the experts at the Institute of Medicine. In my judgment, perhaps the most critical Institute of Medicine recommendation is that the Congress should provide $30 million annually for this special program. Those of us from Hawaii truly appreciate on a first-hand basis the many far reaching health policy recommendations that have been made over the years by our visionary pediatrician, Dr. Calvin Sia. I, as one U.S. Senator, shall continue to do my best to implement Dr. Sia's recommendations. Our nation's children and families deserve no less.

Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, as Chairman Campbell of the Committee on Indian Affairs has observed, I believe it is very important that our colleagues have a clear understanding of the context in which this amendment is being offered. I say this because one might infer that the Secretary of the Interior is pursuing a course of action that is either unwarranted or one which the Congress would never sanction, and I believe it is critically important that we understand that drawing such inferences would be wrong. 
As Senator Campbell has indicated, in 1988 the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act was enacted into law. It followed a ruling by the Supreme Court in 1987 in which the Court once again reaffirmed one of the fundamental principles of Federal Indian law; namely, that the civil regulatory laws of the State do not apply in Indian country. In so ruling, the Court concluded that the State of California could not regulate gaming on Indian lands. 
As often happens, the Congress responded with the enactment of a law that gave to the States that which they did not have after the Court's decision--an ability to enter into a compact with a tribal government under which State laws might apply if the parties so agreed. 
That law has proven to work well. 
In fact, twenty-three of the twenty-eight States in which Indian reservations are located, have elected to enter into compacts with the tribal governments in their respective States. 
Thus, it is clear that the law is working. 
However, in 1996, the Supreme Court ruled again. 
The Court found that while the Congress intended to enable the parties to go to a Federal court to resolve any outstanding questions of law relative to gaming activities permitted within each State, or relative to tribal-state compact negotiations, the Congress could not waive the States' eleventh amendment immunity to suit. 
The result was that if a State refused to negotiate a tribal-state compact for the conduct of gaming, there is no Federal forum to which the parties can go to secure the assistance of the courts in reaching a resolution. 
So the Secretary of the Department of the Interior--as the Federal official to whom authority has been delegated to manage matters of Indian affairs--took the next step and did what many believe was the responsible thing to do. 
In the fall of 1996, the Secretary invited comments from the public as to how he should proceed. 
He posed a question--`should the remaining tribal governments--those that did not have compacts before the Supreme Court's ruling--be precluded from conducting gaming on their lands if a State elects not to enter into compact negotiations?' 
Taken together, the responses, I assume were that the Supreme Court and the Congress have recognized the right of tribal governments, as sovereigns, to conduct gaming activities on their lands--and that if the process set forth in the act was no longer workable, then another process ought to be put in place. 
And so the Secretary proceeded to issue an advance notice of proposed rulemaking, once again inviting comments from the public. 
Put another way, this whole process that the Secretary has pursued has been conducted in the full light of day, with maximum input from all interested parties. There was ample opportunity provided for everyone to weigh in and have their voices heard. And, because we have yet to enact a legislative remedy to the problem created by the Supreme Court's ruling--it was a necessary and proper action for the Secretary to take. 
Nonetheless, my colleagues felt it necessary to propose an amendment to the Interior appropriations bill, last fall, that would prevent the Secretary from proceeding any further. I was opposed to that amendment, because I believe that through our passage of the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, we have clearly sent a message to Indian country. 
That message is that we recognize the right to Indian country to seek a means--other than a reliance on Federal appropriations--to foster economic growth in their communities--communities, which have historically been plagued with poverty, the highest rates of unemployment in the Nation, not to mention the sorry state of housing, health care, and education. 
My colleagues' amendment seeks to send a message to those tribes that have yet to secure compacts--that if for one reason or another, you don't have a compact with a State--you will never have any other way to have gaming activities authorized on your lands. That you will be permanently foreclosed from the one activity that has proven to hold any potential for the economic well-being of Indian communities. That if your tribal economy has been devastated--if there are no jobs to be had on your reservation--that is just too bad. 
Mr. President, I don't think we can--in all clear conscience--send that message to Indian country. 
It isn't as though Indian reservations are located on another planet. The strength of tribal economies is every bit as important to our national economy as those of the States and local governments. 
If there are no jobs on the reservations, people will be, as they have been forced to do in the past, become increasingly more dependent on Federal programs. And this just flies in the face of all good sense and sound judgment. 
For the past 28 years, our national policy has been to support tribal governments in their quest to become economically self-sufficient. 
My friend, the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, could give us chapter and verse as to the scarcity of Federal dollars when it comes to meeting the needs in Indian country. 
For 28 years, we have been saying to the tribes--`get on your feet economically--we will do whatever we can to support you. Like you, we want to see the day when you are self-determining people who no longer need to have your lives dominated by the actions or inaction of the Federal Government.' 
The adoption of this amendment will send a decidedly different message. That message is that--`we will cut off 
Your right, as sovereigns, to determine whether gaming is something you want to employ as an economic tool to lift your communities out of the economic devastation and despair that has plagued Indian country for so long.' 
Mr. President, my colleagues know that I am not one who supports gaming. Hawaii is one of two States in the Union that criminally prohibits all forms of gaming. 
But I have seen what gaming has brought to Indian country and I support gaming for Indian country because I believe that it is one of their Rights as sovereigns within our system of government to determine how to develop the economic base of tribal communities. 
So while I do not question the good intentions of my colleagues, I would suggest to them and to my other colleagues, that this simply is not a matter that has to be or should be addressed in an emergency supplemental appropriations bill. 
The better course of action, in my view, would be to address this matter either in the authorizing committee or as part of the regulatory process. 
I am advised that the National Governor's Association has already notified the Department that it will be requesting a 30-day extension of the rulemaking procedure--which would take us into the end of May. 
Finally, the administration has sent up a statement of administration policy on this amendment which makes abundantly clear that the Department of the Interior will recommend a veto of the emergency supplemental appropriations bills, should this amendment be included in the bill. 
I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment. It does not involve an emergency situation--there are other forums in which this matter is more appropriately addressed. There is more than sufficient time to take action, if it is necessary, before the rulemaking process is complete. 
Clearly, we would not be acting today if there were not victims who are desperately in need of the emergency assistance that this bill will make available. 
I don't think we can responsibly tell them that the help that is so critical to them will not be forthcoming because this bill was vetoed. And we knew that it would be--simply because of an Indian gaming amendment that so obviously did not need to be treated as if it were an emergency and thereby addressed in this bill. 
In conclusion, Mr. President, I would note that each of my colleagues who spoke in support of this amendment yesterday, all made one and the same assumption--the assumption that States have a right to consent to the conduct of gaming on Indian lands. However, under the Supreme Court's ruling in Cabazon, the States do not have such a right. 
This is what the Court explicitly held. 
It is the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act that carved out a role for the States to play in Indian gaming. 
In my view, if a State elects not to avail itself of this role--either by refusing to negotiate for a compact or by asserting it's eleventh amendment immunity to suit--then the State is knowingly opting out of its prerogatives under the act. 
In so doing, a State has voluntarily passed the responsibility back to the Federal Government. 
All that the Interior Secretary is doing here is fulfilling his role as trustee by assuring that the action on the part of a State does not abrogate the rights of the tribal governments. 
When my colleagues suggest that the statute does not envision the Secretary acting without the consent of a State--it is because the statute is premised upon a simple assumption. 
In 1988, the States aggressively pursued having a role to play in Indian gaming. It was and is then natural to assume that they would act in conformance with what they said they wanted. 
If a State doesn't want this role, then I would suggest that a State would be hard pressed to object to the Federal Government fulfilling its responsibilities in lieu of the State. This is simple equity. 
We can always repeal this law. But let us all be clear about what the state of the law would be in the absence of this statute. Tribal governments could conduct gaming on their lands without regard to State law and without the consent of any State. 
Mr. President, I don't think that is what my colleagues want.

Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I would like to express my support for the amendment offered by Senator Stevens to promote the use of marine ferry and high-speed marine ferry services. This amendment will help promote marine ferry transportation, a widely overlooked, but incredibly efficient sector of our public transportation system. 
The marine ferry system of the United States is invaluable in meeting the transportation needs of our nation. As a Senator from an island state, I appreciate the need for passenger/vehicle ferry services. In general, marine ferries require minimal costs as compared to the costs of new infrastructure such as highways, bridges and tunnels. 
In coastal urban centers, marine ferry service can provide low-cost, environmentally friendly transportation to areas suffering from congestion. For instance, the cost of additional roadways and bridges in the New York/New Jersey metropolitan area could be astronomical compared to the minimal costs of helping to establish a regular ferry route. In addition, in coastal urban centers the reduction of automobile use mitigates environmental air quality problems. 
In rural coastal areas, such as the barrier islands of Maine, North Carolina, and Florida, marine ferries have been utilized as the sole source of transportation to connect coastal communities to the mainland. States like North Carolina utilize their state ferry system as an integral part of their hurricane disaster planning, when traffic can be congested during an evacuation. Ferries were used in the aftermath of the earthquakes in northern California to provide transportation across San Francisco Bay. 
Marine ferry transportation can also provide benefits to inland states with marine barriers such as rivers or lakes. Many states have utilized marine ferries as low-cost alternatives to highway bridges or to circumvent large inland lakes. Again, this provides the lowest cost transportation alternative to the taxpayer. 
In states such as Washington and Alaska, ferry transportation is vital and crucial to the population. These states have invested, with great success, in state-run marine ferry services, and have far-flung populations where highway road service is inefficient or in some cases impossible. Other states such as New York, New Jersey, and my own state of Hawaii, are exploring incentives to induce private ferry operations in order to fulfill certain transportation objectives. 
This year I introduced S. 961, the Marine Ferry and High-Speed Marine Ferry Act. Senator Stevens' amendment includes many of the provisions that were included in S. 941, and they will help us to fulfill our Nation's potential for both the continued use of traditional ferry services and to help develop potential use of high-speed marine technology. 
In the early 1970s, Boeing Marine pioneered the development and construction of commercial passenger hydrofoils capable of operating at 45 knots. Boeing built 25 hydrofoils for high-speed use on the Hong Kong-Macau route before licensing production to Kawasaki Heavy Industries of Japan in the early 1980s, and by 1989, only one high-speed marine passenger/vehicle ferry of significant size was in operation. 
The international and domestic high-speed marine passenger vessel market has recently seen a dramatic expansion, and currently over 60 high-speed marine passenger/vehicle ferries are in service or under construction. Fast ferries, until recently, have been primarily used in short sea services on protected routes, but recent advances in design and materials have allowed for the construction of larger vessels capable of being operated on longer open sea routes. These technologies are integral to the development of ferry service in the Hawaiian islands, where we have rougher and more exposed sea routes. New technologies have also opened possibilities for high-speed cargo-carrying operations. 
The United States has benefitted from a number of recent high-speed projects, and from the establishment of a shipyard specifically designed for high-speed marine passenger vessel construction. The Maritime Administration's 1996 Outlook for the U.S. Shipbuilding and Repair Industry indicates:  
New orders for ferries should also continue to provide work for the second-tier shipyards. The enactment of ISTEA continues to provide a significant boost to new ferry projects. In addition, MARAD has a Title XI application pending for the construction of two passenger/vehicle ferries for a foreign owner, valued at more than $171 million. Demand will come from continued promotion of states of ferries for use in their tourist industries, as well as in transportation/commuting, as an alternative to building infrastructure projects such as highways and bridges. The recent award of a $181 million contract to Todd Seattle for three 2,500-passenger ferries and the solicitation for proposals for two additional 350-passenger ferries by the State of Washington, is an added sign that the ferry industry is strong. On the private sector side, there is a demand for the deployment of high-speed, high-tech ferries in the passenger excursion industry. 
The Stevens amendment will build on previous enactments aimed at promoting marine ferry operations. The bill would reauthorize section 1064 of ISTEA, at levels consistent with past years, to allow state-run ferry programs to apply for federal grants for the construction of ferries, and/or related ferry infrastructure. 
The Stevens amendment would also require DOT to report on existing marine ferry operations and to make recommendations on areas that could benefit from future marine ferry operations, and directs DOT to meet with relevant state and local municipal planning agencies to discuss the marine ferry option to transportation planning. I think that municipal planners will be convinced that marine ferries can be the lowest cost alternatives available. 
I am happy the amendment has been incorporated in the bill, and thank my colleagues for their support of marine ferry operations. For a relatively small investment, we can encourage state and private operations to address our pressing infrastructure demands.

 Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, on December 31, 1997, John DaPonte retired from U.S. Government service and returned to his home state of Rhode Island after having served at the Foreign-Trade Zones (FTZ) Board since 1968. The retirement of a federal official happens several times every day. However, it is important that John DaPonte's career in government be remembered because of the impact that he and the Foreign-Trade Zones Board have made on U.S. trade policy, U.S. companies in the global marketplace, and the economic development of a wide range of communities in the United States. There are few federal government officials who have made such a direct positive impact on the subject they manage. 
The agency for which John DaPonte worked, the Foreign-Trade Zones Board, is one of the smallest federal agencies in Washington, D.C. with only nine employees. It is so small that it does not have a line item in the federal budget. In 1968, Zone projects existed in only 6 states and Puerto Rico and were very modest in size. Today, Foreign-Trade Zones Board activity is in all 50 states and Puerto Rico. During his tenure at the Board, the agency's Zone projects increased from 9 in 1968 to 560 in 1997, a yearly growth rate of 221%; domestic merchandise receipts grew from $18 million in 1966 to $125.6 billion. An average yearly rate of 24,933%; and employment increased from 1200 jobs in 1968 to 370,000 jobs an average yearly growth rate of 1,138%. There are few, if any, federal agencies with this growth record. John DaPonte deserves a thank you for managing an important U.S. trade program that grew rapidly over the last 30 years with very modest resources. 
The Foreign-Trade Zone Program is an economic development tool for communities providing financial assistance to many troubled U.S. industries, as well as to foreign-based firms interested in establishing U.S. production operations, by helping them be competitive in the global marketplace. Foreign-Trade Zones place U.S. production facilities on an equal footing with foreign operations. The benefit of this investment is the creation of jobs in the U.S. Industry groups become involved in the Foreign-Trade Zone Program in order to solve trade problems. Major industries involved in the program include shipbuilding, motor vehicles, oil refining, pharmaceuticals, and information technology. 
The growth of the Foreign-Trade Zone Program required a very significant amount of effort by the staff of the Foreign-Trade Zones Board. The Foreign-Trade Zones Act, and laws pertaining thereto, were amended in the 1968 to 1997 period on thirteen (13) occasions. Mr. DaPonte implemented many new procedures at the Foreign-Trade Zones Board including minor boundary modifications and grant restrictions to assist in managing the very rapid growth of the program in a balanced manner and without major funding or personnel. In 1968, 2 applications for new projects were filed. In 1997, 85 applications were filed. Board Orders approving new Zone projects grew during the period from 3 Board Orders issued in 1968 to 78 Board Orders issued in 1997. 
In order to operate effectively, the Foreign-Trade Zones Board works closely with a wide range of U.S. government agencies. Most important, is the Board's continuing involvement with state and local governmental organizations that implements most zone activity. At a time when we in Washington are trying to empower states and localities, we would do well to look at the positive program developed under John DaPonte's leadership. The Foreign-Trade Zones Program, from the beginning, has been one that actively engaged states, counties, cities, and port authorities on all levels to encourage local economic development activities. 
It is clear that during John DaPonte's tenure at the Foreign-Trade Zones Board, the program experienced extraordinary growth. He managed this high level of growth effectively with extremely modest personnel and budget resources. No other Federal agency has created such a positive impact on our nation's balance of trade with such limited resources. John DaPonte's involvement in the federal government is a classic example of the federal government at its best. Today, we remember the positive contributions of John DaPonte to U.S. trade. This Congress thanks him for his efforts and wishes him well in his future endeavors.

Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise today to urge my colleagues to begin immediate consideration of the ISTEA reauthorization legislation. The current federal funding authorization for our nation's roads and bridges expires May 1st. If we allow this funding authority to expire, the ability of our state and local agencies to plan, design, implement, and manage transportation improvements and resources will be compromised. 
This lapse in new highway funding authority will jeopardize highway projects and safety programs across our country, and will have significant effects on Hawaii. 
Federal highway projects support approximately 5,816 jobs in Hawaii, and without a reauthorization of the ISTEA legislation, those 5,816 people may lose their jobs. In addition to employment effects, an expiration of ISTEA spending authorization will place the safety of all Hawaii's citizens at risk. More than half, 51%, of Hawaii's bridges are structurally deficient or functionally obsolete. Further, 28% of Hawaii's major roads are in poor or mediocre condition, which increases the possibility of motor vehicle crashes. 
A failure to reauthorize this transportation spending authority will only increase the cost Hawaii's motorists currently pay due to poor road conditions. Each Hawaii motorist pays an additional $102 each year in extra vehicle repairs and operating costs caused by driving on roads in need of repair. Furthermore, 45% of Hawaii's urban freeways are congested, which costs Hawaii's motorists in wasted time and fuel. 
`The effects of our failure to reauthorize the ISTEA legislation will be felt not only in Hawaii, but also in every state in the nation by every citizen of our nation. Every single citizen benefits from our transportation infrastructure every day. Even if you do not drive you benefit from our transportation system through the products you consume that were transported via our roads and highways. The development of our transportation infrastructure helped fuel the development of our nation. We must not let it fall into disrepair. 
There may be concerns that the proposed ISTEA legislation is not the best way to meet our country's transportation needs. We must allow ourselves ample time to debate and consider all the issues surrounding ISTEA reauthorization, so that we may pass the most effective legislation. We must bring this legislation to the floor now.

 Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to a group of Americans that contributed greatly to the game of baseball. Although not widely known in this country, the Japanese American community has contributed a significant chapter to the history of baseball as it has to many other important aspects of American society. 
Beginning at the turn of the 20th century, Issei, or first generation Japanese Americans, developed a love for baseball that led to the creation of an extensive network of Japanese American leagues throughout the United States. Japanese American baseball leagues began to appear in towns and cities throughout Hawaii and the western continental United States. The popularity of baseball spread to the point where there was a team in nearly every Japanese American farming community. 
By the 1920's, more than 100 teams had been formed consisting primarily of talented Nisei, or second generation Japanese Americans. Because of the discrimination and forced segregation of the time, the Nisei teams, like the teams in the Negro Leagues and in the All-American Girls Professional Baseball Leagues, played mostly against each other. However, they also successfully compete against high school, college, and semi-professional teams from white America, teams from the Negro Leagues, and even against baseball legends such as Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig, Ted Williams, Jackie Robinson, and Joe DiMaggio. 
In 1937, all-star teams consisting of Nisei players from California traveled to Japan, Korea, and Manchuria as ambassadors of goodwill. The Nisei teams competed throughout Asia where they impressed audiences with their talented play, sportsmanship, and aggressive style of fast-paced American baseball. However, the outbreak of World War II abruptly ended their overseas campaign as ambassadors of American goodwill. In the following months, many of these players and their families, because of their race, became the object of suspicion and mistrust in their own country. 
The serene life of farming and playing baseball ended abruptly with the announcement of Executive Order 9066. More than 120,000 Japanese Americans were relocated to remote internment camps across the United States. In an effort to preserve a sense of community and improve the living conditions of the interment camps, Japanese Americans set about 
recreating many of the social networks and clubs that were an integral part of their lives prior to their internment. For many of the younger Japanese Americans this meant banding together and forming baseball leagues that played several seasons behind barbed-wire fences. 
For Japanese Americans interned during World War II, playing, watching and supporting baseball was an important reprieve from the harsh nature of camp life. Popular Japanese American baseball players, such as Kenichi Zenimura, made it a mission to bring baseball to the internment camps. He and the Japanese American community worked tirelessly to build makeshift baseball stadiums where, for several hours each week, Japanese American communities could forget their worries and enjoy their worries and enjoy their favorite American pastime. For the many Japanese Americans who participated in the baseball leagues and the thousands who watched and supported the teams, the baseball leagues helped to rebuild a sense of civic pride and dignity which had greatly suffered as a result of their forced internment. 
In the post-war years, Japanese American baseball players took up their former role as ambassadors of goodwill and began traveling across the Pacific to play exhibiting games in Japan. In addition, prominent Japanese American baseball players, like Tsuneo `Cappy' Harada, contributed to the explosion of baseball's popularity in Japan by bringing famous Americans such as Lefty O'Doul and Joe DiMaggio to Japan for exhibitions and public appearances. These efforts by Harada and other greatly contributed to the internationalization of baseball as a professional sport and the popularity of baseball in Japan. The current practice of playing exhibition games in both American and Japan was started by Japanese American baseball players and provides opportunities for both American and Japanese players to compete in each other's countries. In recent years, American Cecil Fielder played for the Hanshin Tigers in Japan's Central League, while Japanese players, like Hideo Nomo, have competed for American teams. In addition, American and Japanese All-Star teams regularly compete in Japan. 
In spite of this rich tradition and history, the popularity of the Nisei Baseball Leagues gradually waned as discrimination and segregation faded in American society. By the 1970's the leagues had almost completely disappeared. However, the important contributions of Japanese American baseball players had, in recent years, been rediscovered for the benefit of all Americans. Historical exhibits, like `Diamonds in the Rough: Japanese Americans in Baseball,' which have traveled to many sites throughout the United States, have brought to the public's attention the important role Japanese Americans played in baseball's history. In addition, many younger Japanese Americans, have begun to participate in the historic Japanese American baseball leagues again. 
It is a great privilege to bring to the attention of the Congress and the American people the important contributions of the Japanese American baseball players. From their early days playing in segregated Japanese American leagues to their more recent role as promoters of baseball around the world, they have consistently demonstrated an incredible ability to overcome adversity and make the most of opportunities in even the most difficult of circumstances. In light of their many accomplishments, I am honored to commemorate the Japanese American baseball players today.

Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I, too, want to express my strong interest in amending the title IV-E statute so that Indian children placed by tribal courts have access to this program on the same basis as other children and that tribal governments with approved programs be made eligible for IV-E administrative and training funds on the same basis as States. Senator Campbell and I jointly wrote the Finance Committee on this matter. 
I would point out that the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs, in April 1995, held a hearing on welfare reform proposals. At that hearing, a representative of the Department of Health and Human Services, Office of the Inspector General, testified with regard to its August 1994 report: `Opportunities for Administration on Children and Families to Improve Child Welfare Services and Protections for Native American Children,' which documented that tribes receive little benefit or funding from the title IV-E Foster Care and Adoption Assistance Program--and other Social Security Act programs. The OIG report states: `The surest way to guarantee that Indian people receive benefits from these Social Security Act programs is to * * * provide direct allocations to tribes.' The OIG report also noted that the State officials with whom they talked preferred direct IV-E funding to tribes: 
With respect to IV-E funding, most State officials with whom we talked favored ACF (Administration on Children and Families) dealing directly with Tribes. This direct approach for title IV-E would eliminate the need for Tribal-State agreement, and because title IV-E is an uncapped Federal entitlement, would not affect the moneys available to the States.

 Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, the Internet is transforming every aspect of how a university performs research, teaches its students and reaches out to the public. In Hawaii and Alaska, the importance of the Internet is multiplied even more by the vast distances that separates us from the other 48 states, as well as the unique internal geography of our states which separate our citizens from each other by water, mountains or long distances. 
In October 1996, the Clinton Administration unveiled its Next Generation Internet (NGI) initiative, emphasizing that the Internet is the biggest change in human communication since the printing press. The initiative proposed a $100 million per year federal program to create the foundation for the networks of the 21st century. Approximately $95 million is being appropriated this year for the NGI. 
One of the initial NGI project goals is to connect at least 100 universities and national labs at speeds 100 to 1,000 times faster than today's Internet. The University of Hawaii and University of Alaska, along with many other institutions, have joined the Internet2 initiative which shares this objective. 
Unfortunately, high-speed connectiv- ity comparable to what the NGI project is bringing to research universities throughout the country is not even available, much less affordable, for the universities of our most remote states of Alaska and Hawaii. These are the states where telecommunications is most needed to counteract the isolation that is imposed by our remoteness. 
It must be noted first and foremost that our public universities in Alaska and Hawaii have already dug deep to pay their own fair share to obtain Internet connectivity. These two institutions already allocate more internal funding for Internet connections than any other university, yet they receive far less capacity for their dollars importance on the Internet, these universities are faced with urgent needs that cannot be reasonably accommodated through the commercial marketplace or federal grant mechanisms currently in place. 
For example, as part of the Internet2 project, major research universities are now planning increases in speed from 45 Mbps (million bits per second) to 150 Mbps and even 600 Mbps. According to the founding project director for Internet2, the expected cost for a 150 Mbps connection will average about $300,000 per year for mainland research universities. 
The University of Hawaii already pays much more than this--$448,000 per year--and this buys only a 6 Mbps connection from Hawaii to the mainland. The University of Alaska now pays $324,000 per year for a 4.5 Mbps connection. In other words, compared to the average that other universities are expected to pay for their NGI-capable connections, Hawaii is already paying 50 percent more for 1/25 of the capacity, and Alaska is paying nearly 10 percent more for 1/33 of the capacity. 
The rural states on the mainland found that their connection costs were higher than in urban areas and appealed for assistance. The National Science Foundation (NSF) recognized that the maximum $350,000 3-year grant to assist in establishing connections to its Very High Speed Backbone Network Service was not adequate to meet the costs in these rural states. In response, the NSF agreed to make 18 rural states, not including Alaska and Hawaii, eligible for special supplements of up to $200,000 over and above the $350,000 maximum grant. 
These rural mainland universities can obtain 45 Mbps connections for prices in the range of $150,000 to $360,000 per year. In comparison, the quoted prices for these connections to Alaska and Hawaii are $2.8 million and $2.5 million respectively, escalating to $6 million or more a year to meet future requirements. Further, even if funds were available within the states to pay these costs on an ongoing basis, the capacity is not readily available or even in place on an ongoing basis, the capacity is not readily available or even in place on the existing saturated fiber optic systems that connect Hawaii and Alaska to the rest of the country. 
Our research universities in Alaska and Hawaii need the same level of connectivity as their counterparts in California, Massachusetts, North Dakota and Colorado. Our remote universities are already paying much more and getting much less for their limited internal funding. 
This is not just a problem for our universities, but is fundamental to the overall economic development of our states. Ensuring high-speed Internet access to the only public institutions of higher education in Hawaii and Alaska also supports K-12 education, state government, and many other education, research and public sector organizations to which our universities provide technological leadership, support and services as the intellectual cornerstones of our communities. 
It is imperative that the federal government ensure fair access across the nation to the Internet and to our own federal initiatives such as the NGI. Just as a 32-cent stamp provides the same service anywhere in the country, so too must we consider ways to equalize access to the information superhighway. Further, we must solve this structural problem not just for the short term, but on a permanent basis. 
We urge the federal agencies which are receiving $95 million for the NGI this year, and which are planning on additional funding in the years to come, to take upon themselves the responsibility to ensure that the NGI reaches not just to those places that can be reached cheaply and easily, but to all fifty states. Technical staff at each university have been working long and hard to identify any possible means of achieving affordable high speed connectivity for their state. We ask that, as a nation, we reach out to find a stable and lasting solution to this urgent problem.

Mr. INOUYE. Under the provisions of the Library Services and Construction Act, Public Law 98-480, Native Hawaiian organizations are authorized to provide library services to Native Hawaiians. One of our most exemplary Federal grantees, Alu Like, Inc., has been administering the Native Hawaiian Library Project since 1985. 
Native Hawaiian children in the State's public school system start school well behind other students when it comes to crucial vocabulary skills. Hawaiian children enter kindergarten with lower vocabulary scores than other children (12th percentile: Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test--Revised, 1989), and in achievement tests of basic skills, Hawaiian students continue to perform below national norms and other groups in Hawaii. On the Reading Comprehension Subtest of the Stanford Achievement Test administered by the Hawaii State Department of Education in the spring of 1990, Hawaiian eighth grade students scored at the 18th percentile, the lowest of the four principal ethnic groups in Hawaii. A recent study in Hawaii by the Governor's Council for Literacy shows that Native Hawaiian adults have low literacy rates, with 30 percent at the lowest level compared with 19 percent of adults statewide. 
It is these statistics, and the need to assure that parents have reading skills sufficient to foster learning and reading skills in their preschool and school-age children, that the Native Hawaiian Library Project has sought to 
address. This has been made possible because of the federal resources that have been made available under the Library Services and Construction Act. The initial funding for this program was $590,123 and 1985, and because of the program's documented effectiveness, it has been funded each year thereafter for a total of $7,223,297. Funding in the past fiscal year was $635,025. 
It is my understanding that in enacting the Museum and Library Services Act, the Congress sought to extend the authority for the library services programs that have proven to be so effective in enriching the reading and vocabulary skills of Americans of all ages. In our State, it has enabled Native Hawaiian children to begin to perform on a par with other students, it has effected a reduction in the drop-out rates of Native Hawaiian students and demonstrated a marked improvement in their performance on achievement tests, and has enabled adults with new literacy skills to secure employment. 
It is because of the importance of this program to the Native Hawaiian people of our State that I seek your clarification that the bill to provide technical and conforming amendments to the Museum and Library Services Act, specifically section 6 of that measure, is intended simply to maintain the status quo relative to the federal support for Native Hawaiian library services by extending the authority for grants to Native Hawaiian organizations for this purpose.

 Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise today to address a project that unfortunately was not incorporated in the list of projects to be funded by the Economic Development Administration outlined in the Senate report to accompany the Fiscal Year 1998 appropriations bill for Commerce, State, Justice and the Judiciary. 
This project is the People's Lodge--a multi-cultural center designed to serve the urban Indian and Alaska Native populations in Seattle, Washington, and all of the Indian tribes in the Pacific Northwest and Alaska. The People's Lodge represents the next phase of development of the Daybreak Star Center and will include a permanent Hall of Ancestors exhibition, a multiple-use Potlatch House, and an exhibition gallery, the John Kauffman, Jr. Theater, a resource center, and the Sacred Circle of the American Indian Art. 
The federal funding for this project--approximately $13 million--would be matched by funds from private sources. The private fund-raising efforts are already well-underway. 
In the coming days, Senator Stevens and Senator Murray and I will be pursuing this matter directly with the Secretary of the Department of Commerce. 
Mr. President, it is my hope that the Economic Development Administration will agree with us as to the merits of this most worthwhile project.

 Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, the Public Housing Management Assessment Program was established under the National Affordable Housing Act of 1990 to ensure that public housing functions as a well-managed enterprise on a uniform, nationwide basis. The PHMAP was designed to institute a system of accountability that would help the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development monitor and evaluate management operations of housing authorities nationwide. PHMAP scores are based on ranking in seven areas: vacancy rate and unit turnaround time, modernization, rents uncollected, work orders, inspection of units and systems, financial management, resident services, and community building. 
The Hawaii Housing Authority is ranked the 29th largest authority of 4,000 housing authorities in the country. Last month, HUD announced that the HHA received a 92.5 score and high-performer status for its management program under PHMAP. This enables the State of Hawaii to continue to receive its share of Federal funding, and allows HHA maximum flexibility in using those federal funds. 
I would like to congratulate Hawaii Gov. Benjamin J. Cayetano, Ms. Sharon R. Yamada, executive director of the Hawaii Housing Authority, and the extraordinary staff of the HHA for this outstanding achievement. I proudly commend the staff of HHA for their dedication, hard work, and detailed attention to serving their housing customers.

Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I am pleased to lend my support to Senator Murkowski's bill that would amend Public Law 105-34, the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997, with respect to domestic aviation travel to, from, and within Hawaii and Alaska. Hawaii, unlike any other State, save Alaska, does not have the transportation alternatives that are available to citizens of other States. Roads, bridges, trains, and buses do not operate between the islands of Hawaii. This geographic difference causes any tax imposed on the cost of flying, our citizens' only means of getting from one island to another, to fall disproportionately on our citizens. 
This bill would correct any injustice that the citizens of Hawaii and Alaska were, perhaps inadvertently, subjected to as a result of last summer's passage of increased excise taxes on air transportation. Specifically, the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997's provision for the collection of an additional segment tax for each segment of air travel among the Hawaiian Islands disproportionately penalized Hawaii citizens. 
In addition, the current law definition of `rural airports' is under inclusive. Under the current law, Hawaii citizens traveling to and from an airport located within 75 miles of a high-traffic airport that is inaccessible to them because there are no paved roads connecting the two airports, are nonetheless ineligible for the reduced 7.5 percent tax. By amending the definition of `rural airports,' this bill will afford Hawaii citizens the same tax benefits as similarly situated citizens of other States. 
Therefore, I support the reinstatement of the pre-act formula for computing taxes on domestic segments that begin or end in Alaska and Hawaii, which would correct the inequitable tax treatment of Hawaii passengers under the current law. 
It is my hope that my colleagues will support this measure during the second session of the 105th Congress.

 Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I would like to take this moment to remember an extraordinary and talented individual. I join the multitude of people who noted the passing of James A. Michener with much sadness. I recall my meetings with Mr. Michener during his brief residency in Hawaii, during which time, he did much of his research on his monumental opus, `Hawaii.' 
Though some may have criticized his book, it was generally received by the people of Hawaii with great enthusiasm and commendation. He captured the spirit of early Hawaii, and reminded us of the sad plight of the indigenous people of Hawaii--the proud and noble Polynesians. We shall always be indebted to James Michener for introducing to the world the Hawaiian Islands that now constitute the 50th State of our Nation.

Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise to commend my colleagues for their work on the conference report on the Interior appropriations bill for fiscal year 1998. 
There are a few provisions of this bill that do not relate to matters of appropriations which would be more properly addressed by the authorizing committees of the Senate, and thus, I feel compelled to register concern that measures that are clearly substantive in nature--such as a comprehensive settlement of the claims of the Miccosukee Tribe of Florida--do not belong in this or any other appropriations bill. 
I raise this matter because in last year's Omnibus Appropriations Act, there was a provision that singled out one Indian tribal government for disparate treatment--namely, to strip that tribe of benefits and privileges that have been authorized for all other tribes in the country under the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act. I speak of the provision affecting the Narragansett Tribe of Rhode Island. 
Last year's provision came before this body over the strenuous and adamant objections of the Narragansett Tribe, without the benefit of any hearings, in the absence of any record that would serve to justify this unusual action on the part of the Congress, and with no consultation with the affected tribe. 
The Narraganset Indian Tribe advises us that this provision has forever changed the lives of the members of that tribe, and has wrought devastating effects on the potential for the development and growth of the tribal economy. 
Mr. President, I look forward to the day when the Congress acts to rectify the effects of last year's appropriations bill as it relates to the Narragansett Tribe.

Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, today I introduce the Communications Satellite Competition and Privatization Act of 1997. This bill amends the Communications Satellite Act of 1962 in order to promote full competition in the global satellite communication services market by fully privatizing satellite communications. It is my intention that the introduction of this bill in the Senate will spur debate on this important issue. It is my goal to work with all of my colleagues and all other interested parties to address the issues presented in this bill. 
In 1962, the United States and other countries around the world recognized the increasingly important role the new and emerging satellite technology could play in facilitating worldwide communications. In enacting the Communications Satellite Act of 1962, Congress sought to improve the global communications network by implementing a global, commercial communications satellite system, expeditiously. INTELSAT, Inmarsat, and Comsat emerged as the network that would connect Americans to countries throughout the world. 
INTELSATE, Inmarsat, and Comsat have undoubtedly fulfilled their missions and have provided us with valuable services. Through their communications network, they have connected us whether we are on land or on water, by voice, video, and data transmissions, and across continents. They have also played a pivotal role in pioneering the delivery of satellite communications. 
However, in the 35 years since the act has been adopted, the marketplace has changed and the time is now ripe for us to revisit the act and put in place a policy that will take the industry and the American consumers into the future. Today, many U.S. and foreign satellite systems participate in the global satellite marketplace. There are also an increasing number of satellite systems seeking authority to participate in the marketplace. As additional satellite systems enter the marketplace, competition must continue to flourish and consumers must obtain needed services at reasonable prices. The treaty-based status and intergovernmental structure of INTELSAT, Inmarsat, and Comsat must not hinder the ability of these carriers to effectively compete in the future and must not distort competition in the marketplace. 
Today, many individuals in the government and in industry, nationally and worldwide are working on the privatization of INTELSAT and Inmarsat. There is a recognition that the status quo will not benefit the marketplace nor will it benefit INTELSAT and Inmarsat, or Comsat. My introduction of this bill is intended to establish a framework in which the Senate can begin a larger discussion of the issues and ultimately craft legislation that promotes the delivery of state-of-the-art satellite communications and brings innovations and cost reductions to the public. I encourage my colleagues to join with me in supporting a policy that will continue to allow our satellite industry to grow and flourish and for consumers to receive the benefits of such advancements.

Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I am pleased to rise today in support of House Concurrent Resolution 8. The United States is beginning to take steps to maintain and protect our coral reef ecosystems. This resolution encourages us to continue to improve our stewardship of these treasures in the sea. Coral reefs are among the most biologically diverse and productive marine habitats. They occur throughout the world's tropical and subtropical regions and in the waters of two U.S. states, including my home state of Hawaii. 
Mr. President, coral reefs are vital to coastal economies, serving as the basis for coastal and marine tourism in several U.S. states and territories. Reefs also make substantial economic contributions by supporting subsistence and commercial reef fisheries. Coral reefs and the ecosystems they support are under increasing pressure, primarily from human activity. Of approximately 600,000 square kilometers of coral reefs worldwide, estimates are that 10 percent have been degraded beyond recovery and an additional 30 percent are likely to decline significantly within the next 20 years. 
We must strengthen our commitment to be stewards of coral reefs, to discourage harmful fisheries and other practices, to monitor and assess the health of these unique systems; and improve research of and education about coral reef ecosystems. Further, we must ensure that we balance preservation with sustainable use of our coral reef resources. We must identify factors contributing to the global decline of coral reef ecosystems and discourage overfishing and other practices that are harmful to coral reefs and human health. 
It is significant that this resolution is passed during the International Year of the Reef to focus attention on research and public awareness of coral reef issues. The resolution is an important step to promote preservation and sustainable use of coral reef resources worldwide. I appreciate the help of other Senators who have worked to see that our coral reefs are provided the attention that they deserve.

Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise this moment to express my complete support for the conference report on the defense appropriations bill for fiscal year 1998. 
As Chairman Stevens noted, this bill is within the budget allocation provided by the committee for defense funding. 
The amounts provided represents an increase of $5.4 billion, 2 percent above the amounts available during the current fiscal year. 
Mr. President, it is my view that this increase is very modest, and is fully justified under the circumstances. 
The increase is necessary to allow us to continue to modernize our forces, to protect readiness, and to fully fund a 2.8-percent cost-of-living increase for our men and women in uniform. And it allows us to protect the priorities of the Members of the Senate. 
This conference agreement is a compromise which I believe all Members should support. 
The bill was passed by the House with two controversial matters to which the administration strongly objected to--the B-2, and Bosnia. This conference report has dealt with those matters to the satisfaction of the administration. 
On the B-2 bomber, the conferees have provided the President with $331 million to begin the purchase of additional B-2 bombers. However, it is up to the President to determine whether to buy more aircraft, or to upgrade the existing fleet of B-2 bombers. Mr. 
President, I for one hope the President chooses to buy more B-2's. But here the choice is his. 
On Bosnia, the conferees agreed that consistent with the current plans of the administration all United States troops be removed from Bosnia by June 30th of next year. However, if the President certifies that it is in our national interest to maintain our presence in and around Bosnia, he can waive the restriction by consulting with and informing the Congress of his decision. And should the President decide to keep the forces in Bosnia, as Chairman Stevens noted, he shall submit a supplemental, if additional funds are required to pay for this deployment. 
Mr. President, this is an agreement which can be supported by both the Congress and the President. 
We should be grateful to Chairman Stevens and the House conferees for negotiating this very workable compromise. 
I would like to also mention the hard work of the staff under the staff director, Mr. Steve Cortese, and on the minority side, Mr. Charlie Houy. 
Mr. President, I think it should be noted that the staff worked long hours--in one instance throughout the whole night--to ensure that this conference report was completed before the end of this fiscal year. I believe that the Senate owes them its gratitude for their efforts. 
Mr. President, this is a good conference report. I urge all my colleagues to support its adoption. 
Once again, may I express to my colleagues my great pleasure in being able to serve them, together with Chairman Stevens. We are fortunate to have Chairman Stevens at the helm. 
Thank you, Mr. President. I reserve the remainder of my time.

Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I believe the Record should note that up until the latter part of 1967, America controlled the seas. Most of the cruise vessels were American owned, American built. Today, the situation is slightly changed. Last year, over 6.2 million passengers worldwide--and 75 percent were Americans. The Caribbean and the Bahamas regions, which is the largest North American market, does not have a single American cruise vessel. 
Cruises are the fastest growing segment of the tourism industry. They bring in over $7.5 billion in revenues. And 113 vessels currently operate in the North American market--1 American. Of the 30 companies operating in the North American market, 3 companies--foreign companies, Mr. President--command over 70 percent of the market. These foreign ships are obviously built in foreign shipyards. They employ very cheap foreign labor and operate outside our regulations. They pay no U.S. taxes and are not available for U.S. emergencies. 
Shipbuilding subsidies in foreign countries in recent years ranged from 9 percent to 33 percent of the cost of the vessel's construction. At a 9-percent construction subsidy, an operator today could build a new $500 million, 130,000-ton cruise vessel in a foreign yard and reduce its cost of capital by an astounding $45 million. The United States, since the early 1980's, has not subsidized the commercial construction of ships. 
These foreign companies also take advantage of the lower cost of foreign labor. In fact, the Wall Street Journal recently ran an article reporting these foreign cruise companies pay workers on board their ships a paltry $1.50 per day--that's right, $1.50 per day before tips--for 16 to 18 hours of work. We here in the United States have undertaken an aggressive campaign to stop the use of sweatshop labor, and we should hold these foreign-flag ships operating in the American market to those same high standards. 
But perhaps the main reason these vessels fly a foreign flag is to avoid U.S. tax laws. Although most of these foreign-flag cruise operations are located in the United States--and most of their passengers are Americans--they are protected by reciprocal international tax treaties. These reciprocal agreements allow the foreign-flag cruise ship companies to avoid the tax laws of the United States. For example, one large foreign-flag cruise operator recently reported earnings of approximately $1.8 billion in revenues for its cruise operations. While most of these revenues came from American passengers, this cruise line, under existing U.S. law, considers this foreign source income which is exempt from U.S. tax law. Because of this loophole, this one company did not pay any income tax on its cruise ship operations. Based on the companies' net income from cruise operations, this can be equated to a $158 million corporate income tax loss to the Federal Treasury. 
An existing operator of U.S.-flag cruise ships in Hawaii and on the inland waterways, however, is ready and willing to build new U.S. cruise ships and employ American workers. But since U.S. shipyards have not built a large oceangoing cruise ship in over 40 years, the first operator to do so faces a significant cost disadvantage. That is why the U.S.-flag cruise ship pilot project is so important. 
The pilot project will facilitate a series construction for two new cruise ships by requiring the operator to sign a binding shipyard contract with delivery of the first new vessel no later than 2005; the second by 2008. In order to replace a retired ship and develop market demand that operator will temporarily document an existing foreign-flag cruise ship for operation under U.S.-flag with U.S. crews while the new ships are constructed. 
This project is a milestone for our U.S.-flag cruise ship industry. After decades of dormancy in the oceangoing U.S. cruise ship arena, we now have a U.S. company that is willing to make a very substantial investment to try to rebuild our once proud U.S.-flag passenger fleet. Because this existing operator will make a very large investment in the development of new U.S.-flag cruise ships, which otherwise would not exist absent this significant investment, section 8109 includes a preference to ensure that other operators do not take advantage of this company incurring such `first mover' development costs and unfairly compete against the existing operator. I would note that Congress has provided similar incentives and preferences in other areas. The patent system is perhaps the most prominent example of such a restriction that protects, and thus encourages, investment in the development of new products and services that otherwise would not exist--even in highly competitive markets, such as the computer industry. 
The patent-like preference contained in section 8109 is for a very narrow segment of the highly competitive Hawaiian tourism market--domestic inter-island cruises. These cruises account for less than 1 percent of overall Hawaiian tourism and an even smaller percentage of the North American cruise market. Moreover, Hawaii vacationers will have many competitively priced vacation alternatives to these new cruise ships. In addition, foreign-flag cruise ships, with their significant cost advantages in terms of low capital costs, low foreign labor costs, and freedom from U.S. income tax, will still be free to call in Hawaii, just as they always have. In fact, in 1995 alone 12 competing foreign-flag cruise ships operated in the Hawaiian market. Nothing in this provision will change that. 
I recognize that there is a vibrant small U.S. passenger vessel fleet. I want to assure you that they are not affected by this provision. These U.S. operators will be able to enter and compete freely in the Hawaii cruise trade, including inter-island cruises. Mindful of this segment of the fleet, we were careful to draft section 8109 to exclude vessels measuring less than 10,000 gross tons and having berth or stateroom accommodation of fewer than 275 passengers, these thresholds accommodate not only the entire U.S. small passenger fleet, but also any new vessels planned. Nothing in section 8109 will bar this vessel from entering the inter-island cruise market in Hawaii or in anyway inhibits its operation, once the plans are finished and construction of the vessel is completed. 
Mr. President, this pilot project will help reverse the dreadful decline of the U.S.-flag cruise industry. It will jump start cruise ship construction in the United States, develop the U.S.-flag cruise industry, and help reduce U.S. shipyard dependence on DOD construction--all without Federal funds. 
The cruise industry is projecting that $7.5 billion will be invested in the construction of new vessels over the next 5 years--and not one cent of this investment will be spent in U.S. shipyards. This pilot project, however, will result in the construction in the United States of two state-of-the-art large oceangoing commercial cruise ships, representing a private capital investment in U.S. shipbuilding of approximately $1 billion. 
The pilot project will create thousands of American jobs in U.S. shipyards during construction and onboard the vessels upon completion and approximately 750 shipboard jobs on board the temporary vessel within 18 months. It will create some 2,500 shipyard and subcontractor jobs throughout the construction project. And upon completion of the new ships, over 2,000 permanent onboard and shoreside support jobs will be created. 
The pilot project will be supervised under DOD's MARITECH Program which Congress authorized in 1993 and has funded annually to facilitate advanced commercial shipbuilding in U.S. yards and the transition from depending on military construction to the competitive commercial market. Under MARITECH auspices two cruise ship design projects have been completed, led by the Ingalls and NASSCO shipyards. The pilot project would result in the actual construction of new cruise vessels in U.S. shipyards for the first time in 40 years. 
In addition to the commercial benefits of the pilot project, it is also of significant value to the Department of Defense. It will reduce the U.S. shipyards dependence on Defense funds needed to maintain an adequate industrial base. In fact, a recent letter from the Assistant Secretary of the Navy for Research Development and Acquisition, John Douglass called  
* * * the construction of large, oceangoing cruise ships vital to transitioning U.S. shipyards back into the construction of cruise ships and to sustain this country's shipbuilding industrial base. 
The Navy is also interested in exploring the potential use of the hull design for these cruise ships as the hull design for future Joint Command and Control ships. 
Mr. President, the Governor from my State of Hawaii has also expressed his support for the provision and the bipartisan National Security Caucus Foundation called the project `a perfect example of an appropriate commercial initiative.' Support for the pilot project can also be found within the maritime industry--the American Shipbuilding Association, Seafarers International Union, American Maritime Officers, American Classic Voyages Company, Transportation Institute, and American Maritime Officers Service. 
This project will provide the incentive for U.S. expansion in the cruise market, so that once again we can take pride in new U.S.-built oceangoing, U.S.-flag cruise ships. It will help to employ thousands of American workers, put the best shipbuilding technology in the world into commercial use, and help the Nation sustain a viable shipbuilding industrial base--all at no cost to the American taxpayers. It deserves our support. 
The program that we have set forth, supported by DOD and supported by the whole industry, will once again reestablish our cruise industry. 
So, Mr. President, I hope that my colleagues will adopt this amendment.

Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, before proceeding with my remarks, I wish to state for the Record that there are two States in this Union that prohibit gambling of any sort--the State of Utah and the State of Hawaii. In the State of Hawaii, it would be a crime to conduct bingo games. There are no poker games, no slot machines and no casinos in the State of Hawaii. The same thing presents itself in the State of Utah. Yet, I find myself rising to express my opposition to the amendment proposed by the distinguished Senator from Wyoming. 
Though I am personally against gaming, and I would oppose any attempt on the part of the State of Hawaii to institute gaming in our islands, I find that I support gaming for Indians because of two reasons. One, our Constitution states that Indian nations are sovereign and that we have carried this out by treaties and by laws and by Supreme Court decisions. Indian nations are sovereign. 
Second, there were 800 treaties, Mr. President, as we stated a few days ago, and of those 800 treaties, 430 are still lying idle in the archives of the U.S. Senate. These treaties have been lying there for over 100 years. And we have found that, though these treaties are in correct form and appropriate because of changes in circumstances, the Senate has decided not to consider them, debate them, have hearings on them, or pass upon them. And 370 were ratified by this body. But, Mr. President, sadly, I think we should note that of the 370 treaties that we ratified, we have violated provisions in every single one of them. 
These were solemn documents and many of them had language and phrases that were very eloquent, very dramatic. Imagine a treaty beginning with words, such as, `As long as the sun rises in the east and sets in the west, as long as the rivers flow from the mountains to the streams below, this land is yours.' 
Indians started off with 500 million acres of land. Over the years, because of our violation of provisions in our treaties, and because of our refusal to consider these treaties, Indians have 50 million acres left. This was their land. There were sovereign nations long before we came here. When they gave up this land, we promised them certain things, such as providing them shelter, education, and health facilities. And what do we find in their land? Unemployment averaging 57 percent. We pride ourselves with our low unemployment rate in our Nation of 5.2--5.2 for the Nation and 57 percent for Indian country. Some unemployment rates are as high as 92 percent, Mr. President. The health conditions in Indian country are worse than in third world countries--the worst statistics on cancer and the worst statistics on respiratory diseases. And if you look at the social life in Indian country, it is a scandal. We as Americans should be embarrassed and ashamed of ourselves. The suicide rate among the young people in Indian country is eight times our national norm. Some 50 percent of the young ladies in Indian country have considered suicide. 
If this Nation had lived up to the promises that we made many decades ago, I would not be standing here speaking against the Senator from Wyoming, because I am against gaming. Hawaii is against gaming. But, today, I find that I must speak in opposition. 
Mr. President, regretfully, the chairman of the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs is not able to be with us at this moment because of a very important and very urgent matter that suddenly came to his attention. He has asked me to express his concerns, and he has said that this statement I am about to present meets with his approval, and so it is a joint statement of the Senator from Colorado, Mr. Ben Nighthorse Campbell, and myself. 
Mr. President, 2 months ago, Senator McCain, the distinguished Senator from Arizona, and I introduced a bill to amend the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act. A hearing on this bill has been scheduled for October 8. 
It was not scheduled today. This has been announced, and it was announced over a month ago, long before this measure was up for consideration. 
So I would like to suggest to my distinguished colleague from Wyoming that the proper forum to consider his proposal would be before that committee. I can assure my friend from Wyoming that his proposition will be considered with all seriousness. 
We have consistently opposed efforts to amend the Indian Gaming Act in a piecemeal fashion. And this is what it is. We do so again today. 
At a time when the Indian Affairs Committee, the authorizing committee, is making every effort to make adjustments in the act which will reflect contemporary realities, this amendment only serves to undermine our efforts to assure that any amendment to the act is consistent with over 200 years of Federal law and policy. 
For the benefit of our colleagues here who may not be familiar with the context in which this amendment is proposed, allow me to share with you a few relevant facts. 
Last year the Supreme Court of the United States ruled on one important aspect of the regulatory act. While the Court did not strike any provision of the act, its decision left a vacuum of remedies when a State and a tribal government come to an impasse in negotiations which would otherwise lead to a tribal-State compact. These compacts, pursuant to the law, govern the conduct of class 3 gaming in Indian lands. 
The Secretary of the Interior has stepped into the void created by the Court's ruling by inviting public comments on whether an alternative means of reaching a compact ought to be established through the regulatory process until the Congress has the opportunity to act. The Secretary has not had and does not have any intention to establish regulations on his own. He is assisting our committee. He is assisting the Congress of the United States by inviting comments from all interested parties--Indian country, gambling interests, government officials, Governors, attorneys general, and present them to us. The decision will be made here, not by the Secretary of the Interior. 
This amendment is designed to preclude the Secretary from proceeding in what many believe is a constructive effort to advance the public dialog. If anything, we should be encouraging the Secretary to invite comments so that it will help us to expedite our efforts. But this amendment does not just prevent the Secretary from proceeding--it would also effect a dramatic change in the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act by federally preempting the laws of each State. 
I hope that my colleagues realize that this amendment, which looks innocuous and reasonable, will have that effect of telling the several States of this Union that, notwithstanding their constitution or their laws, this is the way business is to be carried out. 
Under the current law, the regulatory act does not touch any State's law or constitution. Mr. President, we did this very deliberately--when we enacted the law. 
Instead, the act recognizes that each State's constitution, and State laws enacted in furtherance of the State constitution, may differ in many respects. There are 50 States, 50 different constitutions, and 50 different sets of laws. 
Over the course of the last 9 years, as a function of litigation on this very point, we have learned a lot about the various States' laws. For example, some States and their constitutions provide that the Governor is authorized to enter into contracts, agreements, or compacts with another sovereign. The Governor is authorized to do that. 
Other State constitutions would require the ratification of the Governor's action by the State legislature. Some States don't require that. Still, other constitutions provide that only the State legislature can act for the State in terms of entering into binding legal agreements. And there are other State constitutions that are silent as to these responsibilities. In some States their laws determine when the Governor can act on behalf of the State and in what circumstances the legislature must act. And the supreme courts of the various States have issued many opinions on these matters at great length. 
This amendment we are considering at this moment will now require that no tribal-State compact can be approved by the Secretary unless both the Governor of the State and the legislature of the State have approved this compact. 
This amendment will, therefore, set aside the constitutions of the various States, the laws of the various States, and would impose new requirements on each State, notwithstanding what their constitutions or law may provide to the contrary. 
This is a very substantial change in Federal law effecting rights that States jealously guard. 
I know of no Governor who has expressed a desire to have the laws of his or her State preempted by Federal law. 
In 2 weeks' time the authorizing committee will carry this dialog forward and provide an opportunity for all affected parties to weigh in with their views. We are hoping at that time the distinguished Senator from Wyoming will present his views to the Committee on Indian Affairs. And this amendment, Mr. President, will preempt that very important public discussion. 
Mr. President, I want to make very clear that I do not question the wisdom of the proponents of this amendment. I just believe that there are others--State and tribal governments--upon whom the effect of this amendment will be directly visited and who ought to have the opportunity to have their views known. 
So, once again, Mr. President, I call upon the Senator from Wyoming to withdraw this amendment and allow the authorizing committee to proceed with our work where his concerns and the concerns of his colleagues will have the benefit of full public consideration. 
Mr. President, it is true that there are 171 compacts that have been approved. It is also true that there are about 120 gaming establishments presently on Indian reservations. But it should be pointed out that less than 10 are making money. I am certain all of us know, or should know, that reservation lands are trust lands. Actually the titles to those lands lie in the hands of the Government of the United States. So, as a lawyer would say, they cannot be alienated. One cannot go to the bank and say, `I want to borrow $1 million, and I will put up this parcel of land as collateral.' You can't do that with reservation lands. So, in order to initiate or establish a gaming enterprise, these Indian governments have to go out to other sources for financing. When that happens, Mr. President, I am certain you realize that the rates that they would have to pay are much, much stiffer than what you and I would be required 
to pay to a bank. Yes, moneys are flowing in. But at this time Indians are not making that money. Operators are making that money. 
But those Indian tribes that are making a few dollars have applied those moneys to causes and to projects that we have failed to provide. They are building schools that we should have built. They are building hospitals that we should have built. They are building homes that we promised them. 
So, Mr. President, though I oppose gaming in any form, if this country is unable to or refuses to live up to the promises that we made by treaty, if this is the only way they can raise funds, so be it. 
Mr. President, I hope that this body will give their committee, the Committee on Indian affairs, an opportunity to conduct this hearing, receive the views of all of our colleagues, and act accordingly. 
So, with that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.  
Mr. ENZI addressed the Chair.

Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I wish to commend my friend from Wyoming for his reasonable approach. But I must say that I would still have to oppose the whole amendment because this is a piecemeal handling of this very important proposition which we have before us. 
I would like to read for the Record a statement issued by the administration. 
It says: 
The Department-- 
The Department of the Interior-- strongly opposes denying any tribe the badly needed economic opportunity envisioned and authored by IGRA. 
The Indian Gaming Regulatory Act. 
Indian gaming has provided benefits to over 120 tribes and their surrounding communities in over 20 States. As required by law, revenues have been directed to programs and facilities to improve the health, safety, educational opportunity and quality of life for Indian people. 
The amendment--Of the Senator from Wyoming-- would deny similar economic opportunities for additional tribes and communities. 
Accordingly, I hope most respectfully that the Senator would seriously consider withdrawing the amendment, and I can assure him in behalf of the chairman of the Indian Affairs Committee that we will accommodate him to every extent possible. He can tell us what witnesses he wishes to be heard. In fact, I am certain we will be able to accommodate him as to when the hearings are conducted. Our first day of hearings will be on October 8, but if he wants 3 days of hearings I can assure the Senator from Wyoming that he will have 3 days of hearings, or 4 days of hearings. 
I can also assure the Senator that we will very seriously consider every proposition that he makes. So I hope that his amendment would be withdrawn. 
I thank the Chair. 
Mr. GORTON addressed the Chair.

Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I very sadly find I must rise and respond to the statement just made by my friend from Washington. First, he stated that a promise of a hearing is a hollow one. I find this rather sad, because I have always considered any promise that I have made for hearings as a very serious one. In fact, the hearings that the Senator alluded to were held by the Indian Affairs Committee in an extra large committee hearing room, and we accommodated every witness that was submitted to us by the Senator from Washington. We invited every person that was on his list. 
Furthermore, we made it known to the attorneys general and the Governors of the several States. None wished to be heard. Every Indian country spoke up against the Senator's proposition. I don't think that was a hearing that was taken lightly. 
As to the hearings that will commence on October 8, I would like to point out, respectfully, that the bill that we will be considering is a result of over a year of consultation with attorneys general, with Indian leaders, with Governors. Before that, for 2 years Senator McCain and I traveled to the several States meeting personally, eyeball to eyeball, with attorneys general, with Governors. We spent hours, we spent days, weeks, months, meeting with these officials to discuss the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act. We did not take our responsibilities lightly. We take it very seriously, especially in my case when I am opposed to gaming. I don't want to see people running gaming operations, people that I would not invite into my home. We take it very seriously. 
There was another matter that was brought up by my friend from Washington. He stated that Indian nations were purchasing parcels of land and having them placed into trusts by the Interior Department, and then establishing gaming operations. This is the law that was passed 8 years ago: 
Gaming regulated by this act shall not be conducted on lands acquired by the Secretary in trust for the benefit of an Indian tribe after the date of the enactment of this act, unless the Governor of the State in which the gaming activity is to be conducted concurs in the Secretary's determination. 
May I make this flatout statement, that the Interior Department has not approved any gaming activity on any land acquired and placed in trust if such gaming activity did not meet the concurrence of the Governor. That is the law of the land. One would gather from the discussions of the Senator from Washington that Indians are, helter skelter, buying properties all over this Nation, placing them in trust and then, in turn, establishing gaming enterprises. 
Yes, it is true that Indians are purchasing lands. They are trying to get back lands that belonged to them that were part of their reservations and taken away in violation of treaties and then placed in trust. But then they need the approval of the Governor, and, if the Governor has not granted this approval, there has been no gaming activity. That is a fact, sir. 
I can assure my colleagues that the promise we make of a hearing is not a hollow one. We will accommodate every witness that they submit to us. We will give them ample time to testify. If it means meeting a week or 2 weeks, we will do so, because the matter before us is an important one. 
Yes, there are tribes that are making money on this. There are tribes that are flourishing as a result of gaming activities. But there are only 8 tribes out of 121 casinos that are making money. The Nation at this moment is spending about $40 billion in gaming. Of that amount, $3 billion is being spent in Indian country, but the profits of less than 10 percent go to the Indians at this time. 
So, we have treated the Indians badly. Let's not exacerbate that. 
Mr. President, this is from the Secretary of the Interior: 
I respectfully request that you oppose this type of amendment to the Interior appropriations bill. I have recommended to the President that he veto similar legislative amendments placed in previous appropriations bills.

Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, as vice chairman of the authorizing committee of jurisdiction, I call upon my colleague from Florida to allow this settlement to have the benefit of a hearing in the committee. 
In the absence of a hearing in the Senate, there will be absolutely no legislative history associated with the action that the Senate would be taking in approving this settlement. 
I know of no other Indian settlement that has been ratified without full consideration in the authorizing committees. 
As you well know, the Congress is vested with plenary authority in the field of Indian affairs. 
We have always taken our responsibilities in this area very seriously--and I believe that it is incumbent upon us to have the benefit of a record upon which we can base a ratification of this settlement agreement. 
If the hearing schedule that the chairman of the Committee on Indian Affairs has established is full, I would be pleased to chair a hearing on this settlement in the very near future, and you can be assured of my personal commitment that committee action on the settlement will be expedited. 
With these commitments in mind, I ask the Senator from Florida to withdraw his amendment and allow the authorizing committee to do its work.

Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, as the vice chairman of the Committee on Indian Affairs, I feel that I must object to this amendment. 
However meritorious its intent may be, it seems to me that there are serious legal ramifications to the proposal that we have not had an opportunity to evaluate. 
As Americans, we have come to rely on the constitutional protections that are accorded to property rights under the law. 
One of those rights is to be free in the use and enjoyment of our property--provided of course that our uses of property do not present any danger to the health or safety of the public. 
Even when land is held in trust by the United States for an Indian tribe, the principal restriction on the use of trust property is a restriction against alienation. 
In the modern era of self-governance and self-determination, this Government has long since abandoned the paternalistic stance of dictating to the tribes the details of everyday life on reservations. 
The principle which informs the fifth amendment to our Constitution--that there will be no taking of property without just compensation--is precisely why we have spent so much time debating the issue of federally imposed land restrictions in the Congress. 
The Wyandotte Tribe of Oklahoma has owned the Huron Cemetery--held beneficial title to the Huron cemetery as a function of an 1867 treaty--for 130 years. 
And yet today, without the benefit of a hearing or any public consideration--and importantly--without the benefit of any consultation with the Wyandotte Tribe of Oklahoma, we are being asked to impose a restriction on the tribe's use of its own land. 
Mr. President, I am not aware that there is any emergency at stake here. 
I know of no reason why we must take this precipitous action on an appropriations bill. 
I believe if the good gentleman from Kansas were to introduce his amendment as authorizing legislation, we could all have the benefit of the kind of information that can be gathered in a formal hearing. 
We could be apprised of what legal liabilities may flow from the proposed amendment. 
The Wyandotte Tribe of Oklahoma can be afforded the due process of law which our Constitution guarantees to all Americans, before the Senate of the United States decides to dictate to this tribe, the manner in which it can use its property. 
Mr. President, I would be remiss if I were to fail to seize this opportunity to suggest that were we to adopt this amendment without the benefit of any hearings or any assessment of its impact--both as a legal matter and as a matter of policy--we will be establishing a precedent that we ought to think very carefully about. 
Are we going to vest ourselves with the responsibility of micro-managing the use of tribal lands across this Nation--50 million acres of land? 
Are we going to return to the days when this Government told the Indians that we were the `Great White Father'--and we would decide what was best for them? 
I, for one, will not go down that road, and I hope that my colleagues will not do so either, until and unless, there is some overwhelming and compelling reason for doing do. 
Personally, I don't believe that the use of the Huron cemetery by the Wyandotte Tribe of Oklahoma presents that compelling a case--nor do I know why we would or should address this matter today. 
Mr. President, let us proceed cautiously and deliberately, as the American public desires us to do--let us examine carefully what is at issue, and take action, only after we have done so, and only after we are informed of all of the facts.

Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I commend my good friend from Kansas. I ask the Senator from Kansas to temporarily set this amendment aside because the chairman of the Indian Affairs Committee is presently presiding at a very important hearing, and I believe he would want to be heard. It is not the intention of the committee to stall this but to accommodate Senator Campbell. So as soon as he is completed, we will try to resolve this matter.

Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, thank you very much. 
Mr. President, this is a battle day--an important day in Indian country. And I am certain that Indian country applauds the resolution that has been reached concerning sections 118 and 120 of this bill. 
So, Mr. President, I rise to join my colleagues in applauding and commending the distinguished Senator from Washington for making this day possible. 
I am well aware--and I am certain that all of us are well aware--of the controversy that sections 118 and 120 have engendered over the past 2 months. It has been a difficult time for all of us. 
Indian country has been vocal in its opposition to these provisions--and I believe rightly so--for these sections go to the very essence and the very foundation of our relationship with Indian governments. 
As my chairman, the distinguished Senator from Colorado, Senator Nighthorse Campbell, has indicated, section 118 will cause us to revisit the commitments this Government made to Indian nations in over 800 solemn treaties. Most Americans are not aware that our relationship with the Indian country is based upon treaties, the Constitution of our land, decisions of the Supreme Court, and the laws of this land. These 800 treaties enable the United States to exercise dominion and control over 500 million acres of land which once belonged exclusively to our Nation's first citizens. 
As Chairman Campbell has indicated, section 120 would have stripped tribal governments of one of the most fundamental attributes of their sovereignty. 
So, in the days ahead, I hope we can focus our attention on the concerns that sections 118 and 120 were designed to address in a venue that will enable the full participation of those who would be most directly affected by these provisions, the tribal governments and the citizens of Indian country. For it is my sincere belief that the solutions to these matters can be found in Indian country and that the tribal government leaders will join us in this effort, and that is the way it should be. If we are to legislate, it should be only after we have given careful and thoughtful consideration to these matters. We should have the benefit of all affected citizens, Indians and non-Indians, and whatever we come up with ought to have the benefit of some consensus. 
With this in mind, I have given my personal assurance to the chairman of the Interior appropriations subcommittee, the Senator from Washington, that we will seriously and deliberately address these matters in the authorizing committee. We have received assurances of the chairman of that committee, Senator Ben Nighthorse Campbell. 
In the interim, I am pleased we have been able to reach agreement and that we have done so in a manner that will enable us to work together in partnership with Indian country as well as other affected citizens to assure the best outcome within the context of our history, our laws and our policy. 
So, Mr. President, once again, may I applaud and commend my friend from Washington, Senator Slade Gorton.

Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, as my distinguished friend from New Mexico suggested, the matter before us is a very complex one. The history that we will be considering in the days ahead, when we debate this matter, is also a complex one filled with tragedy and filled with sadness. 
It is true, as stated by my friend from Washington, that many of the tribes are not treaty tribes. But I will explain why I believe it is not so. 
Mr. President, when the first European came upon this land, anthropologists have suggested there were anywhere from 10 million to 50 million native Americans residing in the present 48 States. Today, the number is less than 2 million. 
The history of our relationship with our first citizens is not a very happy one, Mr. President. In the early days, we looked upon them and counted upon them to help us in our wars. The record indicates that if it were not for certain tribes belonging to the Iroquois Confederacy, General Washington and his troops at Valley Forge could very well have perished. These Indians traveled hundreds of miles carrying food on their backs so that our troops would be fed. 
Well, that was a long time ago, Mr. President. But this is part of our history. There was a time when Indians sent ambassadors here because they were sovereign nations, just as sovereign as Britain or France or China or Japan. And we treated them as sovereigns. 
So sovereign nations conferring with other sovereign nations usually come forth with an agreement which we call treaties. 
Our history shows that we entered into 800 treaties with Indian nations. Of that number, 430 never came to this floor. They are somewhere in the archives of the Senate of the United States. For one reason or another, we decided not to act upon these treaties, treaties that were signed either by the President of the United States or his designated representative. They were solemn papers, documents that started with very flowery words such 
as: `As long as the sun rises in the east and sets in the west, as long as the rivers flow from the mountains to the oceans, this land is yours.' 
It is true, as I indicated, that not all Indian nations are treaty nations, because 430 of the 800 treaties were not ratified, were not even discussed, were not debated, were not considered. But most of the remaining treaties are treaties that were signed in perpetuity. 
It is true that there are some that were not signed in perpetuity. But most of them had the flowery language: `As long as the sun rises in the east and sets in the west, that is yours.' 
Then we decided that the 370 remaining treaties may have been a mistake. And, Mr. President, this is a chapter that many of us would try to forget and it is almost difficult to believe. But we proceeded to violate provisions in every one of them. 
Ours is a proud Nation. We always point to other nations and say, `You have violated a treaty. You have violated START II. You have violated the nuclear proliferation treaty,' and we convince ourselves that we always fulfill every provision in our treaties. Yes, today we do so. 
But there was a time when we disregarded these solemn promises. After the treaties were signed, we decided that Indians were a nuisance. That is a harsh word to use, but we established a policy of extermination. We may not have used that word, but the actions we took were extermination. 
We often hear about the trail of tears. We have had hundreds of trails of tears. For example, the Cherokees were rounded up in the Carolinas--thousands of them. They were rounded up in the summertime, and in the wintertime, with their summer attire, some in shackles, had to travel across the country to Oklahoma. It is no surprise that over half of them perished. These were the trails of tears. 
Oklahoma, Mr. President--we hate to admit this--is a dumping ground. There are tribes there that cannot trace their ancestral land in Oklahoma. What are the Apache doing in Oklahoma? What are the Seminoles doing in Oklahoma? What are the Cherokees doing in Oklahoma? They were sent there, and oftentimes sent to areas that no one wanted. Yes, if we found gold on certain land, that treaty was violated. 
So, Mr. President, this is a very complex issue. After the Indian wars--and we oftentimes look back to those days with great pride; there were great soldiers, great generals, like General Custer--at the end of the Indian wars, as a result of wartime death, disease, and such, the Indian population of the land had come down to 250,000--250,000. 
Yet, with this background, with this history, I think we should recall this footnote. 
In all of the wars that we have been involved in since World War II of this century, native Americans have put on the uniform to participate in the defense of our freedoms, our liberties, our Constitution, our people, and our land. They have sent more men on a per capita basis than any other ethnic group. More men from Indian reservations served in Desert Storm on a per capita basis than any other ethnic group. 
In fact, we oftentimes look at that great statue of the raising of the flag at Iwo Jima on Mt. Suribachi. It should be noted that of the five Americans that are raising the flag, one is an Indian. That has been the contribution of Indian men and Indian women throughout our history. They have done so notwithstanding their strange and tragic history in the back. So I think they have earned the right to say, `Let's not break any more treaties.' Enough is enough. 
Mr. President, like my distinguished friend from Washington, my friends from Colorado, New Mexico, Arizona, and Alaska, I look forward to this great debate where we can finally with some definitiveness and with some depth discuss our relationship with the first citizens. 
In closing, I will read part of the statement of Governor Stevens of the State of Washington when he asked the tribe in the Pacific Northwest to sign the treaty of Point Elliott. The Governor used some extraordinary words:  
There will be witnesses. These witnesses will be tides. You Indians know that the tide goes out and comes in, that it never fails to go in or out. You people know that streams that flow from the mountains never cease flowing. You people know the sun rises and sets and never fails to do so. Those are my witnesses. And you Indians, your witnesses and these promises will be carried out and your promises to me and the promises to the Great Father made to you will be carried out as long as these three witnesses continue.

Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise to introduce legislation that would make very minor changes to the antidumping provisions of the Tariff Act of 1930. This bill will clarify Commerce Department authority to allocate costs in antidumping cases consistent with sound accounting principles and commercial reality. Although the antidumping law generally affords the Commerce Department wide latitude in determining proper cost allocations in antidumping cases, developing case law in this area severely limits the ability of the Department to calculate accurate dumping margins. Specifically, these cases interpret the current antidumping statute to prevent the Department from relying on cost allocations based on revenues, even though revenue-based allocations are widely accepted in the accounting profession and often are most appropriate in particular fact situations. 
This bill would not require a particular kind of cost allocation in any given case. Rather, the proposal would clarify the Department of Commerce's authority to use any appropriate cost allocation methodology, including a revenue-based methodology, consistent with generally accepted accounting principles and the particular facts of the case at hand.

Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I share the concerns of my colleagues from Alaska and Hawaii regarding the new airline ticket tax formula. I, like Senators Murkowski, Stevens, and Akaka, am distressed that a bill that has so many important provisions that will benefit the Nation and citizens of Hawaii, badly misjudges the need for and importance of air transportation in both Alaska and Hawaii. 
Hawaii, unlike any other State in the Union, is completely isolated from any other landmass. In terms of interisland/intrastate travel, my State is totally dependent on air transportation. Maintaining the stable, low-fare air transportation system we currently have is essential to the State of Hawaii. Similarly, we must also maintain a low-fare environment to stimulate the influx of tourists. Tourism is Hawaii's No. 1 industry. Given this utterly unique feature of our State, I am most disappointed that this bill imposes not only a segment tax on our citizens who must travel between the islands to conduct daily business and to visit family members, but also imposes the segment tax, an excise tax and a departure tax on passengers coming from any other State in the Union to Hawaii. According to the local carriers in the State of Hawaii, in 1998, interisland customers would pay an additional 16 percent in taxes, increasing to 54 percent in 2003. No other State, other than Alaska, will face fare increases as significant as those which the new legislation will impose on the residents and tourists of Hawaii. We must recognize that Alaska and Hawaii are unique and must accommodate these States' dependence on air travel in legislation that impacts the primary means of commerce on our States. 
I am pleased that Senator Murkowski plans to introduce legislation to rectify this situation and I will strongly support him in those efforts.

Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my chairman today, Senator Ben Nighthorse Campbell, as a cosponsor of legislation to provide for an amendment in authorizing legislation that will enable the National Indian Gaming Commission to adjust the manner in which fees are imposed on the gaming operations that are subject to regulation under the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act of 1988. 
Mr. President, it has been 9 years since the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act was enacted into law. In the ensuing years, there has been a substantial increase in the number of tribal government-sponsored gaming operations, as well as a significant shift in the number of operations that are engaged in the conduct of class III gaming operations. 
The bill we introduce today might be considered as companion legislation to a bill introduced earlier this week by Senator John McCain, and a bill that Senator Campbell is developing for introduction in the fall. All three measures are intended to reflect the contemporary realities of tribal gaming and the need for a regulatory framework that can respond to the growth in Indian gaming. 
Mr. President, we proceed with this separate legislation because of the pressing need to assure that the Commission is adequately funded, and that the Commission has the capacity, independent of Federal appropriations, to address a far wider array of regulatory demands than we could have anticipated in 1988.

Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise to expound upon a provision in the Transportation appropriations bill to forgive the State of Hawaii from its obligation to repay $30 million owed to the Airport Revenue Fund for ceded land payments to the Office of Hawaiian Affairs [OHA]. 
Current law states that airport revenues can only be used for airport purposes. The U.S. Department of Transportation's inspector general found in September of 1996, that the approximately $30 million in ceded land payments made from the Hawaii Airport Revenue Fund were not in compliance with the law. In April of this year, the U.S. Department of Transportation affirmed the decision, and is seeking the repayment of those moneys. 
A continuation of the status quo--continued ceded land payments from the Airport Revenue Fund--was not possible. It was counter to the U.S. Department of Transportation's position and policy. I did not have the support of my colleagues to legislate its continuation. At this time, forgiveness of the $30 million debt was possible and achievable. I thank my colleagues for allowing for the congressional forgiveness of an airport revenue diversion in order to aid the State of Hawaii and the Office of Hawaiian Affairs. 
However, I would like to make clear that as a result of the U.S. Department of Transportation ruling and the pending legislation, the removal of the Airport Revenue Fund for use by the State of Hawaii as a source of compensating the Office of Hawaiian Affairs for use of ceded lands upon which the airports sit, should not equate to a like reduction in the State's obligation to OHA under State law. This forgiveness provision should not be construed as a forgiveness of the State's obligation to OHA. 
The airports continue to sit on ceded lands. The State's obligation to compensate OHA for the use of the land upon which the airports sit should also continue. The only difference would now be the source the State will draw upon to satisfy its obligation. I have viewed my role as aiding in alleviating the accumulated debt to reduce the pressure, and thereby allow the State and OHA to return to the negotiating table to work toward a mutually acceptable course of action that accepts as a premise, the existence of an obligation. 
To ensure that my intent is clear in this regard, I have requested the inclusion of the following provision in section 335: 
Nothing in this Act shall be construed to affect any existing statutes of the several states that define the obligations of such states to Native Hawaiians, Native Americans or Alaskan Natives in connection with ceded lands, except to make clear that airport revenues may not be used to satisfy such obligations. 
Mr. President, in light of the unique history of Hawaii's ceded lands and the obligations that flow from these lands for the betterment of the native Hawaiian people, I believe that this is more than a fiscal matter, this is a fiduciary matter--one of trust and obligation. Section 335 ensures that the State of Hawaii and OHA would not be required to return funds already in their possession. It is my expectation that this will calm the waters and clear the way for reasoned negotiations as the State, in good faith, looks to satisfy its obligations from other sources.

Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, for nearly 3 years, the people of Guam endured war time atrocities and suffering. As part of Japan's assault against the Pacific, Guam was bombed and invaded by Japanese forces within 3 days of the infamous attack on Pearl Harbor. At that time, Guam was administered by the United States Navy under the authority of a Presidential Executive order. It was also populated by then American nationals. For the first time since the War of 1812, a foreign power invaded United States soil. 
In 1952, when the United States signed a peace treaty with Japan, formally ending World War II, it waived the rights of American nationals, including those of Guamanians, to present claims against Japan. As a result of this action, American nationals were forced to seek relief from the Congress of the United States. 
Today, I rise to introduce the Guam War Restitution Act, which would amend the Organic Act of Guam and provide restitution to those who suffered atrocities during the occupation of Guam in World War II. There are several key components to this measure. 
The Restitution Act would establish specific damage awards to those who are survivors of the war, and to the heirs of those who died during the war. The specific damage awards would be as follows: First, $20,000 for death; second, $7,000 for personal injury; and third, $5,000 for forced labor, forced march, or internment. 
The Restitution Act would also establish specific damage benefits to the heirs of those who survived the war, who made previous claims but have since died. The specific damage benefits would be as follows: First, $7,000 for personal injury; and second, $5,000 for forced labor, forced march, or internment. Payments for benefits may either be in the form of a scholarship, payment of medical expenses, or a grant for first-time home ownership. 
This act would also establish a Guam trust fund from which disbursements will be made. Any amount left over in the Fund would be used to establish the Guam World War II Loyalty Scholarships at the University of Guam. 
A nine-member Guam Trust Fund Commission would be established to adjudicate and award all claims from the Trust Fund. 
The United States Congress previously recognized its moral obligation to the people of Guam and provided reparations relief by enacting the Guam Meritorious Claims Act on November 15, 1945 (Public Law 79-224). Unfortunately, the Claims Act was seriously flawed and did not adequately compensate Guam after World War II. 
The Claims Act primarily covered compensation for property damage and limited compensation for death or personal injury. Claims for forced labor, forced march, and internment were never compensated because the Claims Act excluded these from awardable injuries. The enactment of the Claims Act was intended to make Guam whole. The Claims Act, however, failed to specify postwar values as a basis for computing awards, and settled on prewar values, which did not reflect the true postwar replacement costs. Also, all property damage claims in excess of $5,000, as well as all death and injury claims, required congressional review and approval. This action caused many eligible claimants to settle for less in order to receive timely compensation. The Claims Act also imposed a 1-year time limit to file claims, which was insufficient as massive disruptions still existed following Guam's liberation. In addition, English was then a second language to a great many Guamanians. While a large number spoke English, few could read it. This is particularly important since the Land and War Claims Commission required written statements and often communicated with claimants in writing. 
The reparations program was also inadequate because it became secondary to overall reconstruction and the building of permanent military bases. In this regard, the Congress enacted the Guam Land Transfer Act and the Guam Rehabilitation Act (Public Laws 79-225 and 79-583) as a means of rehabilitating Guam. The Guam Land Transfer Act provided the means of exchanging excess Federal land for resettlement purposes, and the Guam Rehabilitation Act appropriated $6 million to construct permanent facilities for the civic populace of the island for their economic rehabilitation. 
Approximately $8.1 million was paid to 4,356 recipients under the Guam Meritorious Claims Act. Of this amount, $4.3 million was paid to 1,243 individuals for death, injury, and property damage in excess of $5,000, and $3.8 million to 3,113 recipients for property damage below $5,000. 
On June 3, 1947, former Secretary of the Interior Harold Ickes testified before the House Committee on Public Lands relative to the Organic Act, and strongly criticized the Department of the Navy for their `inefficient and even brutal handling of the rehabilitation and compensation and war damage tasks.' Secretary Ickes termed the procedures as shameful results. 
In addition, a committee known as the Hopkins Committee was established by former Secretary of the Navy James Forrestal in 1947 to assess the Navy's administration of Guam and American Samoa. An analysis of the Navy's administration of the reparation and rehabilitation programs was provided to Secretary Forrestal in a March 25, 1947 letter from the Hopkins Committee. The letter indicated that the Department's confusing policy decisions greatly contributed to the programs' deficiencies and called upon the Congress to pass legislation to correct its mistakes and provide reparations to the people of Guam. 
In 1948, the United States Congress enacted the War Claims Act of 1948 (Public Law 80-896), which provided reparation relief to American prisoners of war, internees, religious organizations, and employees of defense contractors. The residents of Guam were deemed ineligible to receive reparations under this Act because they were American nationals and not American citizens. In 1950, the United States Congress enacted the Guam Organic Act (81-630), granting Guamanians American citizenship and a measure of self-government. 
The Congress, in 1962, amended the War Claims Act to provide for claimants who were nationals at the time of the war and who became citizens. Again, the residents of Guam were specifically excluded. The Congress believed that the residents of Guam were provided for under the Guam Meritorious Claims Act. At that time, there was no one to defend Guam, as they had no representation in Congress. The Congress also enacted the Micronesian Claims Act for the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands, but again excluded Guam in the settlement. 
In 1988, the now inactive Guam War Reparations Commission documented 3,365 unresolved claims. There are potentially 5,000 additional unresolved claims. In 1946, the United States provided over $390 million in reparations to the Philippines, and over $10 million to the Micronesian Islands in 1971 for atrocities inflicted by Japan. In addition, the 
United States provided over $2 billion in postwar aid to Japan from 1946 to 1951. Further, the United States government liquidated over $84 million in Japanese assets in the United States during the war for the specific purpose of compensating claims of its citizens and nationals. The United States did not invoke its authority to seize more assets from Japan under Article 14 of the Treaty of Peace, as other Allied Powers had done. The United States, however, did close the door on the claims of the people of Guam. 
A companion measure to my bill, H.R. 2200, was introduced in the House of Representatives by Representative Robert Underwood. The issue of reparations for Guam is not a new one for the people of Guam and for the United States Congress. It has been consistently raised by the Guamanian government through local enactments of legislative bills and resolutions, and discussed with congressional leaders over the years. 
The Guam War Restitution Act cannot fully compensate or erase the atrocities inflicted upon Guam and its people during the occupation by the Japanese military. However, passage of this Act would recognize our Government's moral obligation to Guam, and bring justice to the people of Guam for the atrocities and suffering they endured during World War II. I urge my colleagues to support this measure.

Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise today to join my distinguished colleague, Senator John McCain, as a co-sponsor of legislation to amend the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act of 1988. 
It is my understanding that this measure is substantially identical in most respects to the bill, S. 487, that was reported by the Committee on Indian Affairs in the last session of the Congress. 
 Mr. President, over the years, in our various capacities as Members, chairman, and vice chairman of the Committee on Indian Affairs, Senator McCain and I have worked together on the complex and challenging issues which have typically loomed large on the horizons of Indian gaming. 
We have learned, from sometimes bitter experience, that in this arena, one most definitely cannot satisfy even some of the people some of the time--but we have continued to explore a range of solutions that might hold the potential for finding acceptance amongst the relevant parties in interest. 
 Mr. President, it is my hope that in the days ahead, the chairman of the Indian Affairs Committee and I will be able to introduce a measure to amend the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act that will build upon this initiative, and the work that the Indian Affairs Committee has been engaged in--over the last 7 months. 
We are in the process of updating some of the provisions of the 1988 act--as well as identifying areas that may require a whole new approach. 
In the interim, of this we can be certain--there will be much discussion and a renewed round of debate on the merits of the measure that is being introduced today--but I commend my colleague for his continuing commitment to Indian country, and his efforts to address some of the more challenging issues of our times.

 Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, it was a sad day in our Nation's history, and more significantly, to its southernmost territory in the South Pacific, the islands of Tutuila and Manu'a known also as American Samoa, when a grand lady, a woman of great courage, a long-time educator, passed away peacefully in Honolulu, HI, on June 13, 1997. She was the late Hon. Seuva'ai Mere Tuiasosopo-Betham, former associate judge of the high court of American Samoa and former director of the American Samoa Department of Education. She was 65 years of age. 
`Mere' as she was popularly known, was born to the late High Chief Orator Mariota Tiumalu Tuiasosopo I of Vatia who was one of the signatories of the Deed of Cession between the islands of Tutuila and Manu'a and the United States of America in 1900. Her mother was the late Venise Pulefa'asisina-Tuiasosopo of the village of Amanave. During the islands' naval administration in 1950, Mere graduated as the only female out of 16 students in the first graduating class of the Amerika Samoa High School. High Chief Orator Tuiasosopo, a staunch educator and an influential person in Mere's life, who firmly believed in the vast opportunities offered by the new mother country, encouraged his daughter to study abroad. She attended Geneva College in Pennsylvania and experienced the lessons of life to persevere and be disciplined while thousands of miles away from her home in the South Pacific. 
After becoming one of the first Samoans ever to successfully complete college in 1954 and earning her teaching credentials, Mere returned to Samoa upon her parents wishes and delved into education, becoming one of the first teachers in the American Samoan educational system. Over four decades, Mere dedicated her life to the teaching of Samoan students. She began as a classroom teacher, then an adviser, a vice principal, a principal, and eventually rose to the prestigious position of assistant director of the Department of Education at a time when very few Samoans held administrative positions in government and the territory's chief executive was still appointed by the Secretary of Interior. In 1978, when American Samoa elected its first Samoan Governor, Mere was appointed as the first Samoan female to hold a cabinet office serving as director of the Education Department. 
Since the inception of formal education in American Samoa, Mere's name has been synonymous with its development. She 
initiated the local capacity building concept that involved efforts for staff development and the bilingual/bicultural education which consolidated the best in both Samoan and Western curricula. Her local capacity building grew out of the need to upgrade the total teaching force in American Samoa which was nearly 90 percent Samoan. She once said, that, 
. . . for every child to be able to learn well, he must be taught well . . . our people are our greatest and only valuable natural resource, it is imperative that we invest heavily in their development at all levels. In doing so, we invest in our country's future stability, growth, health and security. 
Inherent in Mere's insistence on local capacity building was her conviction that the only way citizens in a developing country like Samoa can ensure their survival amidst the influxes of the Western world, was to remain the masters of their land and development, and continue to reaffirm confidence in their ability to determine their own destiny. It is also the mechanism, she believed, the Samoan culture and American democracy could merge enabling Samoans to continue to live in peace and harmony. 
Mere's conceptualization, development, and materialization of the bilingual/bicultural educational system of American Samoa was an innovative approach to reconcile the fervent desire of Samoans to maintain their identity as a cultural entity while educating their people to meet the demands of the Western world. She held this notion for nearly 40 years and firmly ingrained it in all of her students, many of whom attest to the immense influence this great Samoan lady has had in their lives. 
Mrs. Betham received numerous awards as a leading educator in the Pacific. She received the Samoan Educator of the Year award presented to her by former U.S. Secretary of Education, Dr. Terrell H. Bell. He thanked her for her efforts to improve educational opportunities in the Pacific Basin saying, `Progress in education (reform) depends most of all on the activities of leaders in each of our states and territories, and your example to the people of American Samoa has been bright * * *' 
In 1991, Mere was appointed to the all-male high court of American Samoa which included seven Samoan associate judges who dealt mainly with land and `matai' [chieftain] title laws. Her wisdom and knowledge of the `fa'a-Samoa' [Samoan culture] was fiercely sought by many of the territory's leaders to help preserve the integrity and uniqueness of their Samoan heritage at the same time dispensing American justice. As part of the criteria of being an associate judge, Mere was initiated into her village's `Nu'u o Ali'i,' the council of chiefs, traditionally all-male in most Samoan villages. She was bestowed the Talking Chief title `Seuva'ai,' descriptive of one surging forward with determination but cognizant of her native surroundings and what the benefits will be to everyone. 
Mere epitomized the true legacy of an educator, who throughout her lifetime set precedents for Samoan people and especially for Pacific island women, teaching by example. As her island home developed under the guidance of the United States of America for almost a century now, she never forgot her role as an educated Samoan to maintain her indigenous culture. 
Judge Betham is survived by her husband of over 40 years, James `Rusty' M. Betham, five of her six children, five grandchildren, her 83-year-old mother-in-law, a number of brothers and sisters, and a large extended family in her native Samoa and the world over. She will be missed by all those who knew and loved her.

Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, 40 years ago the United States shipping interests controlled the Mediterranean. Most of the cruise ships in the Mediterranean, if I may remind my colleagues, were made in the United States. They had crews of American sailors, and we carried passengers not only from the United States but all over the world. 
At the same time, we also dominated and controlled the cruise ship industry in the Caribbean. The same is true in the Pacific. For that matter, 40 years ago the United States shipping interests sailed the seven seas and controlled the seven seas. 
Today, we have one company that has one cruise ship. No shipyard has ever made a cruise ship since 1956. That is 40 years. For 40 years, our shipyards have not built a cruise ship. Today, we have one, an old ship. 
And what is the situation? The fastest growing part of the tourist industry of the world is cruise ships. We see that on television every night, every 30 minutes on just about every channel--love boats, holiday boats, and most of the passengers are American. These cruise ships are built in foreign shipyards, and they are manned by foreign sailors. 
It may interest you to know that just last week the Wall Street Journal reported that cruise ship workers on foreign flag vessels work between 16 to 18 hours a day and get paid by the cruise lines about $1.50 a day before tips--$1.50 a day before tips. That is their take-home pay because the cruise ship owner says, well, he has a free bunk; we give him three meals a day. This is gravy for him, $1.50 a day. 
That is why we cannot compete with them. We insist that all of our ships maintain the highest health standards. Wage and hour provisions that apply here in the Nation's Capital will apply on cruise ships manned by Americans. The cruise ships operating in the Hawaiian waters today pay not minimum wage but union declared wages. They are much, much higher than union wage, and they get paid more than $1.50 an hour. 
Many of us felt that the time had come to stop this, to reinvigorate the industry, and we came up with this plan. This plan reminds us of what happened to the United States in World War II--for that matter in World War I--the Korean conflict, and even in Vietnam. Since we do not have a fleet of troop carriers, we have always had to call upon private shipowners to come forth with their passenger vessels, convert them into troop carriers, and sail the seven seas. 
Mr. President, as a young man of 18, I crossed the Pacific on a luxury cruise ship which was converted into a troop carrier. Going across the Atlantic, I am sorry to say, it was not a cruise ship; it was a tanker, but there were many other cruise ships in operation at that time. 
This program, the Meritech Program, has been authorized. It has been operational. And up until now they have come up with plans on how to bring about the construction by private industry of passenger vessels that can be converted for defense purposes if the need should arise. This provision in this bill is to implement those plans. 
I can assure you, if the Senator from Arizona wishes, we will put in clear language that says this ship will be built with private funds. I can assure one and all that if this will satisfy my friend from Arizona, I would like this language put in the appropriate place: `Provided further, that none of the funds provided in this or any other act may be obligated for the construction of vessels addressed by this section.' 
If it is appropriate, I ask that this provision be made part of the bill before us.

I know, for example, that the bases in Bermuda very effectively contributed to United States. national security during World War II and throughout the cold war. I am also aware that with changed world circumstances, it became clear during the 1990's, that it was no longer necessary for the U.S. military to continue to maintain bases there. And, on September 1, 1995, U.S. military forces formally withdrew from the island. 
Certainly it seems very logicial for the Secretary of Defense to be asked to look into matters related to our presence there.

Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, may I first thank my distinguished friend from Alaska for his very generous remarks. 
Mr. President, I rise this day to offer my complete support for the fiscal year 1998 DOD appropriations bill. As noted by the chairman of this committee, this bill is well within the budget agreement. It is about $1.2 billion below the amount authorized last week by the Senate for these programs. I should point out to all of my colleagues that the chairman and I are hopeful we will not have to reconsider items that were debated and voted upon last week. 
Let me assure my colleagues that we intend to modify this bill to conform to many of the changes that were approved by the Senate last week. We look forward to working with Members and their staffs over the next 24 hours to ensure that their views are heard. 
Mr. President, I am pleased to report to my colleagues that this is a good bill. It is a product of a truly bipartisan process. As the chairman pointed out, this bill received unanimous support from members of the Appropriations Committee. For those of us who have had the privilege and great honor of serving in this body for many years, you will know that it is almost impossible to get unanimous support from the members of the Appropriations Committee. 
Therefore, I wish to commend Chairman Stevens and his capable staff in putting this bill together. It is a tough bill, but, Mr. President, it is a fair bill. It protects both the interests of the Nation and those of the individual Members of this body. 
It is very clear that the top priority of this bill is supporting our troops, the men and women who are willing to stand in harm's way to safeguard the Nation. Our chairman, Chairman Stevens, has pointed out in great detail the items that are found in this measure, and included in these items we find the procurement of many necessary weapons systems. Each of these recommendations, I believe, will help improve the capability of the Defense Department to protect and defend our Nation, and, most importantly, it will help to deter aggression against the United States and its interests. 
Many of my colleagues have commented, why are we spending all this money? Mr. President, one may think that we are in the business of making war. But essentially and fundamentally, we are in the business of preventing war, and we have learned from 
experience, bloody experience, that the most effective way to prevent war is to be prepared for war, and to be prepared for war, we taxpayers will be called upon to spend some money. If given a choice of our citizens dying on the field or spending more money so that this can be prevented, I am certain all of us would go for the latter. 
This bill also provides for programs which may not be directly defense in nature, but I think it somehow gives a fuller picture of the Congress of the United States. We have in this measure $175 million for breast cancer. I am certain most people realize that the women in the military, like women outside the service, may have to face this tragedy with breast cancer. 
Though we are not directly responsible for the Coast Guard, as the chairman pointed out, we have $300 million included in this measure to support the Coast Guard. Mr. President, the Coast Guard is one of the great institutions and services that we do not hear enough about. They are out there 24 hours a day, saving lives. They are out there monitoring the seas in our behalf. But importantly, in times of war and peace, they carry out military missions. They carried out great missions in the gulf war, though you very seldom hear about them. We also have, Mr. President, in this measure, a sum of $48 million to maintain a program that our National Guard has been carrying on for troubled young people. It has been one of the most successful programs we have had in dealing with troubled teenagers. 
We also have added nearly $40 million above the budget request for drug interdiction. We are in the business of using DOD assets for fighting drugs. We have $1.3 billion to restore the environment. The Department of Defense is a responsible citizen, a responsible neighbor. Let it not be forgotten, they, like all of us, are concerned about the environment. 
So, Mr. President, may I once again advise my colleagues that this is a good bill. It is a tough bill, but it is a fair bill. The Defense Appropriations Subcommittee faced several challenges in fashioning this bill, including reducing funding by $1.2 billion below the amounts authorized. We wanted to spend the whole amount authorized, but the committee felt at this time in our history that expenditure was not necessary, and other defense-related needs were a higher priority. As a result, this is a tight bill. However, it satisfies the highest priority needs of the Defense Department while living within the constraints of the subcommittee's present allocation. 
So, Mr. President, I urge all the Members of this Senate to support this measure. Once again, I thank my chairman, the great Senator from Alaska, for his generous words.

Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I believe the measure before us has addressed this problem. The problem in issue is rather painful. On one hand, it is our intention, and the intention of our Department of Defense, to maintain and retain an industrial base. How do we maintain an industrial base if there are too many companies involved in one scope of work, adding to the cost of defense? We have found that by encouraging restructuring, they can bring about a definite reduction in costs--a reduction in costs to the taxpayers, a reduction in costs to the Department. 
Mr. President, there is no question that when we do achieve cost reduction brought about by restructuring, men and women 
will find themselves without employment. And so we are faced with this predicament: Do we subsidize a company by paying large sums of money for services and products, knowing that it can be done less expensively, but since we don't want men and women to lose their jobs, we subsidize their company to maintain an overloaded work force? 
We have decided that it would be in our national interest, in the interest of the Defense Department, and in the interest of the taxpayers that we bring down the cost of Government. We do have other programs--not in the defense bill, but in other accounts--such as labor, health and human services, Medicare, Medicaid, welfare to help, to the extent possible, those who may have become victims of restructuring. But we have, Mr. President--the chairman and I--the responsibility of presenting to the Senate a measure that we are confident would bring about the best service, the best product, at the least cost.

Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, the matter before us goes much deeper than the gallant lady, the U.S.S. Missouri. It involves the process of competition in the U.S. Government. Every day there is some competition. There is a competition between two great manufacturing plants to see whether this plant should build a tank or that plant. There are competitions going on as to what company should build the joint strike fighter or the C-17 or the B-2. Should it be Boeing? Should it be McDonnell Douglas? 
These competitions are part of the life of the U.S. Government. And if we look upon this measure before us as a simple Missouri amendment, then we have not seen the deeper picture; we will be setting a very, very dangerous precedent, Mr. President. 
This competition was won fairly and impartially. If the Congress of the United States is to take a step to overturn this decision, then what will happen to all the other competitions that we have been faced with? Whenever there is a contest on who would build that submarine--should it be Norfolk or should it be Connecticut?--if Connecticut wins, should Norfolk come to the Congress and appeal the case, or vice versa? 
Mr. President, let me just read once again from the letter from the Secretary of the Navy. The Secretary says--and this is from a letter dated June 10; and it is part of the Record at this moment: 
I have reviewed the General Accounting Office report . . . and I find that it contains nothing that would warrant reopening the process. The General Accounting Office stated that the Navy `impartially applied' the donation selection process, and that all applicants received the same information at the same time . . . I remain confident that my selection of Pearl Harbor was in the best interest of the Navy and our Nation, based on the impartial review of the relative merits of the four acceptable applications. . . . The General Accounting Office also noted, however, that none of the applicants requested clarification on any aspect of these two criteria [that the proponents speak of]. 
No one complained about the process when it was ongoing. The complaints come at the end of the process. 
It may interest you, Mr. President, to know that the State of Missouri--and this ship is named after the State of Missouri--by resolution that was passed unanimously by the Missouri Senate, the general assembly, the House of Representatives concurring: 
. . . memorialize the Congress of the United States, the President of the United States, the Chief of Naval Operations, and the Secretary of the Navy to take any appropriate action necessary to permanently locate the U.S.S. Missouri at Pearl Harbor, Honolulu, Hawaii, next to the U.S.S. Arizona Memorial, for the purpose of serving as a Naval Memorial and Museum. . . .

Mr. INOUYE. This letter makes it very clear that: 
[The] USS Missouri belongs in Pearl Harbor, within site of the USS Arizona, where future generations can come and understand America's involvement in World War II, from beginning to end. 
Mr. President, the GAO report has been cited. The GAO report makes it very clear that Pearl Harbor won the competition without question. And, more importantly, Hawaii did not lose the competition even if it is based solely on financial and technical issues. 
Mr. President, I realize that no one relishes the thought of losing. We all want to win. But the human affairs of this Nation would tell us that at times one wins and another loses. And if we are to set a precedent that whenever someone loses that he will come to Congress to appeal his case, the process that we have established for the past decades to determine decisions that are very necessary to our Defense Department, if such be subject to appeal at each turn by the Congress, we will get nowhere. 
I just hope that those of us here will recognize from this report and from all other reports that this competition was won fairly and impartially and that it is in the public interest and the interests of the Navy and our Nation that this ship be based in Pearl Harbor.

Mr. INOUYE. Madam President, the GAO report makes it very clear that the competition was impartial and fair and that, when all the numbers were counted, Pearl Harbor was the winner because, as the Secretary of the Navy has indicated, it will serve our Nation's interests and the interests of the U.S. Navy to have the Missouri memorialized and made into a monument next to the Arizona so that all Americans from this day on will be able to see in one place the beginning and the end of World War II. 
But, more importantly, Madam President, this amendment does not involve just the Missouri. It involves the process of competition. If the Congress is to be called upon at each time whenever someone loses, where do we end? Whenever there is a competition for the building of a submarine, should the losing State come forward to the Congress and ask for reconsideration? If they lose a carrier, should the losing State come here and ask the colleagues here for reconsideration? We have competition going on at every moment of the day. 
Madam President, let us not set a bad precedent. I think the time has come for decision. The merits are clear. The State of Missouri is in favor of their ship being berthed in Hawaii. The American Legion is in favor of that. The Navy League of the Pacific is in favor of that. I think the Nation would prefer to have the U.S.S. Missouri have its final resting place in Pearl Harbor where it belongs. 
Thank you, very much.

Mr. INOUYE. Madam President, briefly, it displeases me to be standing here speaking in opposition to my distinguished friend from Washington. But I think it should be remembered by all of us that under current law, the law that is in place, the Secretary of the Navy is authorized to donate any stricken vessel to any organization which can demonstrate its financial means to support it. 
The Navy is not required to hold a competition nor is it required to select a winning proposal. However, as my friend from Washington noted, when it became apparent that there were several cities vying for the Missouri, such as San Francisco, Bremerton, and Pearl Harbor, the Secretary determined that he would very carefully examine how he would dispose of the ship. 
In a lengthy competition, the Navy kept all participants equally informed. Nowhere in the GAO report does it say that any city got favorable treatment. They were equally informed of how it would judge the applicants. 
It determined that in the unique situation at hand it should ensure that this historic ship should be located where it would best serve the Navy and the Nation. Those were the two additional criteria. 
I think that even without stating that, that should be the first criteria: How best can the interests of this Nation be served? How will the Navy's interests be served? 
The Secretary issued these new requirements to all of the applicants. According to the GAO, no one received favorable or preferential treatment. The Navy Secretary then had his staff evaluate the criteria. He chose the best proposal as the winning location. Under the current law the Secretary could have selected the losing proposal, but he did not. He chose the winning proposal. And the winner was Pearl Harbor. 
Now, those that lost say that is not fair. If one would objectively look at the GAO report, it does not suggest that it was not fair. All applicants operated under the same rules. We did not know that the Navy would change the interests which best served their interests. 
They argue that the competition should be reopened. What is the basis of this argument? The GAO did not recommend that the competition be reopened, nor did the Secretary recommend that the competition be reopened. Instead, they believe, since none of the parties had enough time to consider how their location was the best location for the ship, that we should go back and redo the competition. 
Madam President, I believe that is completely unfair to the winning team. We have made countless--hundreds--of decisions of this nature. Did we go back to MacDonnell Douglas and say we are going to reopen the competition for the joint strike fighter because they lost to Boeing? No. Did the Navy reopen the competition of the sealift ship contracts when Newport News and Ingalls lost to Avondale? No. 
Madam President, the amendment by the Senator from Washington, I believe, is unfair and it is bad for all of us. Each of us has had constituents which won and also lost competitions. If we are to go back and reconsider awards even when the GAO does not recommend reopening matters, then I believe we will be in very serious trouble. 
I believe that the Pearl Harbor applicants won the contest and competition for one simple reason: The Pearl Harbor applicants did not look upon the Missouri as a mere tourist attraction. We have a very sacred ship in Pearl Harbor at this moment, the Arizona. There are over 1,700 men who are still in the ship. It is a memorial. And it happens that more tourists visit the Arizona than they do the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. But it was not built, Madam President, as a tourist attraction. It was built as a memorial to remind all of us that on this dark morning of December 7, 1941, we were suddenly thrust into a bloody and terrible war. 
The battleship Missouri is a ship upon which the surrender terms were signed by the representatives of the Imperial Government of Japan. The most logical spot for the location is Pearl Harbor. On one hand, you will see the Arizona where the war began, and down Battleship Row you will see the U.S.S. Missouri where the war ended. It would constantly remind us of the many sacrifices that men and women of the United States were called upon to make during that terrible war. 
I have visited Bremerton. It is a nice place. But I am certain that my colleagues realize that Bremerton is also looked upon by Navy personnel, and others, as the graveyard of ships, where dozens upon dozens of destroyers and cruisers are parked and put in cover hoping that someday they can be used. 
The Missouri deserves much more than a graveyard, Madam President. The Missouri should be respected with dignity; it should be revered as a memorial. 
So, Madam President, I hope that my colleagues will follow the suggestions of the GAO. The GAO said it should stand as is. The Secretary of the Navy said his decision stands. Why go through the misery again of spending countless dollars to come up with the same result? 
I thank the Chair.  
Mr. GORTON addressed the Chair.

Mr. INOUYE. Madam President, I suggest that to call upon the Navy as being unfair and not objective is not fair. There is nothing in the record to suggest that they have been less than objective or less than fair. 
I think it should be pointed out that the GAO report stated that no one received preferential treatment, no one received advance notice. It was objective, it was fair to all, and the Secretary of the Navy just recently stated he stands by his decision, and the GAO report itself says the decision should be left where it is. It should not be reopened. 
So I hope my colleagues will defeat this amendment.

Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation, cosponsored by Senators Gorton, Kerry, Murray, and Breaux to promote the use of marine ferry and high-speed marine ferry services. 
The marine ferry system of the United States provides an invaluable component to the transportation requirements of our Nation. As a Senator from an island State, I appreciate the need for passenger/vehicle ferry services. In general, marine ferries require minimal costs as compared to the costs of new infrastructure such as highways, bridges, and tunnels. In addition, marine ferries are one of the most environmentally friendly modes of transportation. 
In coastal urban centers, marine ferry service can provide low-cost, environmentally friendly transportation to areas suffering from congestion. In rural coastal areas, such as barrier islands, marine ferries have been utilized as the sole source of transportation to connect coastal communities to the mainland. While States with marine barriers such as rivers or lakes have utilized marine ferries as low-cost alternatives to highway bridges or additional roadways. Marine ferries have also been used to provide transportation in areas devastated by natural disasters and floods. Ferries were used in the aftermath of the earthquakes in northern California to provide transportation across San Francisco Bay. 
States such as Washington, Alaska, North Carolina, and Delaware have invested, with great success, in State-run marine ferry services. While other States such as New York, New Jersey, and my own State of Hawaii, are exploring incentives to induce private ferry operations in order to fulfill certain transportation objectives. Private ferry operations and high-speed marine passenger vessels used for dinner cruises and tour excursions, have contributed to the tourism potential of certain areas as well. 
I am particularly hopeful that the Marine Ferry and High-Speed Marine Ferry Act will help us to fulfill our Nation's potential for high-speed marine technology. In the early 1970's, Boeing Marine pioneered the development and construction of commercial passenger hydrofoils capable of operating at 45 knots. Boeing built 25 hydrofoils for high-speed use on the Hong Kong-Macau route before licensing production to Kawasaki Heavy Industries of Japan in the early 1980's, and by 1989, only one high-speed marine passenger/vehicle ferry of significant size was in operation. 
The international and domestic high-speed marine passenger vessel market has recently seen a dramatic expansion, and currently over 60 high-speed marine passenger/vehicle ferries are in service or under construction. Fast ferries, until recently, have been primarily used in short sea services on protected routes, but recent advances in design and materials have allowed for the construction of larger vessels capable of being operated on longer open sea routes. New technologies have also opened possibilities for high-speed cargo-carrying operations. 
The United States has benefited from a number of recent high-speed projects, and from the establishment of a shipyard specifically designed for high-speed marine passenger vessel construction. The Maritime Administration's `1996 Outlook for the U.S. Shipbuilding and Repair Industry' indicates: 
New orders for ferries should also continue to provide work for the second-tier shipyards. The enactment of ISTEA continues to provide a significant boost to new ferry projects. In addition, MARAD has a Title XI application pending for the construction of two passenger/vehicle ferries for a foreign owner, valued at more than $171 million. Demand will come from continued promotion of states of ferries for use in their tourist industries, as well as in transportation/commuting, as an alternative to building infrastructure projects such as highways and bridges. The recent award of a $181 million contract to Todd Seattle for three 2,500-passenger ferries and the solicitation for proposals for two additional 350-passenger ferries by the State of Washington, is an added sign that the ferry industry is strong. On the private sector side, there is a demand for the deployment of high-speed, high-tech ferries in the passenger excursion industry. 
The Marine Ferry and High-Speed Marine Ferry Act will build on previous enactments aimed at promoting marine ferry operations. The bill would reauthorize section 1064 of ISTEA, at levels consistent with past years, to allow State-run ferry programs to apply for Federal grants for the construction of ferries, and/or related ferry infrastructure. The bill would also initiate a new program to help provide loan guarantees for private marine ferry operators. A number of States have decided not to operate their own ferry vessels, but instead, have encouraged the private sector to establish marine ferry operations. The provision of loan guarantees to qualified applicants will allow private sector operators to contribute to legitimate public sector transportation needs by providing favorable financing through federally guaranteed loans. 
The bill would also require DOT to report on existing marine ferry operations and to make recommendations on areas that could benefit from future marine ferry operations, and directs DOT to meet with relevant State and local municipal planning agencies to discuss the marine ferry program. The bill also directs the Marine Board to study high-speed marine technologies, and potential utilization of such technology. 
I hope my colleagues can join in to continue our support of marine ferry operations. For a relatively small investment, we can leverage State and private operations to address our pressing infrastructure demands.

 Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise in support of a most important and timely of resolutions proposed by my distinguished colleague, Senator Pete Domenici. Senate Joint Resolution 100, which was introduced on June 17, 1996, goes to the very heart of a matter of utmost concern--the education of American Indian and Alaska Native children and youth. 
In exchange for millions of acres of the vast landscape which ultimately formed the very foundation of our Nation, the United States undertook certain responsibilities to those who were here before us. We entered into over 800 treaties with Indian tribes, many of which contained provisions for the education of Indian children. But as we know, this history is a less than honorable one--not only did we violate provisions in almost every single treaty--but we entered into a dark chapter where education meant the forced removal of Indian children from their families and communities. 
This nearly century-long Federal policy began in 1819 when the Congress enacted a law establishing a civilization fund for the education of Indians. This fund was turned over to religious groups that established mission schools for the education of Indian children. In the late 1840's, the Federal Government and private mission groups combined efforts to launch the first Indian boarding school system, and in 1860, the first nonmission federal boarding school was established. Richard Henry Pratt, the founder of the Carlisle Indian School and considered to be the father of Indian education, believed that in order to transform a people, you must start with their children. This attitude was also expressed by the Federal Superintendent of Indian Schools in 1885 when describing his duty to transform Indian children into members of a new social order. 
By the end of the 19th century, this pattern of forcibly removing Indian children from their homes and families and sending them to faraway boarding schools had become so pervasive that the Congress enacted legislation in 1895 which made it a crime to induce Indian parents by compulsory means to consent to their children's removal from their environment. 
And so, for nearly a century, under the guise of education, the Federal Government sought to cleanse Indian children of their Indianness by separating them from their families and communities for many years, by forbidding them to speak their native language and practice their cultural traditions. The ramifications of such policies are still being felt today, and are still remembered in the minds of once-young children, now in their eighties and nineties. 
While this dark chapter has long since been brought to a close and we have distanced ourselves from such practices, in some respects, I believe we have not come far enough. Indian students today have the highest drop-out rates, the lowest high school completion rate, and the lowest college attendance rates of any minority group. Nearly 38 percent of Indian children above the age of five live in poverty. 
Such statistics are unacceptable. We simply have not done enough, and we, as a collective body, must agree that more should be done and that we must act accordingly. Mr. President, that is precisely what this measure before us does--it declares the sense of the Senate that the Federal commitment for the education of American Indians and Alaska Natives be affirmed through legislative actions of this Congress to bring the quality of Indian education up to parity with the rest of America. 
Mr. President, this is about capacity building, about school repairs so that Indian children can learn in safe environments, and about sufficient funding for the operation of 184 Bureau of Indian Affairs schools. It is about addressing Indian adult literacy needs and special education, disability and vocational education needs. It is about using that same educational system which once sought to strip native people of their Indianness, and using it instead to strengthen Indian people and their communities. 
Mr. President, I am proud to join my esteemed colleague, Senator Domenici, as a cosponsor of this resolution, and I urge each and every Member of this Chamber to do the same.

Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to George Hearn. George Hearn is an old and trusted friend who has rendered distinguished service to our country in peace and war. He has announced that he will soon be trimming his sails, and cutting back on his day to day activities on behalf of U.S. flag international shipping. I hasten to reassure his countless friends and those who rely on his good counsel and advice, George Hearn is not retiring completely from the world of international shipping. 
For over 50 years George has been part of our Nation's maritime effort. He enlisted in the U.S. Navy, and served in the Pacific Theater aboard the U.S.S. Iowa from 1945 to 1946. Honorably discharged from the Navy, George practiced maritime law in New York City. During that time he was also elected to the New York City Council, and served from 1957 until his resignation in 1961. He resigned to join the Kennedy administration in Washington, DC, where he served in a senior staff position at the Civil Aeronautics Board, until President Johnson nominated him to the Federal Maritime Commission in 1964. George was reappointed to the Commission, once by President Johnson, and once by President Nixon. He resigned as Vice-Chairman of the Commission in 1975, to practice maritime law in New York City. In 1982 he joined Waterman Steamship Corp. as the executive vice-president. George will continue to serve Waterman as a consultant. 
Mr. President, that in brief is the distinguished public career of my friend, George Hearn. Proud as he should be of all he has accomplished, I know he is proudest of his family, his wife of 45 years, Anne, and their adult children, Annemarie, Peggy, and George, Jr. 
George is the son of an immigrant Irish father. George has capitalized to the fullest the bounty which our great country has offered to us all. But what makes me proudest to call George my friend, is the way he has used his opportunity to help preserve and increase that bounty for the generations of Americans to come. So, I wish to say well done good friend, and you deserve the chance to take time to smell the roses.

 Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I introduce the PACE Provider Act of 1997 with my distinguished colleague Senator Grassley. 
The Program for All-inclusive Care for the Elderly [PACE] Act of 1997 began in 1983 with the passage of legislation authorizing On Lok, the prototype for the PACE model, as a demonstration program. In 1986 Congress passed legislation to test the replicability of On Lok's success by authorizing Medicare and Medicaid waivers for up to 10 replication sites; and in 1989 the number of authorized sites was increased to 15. The PACE Provider Act of 1997 is the next step in a series of legislative actions taken by Congress to develop PACE as a community-based alternative to nursing home care. 
Currently PACE programs provide services to approximately 3,000 individuals in eight States: California, Colorado, Massachusetts, New York, Oregon, South Carolina, Texas, and Wisconsin. There are also 15 PACE programs in development which are operational, although not involved in Medicare capitation. In addition, a number of other organizations are actively working to develop PACE programs in other States including: Florida, Hawaii, Illinois, New Mexico, Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Washington. 
PACE is unique in a variety of ways. First, PACE programs serve only the very frail--older persons who meet their States' eligibility criteria for nursing home care. This high-cost population is of particular concern to policy makers because of the disproportionate share of resources they use relative to their numbers. 
Second, PACE programs provide a comprehensive package of primary acute and long-term care services. All services, including primary and specialty medical care, adult day care, home care, nursing, social work services, physical and occupational therapies, prescription drugs, hospital and nursing home care are coordinated and administered by PACE program staff. 
Third, PACE programs are cost-effective in that they are reimbursed on a capitated basis, at rates that provide payers savings relative to their expenditures in the traditional Medicare, Medicaid, and private pay systems. Finally, PACE programs are unique in that a mature program assumes total financial risk and responsibility for all acute and long-term care without limitation. 
The PACE Provider Act does not expand eligibility criteria for benefits in any way. Rather, it makes available to individuals already eligible for nursing home care, because of their poor health status, a preferable, and less costly alternative. 
By expanding the availability of community-based long-term care services, On Lok's success of providing high quality care with an emphasis on preventive and supportive services, can be replicated throughout the country. PACE programs have substantially reduced utilization of high-cost inpatient services. Although all PACE enrollees are eligible for nursing home care, just 6 percent of these individuals are permanently institutionalized. The vast majority are able to remain in the community and PACE enrollees are also hospitalized less frequently. Through PACE, dollars that would have been spent on hospital and nursing home services are used to expand the availability of community-based long-term care. 
This bill would expand the number of non-profit entities to become PACE providers to 45 within the first year and allow 20 new such programs each year thereafter. In addition, the PACE Provider Act of 1997 will establish a demonstration project to allow no more than 10 for-profit organizations to establish themselves as PACE providers. The number of for-profit entities will not be counted against the numerical limitation specified for non-profit organizations. 
Analyses of costs for individuals enrolled in PACE show a 5- to 15-percent reduction in Medicare and Medicaid spending relative to a comparably frail population in the traditional Medicare and Medicaid systems. 
States have voluntarily joined together with community organizations to develop PACE programs out of their commitment to developing viable alternatives to institutionalization. This legislation provides States with the option of pursuing PACE development; and, as under present law, State participation would remain voluntary. 
As our population ages, we must continue to place a high priority on long-term care services. Giving our seniors alternatives to nursing home care and expanding the choices available, is not only cost-effective, but will also improve the quality of life for older Americans.

 Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I join today with my friend and colleague from Hawaii, Senator Akaka, to congratulate Ambassador Charlene Barshefsky and her staff at the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative on their outstanding work to date in the World Trade Organization [WTO] action involving the European Union [EU] banana policy. On March 18, 1997, a neutral WTO panel charged with reviewing the banana case issued a detailed interim report finding the EU regime to be in violation of over 20 WTO principles. This represents more violations in a single case than has ever before been found in the history of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and WTO dispute settlement. 
Although narrow in scope, the one implication I am obliged to mention first relates to U.S. banana production. Hawaii has produced bananas commercially for almost 160 years. Bananas are Hawaii's seventh leading agricultural crop by value and show considerable promise for expansion and export. This growth potential is extremely important as Hawaii makes a critical transition from a large plantation style agricultural base in sugar and pineapple to a diversified crop base featuring a very wide range of tropical and subtropical products. While Hawaii is a small producer of bananas by global standards, the distortions to global banana trade caused by the EU banana import regime have taken a decisive toll on Hawaiian producers in the form of depressed producer prices. If the EU's panel report is adopted as expected, it will have a leveling effect on the prices received by Hawaii banana growers.

Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, at the request of President Clinton, I rise to introduce legislation which directs the Secretary of the Interior to plan for the design and construction of a permanent addition to the Franklin Delano Roosevelt [FDR] Memorial. 
The FDR Memorial Commission was organized in 1955 for the purpose of considering and formulating plans for the design, construction, and location of a permanent memorial to President Roosevelt. I have had the distinct pleasure of serving on the Commission for 27 years along with our former colleague, Senator Mark O. Hatfield. 
The FDR Memorial will be dedicated on Friday, May 2, 1997. This memorial represents a plan and design that has undergone extensive review and study by the Commission of Fine Arts, the National Park Service, the Department of the Interior, and the Congress. After 23 years, and three design competitions, one of which bestowed a $50,000 award, the final design for the memorial was approved in 1978. 
Approximately 2 years ago, after all design plans were approved, all funding appropriated by the Congress, and the construction of the memorial was well underway, the disabled community made a demand that the Commission add another statue of FDR in a wheelchair. In the early days, the children of Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt made it clear they wanted no statue showing President Roosevelt in a wheelchair. I might add that during the approval process no member of the disabled community came forth to request the Commission amend the design plans for the memorial. 
However, in an effort to be sensitive to their concerns yet historically accurate, the Commission agreed to display an exact replica of one of President Roosevelt's wheelchairs in the entry building of the memorial. It was determined that existing wheelchairs are too fragile to be loaned to the memorial. Consequently, Senator Hatfield and I instructed the National Park Service to prepare for display an exact replica of one of President Roosevelt's wheelchairs. A cabinetmaker is building the chair and other wooden parts, a wheelmaker is producing 18-inch rims and tires and a metalsmith is assembling the completed chair. 
In addition, in the memorial's entry building there will be a display of mounted photographs of President Roosevelt, including one of the two known photographs of him in a wheelchair. The photograph to be displayed will be 12 inches tall and 9 inches wide. Also included in the memorial is a time line of the major events of FDR's life, carved in granite, which states: `1921 stricken with poliomyelitis--he never again walked unaided.' 
The Commission tried its best to ensure that the initial wishes of the Roosevelt family were carried out, along with the design plans approved by the Commission of Fine Arts. The Commission has also tried to be sensitive to the concerns of those citizens having to spend their lives in a wheelchair. It is true that the depiction of President Roosevelt in a wheelchair will inspire the tragically afflicted. It may very well be a more honest way to depict President Roosevelt. 
Accordingly, at President Clinton's request, I am pleased to introduce this legislation which directs the Secretary of the Interior to plan for the design and construction of a permanent addition to the FDR Memorial, and I thank my colleagues for their support and in the Senate acting expeditiously.

 Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, there have been many supportive comments on the remarks I presented last week on the need to acquire nine additional B-2 global precision strike aircraft. There is one response, in particular, which I wish to share with my colleagues. 
Former Senator Sam Nunn of Georgia served the Senate for many years. Through dedicated work and thoughtful analysis, Senator Nunn came to be regarded as a national authority on defense issues. I now ask that a letter in support of additional B-2 procurement, which Senator Nunn sent to Congressman Duncan Hunter, chairman of the House Committee on National Security, Subcommittee on Military Procurement, be printed in today's Record. I believe that all Senators will benefit from a close and thoughtful reading of former Senator Nunn's letter.

Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise to introduce legislation which amends title 38, United States Code, to restore full veterans' benefits, by reason of service to certain organized military forces of the Philippine Commonwealth Army and the Philippine Scouts. 
On July 26, 1942, President Roosevelt issued a military order that called members of the Philippine Commonwealth Army into the service of the U.S. Forces of the Far East. Under the command of Gen. Douglas MacArthur, our Filipino allies joined American soldiers in fighting some of the most fiercest battles of World War II. 
From the onset of the war through February 18, 1946, Filipinos who were called into service under President Roosevelt's order were entitled to full veterans' benefits by reason of their active service in our Armed Forces. Unfortunately, on February 18, 1946, the Congress enacted the Rescission Act of 1946 (now codified as section 107, title 38, United States Code), which states that service performed by these Filipino veterans is not deemed as active service for purposes of any law of the United States conferring rights, privileges, or benefits. On May 27, 1946, the Congress extended the limitation on benefits to the new Philippine Scouts units. 
Interestingly enough, section 107 denied Filipino veterans access to health care, particularly for nonservice connected disability, and denied them other benefits such as pensions and home loan guarantees. Additionally, section 107 limited the benefits received for service-connected disabilities and death compensation to 50 percent of what was received by their American counterparts. 
As a result, Filipino veterans sued to obtain relief from this discriminatory treatment. The U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, on May 12, 1989, in Quiban versus U.S. Veterans Administration, declared section 107 unconstitutional. However, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia reversed that ruling and the veterans did not file a petition for certiorari to the U.S. Supreme Court. Thus, the Congress is the only hope for rectifying this injustice. 
For many years, Filipino veterans of World War II have sought to correct this injustice by seeking equal treatment for their valiant military service in our Armed Forces. We must not ignore the recognition they duly deserve as U.S. veterans. Accordingly, I urge my colleagues to support this measure which would restore full veterans' benefits, by reason of service, to our Filipino allies of World War II. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of my bill be placed in the Record.

 Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, today I want to address a very serious issue, which is at the heart of the defense of our Nation's interests. I want to address the need to acquire a meaningful long-range-strike weapons system. I want to address the procurement of nine more B-2 bombers, which are needed to complete a three-squadron fleet that will have the means to deter, the capabilities to defend against, and the power to defeat threats to our national interest. 
I speak today in support of America's most capable long-range-strike aircraft, the B-2 bomber. The B-2 is not just a bomber. When most people think of bombers, they think of World War II airpower films, with scores of bombers flying in tight formation, dropping strings of iron bombs on rail lines and oil refineries. The B-2 is more than a bomber. It is a long-range-strike aircraft, capable of reaching anywhere in the world and releasing highly sophisticated, explosive weapons with uncommon precision on specific targets. Unlike the bombers of old, which often missed their targets by miles, the B-2 strike aircraft can hit as many as 16 separate aim points, with deadly accuracy, in a single pass. 
Mr. President, it defies convention to think of the B-2, with its high sticker cost, as a cost-effective weapon. Only when we stop thinking of the B-2 as a bomber, and instead think of it as a long-range-strike weapons system, do we realize that it is, indeed, the most cost-effective weapons system in our Nation's arsenal which can realistically be used to protect our citizens, our interests, and our allies around the world. It is the only weapons system that combines long-range, large payload, modern precision weapons, and stealth--a revolutionary and powerful combination. 
Since the end of the cold war, we have come to recognize that we no longer live in a bipolar world. Threats to our national security have taken on both familiar and unfamiliar forms: renewed territorial aggression, simmering regional and ethnic conflicts, state-sponsored terrorism, and now, for the first time since the Middle Ages, stateless terrorism. We send our forces abroad to protect air bases and oil fields and our sons and daughters are attacked by religious zealots. We all vividly recall the loss of life at our military barracks in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia. It was attacked, not by the Iraqi forces we seek to deter, but by nameless terrorists from Iran, or from Lebanon, or from internal Saudi opposition groups, or from God knows where. With the B-2, the forward air bases would not be needed; the oil fields could be protected from afar. 
What happened when Saddam Hussein attacked the U.N.-protected Kurdish safe zone in northern Iraq? We attacked Baghdad and southern Iraq. Because the leadership in Jordan, in Saudi Arabia, in Turkey, and in other countries, where we have shorter range aircraft, was concerned with stirring up public opinion, United States forces were denied the freedom to launch counter strikes from air bases on their territory. With the B-2, we could have struck Saddam Hussein's forces in the North, from bases in the United States. 
The Secretary of Defense stated in his annual report for fiscal year 1996: `Because potential regional adversaries may be able to mount military threats against their neighbors with little or no warning, American forces must be postured to project power rapidly to support United States interests and allies.' Clearly, the most appropriate weapon in our arsenal for rapid power projection is the B-2 long-range-strike aircraft. Yet, because of legislation--which has now been repealed--we currently have only two squadrons of B-2's. In order to meet effectively our basic strategic objectives, just nine more B-2's, bringing the total to three squadrons, are essential. Mr. President, we must restart this program; we must provide funding for the B-2 this year. 
The B-2--a long-range, precision-strike aircraft--is the best, and perhaps only, option available to us to counter emerging threats in our security environment. We are not able to spend as much for defense as we have in the past, causing us to decrease our presence abroad and base more of our forces here at home. This, in turn, limits our forward presence 
and ability to rapidly respond to a crisis elsewhere in the world. In addition, access to foreign bases, closer to theaters of conflict, has become more and more uncertain. And above all, weapons of mass destruction and accurate delivery systems are becoming more prolific, possibly held by rogue states and organized terrorists alike. These chemical, biological, or nuclear weapons could be used with devastation to attack American ground, naval, and air forces based within a theater of conflict. 
How does the B-2 respond to these challenges? The B-2 uses stealth technology, technology more effective than that employed on F-117 fighter bombers in the gulf war. As you recall, these planes were the key to securing the advantage immediately in the air war and remained impossible for the Iraqis to stop. However, the B-2 is a more powerful and flexible weapon, and offers several advantages over the F-117. 
First, it is a long-range system. The B-2 can fly anywhere in the world, from bases in the United States, with only one refueling. These factors also make the B-2 an important tool for deterrence, allowing the President the ability to strike anywhere in the world immediately. Thus, a counterstrike can be launched from the United States, as soon as the threat is apparent, without reliance on foreign bases, or troop buildup. 
Second, the B-2 carries a bigger, more accurate payload than the F-117. The precision bombs carried by the B-2 use GPS-aided targeting systems, and GPS-aided munitions [GATS/GAM], which enables up to 16 independent points to be targeted with extreme accuracy, in 1 pass. This precision is an important counter to the mobile and relocatable nature of many of our new potential enemies, such as scud missiles or terrorist encampments. The local release of a strike allows last minute adjustments to account for local conditions, or target movement. This is not possible with cruise missiles. In addition, delivering a strike via bomber also allows difficult targets, like the dark side of a mountain, or underground bunkers, to be attacked and destroyed. 
One of the most important points to make about the B-2 is that it will reduce the number of American soldiers put in harm's way, and ultimately reduce casualties. Because the President can choose to respond immediately, or preemptively, engagement in a conflict or its escalation, may be avoided. Because the aircraft is launched from outside the theater, all support personnel and equipment are also outside the theater of conflict. Because the B-2 utilizes stealth, the need for escort aircraft, which are also theater-based, is eliminated. I have read several estimates about the value of stealth and precision weapons, and one that sticks in my mind is that one B-2 bomber has the combat power of 75 non-Stealth aircraft. 
This last statistic illustrates another important factor in our consideration to build nine additional B-2's: the program will provide cost savings in the long run. This may be hard to believe, when we are talking about aircraft that cost $850 million each to build, but as I have explained--the B-2 requires less support; is more precise, requiring fewer sorties to accomplish the task; and, may reduce the need for further massive troop and aircraft involvement. Air Force analysis shows that, operating independently, free of the requirement for fighter escorts, electronic jamming aircraft, and tankers, a single B-2 with two crew members can accomplish missions currently requiring 75 tactical aircraft and 147 crew members. The B-2's ability to penetrate air defenses, without the usual armada of support aircraft, means that we can, in some mission areas, replace dozens of aircraft with one bomber, potentially saving billions of dollars over the long run. 
Mr. President, the American bomber force currently relies most heavily on two aging conventional bomber aircraft--the B-52 and the B-1. In order to maintain mission safety while attacking specific, above ground targets, these bombers must use cruise missiles. These missiles are more expensive--the 44 cruise missiles fired against Iraq during the gulf war cost more than $100 million--over 100 times more expensive than what an equivalent number of precision, direct-attack weapons, delivered by the B-2, would cost. Moreover, these missiles are 
less effective--current-generation cruise missiles cannot be used against mobile or heavily hardened targets. The B-2 long-range-strike aircraft is cost effective. 
Mr. President, the last B-52 was built 35 years ago. It has been a very successful aircraft, but it will not last forever. As we look to the future, with the retirement of B-52's and the withdrawal of the B-1 from active service, the B-2 will be the only long-range aircraft in the Air Force inventory. That is why the B-2 program also represents an important opportunity for the United States to maintain superiority in a critical field of production. This program is the only remaining component of the combat aircraft manufacturing industry in California. By building the remainder of the third squadron, the production lines would stay open another 10 years. Not only would this sustain American know-how in this important industry, but would also save tens of thousands of jobs within aerospace and related industries. When we buy the B-2 we are not only buying the best long-range-strike aircraft in the world, we are also investing in the industrial capacity to produce them. We preserve the industrial base, while preserving the ability to project power anywhere in the world to protect American interests. 
Another important cost factor to consider is what we have already invested in this revolutionary weapons system. If we do not have the foresight to approve the remaining nine bombers now, the costs to restart this program will be much greater in the future, as the need becomes more critical. Planning ahead will allow us to get more value from the money and effort already committed to this project. 
Mr. President, earlier, I mentioned Saddam Hussein's aggression against the Kurds last fall, as an example of new threats to our national security. This is especially true since administration officials have stated that we should expect to contend with Saddam on a yearly basis from now on. In response to Saddam's movements against the Kurds, on September 3, 1996, we attacked targets in the southern regions of Iraq. It would have been more effective to strike the Republican Guard, which was the actual threat to the Kurds in the north, or the hardened command and control centers of the Iraqi leadership in Baghdad. However, our insufficient response to Saddam's assault resulted from a lack of options available to us. 
Because Saudi Arabia, Jordan, and Turkey each indicated that they would not permit American aircraft from launching air strikes from bases in their countries, we were forced to use other options not dependent on foreign governments: carrier airpower, bombers, and cruise missiles. The inherent limitations of each of these options imposed constraints on where and what we could attack--the northern targets were out of range of carrier-launched missions and, because the targets were mobile, cruise missiles could not be used. The most important targets in Baghdad were too heavily protected for conventional, non-Stealth aircraft delivering cruise missiles that, in any event, could not penetrate underground bunkers. Thus, we had to choose targets that were easier to attack: fixed targets, which were above ground and not hardened and, therefore, vulnerable to cruise missile attacks within range of carrier-based aircraft in the southern no-fly zone. 
In order to more effectively attack Saddam and punish his aggressive actions, we would have had to use a stealth weapon to elude detection by Iraqi air defense; a long-range weapon, not based in a foreign country; and a precise weapon to strike the mobile and hardened targets presented in Iraq. Our B-2 is this weapon. It is the only tool in our arsenal that allows us to respond to the new threats we face in an unequivocal and decisive fashion. 
What about those who say we don't need any more B-2 bombers? The issue of our bomber capacity was addressed in the Department of Defense Heavy Bomber Force Study. This study concluded that our current force would be sufficient through sometime around 2015. I was very disappointed with the conclusions of this study, not only because I believe the 
study was fundamentally flawed and based on unrealistic assumptions, but also because I believe the B-2 is the most vital weapon of our future. 
The study utilizes a scenario of two regional conflicts, but assumes that our enemies would be incredibly considerate of our needs. It was assumed that we would have a 14-day advanced warning of an enemy attack, allowing time to deploy our forces; that the two regional conflicts would not be simultaneous, so our bombers could be used in both conflicts; and that no weapons of mass destruction would be used to poison the ground and air in the area where we would intend to deploy our troops. These were the assumptions. 
I ask my colleagues, with the furor aroused in the American populace by the gulf war syndrome and the conflicting stories which have emerged from the Pentagon, is there anyone who still believes that we would deploy forces into an area where we suspect the enemy has released chemical or biological weapons? What is to prevent an enemy from discharging chemical or biological agents in an area prior to the initiation of open hostilities? Would our troops be able to deploy into the theater of conflict without interference? Could they set up and operate air bases and troop reception centers while under the threat of chemical or biological weapons? I am confident that the answers point to the urgent need for long-range-strike aircraft and support the acquisition of nine more B-2 aircraft. 
The heavy bomber study also made some broad assumptions about other factors that may or may not be in our control. The study assumes that we will be able to move our troops and equipment faster than we ever have before; that all of our allies will be on board and welcome foreign troops into their bases and ports; that our forward locations will also be conveniently located near the regional conflicts; and that our current equipment, including bombers built in the 1950's and 1960's, will be available and fully functional. Altogether, these are awfully big leaps of faith to make about uncertain enemies and unlikely conditions in the future. 
If any one of the unrealistic assumptions does not hold true, the B-2 becomes our primary weapon and our only practical option. It is the only system that is not vulnerable to surprise attack. It is the only system that is independent of support aircraft based in the theater of conflict. It is the only system that is capable of operating beyond the range of weapons of mass destruction. 
Mr. President, we have also learned that our allies do not always cooperate readily with our requests to use bases in their countries, or fly through their airspace, when answering aggression--again, examples are the United States raid on Libya in 1986 in response to terrorist bombings and the attack on Iraq last year when organized Iraqi forces attacked Kurds in northern Iraq. To give the President the best option to protect American interests and citizens, while reducing to a minimum the risk to American soldiers, we need to have the most effective tool available--an independent, global, precision strike system. We need to give him this option and take advantage of the most advanced technology available; we must approve funding in order to complete the third squadron of B-2's. 
Mr. President, I am no military expert. But those whom I know and trust, men such as retired Air Force General Charles Horner, who ran the air campaign in the gulf war, have determined that three squadrons of B-2's represent the minimum operational capacity required to meet our basic military objectives. In order to halt an invasion from bases at home, and to conduct a strategic air campaign, like that of the gulf war, from bases at home, the Air Force needs three squadrons of B-2's. These three squadrons are also critical to neutralizing weapons of mass destruction and theater ballistic missiles; establishing air superiority and attacking enemy airfields; and suppressing enemy air defenses; all of which then enable the deployment of forces to the theater when necessary.  
Mr. President, history shows us that surprise attacks, both strategic and terrorist, do happen and are very effective--Pearl Harbor and Korea, as well as the attack on the Marine barracks in Beirut, and on our installation in Dhahran--are poignant examples of our past failures. We dare not fail again. We need to plan for surprise--to equip our military forces with the ability to blunt or defeat an attack anywhere, at any time, and with weapons that we will actually use and which others believe we will actually use. That means conventional explosives delivered with great accuracy and with immediacy and with little risk of U.S. casualties. That means the B-2 long-range-strike aircraft. 
Mr. President, with the B-2, our ability to respond effectively to diffuse global threats, through the projection of American power, is secure; without it, our foreign policy is one of dependence on others, our interests are hostage to public opinion in foreign countries, and our soldiers, whom we send to defend our interests abroad, are needlessly imperiled. 
Mr. President, I call upon my colleagues to support the acquisition of nine more B-2 aircraft, to establish the minimal, militarily effective force of three squadrons.

 Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, today, it is with great pleasure and appreciation, mixed with a certain measure of sadness, that I rise to recognize and pay tribute to Mr. James D. Bond on the occasion of his retirement from a long and distinguished career on the staff of the Senate Committee on Appropriations. 
For the past 20 years, Mr. Bond has served the Senate on the staff of the Subcommittee on Foreign Operations, Export Financing, and Related Agencies as either the clerk or the minority staff director. Throughout this time, his expertise and leadership have proven invaluable to the committee's work on appropriations and oversight of the economic and military assistance programs of the United States. Senators on both sides of the aisle are indebted to him for his sage advice, honest counsel, and tireless effort. His contributions to legislation on American foreign policy have been numerous, including his original drafts of laws ranging from Israeli loan guarantees to the creation of the Development Fund for Africa. On foreign operations matters, Jim Bond has been the key liaison with Members of the House of Representatives; officials within the Department of State, the Agency for International Development, the Export-Import Bank, the Overseas Private Investment Corporation, the Trade and Development Agency, and other agencies of the U.S. Government; as well as international organizations, including multilateral development banks and U.N. agencies; and public interest groups. Mr. President, the breadth of his grasp and the depth of his understanding of the process and the issues is unparalleled; he will be sorely missed. 
Prior to his service with the Subcommittee on Foreign Operations, Mr. Bond worked as the minority staff director for the Subcommittee on HUD and Space Science, Subcommittee on Agriculture, Subcommittee on Public Works, and the Subcommittee on the Interior. He also served on the staff of our former colleague, Milton Young, as a legislative assistant. After 25 years of work in the Senate, I know that he is highly respected by staff and Senators alike. I and many of my colleagues are proud to call him our friend. Mr. President, a man who is called friend by Pat Leahy and Jake Garn, by Mitch McConnell and Mac Mathias, by Ted Stevens and Howard Metzenbaum--such a man is remarkable indeed. 
Mr. Bond's public service is not limited to his work with the Senate. For several years, he has been an adjunct professor at Georgetown University, teaching a course on the appropriations process in the Graduate Public Policy Program, as well as lecturing at Marquette University's Les Aspin center and the American University's Washington Semester. Through his teaching, Mr. Bond shares his knowledge and experience with America's future leaders. 
Jim Bond began his service to our country during the Vietnam war, when he served in the infantry with the 101st Airborne Division, 327th Infantry Battalion. For his service and heroism, he was awarded the Bronze Star and Combat Infantryman's Badge. 
Mr. President, Jim Bond has served this institution with honor and conviction. He has served the citizens for whom we all work in an exemplary fashion. Our work has been enhanced by his contributions. I am confident that Mr. Bond will continue his commitment to American government and will utilize his knowledge and experience toward the betterment of our foreign policy and trade relations. I am sure he will continue his humanitarian work for the poor of the world. I know he will continue his efforts to sustain American prosperity in an era of increased competition. 
Mr. President, I wish Jim Bond well as he leaves the Senate. I know our paths will cross again and I will welcome him. I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring Mr. Bond for his service and congratulating him on his retirement from the staff of the U.S. Senate. 
Aloha Jim.

 Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise today to call the attention of my colleagues to an excellent article by Warren Dean that appeared in the March 11, 1997 edition of the Journal of Commerce, which so eloquently states the reasons why it would be foolish to weaken or repeal the Jones Act. 
I am a longstanding supporter of the Jones Act and of the American-flag Merchant Marine. But it is important for those Members who are less familiar with the Merchant Marine to consider Mr. Dean's article. Mr. Dean is a senior partner in a Washington law firm, and an adjunct professor of transportation law at Georgetown University Law Center. 
In his column, Mr. Dean spells out clearly and succinctly the reasons America stands to lose if foreign-flag ships and foreign crews are allowed to take over our domestic waterborne commerce, and why it would be unfair not only to America's maritime industry but also to our trucking, rail, and pipeline industries as well. If the Jones Act is eliminated, all these industries would have to abide by U.S. laws and regulations, and pay U.S. taxes, while their foreign competitors in our Nation's domestic market would not. Those who claim they want to deregulate domestic shipping and reform the Jones Act would do well to read this article. It explains just how poorly thought out and unfair such actions would be.

Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise today to cosponsor a measure to reauthorize the Native American Programs Act of 1974. The purpose of this bill is to amend the Native American Programs Act to extend the authorization of appropriations for programs administered by the administration for Native Americans within the Department of Health and Human Services to fiscal year 2000. 
In 1974, the Native American Programs Act was enacted by the Congress to assist tribes and other Native American entities with developing social, economic, and governance strategies in order to become viable and economically self-sufficient communities. 
In the decades since its enactment, hundreds of tribes, reservation communities, and native organizations have benefited from the programs funded under this act. In fiscal year 1994 alone, the administration for Native Americans provided 215 grants for governance, social, and economic development projects, several dozen grants to assist with tribal recognition efforts, 26 grants for projects to assist tribes in their capacity to meet environmental requirements, 18 grants to support projects assisting the survival and preservation of Native American languages, and funds to support the Native Hawaiian revolving loan fund. These projects have served to improve the quality of living for thousands of Native American families and communities. 
Over 2 years ago, on March 7, 1995, Senators McCain, Campbell and I introduced S. 510, a bill which reauthorized programs under the Native American Programs Act. On May 11, 1996 this body passed S. 510, as amended in committee, by unanimous consent, but the bill was subsequently not acted upon by the House prior to the adjournment of the 104th Congress. 
The bill being introduced today is substantially similar to S. 510, as introduced in the last Congress. I am pleased that once again, the chairman, as his predecessor did, is willing to consider the inclusion of provisions that would reauthorize for a period of 1 year, the Native Hawaiian revolving loan fund. 
Mr. President, the programs authorized in this measure are critical to fostering Native American social and economic self-sufficiency--a goal shared by this Congress as we move toward greater fiscal responsibility. 
I urge my colleagues to act favorably and expeditiously on this measure.

 Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Susan Nan Hoechstetter, a social worker with whom I have been privileged to work with for many years. Throughout her 13 years of employment with National Association of Social Workers [NASW], Sue Hoechstetter tenaciously promoted the social work profession and advocated for social policy that recognizes the responsible role of government in assisting individuals, families, and communities to work together and address their common needs. 
When Sue first began representing the interests of social workers before the U.S. Congress, very few Federal statutes directly acknowledged the significant role of professional social workers in providing health, mental health, and counseling services. Now, however, through Sue's able leadership, all Federal insurance programs that authorize the provision of mental health care services, including Medicare, the Federal Employee Health Benefits Program, and the Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Uniformed Services, recognize the ability of clinical social workers to independently diagnose and treat mental illness. Additionally, clinical social workers are now identified as health professionals through title VII of the Public Health Service Act, and school social workers are acknowledged as key members of the pupil services team through various educational programs. 
During Sue Hoechstetter's tenure, the National Association of Social Workers also provided leadership in promoting progressive social policy. Family and medical leave, health care reform, improved staffing and training in the child welfare system, and the development of Federal managed care standards are just a few of the proactive policies that NASW advocated under her direction. 
In recent years, Sue and the association have devoted considerable energy in an attempt to preserve the entitlement for children under the Aid to Families with Dependent Children Program, as well as to preserve the financial and program integrity of the Medicaid and Medicare Programs. 
Sue Hoechstetter has never represented a high-powered firm, has never enjoyed the luxury of having a host of assistants to support her work, and has never received great financial reward for her efforts. I suspect that Sue would not recognize an alligator shoe if she saw one. Yet, I believe it is absolutely essential that Sue Hoechstetter and others who share Sue's values continue their work educating the Congress. Our representative form of government requires the active engagement of competing interests in the formulation of Federal policy, and I am very glad that professionals like Sue Hoechstetter promote social policies that support the common good and help people in need participate in the process. 
I am deeply saddened that Sue will no longer be representing the interests of the National Association of Social Workers. Her contribution to the association has been considerable. However, I am very pleased that Sue will continue to pursue her interests in increasing citizen participation in the political process. I wish her the very best.

Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise today to join my esteemed colleague, Senator Pete V. Domenici of New Mexico, as a cosponsor of legislation that he has authored which proposes an increase in the funding for the Indian Reservation Roads Program and which would improve the quality of Indian roads by directly including Indian tribes in Federal transportation service programs. 
Indian reservation roads are the lifeline of tribal economic and social wellbeing, with about 50,000 miles of roads serving Indian tribes and Alaska Native villages nationwide. Over 90 percent of these roads are comprised of State and county roads and roads constructed and maintained by the Bureau of Indian Affairs. 
The Bureau of Indian Affairs' road system includes approximately 21,000 miles of roads which comprise about 42 percent of all roads serving Indian country. The overwhelming majority of these Bureau of Indian Affairs' roads--about 89 percent--are rated as being in poor condition. This is an alarming statistic which this legislation is designed to remedy. 
Historically, funding for the construction and maintenance of Bureau of Indian Affairs' roads has failed to keep pace with tribal transportation needs and the result has been inferior Indian road conditions. In the 1950's, BIA funding reached a high of $10 million per fiscal year. By 1979, funding levels rose to $80 million per year. Thereafter, BIA funding significantly declined. 
The Surface Transportation Assistance Act of 1982 made the Indian Reservation Roads Program eligible for support from the Highway Trust Fund at $100 million for fiscal years 1984 to 1986. Between 1987 and 1991, funding from the Highway Trust Fund decreased to $80 million. In 1992, funding rose to $159 million and from 1993 to 1997, funding for Indian roads increased to $191 million. 
Although funding for Indian reservation road construction and maintenance improved, the increases were nonetheless woefully inadequate to meet tribal construction needs and to improve Indian roads so that they might be able to meet national standards. Furthermore, the current funding level of $191 million falls well short of the estimated national tribal transportation need of $300 million annually. Unless funding is increased, tribal roads will continue to fall behind national standards to the economic and social detriment of Indian tribes. 
The American Indian Transportation Improvement Act of 1997 includes necessary funding increases and significant changes to the Indian Reservation Roads Program and to relevant Federal transportation programs that will provide Indian tribes with greater opportunities to meet their transportation needs. The improvements to Indian transportation include the following: 
One, funding for the Indian Reservation Roads Program would be increased from $191 million annually to $250 million for fiscal year 1998, $275 million for fiscal year 1999, and $300 million for fiscal years 2000 through 2002. Funds are primarily to be used for the design and construction of roads in the BIA system. 
Two, identified as high priority by tribes, the bill includes Indian reservation road maintenance as an eligible activity for funding under the Indian Reservation Roads Program. For BIA roads, Indian Reservation Roads Program funds would be used to supplement the nominal funding provided for road maintenance. 
Three, to encourage donee States to fund public land highway projects that serve Indian country, the bill exempts funds expended on a public land highway constructed on an Indian reservation from the apportionment adjustment hold harmless requirement which has in the past had the effect of decreasing a 
State's surface transportation program allocation by the amount a State expended on a public land highway located on or running through an Indian reservation. 
Four, this bill would establish a 1-percent set-aside of funds allocated for the National Scenic Byway Program for the development of an Indian scenic byway program to enhance access to scenic areas for economic development and other purposes with funding to be distributed through competitive grants. 
Five, currently, tribes qualified to meet the requirements of direct certification in order to operate their own Federal highway programs are not eligible to do so. The bill overcomes this impediment by authorizing the eligibility of Indian tribes for certification by the State or tribal highway department to directly operate Federal highway programs. For example, certified tribal governments will have direct access to Federal highway safety funds and be able to manage the highway safety programs. 
Six, to promote tribal highway enhancement activities on Indian roads, including bus transfer points and highway lighting, the bill authorizes the transfer of 1 percent of the funds available to States for transportation enhancement for competitive grants to Indian tribes. 
Seven, in order to remedy the inefficient distribution of Indian bridge funds, the bill would establish a national Indian bridge program by consolidating the 1 percent of funds the States set aside for Indian bridges. The Secretary of Transportation would distribute the funding with priority given to bridges with the highest level of deficiency as determined by the BIA National Bridge Inspection Standards. This process efficiently allocates Indian bridge funds based on demonstrable need. 
Eight, to enhance the capability of Indian tribes to improve their transportation systems and qualify for direct certification, $1 million per fiscal year is authorized for each of six Indian technical centers where tribal members receive training in areas including highway planning, construction, and maintenance. 
Nine, finally, to address the inability of Indian tribes to apply directly for mass transportation funds and to meet increasing transit needs, the bill provides authority for a 1-percent set-aside of mass transportation funding for tribes with the allocation formula to be established by the Secretary of Transportation following negotiations with the tribes. In addition, the bill authorizes the conversion of up to 3 percent of Indian reservation road funds to provide mass transportation services to Indian tribes. 
The American Indian Transportation Improvement Act of 1997 will significantly improve surface transportation service on or near Indian Reservations--improvements that will provide greater mobility for tribal members, increase economic opportunities for the tribe, including much-needed employment, and improve the overall quality of life. 
Mr. President, I want to recognize the outstanding leadership demonstrated by Senator Pete Domenici in developing this important legislation. I urge my colleagues to join the chairman of the Indian Affairs Committee, the Honorable Senator Ben Nighthorse Campbell, Senator Pete Domenici, and me in acting favorably on this bill when it comes before the Senate for consideration.

 Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Proctor Jones on his retirement from the Senate Appropriations Committee. Proctor Jones, a most distinguished professional staff member, has served the Senate Appropriations Committee honorably since 1971. 
During my many years of interaction with Mr. Jones, I have observed that his attention to detail and superb performance under pressure have earned him the respect and admiration of Senators and Senate staff alike. He distinguished himself rapidly as a professional who possessed an infectious demeanor, tremendous integrity, decisive leadership style, political savvy, and boundless energy. 
Mr. Jones forged strong alliances and affiliations with a myriad of congressional offices, committees, and Federal and civilian agencies to present a cohesive approach in drafting a responsible energy and water appropriations bill each year. 
Mr. Jones has had an opportunity to serve under a number of distinguished Appropriations Committee chairmen: Senators Russell, Ellender, McClellan, Magnuson, Stennis, Byrd, and most recently Hatfield. Mr. Jones served as deputy staff director of the committee under Senators McClellan and Stennis. Since 1973 he has been the Staff Director, Subcommittee on Public Works for Water and Power Development, and Atomic Energy Commission Appropriations, which was renamed the Subcommittee on Energy and Water Development in 1977. 
In addition to handling the annual appropriation bill, he has been in charge of numerous continuing resolutions, supplemental appropriations bills, rescission bills, and other measures relating to the appropriations process. 
I understand Mr. Jones will be working here in Washington, with former Senator J. Bennett Johnston, with whom he has been associated for over 20 years. I know his expertise, professionalism, and dedication will serve him well in his new position. I want to personally and publicly acknowledge my appreciation to Mr. Jones for his exemplary service to this great institution and to bid him a fond aloha and heartfelt mahalo.

Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, the law of the land, specifically section (1) of the Merchant Marine Act of 1936, declares that the United States shall have a merchant marine sufficient, among other things, to: 
Carry a substantial portion of our international waterborne Commerce; and to serve as a fourth arm of defense in time of war and national emergency. 
The importance of these requirements has been dramatically illustrated by the vital role of our merchant marine in World War II, Korea, Vietnam, during operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm, and most recently in Haiti, Somalia, and Bosnia. 
While the privately owned and operated U.S. flag merchant marine has performed so magnificently and effectively in times of crisis, it has also made extraordinary efforts to ensure that a substantial portion of commercial cargo bound to and from the United States moves on U.S. bottoms. Given the chronic overtonnaging in international shipping, cut-throat competition, and the competitive edge our trading partners give their national flags, this has not been easy. In addition to competition with subsidized foreign carriers, U.S.-flag carriers are forced to compete with flag of convenience carriers. Over two-thirds of the international vessels operating in commerce are operating under flags of convenience. Flag of convenience registries include such major maritime powers as Panama, Liberia, the Marshall Islands, and Vanuatu. These registries only require their vessel owners to pay registration fees, and shipowners are not required to pay tax on revenues earned, nor do employees have to pay income tax, and the shipowner has little or no obligation to comply with the nation's law. 
Nevertheless, if our commercial fleet is to continue to be an effective auxiliary in times of war or national emergency, it must first be commercially viable in times of peace. Otherwise, there will be no merchant fleet when the need arises. 
I think we all would agree that there is a substantial national interest in promoting our merchant fleet. I think, also, that we would all agree that U.S. national security and economic security interests should not be held hostage for lack of U.S.-controlled sealift assets. Given the increasing diminution of the flag fleets of our NATO allies it will be more important in the future to sustain a viable U.S.-flag presence. Indeed, several laws of our land recognize that national interest and spell out specifically how the U.S. Government is to go about promoting it. Federal laws require that all U.S. military cargo, cargo purchased with all loan funds and guarantees from the Eximbank, 75 percent of concessionary agricultural, and at least 50 percent of all other international ocean borne cargo generated directly or indirectly by the Federal Government, be carried on U.S. flag vessels. The alarming news is that according to Maritime Administration [MarAd] the total volume of cargo moving under these programs is declining and will continue to do so. 
According to a report by Nathan Associates, Inc., the 1992 economic impact of cargo preference for the United States is 40,000 direct, indirect, and induced jobs, $2.2 billion in direct, indirect, and induced household earnings, $354 million in direct, indirect, and induced Federal personal and business income tax revenues--$1.20 for every dollar of Government outlay on cargo preference, and $1.2 billion in foreign exchange. 
It is, therefore, imperative that U.S. flag vessels carry every ton of cargo which these programs and the law intend them to carry. This brings me to the reason for the resolution I am introducing today. There are two substantial problems which threaten the viability of these programs and, therefore, the viability of our merchant fleet. 
Several agencies administering cargo reservation programs continue to do their almighty best to evade the spirit and letter of the reservation laws, that is, find the law inapplicable to a particular program, or employ other loopholes. 
Because of this problem of evasion and uneven confidence, the Congress amended the Merchant Marine Act of 1970 to centralize monitoring and compliance authority for all cargo reservation programs in MarAd. Nevertheless, the problem remains. Critics of MarAd maintain the agency is too timid, and does not discharge its obligation aggressively. MarAd, on the other hand, says it has limited enforcement powers over those Government agencies which are not in compliance. 
In light of recent proposals to consolidate the Department of Transportation's operating divisions, I believe it is more important than ever for the Congress to reiterate its support for our cargo reservation laws, so that their administration and enforcement will not suffer from any departmental reorganization. 
Mr. President, the resolution I am submitting today merely expresses the sense of the Senate that all of these Federal agencies do what they are supposed to be doing now, under existing law.

 Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize and commemorate, with very deep patriotic pride, the 50th anniversary of the U.S. Pacific Command. 
On January 1, 1947, the U.S. Pacific Command was established to unify with the Alaskan and Far East commands. 
As the largest of nine unified commands within the Department of Defense today, the U.S. Pacific Command interacts daily with foreign military and civilian leaders, serving as a key link for the United States in the most dynamic region of the world--a region that contains 44 countries, two-thirds of the world's population, and 7 of the world's largest armed forces. 
During the past 50 years, the Asia-Pacific theater has grown from a war-torn region recovering from the devastation of World War II to the most dynamic economic region in the world. The importance of the United States' interest in the Asia-Pacific theater is best illustrated by the pivotal role of East Asia's economies in the world's economic order. The Asia-Pacific gross national product surpassed the European Union in 1990, and today, our trans-Pacific trade now exceeds $503 billion per year. 
Fostering peace, providing security, and meeting the challenges within an area totaling more than half of the Earth's surface, the U.S. Pacific Command is represented by more than 300,000 trained and highly dedicated soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines. 
Mr. President, after World War II, our Nation's military leaders recognized the importance of unity of forces worldwide. On December 14, 1946, President Truman approved the first unified command plan, and on January 1, 1947, the U.S. Pacific Command was established. 
During the past 50 years, the U.S. Pacific Command's responsibilities have expanded to include the west coast of the United States, the eastern shores of Africa, all points in Asia, and the Arctic to the Antarctic. 
Mr. President, during the past 50 years, U.S. Pacific Command Forces have been engaged in three major conflicts and numerous military actions. During the Korean conflict, Vietnam conflict, and the Gulf war, the United States Pacific Command Forces have fought bravely. 
The United States Pacific Command provided forces to support the United States, Far East and U.N. Commands during the Korean conflict. These support forces were primarily in the form of naval assets which conducted patrolling missions and aided amphibious operations by providing naval gunfire, sealift and airstrikes from carrier task forces. The naval airstrikes were an integral part of the overall air campaign. 
The United States Pacific Command oversaw our involvement through all phases of the Vietnam conflict--from the build-up and military actions to the withdrawal of United States combat forces. However, Mr. President, as many will sadly agree, memories of the Vietnam conflict were not over for the United States Pacific Command. The command became 
deeply involved in the emotional repatriation of American prisoners of war during Operation Homecoming. Additionally, the United States Pacific Command assisted with the movement of Vietnamese nationals to the United States and the airlift of Vietnamese children during Operation New Life and Operation Babylift, respectively. 
During Desert Shield and Desert Storm, the United States Pacific Command Forces provided vital ground, sea, and air assets in support of U.S. Central Command Operations conducted in Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Iraq, and off-shore in the Arabian Sea. 
The United States Pacific Command deployed forces to Haiti during Operation Uphold Democracy and continues to deploy forces in support of the United States' interests in the European and Middle Eastern theaters. 
Today Mr. President, the U.S. Pacific Command's mission is to foster peace, deter aggression, and rapidly respond to crisis. If necessary, they will fight to maintain security and stability throughout the Asia-Pacific region. 
In order to maintain security in the vast Asia-Pacific region, the U.S. Pacific Command has the U.S. Army Pacific, the Pacific Fleet, the Pacific Air Forces, and the Marine Forces Pacific as its service components. Additionally, its sub-unified command includes United States Forces Korea, United States Forces Japan, the Alaskan Command, and the Special Operations Command, Pacific.

 Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise today to commemorate the retirement of Mr. Clarence Taba of Hawaii after 22 years of service as executive director of the Hawaii Bankers Association. 
During World War II, Mr. Taba was one of the young men who enlisted and became a member of the 442d Regimental Combat Team--an infantry unit composed of Americans of Japanese ancestry. Mr. Taba's courage was prominently displayed during the rescue of the Texas `Lost Battalion'--141st Infantry of the 36th Division--in France, for which he earned a Silver Star and two Bronze Star Medals for leadership and gallantry in combat, and three Distinguished Unit Citations with 5 battle stars, for his participation in pivotal battles in Italy and France. 
As a veteran, Mr. Taba served as the first State commander of the Hawaii Disabled American Veterans. 
Mr. Taba is well known and well respected within Hawaii's financial community. His financial career commenced shortly after the end of World War II, when he organized a Federal credit union for his 442d Regimental Combat Team comrades. Mr. Taba became the first American to qualify as a certified credit union executive, and was also the first American to be awarded the Edward Filene Award for Volunteer Achievement. He also served the Hawaii financial community as the mortgage operations officer for Bank of Hawaii, cashier for City Bank of Honolulu during its organizing years, Senior vice president and operations officer for the State of Hawaii's largest savings and loan at that time, and senior bank examiner for the State of Hawaii. 
Mr. Taba was appointed as the first executive director of the Hawaii Bankers Association in September 1975. Throughout the years, he has diligently worked to bring the local banks together, especially on significant issues such as the recodification of Hawaii banking laws, and the passage of such bills as the Credit Sales Contract Act and the Industrial Loan Act. He also spearheaded the many projects traditionally undertaken by the Hawaii Bankers Association throughout the calendar year, including the annual convention, installation luncheon, and various seminars. The Hawaii congressional delegation is extremely grateful for the assistance and guidance Mr. Taba has provided throughout his tenure at the HBA to ensure that Hawaii's interests were addressed. 
The Hawaii Bankers Association continues to be a key player in the State of Hawaii's economy. Despite stiff competition, the different banks always work together in the spirit of aloha and harmony. Mr. Taba, in his own special way, has ensured all of that. 
I wish to join the banking industry and the people of Hawaii in thanking Clarence Taba for his dedicated efforts over the years on behalf of the State of Hawaii and our Nation, and to wish him a happy and fulfilling retirement.

Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I am reintroducing legislation today that would direct the Secretary of the Army to determine whether certain nationals of the Philippine Islands performed military service on behalf of the United States during World War II. 
Mr. President, our Filipino veterans fought side by side and sacrificed their lives on behalf of the United States. This legislation would confirm the validity of their claims and further allow qualified individuals the opportunity to apply for military and veterans benefits that, I believe, they are entitled to. As this population becomes older, it is important for our nation to extend its firm commitment to the Filipino veterans and their families who participated in making us the great nation that we are today.

Mr. INOUYE. 
Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the native Hawaiian Housing Assistance Act of 1997--a measure which seeks to provide housing assistance to those families most in need, both nationally and in my home state of Hawaii--native Hawaiians. 
Less than 2 years ago, in 1995, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development released a report entitled, `Housing Problems and Needs of Native Hawaiians.' This report found, astoundingly, that native Hawaiians experience the highest percentage of housing problems in the Nation--49 percent--higher than even that of American Indians and Alaska Natives residing on reservation--44 percent--and substantially higher than that of all U.S. households--27 percent. 
These findings, taken in conjunction with those of two other reports: The final report of the National Commission on American Indian, Alaska Native, and native Hawaiian Housing, `Building the Future: a Blueprint for Change' (1992) and the State Department of Hawaiian home lands report, `Department of Hawaiian Homelands Beneficiary Needs Study' (1995), document that: 
Native Hawaiians have the worst housing conditions in the State of Hawaii and are seriously overrepresented in the Stat's homeless population, representing over 30 percent of the homeless population. 
Among the native Hawaiian population, the needs of the native Hawaiians eligible to reside on lands set aside under the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act are the most severe. Ninety-five percent of the current applicants, approximately 13,000 native Hawaiians, are in need of housing, with one half of those applicant households facing overcrowding and one third paying more than 30 percent of their income for shelter; and under the Department of Housing and Urban Development [HUD] guidelines, 70.8 percent of the Department of Hawaiian Home Lands (DHHL) lessees and applicants fall below the HUD median family income, with more than half having incomes below 30 percent. 
Mr. President, I find these statistics deplorable and unconscionable. They are the direct result of a pattern of purposeful neglect on the part of our Federal Government. 
At the time of the arrival of Captain Cook to Hawaii's shores in 1778, there was a thriving community of nearly 1 million indigenous inhabitants. But over time, introduced diseases and the devastating physical, cultural, social, and spiritual effects of Western contact nearly decimated the native Hawaiian population. In 1826, less than 50 years later, the native Hawaiian population had decreased to an estimated 142,650, and by 1919, this number had dropped to 22,600. 
In recognition of this catastrophic decline, and of the role the Federal Government played in facilitating such a decline, the Congress enacted The Hawaiian Homes Commission Act [HHCA], which set aside 200,000 acres of CEDED public lands for homesteading by native Hawaiians. As then Secretary of the Interior Franklin K. Lane was quoted in the committee report to the HHCA as saying: `One thing that impressed me--was the fact that the natives of the islands who are our wards, I should say, and for whom in a sense we are trustees, are falling off rapidly in numbers, and many are in poverty.' Congress thus sought to return the Hawaiian people to the land, thereby revitalizing a dying race. 
And yet, despite what arguably were good intentions, the Congress subsequently and systematically failed to appropriate sufficient funds for the administration of the HHCA. Faced with no means of securing the necessary funding which would enable the development of infrastructure or housing, the administrators were forced to lease large tracts of the homelands to non-Hawaiians for commercial and other purposes in order to generate revenue to administer and operate the program. Hawaiians were thereby denied the benefits of residing on those very lands set aside for their survival as the indigenous inhabitants of Hawaii. 
Over the years, I am sad to report, this Government has taken the anomalous legal position that native Hawaiians residing on these home lands must be excluded from access to existing Federal Housing and Infrastructure Development programs because the expenditure of Federal funds to benefit these lands was somehow deemed unconstitutional. 
While the Clinton administration has reversed this position--arguing before the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals that the home lands were not set aside exclusively for native Hawaiians--there are those who nonetheless seem to want it both ways. They want 
to deny that any Federal responsibility flows from the provisions of a Federal law, and yet they want to bar native people from their rights of access to existing Federal housing programs. 
It is this reverse discrimination that I find repugnant and unacceptable. It is a mentality that enables the Federal Government to set aside lands for native Hawaiians, retain certain powers over the administration of these lands, and then deny those native Hawaiians residing on these lands access to programs made available to all others, including Indians residing on reservations, on the basis that the lands set aside by the United States only benefit native Hawaiians. 
I am happy to report that, with the assistance of outgoing HUD Secretary Cisneros, we have worked to identify and remove some barriers which have prevented native Hawaiians residing on the home lands, from securing access to existing federally-assisted housing programs. For his understanding of and dedication toward these matters, I am most grateful. However, I would be the first to admit that much more remains to be done. 
When the National Commission of American Indian, Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian Housing issued its report, after full consideration of the deplorable housing conditions native Hawaiian families face, they submitted the following recommendation: That Congress enact a `Native Hawaiian Housing and Infrastructure Assistance Program' to alleviate and address the severe housing needs of native Hawaiians by extending to them the same Federal housing assistance available to American Indians and Alaska Natives. 
This, Mr. President, is exactly what this bill is designed to accomplish. It amends the Native American Housing and Self-Determination Act of 1996 by creating a separate title to establish a parallel housing program for native Hawaiians. This program would not benefit all native Hawaiians, but is limited in scope to those most in need because this Government has consistently denied them access to existing housing programs--those native Hawaiians eligible to reside on the home lands. 
This bill would provide funding, in the form of a block grant, to the department of Hawaiian Home Lands, to carry out affordable housing activities which are identical to those activities authorized under the Native American Housing Assistance and Self-Determination Act. The bill provides that, to the extent practicable, the Department shall employ private nonprofit organizations experienced in the planning and development of affordable housing for native Hawaiians. In addition, the bill authorizes the Secretary to adopt modifications which are deemed necessary in order to meet the unique needs of native Hawaiians. 
Finally, an additional section of the bill creates a loan guarantee program similar to that which exists for American Indians. Neither of these programs would tap into existing tribal monies, but instead would authorize a separate funding stream. 
Mr. President, this is a bill whose foundation is a dual one--one based on need, on statistics which show that native Hawaiians face the highest incidence of housing needs in the nation, and that among the native Hawaiian population, those native Hawaiians eligible to reside on the home lands are the most in need, and one based on the special historical relationship between the United States and the native Hawaiian people. 
While history has shown that the Congress has fallen far short of its commitment to provide sufficient funding for the administration of the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act, let history also reflect, that in this, the 105th Congress, we sought to finally, balance the scales, by creating housing opportunities for native Hawaiians similar to those provided to other native Americans.

Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill to amend the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act to clarify certain provisions of that act as they pertain to Indian tribes and native Hawaiian organizations. This bill is similar to the bill I introduced in the last session of the Congress--a bill which passed this body by unanimous consent on September 13, 1996. Unfortunately, the House of Representatives failed to act on the measure prior to the adjournment of the 104th Congress. 
In 1990, the Congress enacted the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act [NAGPRA] to address the growing concern among Indian tribes, Alaska Native villages, and native Hawaiian organizations regarding the proper disposition of thousands of Native American human remains and sacred objects in the possession and control of museums and Federal agencies. 
NAGPRA requires museums and Federal agencies to compile summaries and inventories of human remains, associated and unassociated funerary objects, sacred objects, and cultural patrimony, to notify an Indian tribe or native Hawaiian organization that have an ownership or possessory interest in the remains, objects or patrimony, and, upon request, to repatriate those remains or cultural items to the appropriate Indian tribe or native Hawaiian organization. 
NAGPRA further provides a process governing the treatment of human remains or cultural items inadvertently discovered and intentionally excavated from Federal or tribal lands. 
In the years since the enactment of NAGPRA, native Hawaiians have been at the forefront in the repatriation of ancestral remains and the treatment of ancestral remains inadvertently discovered on Federal lands. 
Hundreds of native Hawaiian kupuna--ancestors--have been returned to Hawaii--released from the confines of more than 25 museums in the Untied States, Canada, Switzerland, and Austrialia--and returned to the land of their birth. 
Despite these accomplishments, native Hawaiian organizations have experienced difficulty in ensuring the implementation of the act--ironically, not abroad, but in Hawaii. 
In written testimony submitted to the Committee on Indian Affairs by Hui Malama I Na Kupuna O Hawaii Nei, a native Hawaiian organization recognized under NAGRPA, for a December 9, 1995 oversight hearing on the act, a number of concerns were raised--concerns which this bill seeks to address, namely: The lack of written consent where native American remains are excavated or removed from Federal lands for purposes of study; following an inadvertent discovery of Native American remains, the lack of assurances that the process for removal complies with the requirements that are associated with an intentional excavation; and the lack of required notification to native Hawaiian organizations when inadvertent discoveries of Native American human remains are made on Federal lands. 
In addition to amendments which address these concerns, this bill also incorporates two technical amendments requested by the administration: a provision expanding the responsibility of the NAGPRA Review Committee to include associated funerary objects in the compilation of an inventory of culturally unidentifiable human remains; and provisions providing the Secretary of The Interior with authority to use fines collected to supplement the cost of enforcement-related activities. 
As one of the original sponsors of the act, it is my view that these amendments are consistent with the original purpose, spirit, and intent of NAGPRA, and are necessary to clarify the existing law. 
It is my expectation that if adopted, these amendments will ensure better cooperation by Federal agencies in the implementation of the act in the State of Hawaii and the rest of the United States. For while these amendments address concerns raised by the native Hawaiian people, they will also serve to benefit Indian country. 
The responsibility borne by those who choose, or who are called upon to care for the remains of their ancestors is a heavy one. By acting favorably on this measure, I hope that we can assist these individuals and organizations as they continue in their efforts to bring their ancestors home and provide them with proper treatment when they are disturbed from sacred burial sites. 
Mr. President, I thank you for this time today, and I urge my colleagues to support this bill when it comes before the Senate for consideration.

Mr. INOUYE. 
Mr. President, today, I rise to introduce legislation which amends Public Law 97-359, the Amerasian Immigration Act, to include Amerasian children from the Philippines and Japan as eligible applicants. This legislation also expands the eligibility period for the Philippines to November 24, 1992, the date of the last United States military base closure and the date of enactment of the proposed legislation for Japan. 
Under the Amerasian Immigration Act (Public Law 97-359) children born in Korea, Laos, Kampuchea, Thailand, and Vietnam after December 31, 1950, and before October 22, 1982, who were fathered by United States citizens, are allowed to immigrate to the United States. The initial legislation introduced in the 97th Congress included Amerasians born in the Philippines and Japan with no time limits concerning their births. The final version as enacted by the Congress included only those areas where the U.S. had engaged in active military combat from the Korea War onward. Consequently, Amerasians from the Philippines and Japan were excluded from eligibility. 
Although the Philippines and Japan were not considered war zones from 1950 to 1982, the extent and nature of U.S. military involvement in both countries are not dissimilar to U.S. military involvement in other Asian countries during the Korean and Vietnam conflicts. The role of the Philippines and Japan as vital supply and stationing bases brought tens of thousands of U.S. military personnel to these countries. As a result, interracial relations in both countries were common, leading to a significant number of Amerasian children being fathered by U.S. citizens. There are now over 50,000 Amerasian children in the Philippines. According to the Embassy of Japan, there are 6,000 Amerasian children in Japan born between 1987 and 1992. 
Public Law 97-359 was passed in the hope of redressing the situation of Amerasian children in Korea, Laos, Kampuchea, Thailand, and Vietnam who, due to their illegitimate or mixed ethnic make-up, their lack of a father or stable mother figure, or impoverished state, have little hope of escaping their plight. It became the ethical and social obligation of the United States to care for these children. 
The stigmatization and ostracism felt by Amerasian children in those countries covered by the Amerasian Immigration Act also is felt by Amerasian children in the Philippines and Japan. These children of American citizens deserve the same viable opportunities of employment, education, and family life that is afforded their counterparts from Korea, Laos, Kampuchea, Thailand, and Vietnam.

Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I am introducing legislation today to amend Title VII of the Public Health Service Act to establish a psychology post-doctoral program. 
Psychologists have made a unique contribution in serving the Nation's medically undeserved populations. Expertise in behavorial science is useful in addressing many of our most distressing concerns such as violence, addiction, mental illness, children's behavior disorders, and family disruption. Establishment of a psychology post-doctoral program could be most effective in finding solutions to these pressing societal issues. 
Similar programs supporting additional, specialized training in traditionally undeserved settings or with specific undeserved populations have been demonstrated to be successful in providing services to those same undeserved populations during the years following the training experience. That is, mental health professionals who have participated in these specialized federally funded programs have tended not only to meet their payback obligations, but have continued to work in the public sector or with the undeserved populations with whom they have been trained to work. 
While the doctorate in psychology provides broad-based knowledge and mastery in a wide variety of clinical skills, the specialized post-doctoral fellowship programs provide particular diagnostic and treatment skills required to effectively respond to these underserved populations. For example, what looks like severe depression in an elderly person might be a withdrawal related to hearing loss, or what looks like poor academic motivation in a child recently relocated from Southeast Asia might be reflective of a cultural value of reserve rather than a disinterest in academic learning. Each Of these situations requires very different interventions, of course, and specialized assessment skills. 
Domestic violence is not just a problem for the criminal justice system, it is a significant public health problem. A single aspect of the issue, domestic violence against women results in almost 100,000 days of hospitalization, 30,000 emergency room visits, and 40,000 visits to physicians each year. Rates of child and spouse abuse in rural areas are particularly high as are the rates of alcohol abuse and depression in adolescents. A post-doctoral fellowship program in the psychology of rural populations could be of special benefit in addressing these problems. 
Given the changing demographics of the Nation--the increasing life span and numbers of the elderly, the rising percentage of minority populations within the country, as well as an increased recognition on the long-term sequel of violence and abuse--and given the demonstrated success and effectiveness of these kinds of specialized training programs, it is incumbent upon us to encourage participation in post-doctoral fellowship programs that respond to the needs of the Nation's underserved.

Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise to introduce legislation to restore the business meals and entertainment tax deduction to 80 percent. I am joined by Senators Thomas, Cochran, and Stevens. Restoration of this deduction is essential to the livelihood of the food service, travel and tourism, and entertainment industries throughout the United States. These industries are being economically harmed as a result of this reduction. All are major industries which employ millions of people. many of whom are already feeling the effects of the reduction. 
The deduction for business meals and entertainment was reduced from 80 to 50 percent under the Omnibus budget Reconciliation Act of 1993, and went into effect on January 1, 1994. Many companies, small and large, have changed their policies and guidelines on travel and entertainment expenses as a result of the tax reduction in the business meals and entertainment expenses deduction. Businesses have also been forced to curtail company reimbursement policies because of the reduction in the business meals and entertainment expenses deduction. In some cases, businesses have eliminated their expense accounts. Consequently, restaurant establishments, which have replied heavily on business lunch and dinner services, are being adversely affected by the reduction in business meals. For example: 
Jay's Restaurant in Dayton, Ohio, closed its lunch service on July 14, 1994, following a 15 percent decrease in lunch business. This decision was based on 2,000 fewer lunch customers from January through June 1994 as compared to the same period in 1993. 
The Wall Street Restaurant in Des Moines, Iowa, an upscale restaurant serving American and Continental cuisine, has seen its revenues decline 40 percent since the beginning of 1994. Owner Joey Fasano reduced his staff from 50 to 35 employees. 
The Boca in Middlesex County, New Jersey, averaged 40 to 60 lunches per day prior to 1994. The restaurant now serves between 5 to 15 lunches per day. Owner Robert Campione reduced his staff from 18 to 14 employees. 
The 37th Street Hideaway Restaurant in New York City did 150 lunches a day prior to 1994. Owner Van Panopoulos now serves 40 lunches and his dinner business has dropped 30 to 40 percent. Mr. Panopoulos reduced his staff from 20 to 10 employees. 
Bianco's in Denver, Colorado, closed its lunch service in April 1994 because of the decline in business. Owner Fred White reduced his staff from 26 to 15 employees. 
Edward's at Kanoloa in Hawaii has seen its revenues decline by 15 percent since 1994. Owner Edward Frady attributes the decline in his business to the reduction in business meals and entertainment expense deduction. 
I sincerely hope that the business meals reduction to 50 percent does not become a Luxury Tax Two, in which the Congress moves toward restoration only after the damage has been done and huge job losses have occurred. Accordingly, I urge my colleagues to join me in cosponsoring this important legislation.

Mr. Inouye. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on an issue of great importance to Hawaii's leasehold homeowners. In fiscal year 1992, at my request, the Congress appropriated $400,000 to study the feasibility of reforming the Internal Revenue Code to address ground lease rent payments and to determine what role, if any, the Federal Government should play in encouraging lease to fee conversions. The nationwide study was conducted by the Hawaii Real Estate and Research Center. 
The legislation I am introducing today is based on the recommendations of this study. The bill would: First, provide a mortgage interest deduction for residential leasehold properties by allowing the nonredeemable ground lease rents to be claimed as an interest deduction; and second, include a tax credit for up to $5,000 for certain transaction costs on the transfer of certain residential leasehold land for a 5-year period, ending on December 31, 2001. Transaction costs include closing costs, attorneys' fees, surveys and appraisals, and telephone, office, and travel expenses. 
In most private home ownership situations in this country, a homeowner owns both the building and land. Under a leasehold arrangement a homeowner owns the building--single-family home, condominium, or cooperative apartment--on leased land. The research conducted under the leasehold study shows that residential leaseholds are not uncommon in other parts of the United States and elsewhere in the world. Residential leaseholds exist in places such as Baltimore, MD, Irvine, CA, native American lands in Palm Springs, CA, Fairhope, AL, Pearl River Basin, MS, and New York, NY. 
The study further indicates that there are few States that regulate residential leaseholds. Of those that do, the most common requirement applies only to condominium or time share units and is one requiring adequate disclosure of the lease terms. For the most part, States are unaware of any leasehold problems in their jurisdictions. However, residential leaseholds have proven to be problematic for the State of Hawaii. 
The formation of Hawaii's land tenure system can be traced back to 1778 when British Capt. James Cook made his first contact with the Hawaiian civilization. Leasing was the preferred system to maintain control and retain a portfolio asset value. Residential leaseholds were first developed on the Island of Oahu after World War II. Population increases created a demand for housing and other types of real estate development. Federal income tax policy encouraged the retention of land to avoid payment of large capital gains taxes. 
Hawaii's land tenure system is now anomalous to the rest of the United States because of the concentration of land in the hands of government, large charitable trusts, large agriculturally based companies and owners of small parcels or urban properties. High land prices and high renegotiated rents continue to create instability in Hawaii's residential leasehold system. In 1967, the Hawaii State Legislature enacted a Land Reform Act which did not become effective until the U.S. Supreme Court issued its 1984 decision in Hawaii Housing Authority v. Midkiff, 104 S. Ct. 231 (1984). The act and the Supreme Court decision basically divided the market into a `single-family home market in which leaseholds were subject to mandatory conversion, and a leasehold condominium market which did not come within the scope of the law.' 
Mandatory conversions on the single-family home market occurred from 1979 to 1982, and 1986 to 1990. As of 1992, there are approximately 4,600 single-family homes remaining in residential leaseholds. However, resolution over condominium leasehold reform remains uncertain. In 1990, the Honolulu City Council enacted legislation that would cap lease rent increases. The constitutionality of the law as challenged in U.S. District Court, District of Hawaii. The court found the law unconstitutional because the formula it used to arrive at permitted lease rent was illogical. 
In 1991, due to the Hawaii State Legislature's unwillingness to address the leasehold problems, the Honolulu City Council again enacted a mandatory leasehold conversion law for leasehold condominiums, Ordinance 01-95. The constitutionality of this law is currently being challenged in the Federal court. Another bill which linked lease rent increases with the Consumer Price Index and the level of disposable income available to condominium owners was also considered. This bill, similar to the one enacted in 1990, was found to be unconstitutional. 
The uncertainty in the residential leasehold market continues to create economic and emotional distress for the leasehold residents of Hawaii. Voluntary conversion has helped to ease the situation and substantially reduce the stock of leasehold residential units in Hawaii. Yet, voluntary conversion is not enough to resolve the residential leasehold problems. 
My legislation will help reduce the economic hardship due to the uncertainty in Hawaii's residential leasehold system. The leasehold study contains an analysis of the tax revenue effects of this legislation by allowing individual tax deductions for residential ground rent. The analysis suggests that there are potential revenues to the Federal Government if this legislation is enacted into law.

Mr. INOUYE. 
Mr. President, section 405 of the Immigration Act of 1990 was enacted to make naturalization under section 329 of the Immigration and Nationality Act available to those Filipino World War II veterans whose military service during the liberation of the Philippines makes them deserving of United States citizenship. The naturalization authority to allow the veterans to be naturalized in the Philippines was first granted under Section 113 of the fiscal year 1993 Departments of Commerce, Justice, State, Judiciary and related agencies appropriations bill. 
The original intent of Congress in providing the Immigration and Naturalization Service [INS] with the authority to naturalize applicants in the Philippines was to relieve the unnecessary hardships that section 405 applicants would encounter by having to travel to the United States for an interview and naturalization ceremony, since many are elderly and have no relatives in the United States. The initial period for filing an application under this provision was from November 29, 1990 to November 30, 1992. Section 113 further extended the filing period to February 3, 1995. 
Unfortunately, the authority to naturalize applicants in the Philippines has now expired. The legislation I am introducing today would immediately restore, for a 5-year period, the authority for the U.S. Embassy in Manila to complete the naturalization process of approximately 12,000 remaining applications which were properly filed under section 405 of the 1990 Act. The legislation does not extend the application period. The legislation also makes clear that naturalization is available only to those applicants who were found by the Recovered Personnel Division of the U.S. Army and the Guerrilla Affairs Division of the U.S. Army to deserve benefits from the U.S. Government.

Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, on behalf of our Nation's clinical social workers, I am introducing legislation to amend the Public Health Service Act. This legislation will: First, establish a new social work training program; second, ensure that social work students are eligible for support under the Health Careers Opportunity Program and that social work schools are eligible for support under the Minority Centers for Excellence programs; Third, permit schools offering degrees in social work to obtain grants for training projects in geriatrics; and fourth, ensure that social work is recognized as a profession under the Public Health Maintenance Organization [HMO] Act. 
Despite the impressive range of services social workers provide to the people of this Nation, particularly our elderly, disadvantaged, and minority populations, few Federal programs exist to provide opportunities for social work training in health and mental health care. This legislation builds on the health professions education legislation enacted by the 102d Congress enabling schools of social work to apply for AIDS training funding and resources to establish collaborative relationships with rural health care providers and schools of medicine or osteopathic medicine. This bill provides funding for traineeships and fellowships for individuals who plan to specialize in, practice, or teach social work, or for operating approved social work training programs; it assists disadvantaged students to earn graduate degrees in social work with concentrations in health or mental health; it provides new resources and opportunities in social work training for minorities; and it encourages schools of social work to expand programs in geriatrics. Finally, the recognition of social work as a profession merely codifies current social work practice and reflects the modifications made by the Medicare HMO legislation. 
I believe it is important to ensure that the special expertise and skills social workers possess continue to be available to the citizens of this Nation. This legislation, by providing financial assistance to schools of social work and social work students, recognizes the long history and critical importance of the services provided by social work professionals. In addition since social workers have provided quality mental health services to our citizens for a long time and continue to be at the forefront of establishing innovative programs to serve our disadvantaged populations, I believe that it is time to provide them with the proper recognition of their profession that they have clearly earned and deserve. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be printed in the Congression Record.

Mr. INOUYE. 
Mr. President, I am introducing legislation today to modify Title VII of the U.S. Public Health Service Act in order to provide students enrolled in graduate psychology programs with the opportunity to participate in various health professions loan programs. 
Providing students enrolled in graduate psychology programs with eligibility for financial assistance in the form of loans, loan guarantees, and scholarships will facilitate a much needed infusion of behavioral science expertise into our public health efforts. There is a growing recognition of the valuable contribution that is being made by our nation's psychologists toward solving some of our Nation's most distressing problems such as domestic violence, addictions, occupational stress, child abuse, and depression. 
The participation of students of all kinds is vital to the success of health care training. The Title VII programs play a significant role in providing financial support for the recruitment of minorities, women, and individuals from economically disadvantaged backgrounds. Minority therapists, for example, have an advantage in the provision of critical services to minority populations because they are more likely to understand or, perhaps, share the cultural background of their clients and are often able to communicate to them in their own language. Also significant is the fact that, when compared with non-minority graduates, ethnic minority graduates are less likely to work in private practice and more likely to work in community or non-profit settings, where ethnic minority and economically disadvantaged individuals are more likely to seek care. 
It is important that a continued emphasis be placed on the needy populations of our nation and that continued support be provided for the training of individuals who are most likely to provide services in underserved areas. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be printed in the Congressional Record.

Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce an amendment that would change existing law regarding the designated position and grade for the Chief Nurses of the United States Army, the United States Navy, and the United States Air Force. Currently the Chief Nurses of the three branches of the military are one-star level general officer grades; this law would change the current grade to Major General in the United States Army and Air Force and Rear Admiral (upper half) in the United States Navy. Our military Chief Nurses have an awesome responsibility--a degree of responsibility that is absolutely deserving of this change in grade. 
You might be surprised at how big their scope of duties actually is. For example, the Chiefs are responsible for both peacetime and wartime health care doctrine, standards and policy for all nursing personnel within their respective branches. In fact, the Chief Nurses are responsible for more than 80,000 Army, 5,200 Navy, and 26,000 Air Force nursing personnel. This includes officer and enlisted nursing specialties in the active, reserve and guard components of the military. This level of responsibility certainly supports the need to change the grade for the Chief Nurses which would insure that they have a seat at the corporate table of policy and decision making. 
There has been much discussion about the so-called glass ceilings that unfairly impact the ability of women to achieve the same status as their male counterparts. While I do not want to make this a gender-discrimination issue, the reality is that military nurses hit two glass ceilings: one as a nurse in a physician-dominated health care system and one as a woman in a male-dominated military system. The simple fact is that organizations are best served when the leadership is composed of a mix of specialty and gender groups--of equal rank--who bring their unique talents to the corporate table. For military nurses, the two-star level of general officer Chief Nurse will insure that nurses indeed get to the corporate executive table. 
I strongly believe that it is very important, and past time, that we recognize the extensive scope and level of responsibility the military Chief Nurses have and make sure that future military health care organizations will continue to benefit from their expertise and unique contributions. 
Mr. President, I request unanimous consent that the text of this bill be printed in the Congressional Record.

Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, today, I am introducing The Physical Therapy and Occupational Therapy Education Act of 1997. This legislation will assist in educating physical therapy and occupational therapy practitioners to meet the growing demand for the valuable services they provide in our communities. 
In its most recent report, the Department of Labor's Bureau of Labor Statistics projected that the demand for services provided by physical therapy practitioners will increase dramatically over the next decade. According to the Bureau, between 1994 and 2005 the increase in demand will create a need for 81,000 additional physical therapists, an 80 percent increase over 1994 figures. Demand for physical therapist assistants is expected to grow at an even faster rate, experiencing an 83 percent increase over the same time period. 
The Bureau also predicts increasing demand for practitioners in the field of occupational therapy. Between 1994 and 2005 the increase in demand will create a need for 39,000 occupational therapists, a 72 percent increase over 1994 figures. Demand for occupational therapist assistants is projected to experience an 82 percent increase over the same time period. 
Several factors contribute to the present need for Federal support in this area. The rapid aging of our nation's population, the demands of the AIDS crisis, increasing emphasis on health promotion and disease prevention, and the growth of home health care have out paced our ability to educate an adequate number of physical therapy and occupational therapy practitioners. In addition, technological advances are allowing injured and disabled individuals to survive conditions that in the past would have proven fatal. 
America's inability to educate an adequate number of physical therapists and occupational therapists has led to an increased reliance on foreign-educated, non-immigrant temporary workers (H-1B visa holders). The U.S. Commission on Immigration Reform has identified the physical therapy and occupational therapy fields as having among the highest number of H-1B visa holders in the U.S., second only to computer specialists. 
According to the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS), we know that 1,389 H-1B visa holders sought employment as physical therapists in 1994. This number represents 5.9 percent of the 23,500 arrivals for which the INS can verify their known occupation. An additional 82,399 holders of H-1B visas were reported to have entered the U.S. in 1994 for which the INS does not have occupation data. If we assume that the same percentage of H-1B visa holders are seeking employment in physical therapy as in the known-occupation pool, we can calculate that an additional 4,861 foreign-educated physical therapists were also seeking employment (5.9 percent of 82,399 aliens). Thus, the total number of foreign-educated physical therapists seeking employment in the U.S. during 1994 was approximately 6,250. In comparison, U.S. programs of physical therapy graduated a total of 5,846 physical therapists from 141 institutions nationwide in the same year. 
While the INS does not categorize occupational therapy as a separate profession when tracking H-1B visa entrants, the National Board for Certification in Occupational Therapy documents that the percentage of newly certified occupational therapists who are foreign graduates has risen from 3 percent in 1985 to more than 20 percent in 1995. 
The legislation I introduce today would provide necessary assistance to physical therapy and occupational therapy programs throughout the country to meet the health care demands of the 21st century. In awarding grants, preference would be given to those applicants that seek to educate and train practitioners at clinical sites in either rural or urban medically underserved communities. 
In addition to a shortage of practitioners, the present shortage of physical therapy and occupational therapy faculty impedes the expansion of established programs. The critical shortage of doctoral-prepared physical therapists and occupational therapists has resulted in an almost nonexistent pool of potential faculty. Presently, there exist 117 faculty vacancies among the 131 accredited, professional-level physical therapy programs in the U.S. Similarly, during the '93-'94 academic year there existed 51 faculty vacancies among the 85 accredited, professional-level occupational therapy programs. The legislation I introduce today would assist in the development of a pool of qualified faculty by giving preference to those grant applicants seeking to develop and expand post-professional programs for the advanced training of physical therapists and occupational therapists. 
The investment we make through passage of The Physical Therapy and Occupational Therapy Education Act of 1997 will help reduce America's dependence on foreign labor and help create high-skilled, high-wage employment opportunities for American citizens. I look forward to working with my colleagues in the Congress to enact this important legislation. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be printed in the Congressional Record.

Mr. INOUYE. 
Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Rural Preventive Health Care Training Act of 1997, a bill that responds to the dire situation our rural communities face in obtaining quality health care and disease prevention programs. 
Almost one fourth of Americans live in rural areas and thus frequently lack access to adequate physical and mental health care. For example, approximately 1,700 rural communities in virtually every state of the union suffer critical shortages of health care providers. As many as 21 million of the 34 million people living in underserved rural areas are without access to a primary care provider. In areas where providers exist, there are numerous limits to access, such as geography and distance, lack of transportation, and lack of knowledge about available resources. Additionally, due to the diversity of rural populations, ranging from native Americans to migrant farm workers, language and cultural obstacles are often a factor. 
Compound these problems with slim financial resources and many of America's rural communities go without vital health care, especially preventive care. Children fail to receive immunizations and routine checkups. Preventable illnesses and injuries occur needlessly and lead to expensive hospitalizations. Early symptoms of emotional problems and substance abuse go undetected and often develop into full blown disorders. 
An Institute of Medicine (IOM) report from their two-year study entitled, `Reducing Risks for Mental Disorders: Frontiers for Preventive Intervention Research' highlights the benefits of preventive care for all health problems. Rural health care providers face a lack of training opportunities. Training in prevention is crucial in order to meet the demand for care in underserved areas. 
Beyond the scope of simple prevention training, interdisciplinary preventive training in rural health is important because of a growing array of evidence that links mental disorders to physical ailments. For example, it has been estimated that from fifty to seventy percent of visits to physicians for medical symptoms are due in part or whole to psychosocial problems. By encouraging interdisciplinary training, rural communities can integrate the behavioral, biological, and psychological sciences to form the most effective preventive care possible. 
The problems with quality, access, and understanding of health care in rural areas all suggest that promoting interdisciplinary training of psychologists, nurses, and social workers is essential. The need becomes clearer when considering that many of the behavior-related problems afflicting rural communities are amenable to proven risk reduction strategies that are best provided by trained mental health care professionals. 
Interdisciplinary team prevention training will facilitate both health and mental health clinics sharing single service sites and routine consultation between groups. Social workers, psychologists, clinical psychiatric nurse specialists, and paraprofessionals play an important role in extending rural mental health services to those in need. Linkage of these services can provide better utilization of existing mental health care personnel, increase awareness and understanding of mental health services, and contribute to the overall health of rural communities. 
The Rural Preventive Health Care Training Act of 1997, targeted specifically toward rural communities, would implement the risk-reduction model described in the IOM study. This model is based on the identification of risk factors for a certain disorder and the implementation of specific preventive strategies to target groups with those risk factors. The IOM Committee aptly demonstrates that methods of risk reduction have proven highly successful in many health-related areas, such as cardiovascular disease, smoking reduction, and the numerous childhood diseases and conditions that are preventable by early prenatal care for pregnant women. 
The cost of human suffering caused by poor health is immeasurable, but the huge financial burden placed on communities, families, and individuals is evident. By implementing preventive measures, the potential for savings in psychological and financial realms is enormous. This savings is the goal of the Rural Preventive Health Care Training Act of 1997. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be printed in the Congressional Record.

Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to enable those former prisoners of war who have been separated honorably from their respective services and who have been rated to have a 30 percent service-connected disability to have the use of both the military commissary and post exchange privileges. While I realize that it is impossible to adequately compensate one who has endured long periods of incarceration at the hands of our Nation's enemies, I do feel that this gesture is both meaningful and important to those concerned. It also serves as a reminder that our Nation has not forgotten their sacrifices.

Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to provide for a federal income tax credit for those families who purchase a child restraint system for their automobiles. 
Accidents and injuries continue to cause almost half of the deaths of children between the ages of one and four, more than half of the deaths of children between five and fifteen, and continue to be the leading cause of death among children and young adults. 
It is my understanding that although the Department of Transportation has made injury prevention among children a top priority, a significant number of parents either do not have adequate child restraint systems or do not have them properly installed. 
It is imperative that we create this opportunity to provide America's parents with a financially accessible alternative to the insufficient level of child safety measures currently available for use in automobiles.

Mr. INOUYE. 
Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Nursing School Clinics Act of 1997, a bill that has two main purposes. First, it builds on our concerted efforts to provide access to quality health care for all Americans by furnishing grants and incentives for nursing schools to establish primary care clinics in areas where additional medical services are most needed. Second, it provides the opportunity for nursing schools to enhance the scope of their students' training and education by giving them firsthand clinical experience in primary care facilities. 
Any good manager knows that when major problems are at hand and resources are tight, the most important act is the one that makes full use of all available resources. The American health care system is particularly deficient in this regard. We all know only too well that many individuals in the Nation have no or inadequate access to health care services, especially if they live in many of our rural towns and villages or inhabit our Indian communities. Many good people are trying to deliver services that are so vitally needed, but we need to do more. We must make full use of all health care practitioners, especially those who have been long waiting to give the nation the full measure of their professional abilities. 
Nursing is one of the noblest professions, with an enduring history of offering effective and sensitive care to those in need. Yet it is only in the last few years that we have begun to recognize the role that nurses can play as independent providers of care. Only recently, in 1990, Medicare was changed to authorize direct reimbursements to nurse practitioners. Medicaid is gradually being reformed to incorporate their services more effectively. The Nursing School Clinics Act continues the progress toward fully incorporating nurses in the delivery of health care services. Under the act, nursing schools will be able to establish clinics, supervised and staffed by nurse practitioners and nurse practitioner students, that provide primary care targeted to medically underserved rural and native American populations. 
In the process of giving direct ambulatory care to their patients, these clinics will also furnish the forums in which both public and private schools of nursing can design and implement clinical training programs for their students. Simultaneous school-based education and clinical training have been a traditional part of physician development, but nurses have enjoyed fewer opportunities to combine classroom instruction with the practical experience of treating patients. This bill reinforces the principle for nurses of joining schooling with the actual practice of health care. 
To accomplish these objectives, title XIX of the Social Security Act is amended to designate that the services provided in these nursing school clinics are reimbursable under Medicaid. The combination of grants and the provision of Medicaid reimbursement furnishes the incentives and operational resources to start the clinics and to keep them going. 
To meet the increasing challenges of bringing cost-effective and quality health care to all Americans, we are going to have to think about and debate a variety of proposals, both large and small. Most important, however, we must approach the issue of health care with creativity and determination, ensuring that all reasonable avenues are pursued. Nurses have always been an integral part of health care delivery. The Nursing School Clinics Act of 1997 recognizes the central role they can perform as care givers to the medically underserved.

Mr. INOUYE. 
Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to amend Title XVIII of the Social Security Act to correct discrepancies in the reimbursement of clinical social workers covered through Medicare, Part B. The three proposed changes that are contained in this legislation are necessary to clarify the current payment process for clinical social workers and to establish a reimbursement methodology for the profession that is similar to other health care professionals reimbursed through the Medicare program. 
First, this legislation would set payment for clinical social worker services according to a fee schedule established by the Secretary. Currently, the methodology for reimbursing clinical social workers' services is set at a percentage of the fee for another nonphysician provider group, creating a greater differential in charges than that which exists in the marketplace. I am aware of no other provision in the Medicare statute where one nonphysician's reimbursement rate is tied to that of another nonphysician provider. This is a precedent that clinical social workers understandably wish to change. I also wish to see that clinical social workers' services are valued on their own merit. 
Second, this legislation makes it clear that services and supplies furnished incident to a clinical social worker's services are a covered Medicare expense, just as these services are currently covered for other mental health professionals in Medicare. Third, the bill would allow a clinical social worker to be reimbursed for services provided to a client who is hospitalized. 
Clinical social workers are valued members of our health care provider team. They are legally regulated in every state of our nation and are recognized as independent providers of mental health care throughout the health care system. Clinical social worker services were made available to Medicare beneficiaries through the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1989. I believe that it is time now to correct the reimbursement problems that this profession has experienced through Medicare.

Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to authorize the autonomous functioning of clinical psychologists and clinical social workers within the Medicare comprehensive outpatient rehabilitation facility program. 
In my judgment, it is truly unfortunate that programs such as this currently require clinical supervision of the services provided by certain health professionals and do not allow each of the various health professions to truly function to the extent of their state practice acts. In my judgment, it is especially appropriate that those who need the services of outpatient rehabilitation facilities have access to a wide range of social and behavioral science expertise. Clinical psychologists and clinical social workers are recognized as independent providers of mental health care services through the Federal Employee Health Benefits Program, the Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Uniformed Services, the Medicare (Part B) Program, and numerous private insurance plans. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be printed in the Congressional Record.

Mr. INOUYE. 
Mr. President, I am introducing legislation today to amend chapter 74 of title 38, United States Code, to revise certain provisions relating to the appointment of clinical and counseling psychologists in the Veterans Health Administration (VHA). 
The VHA has a long history of maintaining a staff of the very best health care professionals to provide care to those men and women who have served their country in the Armed Forces. It is certainly fitting that this should be done. 
Recently a quite distressing situation regarding the care of our veterans has come to my attention. In particular, the recruitment and retention of psychologists in the VHA of the Department of Veterans Affairs has become a significant problem. 
The Congress has recognized the important contribution of the behavioral sciences in the treatment of several conditions from which a significant portion of our veterans suffer. For example, programs related to homelessness, substance abuse, and post traumatic stress disorder [PTSD] have received funding from the Congress in recent years. 
Certainly, psychologists, as behavioral science experts, are essential to the successful implementation of these programs. However, the high vacancy and turnover rates for psychologists in the VHA (over 11 percent and 18 percent respectively as reported in one recent survey) might seriously jeopardize these programs and will negatively impact overall patient care in the VHA. 
Recruitment of psychologists by the VHA is hindered by a number of factors including a pay scale not commensurate with private sector rates of pay as well as by the low number of clinical and counseling psychologists appearing on the register of the Office of Personnel Management [OPM]. Most new hires have no post-doctoral experience and are hired immediately after a VA internship. Recruitment, when successful, takes up to six months or more. 
Retention of psychologists in the VA system poses an even more significant problem. I have been informed that almost 40 percent of VHA psychologists had five years or less of post-doctoral experience. Without doubt, our veterans would benefit from a higher percentage of senior staff who are more experienced in working with veterans and their particular concerns. My bill provides incentives for psychologists to continue their work with the VHA and seek additional education and training. 
Several factors are associated with the difficulties in retention of VHA psychologists including low salaries and lack of career advancement opportunities. It seems that psychologists are apt to leave the VA system after five years because they have almost reached peak levels for salary and professional development in the VHA. Furthermore, under the present system psychologists cannot be recognized nor appropriately compensated for excellence or for taking on additional responsibilities such as running treatment programs. 
In effect, the current system for hiring psychologists in the VHA supports mediocrity, not excellence and mastery. Our veterans with behavioral disorders and mental health problems are deserving of better psychological care from more experienced professionals than they are currently receiving. 
A hybrid title 38 appointment authority for psychologists would help ameliorate the recruitment and retention problems in several ways. The length of time it takes to recruit psychologists could be abbreviated by eliminating the requirement for applicants to be rated by the Office of Personnel Management. This would also facilitate the recruitment of applicants who are not recent VA interns by reducing the amount of time between identifying a desirable applicant and being able to offer that applicant a position. 
It is expected that problems in retention of behavioral science experts will be greatly alleviated with the implementation of a hybrid title 38 system for VA psychologists, primarily through offering financial incentives for psychologists to pursue professional development with the VHA. Achievements that would merit salary increases under title 38 should include such activities as assuming supervisory responsibilities for clinical programs, implementing innovative clinical treatments that improve the effectiveness and/or efficiency of patient care, making significant contributions to the science of psychology, earning the ABPP diplomate status, and becoming a Fellow of the American Psychological Association. 
Currently, psychologists are the only doctoral level health care providers in the VHA who are not included in title 38. This is, without question, a significant factor in the recruitment and retention difficulties that I have addressed. Ultimately, an across-the-board salary increase might be necessary. However, the conversion of psychologists to a hybrid title 38, as proposed by this amendment, would provide relief for these difficulties and enhance the quality of care for our Nations' veterans and their families. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be printed in the Congressional Record.

Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill which is of great importance to a group of patriotic Americans. This legislation is designed to extend space-available travel privileges on military aircraft to those who have been totally disabled in the service of our country. 
Currently, retired members of the Armed Forces are permitted to travel on a space-available basis on non-scheduled military flights within the continental United States and on scheduled overseas flights operated by the Military Airlift Command. My bill would provide the same benefits for 100 percent service-connected disabled veterans. 
Surely, we owe these heroic men and women, who have given so much to our country, a debt of gratitude. Of course, we can never repay them for the sacrifice they have made on behalf of our nation but we can surely try to make their lives more pleasant and fulfilling. One way in which we can help is to extend military travel privileges to these distinguished American veterans. I have received numerous letters from all over the country attesting to the importance attached to this issue by veterans. Therefore, I ask that my colleagues show their concern and join me in saying `thank you' by supporting this legislation.

Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation that would provide a federal charter for the National Academies of Practice. This organization represents outstanding practitioners who have made significant contributions to the practice of applied psychology, medicine, dentistry, nursing, optometry, podiatry, social work, and veterinary medicine. When fully established, each of the nine academies will possess 100 distinguished practitioners selected by their peers. This umbrella organization will be able to provide the Congress of the United States and the executive branch with considerable health policy expertise, especially from the perspective of those individuals who are in the forefront of actually providing health care. 
As we continue to grapple with the many complex issues surrounding the delivery of health care services, it is clearly in our best interest to ensure that the Congress have systematic access to the recommendations of an interdisciplinary body of health care practitioners.

Mr. INOUYE. 
Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Clinical Social Workers' Recognition Act of 1997 to correct an outstanding problem in the Federal Employees Compensation Act. This bill will also provide clinical social workers the recognition they deserve as independent providers of quality mental health care services. 
Clinical social workers are authorized to independently diagnose and treat mental illnesses through public and private health insurance plans across the Nation. However, title V, United States Code, does not permit the use of mental health evaluations conducted by clinical social workers for use as evidence in determining workers' compensation claims brought about by Federal employees. The bill I am introducing corrects this problem. 
All 50 States, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands legally regulate social workers through licensure or certification. Thirty-one States and the District of Columbia have enacted laws that mandate reimbursement for clinical social workers by insurance plans that offer mental health care coverage. All Federal insurance programs that authorize the provision of mental health care services, including Medicare, the Federal Employee Health Benefits Program [FEHBP], and the Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Uniformed Services [CHAMPUS] recognize the ability of clinical social workers to provide mental health services. 
It is a sad irony that Federal employees may select a clinical social worker through their health plans to provide mental health services but may not go to this professional for a workers' compensation evaluation. Studies show that as much as 65 percent of all mental health services are provided by clinical social workers and clinical social workers are often the only providers of mental health service in rural areas of the country. The failure to recognize the validity of evaluations provided by clinical social workers unnecessarily limits the choice of Federal employees in selecting a provider to conduct the mental health evaluation and may well impose an undue burden for Federal employees in certain areas where clinical social workers are the only available providers for mental health care. This legislation will correct such an inequity.
