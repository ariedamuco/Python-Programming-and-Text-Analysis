    Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Percy Hill, an accomplished school teacher from Andover, NH. Percy was recently honored at the Disney American teacher Awards, as one of the 33 honorees selected from a group of 70,000 who were chosen for their creativity in the classroom as well as their teaching accomplishments. 
   Growing up in New England, Percy developed his love for athletics as well as children, spending the past 10 years coaching the Unicycle Team. Working around the clock, he has coached these champions to new levels. They have performed in the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade, the Fiesta Bowl Parade, the Strawberry Festival of Virginia and even have gone international, performing in Canada. 
   Not only has Percy given his time and energy to coaching, but he has spent countless hours raising the funds for the team's traveling expenses. Percy has managed to fund one hundred percent of all of the trips through massive fund raising efforts, allowing all children to go regardless of their situations outside of practice. He has proven time and time again to be a valuable asset not only to the team, but the community of Andover as well. 
   Aside from Percy's work with the unicycle team he also finds time to volunteer referee both basketball and soccer, proving once again, that Percy Hill puts his dedication to the youth of America at the top of his priority list. He is to be commended on his commitment to Andover Elementary and Middle School, and those students which attend it. 
   The Disney American Teacher Awards were developed as, ``A way of honoring members of the teaching profession, whose talent, commitment, and creativity have a profound and lasting impact on our children as well as our society as a whole,'' according  to Michael D. Eisner, CEO of Disney. All of Percy Hill's actions speak volumes of his commitment and impact on the children of Andover, NH. It is an honor to represent him in the Senate.

    Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Daniel Greeley III, of Peterborough, New Hampshire. A Navy Petty Officer 3rd Class Division who was serving on the U.S.S. Cole when it was attacked on October 12th, 2000. Daniel is in his 1st year of a six-year enlistment, after having served three years in the United States Coast Guard. 
   Daniel was one of the engine room mechanics on shift when the attack happened. Even though he was on the other side of the ship, the blast waves hit him hard. He suffered cuts and bruises, but nothing nearly as serious as his friends and shipmates. Four of Daniel Greeley's closest friends were killed by the blast. Even after the blast had left a hole measuring 40 feet wide, and 40 feet high, Daniel as well as the other sailors of the U.S.S Cole pushed on. 
   After the blast, the sailors worked frantically to keep the ship afloat until it could be brought to safety. As one of the engine room mechanics, Daniel was forced to push on through the crisis to keep generators running and the boat from going under. He had the lives of more than 200 sailors depending on his skills as an engine room mechanic. Daniel persevered well through the night and into the early morning, facing adversity head on and pushing through. 
   Daniel's actions and bravery speak volumes of his character. Not only has he elected to serve our country, but has done so in a noble manner. He is a true inspiration to the people of New Hampshire. He can hold his head high, knowing he has done his wife Mary, and 14-month-old daughter Angelina proud. As Daniel continues his service, I wish him continued success. He will begin his ACNR schooling in January, an undoubtedly will continue to serve his country with honor and grace. As a fellow sailor, I salute Daniel Greeley III. It is an honor to represent him in the United States Senate.

   Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. My colleague from Illinois is correct. The bill calls on the scientists themselves to make the determination that a chimpanzee is no longer useful for research and to formally release the chimpanzee to the sanctuary system for permanent cessation of scientific experimentation. 
   The amended version of the legislation allows one exception: In that rare, unforeseen circumstance, where a specific sanctuary chimpanzee may be required because a research protocol he endured in the past, combined with a technological advance that was not available or invented at the time he was released, could provide extremely useful information essential to address an important public health need, then that chimpanzee may be used in research if, and only if, the proposed research involves minimal pain and distress to the chimpanzee, as well as to other chimps in the social group, as evaluated by the board of the sanctuary. Of course, if a chimpanzee currently in a lab setting meets the same criteria, then the bill requires that the sanctuary chimpanzee not be used.

   Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. The Senator is correct on each of those points, which will serve to further limit the possibility of sanctuary chimpanzees being recalled for research. It is my intention, and the intent of the amended legislation, that any such research would rarely, if ever, take place.

   Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. I agree, it would be good to set the record straight on this issue. The federal government now spends millions of dollars each year for the maintenance and care of chimpanzees who are no longer used in medical research, but are being warehoused in expensive taxpayer-funded laboratory cages. The CHIMP Act will actually save taxpayers money because the sanctuary setting is so much less expensive to build and operate than laboratory facilities. 
   The Congressional Budget Office prepared a cost estimate for S. 2725, the legislation that you and I introduced in June. H.R. 3514, the House counterpart that is now pending in the Senate, is identical to S. 2725 in terms of the cost issues. The CBO concluded that ``the cost of caring for a chimpanzee in an external sanctuary would be less expensive on a per capita basis than if the government continued to house the animals in federally owned and operated facilities. Therefore, the government would realize a savings in the care and maintenance of the chimpanzees after 2002.'' CBO estimated the annual savings after initial sanctuary construction costs to be an average of $4 million per year after 2002. 
   It costs $8-$15 per day per animal to care for chimpanzees in a sanctuary, where they live in groups in a naturalized setting. That is compared to the $20-$30 per day per animal that the federal government is now spending to maintain the chimpanzees in laboratory cages. 
   Even in terms of sanctuary start-up costs, taxpayers will benefit because sanctuaries are two to three times less costly to build than laboratory facilities for chimpanzees. While the federal government is now squandering very high-priced laboratory space warehousing surplus chimpanzees, the CHIMP Act will allow this space to be utilized for animals in research, reducing the need to fund new laboratory construction.

   Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. I thank my colleague from Illinois for raising those points. I'd also like to address one other issue that may be on the minds of some of our colleagues. That is the question of euthanasia. Fiscal conservatives may question why we  should worry at all about the long-term care of chimpanzees no longer used in medical research. The answer is: it's basically a cost of doing business. If the federal government wants to keep using chimpanzees for medical research, it has to assume the responsibility for their care after the research is done. This isn't 
   just my opinion, as someone who cares about animals. It was the conclusion of the National Research Council, an esteemed body under the National Academy of Sciences, which was asked by NIH to investigate the problem of chimpanzees no longer used for biomedical research. 
   The NRC conducted a thorough three-year study and issued a report in 1997--Chimpanzees in Research: Strategies for Their Ethical Care, Management, and Use--which recommended sanctuaries as an ``integral component of the strategic plan to achieve the best and most cost-effective solutions to the current dilemma.'' The NRC report clearly rejects the option of euthanizing surplus chimpanzees, based on views strongly conveyed to the NRC by members of the scientific community as well as the public. ``Many members of the public and the scientific community have called for continuing support for chimpanzees in an acceptable environment, rather than euthanizing them, even when they are no longer wanted for breeding or research. The committee fully recognizes the financial implication of this position in regard to lifetime funding for all animals and for additional space and facilities for an aging population.'' The report cites the close similarities between chimpanzees and humans, noting that ``[t]here are practical as well as theoretical reasons to reject euthanasia as a general policy. Some of the best and most caring members of the support staff, such as veterinarians and technicians would, for personal and emotional reasons, find it impossible to function effectively in an atmosphere in which euthanasia is a general policy, and might resign. A facility that adopted such a policy could expect to lose some of its best employees.'' In other words, because chimpanzees and humans are so similar, those who work directly in chimpanzee research would find it untenable to continue using these animals if they were to be killed at the conclusion of the research.

    Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Mary Jane Colton, who will retire from my staff next week after 20 years of service to the people of New Hampshire as an employee of the U.S. Senate.  
   Mary Jane is known throughout the state for her compassion and success in helping New Hampshire citizens with problems they may be having with the federal government. As a chief caseworker on my staff, and as State Office Director for Senator Gordon Humphrey before me, she was critical in managing a constituent service operation that was second to none. Mary Jane helped many senior citizens, veterans, parents, and communities with problems they had with the federal government. From assisting a small community in its battle to receive its own zip code, to helping a local veteran get a long-awaited service medal, Mary Jane's legacy has had a great impact on the Granite State. 
   Mary Jane's compassion is also evident in her home and personal life. For many years she has cared for her elderly and infirm parents in her home, so they would not be separated by being placed in a state nursing home. 
   As Mary Jane leaves public service, I wish her the best in all of her future endeavors. I know she will be working full-time on her passion: Antiques. She will now be able to focus on her on-line antiques business--an enjoyable and hopefully lucrative second career. 
   Good luck, Mary Jane. Thank you for all that you have done for me and for the people of New Hampshire. It is an honor to represent you in the U.S. Senate.

    Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Eric Kingsley as he leaves his position as Executive Director of the New Hampshire Timberland Owners Association, NHTOA. 
   Eric's five year tenure at NHTOA has been marked by progress and success. The organization's programs and services have grown to meet the needs and concerns of its members, and have established a strong, stable foundation for the association's future. 
   Through the years, I have grown to value Eric's input on the many issues that significantly impact New Hampshire's timberlands. Eric has done an outstanding job of keeping me, and other policymakers, informed on the issues and has been a true leader in making sure the voice of NHTOA was heard throughout the country. 
   Of all of Eric's achievements at NHTOA, perhaps his most important success came this past spring. Eric helped lead the charge to defeat the Environmental Protection Agency's ill-considered proposal to treat some forestry activities as ``point source pollution'' under the Clean Water Act. These rules, known as the Total Maximum Daily Loads--TMDL Rule--would have required landowners, foresters, and homeowners to obtain federal permits before conducting a timber harvest and could have exposed them to lengthy bureaucratic delays and costly citizen lawsuits. 
   This past May, I held a field hearing in Whitefield, New Hampshire, on the TMDL rule. Eric was a persuasive witness, providing thoughtful and compelling testimony. He also organized hundreds of foresters to ensure their message was heard loud and clear in Washington. Thanks in large part to Eric's leadership on this issue, EPA withdrew the section of the TMDL rules that adversely affected forestry. 
   My staff and I have also worked closely with Eric on issues of importance to the White Mountain National Forest. When the President issued his ``roadless'' initiative stripping the people of New Hampshire and New England of the opportunity to have a meaningful voice in the management of their public lands, Eric was there to ensure we took this Administration to task. 
   Eric also rose to the occasion in the face of destruction from Mother Nature's wrath. The Ice Storm in January 1998 brought unprecedented challenges to New Hampshire's forest lands. Hundreds of thousands of acres were significantly damaged. Eric worked closely with me and my colleagues to help us turn this tragedy into an opportunity. Today, not only has the federal government provided resources to help recover from the storm, but we have a record number of acres under forest stewardship plans. 
   My staff and I have worked with Eric on a wide variety of other issues during his time at NHTOA. I have always been impressed with his dedication and the depth of knowledge he displayed on issues ranging from estate tax reform to rural economic development. Eric has always been an effective and honest advocate for the causes he holds close to his heart. I know he will be greatly missed by NHTOA's 1,500 members. 
   I wish Eric well in all his future endeavors, and am confident he will succeed in whatever pursuits he chooses. It is an honor to represent him in the Senate.

   Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I wish to make a couple of comments on the legislation that we just adopted. This has been a long time coming. It is a culmination of some--actually, the Everglades portion of this legislation took a year of work. We had a hearing in January at the Everglades. This is a very exciting time for those of us who have worked on this. I want to briefly give a quick overview of that and recognize a few people who have been involved. 
   This is a good bill. I am proud that we passed it. It is fiscally responsible. It recognizes our obligation to preserve one of the most important and endangered ecosystems in the Nation, if not the world: America's Everglades. 
   I thank the Senate conferees--Senators WARNER, VOINOVICH, BAUCUS, and GRAHAM--for their hard work and dedication. 
   I thank Chairman SHUSTER and the House conferees for their cooperation as well. 
   I am proud of this bill. This is not a bill that includes numerous unnecessary projects. The committee established some tough criteria, and we stuck to those criteria. 
   I am proud that the conference agreement on WRDA 2000 does not contain any environmental infrastructure projects. As those who requested such projects know, the committee has a longstanding opposition to including environmental infrastructure projects in WRDA. 
   Unlike what has happened in the past, the Senate conferees were able to hold firm, and the House accepted our position, for which we are grateful. 
   These types of projects, in my view, should be funded through the State revolving loan funds and not by the Army Corps of Engineers. 
   From the time this WRDA process began, the committee received requests to authorize more than 300 new projects. By holding firm to our criteria--the conference report to WRDA--we were able to authorize 30 new projects, 57 new feasibility studies, and a number of other project-related provisions. 
   As I said before, Senator BAUCUS and I are committed to examining next year the infrastructure issue, and other issues, relating to the operation and management of the Corps. This will include hearings on the Corps reform. 
   Let me talk specifically for a moment on the Everglades. There is an important element that separates this WRDA bill from all others and is what makes it so historic. 
   This bill includes our landmark Everglades bill, S. 2797, the Restoring the Everglades, an American Legacy Act. It has been clearly demonstrated that the Everglades are in great peril. Without acting now, we could lose what is left of the Everglades in this generation. But Congress is prepared to move forward and make good on a problem the Federal Government greatly contributed to causing. 
   It has been clearly demonstrated that the Everglades is a Federal responsibility. Lands owned or managed by the Federal Government--four national parks and 16 national wildlife refuges--compromise half of the remaining Everglades and will receive the benefits of restoration. 
   The State of Florida has stepped up to the plate thanks to Gov. Jeb Bush and his legislature in Florida, on a bipartisan basis. 
   The Everglades portion of WRDA has broad bipartisan support. Every major constituency involved in Everglades restoration supports our bill. These bipartisan and wide-ranging supporters include the Clinton administration, Florida Governor Jeb Bush, the Seminole Tribe of Florida; industry groups, including Florida Citrus Mutual; Florida Farm Bureau, the American Water Works Association; Florida Chamber of Commerce; Florida Fruit and Vegetable Association, Southeast Florida Utility Council, Gulf Citrus Growers Association, Florida Sugar Cane League, Florida Water Environmental Utility Council, Sugar Cane Growers Cooperative of Florida, Florida Fertilizer and Agri-chemical Association; and many environmental groups. To name just a few: 
   National Audubon, National Wildlife Federation, World Wildlife Fund, Center for Marine Conservation, Defenders of Wildlife, National Parks Conservation Association, the Everglades Foundation, the Everglades Trust, Audubon of Florida, 1000 Friends of Florida, Natural Resources Defense Council, Environmental Defense, and the Sierra Club. It is pretty unusual to bring the support of that many people on a major environmental bill to the Senate. I am proud to do it. 
   The Everglades bill is a great model for environmental policy development. It is cooperative. It is not prescriptive. It is bipartisan, and it is flexible and adaptive. We can change things. If we don't like what is going on, if something isn't working, we pull back and try something new. It establishes a partnership between the Federal Government and the State and many other private groups as well. 
   Our colleagues in the House suggested improvements to the Everglades piece, and we made those. While it didn't always look promising, we will see this bill become law before we go home, in the very near future, when the House passes it and the President signs it.  
   Last June, Bruce Babbitt called this ``the most important environmental legislation in a generation.'' I agree. It took a lot of courage to work this through. This passed the Senate 85-1. It has broad support. And it will pass overwhelmingly in the House very shortly. 
   It is almost dangerous to mention anyone because once you mention one, you are sure to omit some very important contributors. So with apologies to anybody I miss, I thank the late Senator John CHAFEE because he started this committee's efforts on the Everglades. I went to Florida in January. I told the folks in Florida this would be my highest priority and there wouldn't be much difference between John CHAFEE and Bob SMITH on saving the Everglades. I kept my word. 
   I thank the Senate conferees: subcommittee Chairman GEORGE VOINOVICH, Senator JOHN WARNER, ranking member Senator MAX BAUCUS, Senator BOB GRAHAM from Florida. 
   I also thank Senator CONNIE MACK and Governor Jeb Bush of Florida for their unrelenting efforts on the Everglades. Time and again we talked with them. We kept working with them throughout. 
   From the administration, Carol Browner has been very helpful throughout this affair. 
   I thank Mary Doyle and Peter Umhofer, Department of Interior; Joe Westphal, Michael Davis, and Jim Smythe from the Department of the Army; Gary Guzy from EPA; Stu Applebaum, Larry Prather, Gary Campbell and many others from the Corps of Engineers; and Bill Leary from CEQ. 
   From the State of Florida, I thank David Struhs, Leslie Palmer, and Ernie Barnett from the Florida Department of Environmental Protection; Kathy Copeland from the South Florida Water Management District. 
   I thank the Senate legislative counsel: Janine Johnson, Darcy Tomasallo, and Tim Trushel. 
   I thank the following staff members: from Senator GRAHAM's staff, Catharine Cyr Ranson and Kasey Gillette; Senator MACK's staff, C.K. Lee; Senator VOINOVICH's staff, Ellen Stein and Rich Worthington; Senator WARNER's staff, Ann Loomis; Senator BAUCUS' staff, Tom Sliter, Jo-Ellen Darcy, Peter Washburn, and Mike Evans; and my staff, Dave Conover, Ann Klee, Angie Giancarlo, Chelsea Henderson Maxwell, Stephanie Daigle, Tom Gibson, and Jeff Miles. 
   It was a great bipartisan effort. In spite of many roadblocks over the past several months, we were able to work this bill through in a bipartisan manner. I am truly grateful to everyone on both sides of the aisle for their tremendous support through a very difficult effort. There were literally hundreds of projects that the staff had to pore through, and we did it. 
   When we look back on our careers, when we leave here and look back and say, What did I accomplish? I think we will be very proud of the vote to save the Everglades. I guarantee it. It will be right up there at the top. Once those Everglades are safe, we can say, when the time came to stand up and make a difference, we did. 
   When I became chairman, I promised to make the Everglades my highest priority. I did. I also said we needed to look forward to the next generation, rather than the next election, in environmental policy. 
   We are now poised to send the President a conference report on WRDA that has the support of every major south Florida stakeholder, the State of Florida, and the administration. Restoration of the Everglades is not a partisan issue. We proved it. The effort has been bipartisan from the start. 
   I congratulate my colleagues for daring to take the risk to support this noble effort to save a national treasure. We need to view our efforts as our legacy to future generations, and this will be this Senate's legacy to future generations. 
   I yield the floor.

    Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Mr. Vaughan Taylor, a Jacksonville, North Carolina, attorney and his wife Linda for their heroic efforts to help save the lives of three of the crew members aboard the Frisco, a Virginia Beach fishing vessel. 
   Avid sailors, Vaughan and Linda are no strangers to the perils of the sea. As Vaughan navigated their 40 foot sailboat, Legacy, off the shores of North Carolina, he encountered a pile of floating wreckage. What he did not expect to find were three members of the Lynnhaven based scalloper, Frisco. It had been more than eight hours since a freighter had emerged from the fog, crushing the Frisco and leaving its crew of four clinging to debris in the dead of night. 
   Knowing that their boat was not only low on fuel in bad weather, but also dangerously testing the limit to his radio's frequency, Vaughan and Linda pushed ahead, determined to rescue these men. After radioing for help from anyone who could hear his plea, Vaughan sprang to action aboard the sailboat and began to haul the first member of the crew out of the water. Time was of the essence as he struggled to pull the other crew member from the water. Unable to fight against the weight of his water logged survival suit, Vaughan secured the survivor to the boat with a life preserver and tight line. 
   Using their years of experience at sea, Vaughan and his wife risked their own safety to save the lives of these men. By treating them for hypothermia, they were able to avoid a fatal tragedy for these men. Concentrating on getting the men the five miles back to shore safely, Vaughan hoisted the sails, kept in touch with the U.S. Coast Guard and began cruising at top speeds towards the Chesapeake Bay. Ending the heroic crusade with the credit of saving these lives, and only a mere .8 gallons of gas to spare, Vaughan Taylor serves as a positive role model for all those who venture into the high seas. 
   In all that Vaughan Taylor approaches, he gives unbridled efforts, and stops at nothing short of success. As has been the case in his work for U.S. personnel missing in action and their families, Vaughan continuously fights for the rights of others. He is also one of the most well-respected attorneys representing military personnel who need help, and his knowledge of the uniform code of military justice is second to none. It comes as no surprise that he would risk his own life with his wife by his side, to save his fellow man. I am proud to call Vaughan Taylor a close friend of mine, and I applaud his devotion to humanitarian causes. 
   Mr. President, also let me express my sympathy to the family of Captain Charlie Peel, the owner of the Frisco, who, unfortunately was never found. He was very much respected by all of the waterman in Lynnhaven Inlet, and was like a father to the others aboard the Frisco. I am sure he will be missed, and is in our thoughts and prayers.

   Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Estuaries and Clean Waters Act of 2000, S. 835. This is an important piece of legislation that will enhance our ability to protect the nation's valuable shoreline habitats, extend the cooperative partnership to preserve the Chesapeake Bay and Long Island Sound, and expand the effort to improve water quality in our nation's lakes. 
   I am proud to have been a cosponsor of this legislation and to have had the opportunity to work with our colleagues in the House of Representatives to ensure its passage this year. This legislation was of particular importance to our former colleague, and my friend, Senator John Chafee. He was the principal sponsor of this bill and a long time champion of estuaries. A year ago, under his chairmanship, the Committee on Environment and Public Works reported out S. 835 by voice vote. Since then, his son, Senator LINCOLN CHAFEE has continued the effort to get an estuaries bill signed into law. I am grateful for his leadership and am pleased to join him in that effort. With the Senate's passage of the Conference Report on S. 835 today, and similar action in the House, we will achieve that goal. I believe that is a fitting tribute to Senator John Chafee.

   Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on a disturbing Department of Defense (DOD) policy that prohibits the adoption of retired military working dogs (MWD).  
   The bill that I am speaking in support of today, H.R. 5314, will amend the law to allow a handler to adopt a retired military working dog. This legislation was constructed with the guidance and input of all the parties involved. While the Senate version provides more flexibility for the DOD than I would prefer, in the future the Congress will have the opportunity to evaluate the DOD's work when they report back to Congress on their progress in facilitating military dog adoptions. 
   In discussions with the Managers, my understanding is that this change is only intended to protect the Department of Defense's flexibility to retain animals it determines to be unsuitable for release. In no way is this intended to allow the Defense Department to retain animals that are suitable for release and are no longer needed. I believe it is important to clarify this point, but with that understanding, I am pleased to support this legislation. 
   The DOD's policy callously discards these highly trained and devoted animals after completion of their service to their country after 8-10 years of age, even if their handlers wish to adopt them. 
   Under the current law there is no happy retirement for these loyal canines. After their body is no longer able to sustain the workload of their mission, the future becomes bleak for these dogs. In a best case scenario, the dogs are sent back to Lackland Air Force Base, their original training school, where they are used to instruct their human counterparts to become handlers. 
   After they have served this final duty, they are kenneled for an undertermined amount of time and then put down. In some instances, military working dogs are caged as long as a year until they meet their final outcome. If no kennel space is available, the less fortunate are terminated directly upon their arrival to Lackland. 
   Without the loyal service of Military Working Dogs and their devotion to their handlers, countless American soldiers would have died or become casualties of war. 
   These dogs have abilities that our most advanced technology cannot match, rendering them priceless to the men and women serving in our military. 
   Of the 10,000 men who served with K-9 units during the Vietnam War more than 265 were Killed in Action. Of the 4,000 dogs that served, 281 were ``Officially'' listed as ``Killed in Action,'' but only 190 were returned home at the end of the war. 
   More than 500 dogs died on the battlefields of Vietnam. 
   Military Working Dogs not only helped win battles and save lives, but had an enormous impact upon the mental well-being of those humans that surrounded them in the severest of battle conditions. 
   It is clear that the DOD's policy does not work in the best interests of the dog handlers and the dogs. There is a distinctly strong bond between dog handlers and their dogs, who work, live and play together on a daily basis. 
   I believe that the military's policy unnecessarily severs a bond that has taken years to cultivate which can easily be alleviated by allowing dog handlers or other qualified people to care for these highly intelligent dogs after they can no longer serve their country. 
   The 1949 Federal Property and Administrative Services Act, enacted after World War II, reclassified military working dogs as equipment. According to the military mentality, any piece of equipment no longer operable, becomes a hardship to the unit and must be disposed. 
   In 1997, the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act was amended. The law was altered to permit federal dog handlers, such as those in the Drug Enforcement Administration, to adopt their aging K-9 partners after their service in law enforcement was completed. 
   The DOD's K-9 partners were the only federal canine group not included in the modification. Are these worthy canines any less deserving of peacefully living out the remainder of 
   their days than another federal working dogs? These dogs can be detrained of their aggressive responses and we have no reason to assume that they will not continue to obey their handlers. 
   The bill that I am speaking in support of today, H.R. 5315, will amend the law to allow a handler to adopt a retired military working dog. I believe that legislation was constructed with the best interest for all parties involved. 
   The decision to allow a handler to adopt their canine partner rests on the shoulders of those who know the dog best: the dog's last unit commander an the last unit veterinarian. Made on a case-by-case basis, the commander and veterinarian are obligated to give their consent before the adoption process can move forward. 
   Furthermore, H.R. 5314 provides an additional safeguard at the federal level. Upon receipt of the dog, the adopting handler waives all liability against the federal government. 
   H.R. 5314 will effectively accomplish two goals: it offers the DOD a solution to their dilemma of maintaining aging canines and lifts the restriction that prohibits the adoption of military working dogs. Former dog handlers, individuals with comparable experience, or law enforcement agencies will be able to provide a loving home for such deserving animals. 
   Through the passage of this legislation, not only will the military working dog be taken from a permanently caged status, but the dog will also be given the opportunity for a positive home environment. I know you will agree that after a lifetime of service, there can be no better reward for both handler and dog. 
   In closing, H.R. 5314 has been endorsed by the Humane Society of the United States, the American Veterinary Medical Association, the Society for Animal Protective Legislation, the Doris Day Animal Rights League, and The American Society for the prevention of Cruelty to Animals. This is a positive measure which is a win-win solution for dog, handler and the Department of Defense.

   Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. He offers his strong support for a change in the law that will allow the adoption of military working dogs. Former Marine Lt. Putney led a successful effort to build a cemetery and monument for the 25 dogs who died in the liberation of Guam in 1944, and I applaud his work to memorialize their contribution to preventing more loss of life during WWII. I also want to have printed for  the RECORD an article that provides some details of his military life and his accomplishments in recognizing the special canine contribution to our wartime successes.

    Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to and congratulate Framatome Connectors USA, of Manchester, on their nomination for this year's Secretary of Defense Employer Support Freedom Award. Their dedication to their employees who serve our country as part of the National Guard and Reserve is admirable and an example for other businesses. 
   Framatome, which manufactures electrical connectors, serves the needs of its five employees who serve in the National Guard and Reserve in several very important ways. First, their compensation package for all employees includes differential pay between civilian and military salaries. The package also includes medical, dental, and life insurance and 401(k) coverage for the duration of the employee's duty commitment. 
   Framatome has also established a policy that allows the employee on active duty to maintain his or her position with the company for as long as they required to remain on active duty. They believe the service of their employees to their country is important to our nation's defense, and anything they can do to make this service easier for their employees and their families is worth the effort. 
   Framatome put this generous plan into action recently when one of their employees was mobilized and sent to Bosnia during a Presidential call up. The company believed that when an employee is activated and pulled away from his or her family, a financial cushion should be available to help bridge the gap during the salary transition from civilian to military pay. They wanted to be sure the family of the reservist or guardsman or woman would have the financial resources they needed to continue as close to normal a life as possible while their loved one was away. 
   I applaud Framatome's effort to make Reserve or National Guard service easier for their employees, and the company's national recognition is certainly well-deserved. I know the employees who sacrifice so much to serve their country are extremely grateful for the chance to serve their country and work for such a compassionate, understanding company. It is an honor to serve all the people of Framatome, USA in the U.S. Senate.

    Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Captain John O'Grady, who recently completed a charity bicycle ride from Dayton, Ohio to Albuquerque, New Mexico to raise awareness and money for epilepsy charities. I am particularly proud of John because I had the pleasure of coaching this amazing young man during the 1973-74 baseball season at Kingswood Regional High School. 
   John's desire to make his ride is deeply personal. Just this year, after 23 years as a pilot with United Parcel Service and Airborne Express, John suffered a grand mal seizure while dining at an airport restaurant after a flight. A few weeks later, John was stricken again and diagnosed with epilepsy. This was a shocking blow for a man who flew planes and hot air balloons for so many years. 
   With his flying and driving privileges permanently taken away from him, John was forced to ride his bicycle everywhere he went. In fact, it was on a bike that he suffered the seizure that led to his epilepsy diagnosis, but John did not give up. Instead, he decided to try to use his experience to help others facing epilepsy and the charities that do such important work as we research and try to find a cure for this terrible disease. 
   Since John enjoys hot-air ballooning so much and could not bear to miss the annual International Balloon Fiesta, he decided to ride his bike the 1,600 miles from Dayton, Ohio to the event in Albuquerque. Along the way, John has raised more than $11,000 for several epilepsy charities and inspired others battling epilepsy. John's ride has given people with epilepsy a platform on which they can finally talk about their disease and the discrimination they face on a daily basis. That is perhaps the most important legacy of this magnificent achievement. 
   I want to congratulate John and wish him well in all he does. I am so proud of his courage and determination, and I  am honored to have known him. It is an honor to serve him in the U.S. Senate.

Eric has done an outstanding job of keeping me, and other policy makers, informed on the issues and has been a true leader in making sure the voice of NHTOA was heard throughout the country. 
   Of all of Eric's achievements at NHTOA, perhaps his most important success came this past spring. Eric helped lead the charge to defeat the Environmental Protection Agency's ill-considered proposal to treat some forestry activities as ``point source pollution'' under the Clean Water Act. These rules, known as Total Maximum Daily Loads--TMDL--would have required landowners, foresters, and homeowners to obtain federal permits before conducting a timber harvest and could have exposed them to lengthy bureaucratic delays and costly citizen lawsuits. 
   This past May, I held a field hearing in Whitefield, New Hampshire, on the TMDL issue, and not only did Eric successfully testify, but he organized hundreds of foresters to ensure their message was heard loud and clear in Washington. Thanks in large part to Eric's leadership on this issue, the EPA withdrew the section of the TMDL rules that adversely affected forestry. 
   My staff and I have also worked closely with Eric on issues of importance to the White Mountain National Forest. When the President issued his ``roadless'' initiative stripping the people of New Hampshire and New England with the opportunity to have a voice in the management of their public lands, Eric was there to ensure we took this measure to task. This time we were not successful, but we were very close to creating an exemption for the White Mountain National Forest from this heavy-handed proposal. 
   Eric also rose to the occasion in the face of destruction from Mother Nature's wrath. The Ice Storm in January 1998 brought unprecedented challenges to New Hampshire's forest lands. Hundreds of thousands of acres were significantly damaged. Eric worked closely with me and my colleagues to help us turn this tragedy into an opportunity. Today, not only has the federal government provided resources to help recover from the storm, but we have a record number of acres under forest stewardship plans. 
   My staff and I have worked with Eric on a wide variety of other issues during his time at NHTOA, and have always been impressed with his dedication and the depth of knowledge he displayed on issues ranging from estate tax reform to rural economic development. He has always been an effective and honest advocate for the causes he holds close to his heart, and I know he will be greatly missed by me and NHTOA's 1,500 members. 
   I wish Eric well in all his future endeavors, and am confident he will succeed in whatever pursuits he chooses. It is an honor to represent him in the U.S. Senate.

    Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Barbara Bedford of Etna, New Hampshire, on her fine performance at the Sydney Olympic Games. Her hard work, dedication and perseverance in making her Olympic dream a reality are an example for us all, and the people of New Hampshire are so very proud of her excellent performance. 
   Barbara, along with Jenny Thompson, was part of the gold-medal winning 4x100 medley relay that shattered the world record. It was so great to see Barbara fly through the water during the backstroke leg of the relay with her extremely patriotic red, white and blue-dyed hair. Her Olympic moment was years in the making, as she finally made her first Olympic team at the age of 27 after disappointments at the 1988, 1992 and 1996 Olympic Trials. After those heartbreaking defeats, Barbara could have easily given up her dream of making an Olympic team. However, with the help of her family and coach, Barbara did not retreat. Instead, she worked tirelessly toward her dream and was rewarded at this year's Olympic trials, where she placed first in the 50-meter backstroke. Barbara was able to keep her focus squarely on making the team this year and reach her goal, and this is an inspiration to all of us and proves once again that if we work hard, we can do just about anything. Her positive attitude and passion for her sport is so refreshing in an age when far too many athletes seem more interested in endorsements than their sport. 
   Once again, I want to congratulate Barbara on her accomplishments, and I wish her all the best in her future endeavors. It is an honor to represent her in the U.S. Senate.

    Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate Jenny Thompson of Dover, New Hampshire on her magnificent performance in the Sydney Olympic games. Her hard work and dedication through three Olympics is an example for all of us, and the people of New Hampshire are extremely proud of her success. 
   Jenny has done so much throughout her career to make the people of Dover and New Hampshire proud during her distinguished career. Whether it was breaking records at Stanford University or winning numerous competitions, Jenny has set the standard for women's swimming in the United States over the past decade. Jenny's Olympic teammates often cite her achievements as their inspiration for striving for excellence in the pool. 
   During the Sydney games, American swimmers brought home an impressive 33 of a possible 96 swimming medals, more than any other nation, and Jenny played a key role in that amazing success. She anchored two gold medal-winning relays and brought home her first individual Olympic medal, a bronze in the 100-meter freestyle. These blistering performances brought Jenny's individual Olympic medal count to nine, breaking Bonnie Blair's record for Olympic medals won by an American woman. Jenny performed beautifully under amazing pressure and against tough competition, and she will always be a champion in the eyes of the people of New Hampshire. 
   As Jenny ends her Olympic swimming career, I wish her all the best as she heads to medical school. I am confident her amazing work ethic and dedication to excellence will serve her well in her career in medicine and any other endeavor she pursues. It is truly an honor to represent Jenny in the U.S. Senate.

    Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the Knights of Columbus Number 6725 of Merrimack, New Hampshire as they gather to celebrate their 25th anniversary. This is a milestone of which they and the community of Merrimack should be extremely proud. 
   Throughout its quarter-century of existence, the Knights of Columbus has been a major presence in the Greater Merrimack Area. They have donated their time and energy to making their entire community a better place through public service. Whether it is manning a soup kitchen in Nashua, making annual donations to the New Hampshire Kidney Fund or recognizing Families of the Year, K of C 6725 has shown their dedication to their core values of family, Church, council, and community. 
   Furthermore, the K of C 6725 has worked to help those who do not have a voice, including the needy, the handicapped, and the unborn. They have donated countless items of clothing to people in need, worked tirelessly to help WMUR-TV with its annual presentation of the Jerry Lewis Telethon and purchased and maintained concession  trailers to help generate donations for many charitable organizations. Furthermore, they have sponsored an annual folk music night for Birthright, a group dedicated to protecting the unborn. 
   The K of C 6725 has shown dedication not only to its community and those in need but to the Catholic Church as well. They are a constant presence, holding an annual Palm Sunday Breakfast, an Easter celebration known as ``Birthday Party for Jesus,'' and setting up an Memorial Mass at Last Rest Cemetery in Merrimack. 
   In a world where far too few people take the time and opportunity to get involved in their churches and communities, the K of C No. 6725 is an example of the good things we can accomplish when we work together to help others. I congratulate them on this wonderful anniversary, and I wish them all the best as they continue their fantastic work. It is an honor to represent all of K of C 6725's members in the U.S. Senate.

   Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce the Upper Connecticut River Partnership Act of 2000. This legislation is a truly locally-led initiative. I believe it will result in great environmental benefits for the Connecticut River. 
   The Connecticut River forms the border to New Hampshire and Vermont and provides for a great deal of recreational and tourism opportunities for residents of both States. This legislation takes a major step forward in making sure this River continues to thrive as a treasured resource. 
   To understand just how significant this legislation is, I would like to share with my colleagues some history about the Connecticut River program. In 1987-88, New Hampshire and Vermont each created a commission to address environmental issues facing the Connecticut river valley. The commissions were established to coordinate water quality and various other environmental efforts along the Connecticut river valley. The two commissions came together in 1990 to form the 
   Connecticut River Joint Commission. The Joint Commission has no regulatory authority, but carries out cooperative education and advisory activities. 
   To further the local influence of the Commission, the Connecticut River Joint Commission established five advisory bi-state local river subcommittees comprised of representatives nominated by the governing body of their municipalities. These advisory groups developed a Connecticut River Corridor Management Plan. A major portion of the plan focuses on channeling federal funds to local communities to implement water quality programs, nonpoint source pollution controls and other environmental projects. Over the last ten years, the Connecticut River Joint Commission has fostered widespread participation and laid a strong foundation of community and citizen involvement. 
   As a Senator from New Hampshire and chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee, as well as someone who enjoys the beauty of the Connecticut river, I am proud to be the principal author and cosponsor of this locally led, voluntary effort that accomplishes real environmental progress. Too often we depend on bureaucratic federal regulatory programs to accomplish environmental success. This bill takes a different approach and one that I bet will achieve greater results on the ground. I hope that other communities and neighboring states will look at this model as an example of how to develop and implement true voluntary, on the ground, locally-led environmental programs. 
   I want to thank my colleague from New Hampshire, Senator GREGG, and the two distinguished Senators of Vermont, Senators LEAHY and JEFFORDS, for joining me as original cosponsors to this legislation. I look forward to working with them as we move this important legislation through the Senate.

   Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to applaud my colleague from Arizona, Senator MCCAIN, on his efforts to reauthorize the Atlantic Striped Bass Conservation Act in a package of oceans and fisheries legislation. I would also like to reaffirm the continued interest of the Committee on Environment and Public Works in this important legislation, over which our two committees have traditionally shared jurisdiction. As my colleague knows, this legislation is critically important to the northeast. 
   The populations of striped bass, which can be found all along the east coast, began to decline dramatically during the 1970s. In 1979, Congress responded by authorizing the Emergency Striped Bass Study as part of the Anadromous Fish Conservation Act. And in 1984, Congress enacted the Atlantic Striped Bass Conservation Act. This Act promotes a coordinated Federal-State partnership for striped bass management. The National Marine Fisheries Service and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service have been jointly responsible for working with State agencies to recover the fishery. Their efforts have been very successful. The commercial catch of striped bass peaked in 1998 at 19 million pounds, which is a dramatic increase from 1983 when the catch was 2.9 million pounds. 
   Historically, both the Environment and Public Works Committee, which I chair, and the Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee, which is chaired by Senator MCCAIN, have shared jurisdiction over the conservation of striped bass. Because both the Department of Commerce and the Department of the Interior are involved in the conservation of the fishery, legislation to reauthorize the 1984 Atlantic Striped Bass Conservation Act has always been of interest to both the Commerce Committee and the Environment and Public Works Committee. The most recent reauthorizing legislation, the Atlantic Striped Bass Conservation Act Amendments of 1997, was sequentially referred, by unanimous consent, to the Environment and Public Works Committee after the Commerce Committee ordered the bill to be reported. The Environment Committee then amended and reported the bill. It was signed into law on December 16, 1997. 
   In order to facilitate passage of reauthorizing legislation this year, I have agreed to the language being offered by Senator MCCAIN in H.R. 3417, as amended, the Pribilof Islands Transition Act, and will not request sequential referral. However, I want to reaffirm, with the agreement of my colleague, that this in no way affects the future jurisdiction of the Environment and Public Works Committee over the Atlantic Striped Bass Conservation Act.

    Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Reverend Monsignor Norman P. Bolduc, 48, Chancellor of the Diocese of Manchester, as New Hampshire mourns his tragic loss. 
   Monsignor Bolduc was ordained a priest in April 1979 after entering his religious training at Saint Thomas Seminary in Connecticut at the tender age of 13. As a Lieutenant Colonel, Monsignor Bolduc served as a Chaplain of the United States Air Force Reserves. He earned a master's in philosophy at the Catholic University of America in Washington, D.C., where he also earned his licentiate in Canon law. 
   Upon the recommendation of Bishop Odore Gendron, the seventh Bishop of Manchester, Pope John Paul II appointed Reverend Norman Bolduc as a Chaplain to His Holiness with the title of Monsignor in 1991. As Chancellor, Monsignor Bolduc was the third-ranking official in the diocese. He served as the bishop's Secretary for Pastoral Services and represented the bishop in Concord, New Hampshire, speaking on legislative matters. Reverend Edward Arsenault, Secretary for Administration of the diocese, noted Monsignor Bolduc's keen intellect and his ``great ability to explain and teach the church's teaching. He was a noted and gifted homilist.'' 
   Monsignor Bolduc was a talented baseball player, an avid golfer and had a passion for travel, often traveling to foreign lands. Many New Hampshire residents were fortunate to share his love of travel and accompanied him on pilgrimages to the Holy Land. Monsignor Bolduc was the eldest of seven children. He was the loving son of Norman Sr. and Cecile Bolduc of Laconia, New Hampshire. Monsignor Bolduc was a caring brother and devoted uncle to his eleven nieces and nephews. He enjoyed his family life and cherished the time he spent with all of them. 
   As Bishop John B. McCormack remembered his faithful and devoted colleague during the Funeral Mass celebrated at Saint Joseph's Cathedral he reminded us all that, ``It is clear that God does give, but God also takes away. It is clear whether we live or die, we are all the Lord's.'' Monsignor Bolduc honorably served our nation and the Roman Catholic Church and will be greatly missed by all those who were blessed by his presence and ministry. As Holy Scripture says in Psalm 116, ``Precious in the eyes of the Lord is the death of the faithful ones.'' May God bless Norman Sr., Cecile and Monsignor Boduc's siblings, nieces and nephews as they mourn the loss of their loved one. 
   I am honored to have served the Reverend Monsignor Norman Bolduc in the United States Senate. May God bless him and grant him eternal peace.

   Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. That is not much time to try to make my points here. But, look, this is one of those situations where you have an amendment, part of which I support and part of which I do not, which means I have to oppose it. 
   The clean air provisions that the Senator from California has outlined I can support. But it is unfortunate that I have to be here today, as the chairman of the committee, to choose to do something that this body chose to do 4 years ago in the Safe Drinking Water Act amendment.  
   It is worse that the only groups objecting to this language in VA-HUD are doing so because they stand to gain attorney's fees. I support the underlying managers' amendment by the Senator from Missouri. 
   We are going to see wasteful litigation here, and it is wrong. 
   To put this in context would take more time than I have, but we all agree the standard on this should be reviewed. This is not a discussion about the standard. The arsenic standard needs to be reviewed. But due to the complexity and science that was needed to develop the standard, the Congress very clearly dictated a timeframe. 
   Congress directed EPA to propose a rule on January 1, 2000, and to finalize the rule on January 1, 2001. They made it clear we wanted to provide one year from the date of publication of a draft rule to publication of a final rule. EPA cannot meet this requirement right now, and we need to get this science. We need to draw all this in. That is what the managers' amendment allows for. 
   To go to litigation now means we will waste millions of dollars of taxpayers' money on litigation for no reason, and they are still not going to be able to meet the standard in spite of the litigation. It is absolutely ridiculous. 
   I encourage my colleagues to support Senator BOND and the managers' amendment on this issue. 
   To reiterate, I come today to talk about Senator BOXER's amendment to the VA HUD appropriations bill. Unfortunately, Senator BOXER has put two issues into her amendment. I support one and strongly object to the other. Due to that strong objection I will vote against this amendment. 
   On the arsenic provision, it is very unfortunate that I need to come down here today to defend what this body chose to do four years ago in the Safe Drinking Water Act Amendments. It is even worse that the only groups objecting to this language in the VA HUD appropriation bill are doing so because they stand to gain attorneys fees. 
   The provision on arsenic in the VA-HUD Appropriations bill does one thing: preserves the original intent of the Safe Drinking Water Act Amendments of 1996. While Senator BOXER's amendment does one thing--promotes wasteful litigation. 
   To put this into context let me explain the history and reality of the situation. The Safe Drinking Water Act Amendments of 1996 clearly outlined a need to review the standard for arsenic. We all agree the standard needs to be reviewed. This is NOT a discussion about the standard. I repeat, the arsenic standard needs to be reviewed. 
   However, due to the complexity and science that was needed to develop the standard, we the Congress, very clearly dictated the time frame for developing this rule. Congress directed EPA to propose a rule on January 1, 2000 and to finalize the rule on January 1, 2001. 
   The Congress also made it very clear that we wanted to provide one year from date of publication of a draft rule to publication of a final rule. The reason was to allow sufficient time for public comment and EPA review to finalize this very complex issue. Thus, the Congress stated that the final rule should be published on January 1, 2001, one year after the publication of the draft rule. 
   Unfortunately, the EPA missed the January 1, 2000 deadline to publish the draft rule by six months. There may be very good reasons for why EPA missed this deadline, but the fact is EPA missed the statutory deadline for publication by six months. 
   EPA provided 90 days to comment on the proposed rule, however it is my understanding that EPA will be having an additional comment period on information that became available after the original draft rule was published. So basically, we are not done with the public comment period EPA, less than three months from the statutory deadline to publish the final rule has not even received all the public comments. 
   What do these dates and missed deadlines mean? They mean, and EPA will agree with me on this, that there is no way that EPA will meet the January 1, 2001 statutory deadline to publish this final rule. In fact, EPA will probably not publish the final rule until late spring. I support EPA taking the time to consider all the stakeholders comments and the very complex information they have received. I support the original intent of the Safe Drinking Water Act Amendments to provide one year to finalize this rule. Especially, in light of the controversy this rule has brought on by a host of very credible institutions like the EPA Science Advisory Board that questions the EPA proposal. But that is not what we are down here today to talk about. 
   What happens unfortunately, is a host of groups will sue EPA on January 2, 2001 for not publishing the final rule. Everyone knows that EPA will miss this deadline, YET, these organizations will waste everyone's time and tax payer's money by bringing an unnecessary lawsuit. So what am I down here to discuss today? I am here to discuss: unnecessary attorney's fees, waste of tax payer dollars, and place a burden on the judicial branch. 
   To avoid those three issues, I support the arsenic provision in the VA-HUD Appropriations Bill. This provision would extend the deadline for finalization of the arsenic rule to no later than June 
   22, 2001. This provides the EPA one year to finalize the rule--exactly the same time frame as the Safe Drinking Water Act Amendments. 
   Why is this needed? Because this is a complex rule and the Congress realized that when they required EPA to take one year to finalize the rule. But just as important: we the Congress can make sure tax payers dollars are not wastefully spent on unnecessary judicial proceeding and attorney's fees. 
   Our constituents should not have to pay the price for the EPA's failure to follow the mandates of the Safe Drinking Water Amendments of 1996. This extension will have no impact on human health because it is completely consistent with EPA's time frame for finalizing the rule. 
   I am sure that is why the White House and the Council on Environmental Quality is not opposing this language. 
   Senator BOXER's amendment does absolutely nothing to protect human health. It only protects those environmental groups that want litigation will benefit. This is unfortunate because the litigation will produce the exact same outcome as this provision. However the litigation has consequences, it will produce: unnecessary attorneys fees, an unnecessary burden on the judiciary, an unnecessary burden on the EPA, and taxpayer dollars funding all of this. I cannot stand here and encourage unnecessary litigation. But I can proudly support the original intent of the Safe Drinking Water Act and allow EPA to take appropriate time to consider all the comments and information in proposing a final rule. 
   Now switching to the Clean Air Act issue. The motion to strike also contains language that touches on another one of those complicated Clean Air Act issues. I believe that this is exactly the type of thing that must be addressed by the committee of jurisdiction rather than through a rider. 
   Last year the Environment and Public Works Committee first addressed the issue of what limits were needed on the implementation of these air quality standards while the court was reviewing them. At that time, the committee was considering a bill to improve the transportation conformity provisions of the Clean Air Act. Senator INHOFE offered an amendment to deal with this matter and the amendment was adopted. 
   Even as the INHOFE language was accepted, there was discussion regarding how it might be improved prior to floor consideration. During the past few months, members of the Environment and Public Works Committee, and especially Senator INHOFE and Senator BAUCUS, worked hard to develop language that is now broadly supported--and included in this bill. The bill also contains controversial language on the same issue that came from a House appropriations bill and was not considered by the Environment and Public Works Committee. In fact, no authorizing committee in either body dealt with this language. 
   Mr. President, it seems to me that we are borrowing trouble by taking the House language because the language Senator INHOFE proposed speaks to precisely the same problem as the language Senator BOXER seeks to strike. We do not need both. 
   Let me briefly address the substance of the issue. As many Members know, the Supreme Court is currently reviewing the EPA's recently established air  quality standards for smog and soot, ozone and particulate matter. 
   At the same time, implementation of the standards is proceeding. The EPA is required by law to identify areas that violate the standards, even though the court might throw the standards out. More importantly, designating areas as violating the standards triggers automatic requirements under the Clean Air Act. These include restrictions on highway construction and expanding or building new facilities that would emit air pollutants. 
   The problem we are trying to solve is that these requirements may be triggered and then the standards could be overturned, leading to planning chaos for many states. Senator INHOFE's language would delay the effective date of the automatic requirements under the Clean Air Act to allow time for the Supreme Court to act. The language from the House bill that Senator BOXER seeks to strike would bar the use of funds for making determinations about what areas would violate the standards; thus preventing the triggering of the automatic Clean Air Act requirements. 
   So we have two ways of skinning the same cat. Senator INHOFE's approach has bipartisan support and is the work product of members of this body's authorizing committee. The House language is controversial and has not received consideration from any authorizing committee. 
   The House language is controversial because many people believe that the air data collected by the states should be analyzed by the EPA and made public no matter what happens to the standards in the courts. Also, the limit on the use of funds could delay implementation in the event that the Court upholds the standards. 
   I believe that the Senate should recognize and reward the effort that Senator INHOFE has made to eliminate unnecessary conflict over this issue. I support the language in the bill developed by the Senator from Oklahoma. 
   If the motion by the Senator from California to strike the House language was not attached to the arsenic issue, I would support the Senator in her motion, and I would encourage the entire Senate to do the same. Because the arsenic matter is the overriding concern for me, I must oppose the motion.

   Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I would like to discuss with the distinguished chair of the Appropriations Subcommittee on VA, HUD and Independent Agencies the role of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) in the Section 404 permitting process. FEMA and the Section 404 wetlands permitting program are subject to the authorization jurisdiction of the committee I chair, the Senate Environment and public Works Committee, and receive their funding through this appropriations bill.

   Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. As the Senator knows, the Federal Emergency Management Agency was not established with the intent that it become a regulatory agency. Rather, the principal mission of the Agency is to administer relief to areas of our nation that are suffering from catastrophic events such as floods or hurricanes. The Section 404 permitting program under the Clean Water Act, as the Senator also knows well, is a complicated and controversial federal regulatory program administered primarily by the Army Corps of Engineers. However, the Environmental Protection Agency also has a major role in the implementation of the program that includes the ability to veto decisions by the Corps to issue specific Section 404 permits. I believe that two agencies implementing a federal regulatory program is quite enough.

   Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. I have two specific concerns regarding FEMA and the Section 404 program. First, I understand that a new rule on nationwide permits was issued by the Corps effective June 7, 2000. Nationwide permits are a streamlined permitting process that apply to minor wetlands disturbances that have a minimal impact on the nation's wetlands. These permits are very important to the operation of the program since as many as 85 percent of the permits issued by the Corps each year are nationwide permits. One aspect of this new rule makes it very difficult to obtain nationwide permits in the one hundred year floodplain. According to the Corps, 53 percent of the floodplain is subject to the jurisdiction of the Section 404 program. The rule provides that certain nationwide permits can be obtained in a portion of the hundred year floodplain if approved by FEMA or the local flood control agency. 
   Congress has not authorized a role for FEMA in the Section 404 permitting process. Is it your understanding that this new rule will be implemented in such a fashion that FEMA will not become a regulatory agency with respect to Section 404 nationwide permits?

   Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. I thank the Senator for his attention to my concerns about FEMA's role in the 404 program. I would also call the Committee's attention to the related problem of the issuance of individual 404 permits in the 100 year floodplain. I believe it is important to emphasize that, just as in the case of nationwide permits. FEMA does not have a regulatory role in the issuance of individual permits under Section 404. Whether or not there should be such a policy in the hundred year floodplain is an issue that Congress may wish to address in the future. However, for now, I believe that it must be restated that FEMA has not been authorized a decisional role in whether or not an individual Section 404 permit should be issued nor the conditions of a Section 404 permit. We do not need a third federal agency with a decisional role in the Section 404 permitting program. Obviously, FEMA may comment on applications for Section 404 permits, as may any citizen or federal agency, but that opportunity must not be transformed into a decisional role. Does the Senator agree with me on this point? Is it the Senator's understanding that the funds in this bill will not be used by FEMA to play a decisional role in the issuance of individual Section 404 permits in the hundred year floodplain?

   Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I want to call the Senate's attention to a program that the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is implementing in a way that I believe is inconsistent with the original intent of Congress. The Endocrine Disruptor Screening Program, EDSP, was created by EPA to implement language in the Food Quality Protection Act, FQPA, and Safe Drinking Water Act Amendments of 1996 requiring that EPA, and I quote, ``develop a screening program, using appropriate validated test systems and other scientifically relevant information, to determine whether certain substances may have an effect in humans that is similar to an effect produced by a naturally occurring estrogen, or other such endocrine effect .....'' The Program was required to be implemented by August 1, 1999. 
   This program has been plagued by a lack of public participation from key constituencies, an expansive interpretation of the Congressional mandate, questionable decisions as to the validation of testing protocols, and neglect of money appropriated for the development of non-animal tests. 
   In October 1996 EPA formed the Endocrine Disruptor Screening and Testing Advisory Committee, EDSTAC, under the Federal Advisory Committee Act to advise EPA on risk assessment techniques for endocrine disrupting chemicals. EDSTAC included scientists and representatives from EPA and other government agencies, industry, national environmental groups, worker protection groups, environmental justice groups, and research scientists. More recently, EPA set up the Endocrine Disruptor Standardization and Validation Task Force to perform the work needed to develop, standardize, and validate the screens and tests proposed for the Program. However, one very important constituency was not included in either of these groups--in fact they were excluded--they are the animal welfare groups. Traditionally, these groups have been left out of the consultation process of EPA regarding the newly initiated chemical testing programs. Any program that includes testing of chemicals for toxicity or other effects involves the use of animals in such testing, however, the groups that advocate for animal welfare were excluded from providing early input in the Endocrine Disruptor Screening Program. 
   As Chairman of the committee with jurisdiction over the testing and handling of toxic chemicals, the Committee on Environment and Public Works, I am particularly concerned about how this program is being administered. In addition to the lack of public input, a major concern deals with the large number of animals used in testing that could occur as a result of EPA's implementation plan for this program. On August 25, 2000, EPA published a report to Congress on the Endocrine Disruptor Screening Program that sets forth the findings, recommendations and further actions of EPA in implementing the EDSP. The implementation plan that EPA has come up with is broader than the plain language of the FQPA. While obtaining better data on endocrine disruptors is certainly a worthy goal, I am concerned about the expansion of this congressionally mandated program. The broad interpretation by the EPA of the chemicals to test and the method of validation calls into question whether this program will be implemented in a manner consistent with the intent of Congress. All of these expanded interpretations increase the number of test animals needed to implement the program. 
   The law specifically states that EPA is to ``use appropriately validated tests.'' EPA has interpreted the law to mean that animal tests can be validated through the EPA's own Science Advisory Board, however, non-animal tests must be run through a more rigorous Interagency Coordinating Committee for the Validation of Alternative Methods (ICCVAM) process. ICCVAM was created as a standing committee in 1997 and is composed of representatives of fifteen Federal regulatory or research agencies that regulate the use of animals in toxicology testing; EPA is a co-chair of ICCVAM. The ICCVAM process with input from the EPA Science Advisory Board reviews can ensure that the tests, animal or non-animal, will produce good results. I believe all tests should be assessed for validation by ICCVAM. 
   My comments up until now have been critical of the plan that EPA has put forth for future implementation of the Endocrine Disruptor Screening Program. Last year, Congress appropriated $5 million for the development and implementation of the test methods including the high throughput pre-screen, a non-animal screening process. After spending $70,000, the Agency has stopped working to integrate the high throughput pre-screen into the Endocrine Disruptor Screening Program. Although this specific example concerns me, it is only one example of the general disinterest of EPA in integrating non-animal tests into the program. I  urge the EPA's Office of Research and Development to apportion funds to prioritize research, development and validation of non-animal tests.

   Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I am proud to serve on the Senate Armed Services Committee that developed the Senate version of the National Defense Authorization bill for fiscal year 2001. I am equally proud to have served as a Conferee to resolve differences between our bill and the one that passed the House of Representatives. 
   This bill is important to our men and women who serve this Nation every day. As the explosion today in Yemen demonstrates, America's great military men and women put their lives on the line for us every day. That sacrifice demands our attention and our support. 
   This bill is another step to help us pull the U.S. military out of the nosedive created by this Administration. The number of deployments the Clinton/Gore administration committed us to has forced the military to use its limited funds for operations vice maintaining our forces. Readiness is at an all-time low. We are cannibalizing parts of our forces to keep the other parts running. That is wrong. Our men and women in uniform deserve better. This bill is a step in the right direction, but we still need more. I will fight for more again next year. 
   My colleagues on the Armed Services Committee have lauded the benefits of this bill, so I will not repeat them all here. However, several points I feel are very important to note for the American people. 
   This bill authorizes $309.9 billion in military spending, $4.6 billion above the President's budget request. It authorizes $63.2 billion for procurement, $2.6 billion above the President's budget request. It authorizes $38.9 billion for research and development, $1.1 billion above the President's budget request. 
   This bill provides a decent pay raise--3.7 percent. It approves permanent comprehensive health care benefits for military retirees and benefits for military families. It also provides pharmacy benefits. When our military men and women put their lives on the line for our freedom, we owe them this commitment. 
   This bill is a start, but we must do better. We need to expand our missile defense capabilities to fully leverage land, sea, air, and space options. Our ship-building rate is below that needed to sustain our aging naval force in the long term. We also need to be investing in space power programs. For 8 years, this Administration has ignored programs like the Kinetic Energy Anti-Satellite system and the military space plane. 
   I also want to mention two important items which I fought vigorously for in this Bill that my colleagues have not mentioned. 
   First, this bill attempts to right a grievous wrong that was committed over 50 years ago when Captain Charles Butler McVay III was tried and convicted--unjustly I believe--for the sinking of his ship, the U.S.S. Indianapolis, shortly before the end of the Second World War. This remains the greatest sea disaster in the history of the U.S. Navy. 880 of the 1,197 men aboard perished. Many of those who survived the actual sinking were left without lifeboats, food, or water and faced shark attacks for 4 days and 5 nights. 
   This legislation recognizes Captain McVay's lack of culpability for the tragic loss of the ship, urges a correction of his military record to reflect his exoneration, and prompts the Navy to award a Navy Unit Commendation to the U.S.S. Indianapolis and her final crew. 
   Captain McVay was not given intelligence reports about Japanese submarine activity in the ship's path; he was not granted an escort to help protect his ship; and he had taken prudent steps to protect the vessel. Not all of this information was made available to the court-martial board. Several hundred U.S. ships were lost in combat to enemy action during World War II, yet only Captain McVay was subjected to a court-martial. 
   This language does not erase the conviction of Captain McVay from his record. We in Congress do not have the authority to do that. It must remain on his record as a stain upon the conscience of the Navy until this or some future President sees fit to order that it be expunged. This resolution does, however, represent acknowledgment from one branch of the Federal Government he served so capably that Captain  McVay's conviction was morally wrong and that he should no longer be viewed by the American people as responsible for the horrible tragedy which haunted him to the end of his life. 
   Second, this bill closes a loop hole in our national security regarding the granting of security clearances. Everyday, we entrust our national secrets to individuals to develop weapon systems, intelligence capabilities, war plans, and the like to defend this nation in war and peace. The American people demand these individuals be of the highest integrity. Yet, it came to my attention that we have not been maintaining that standard. Persons with criminal track records have been granted security clearances. We have even granted clearances to murderers. 
   The addition I fought for in this bill is simple. It would prevent the Department of Defense from granting security clearances to those who have been convicted in a court of a crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year. 
   As I have said, this bill will strengthen our military. It is a step in the right direction, but we are not finished. I urge my colleagues to approve the conference report.

   Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Yes. By approving section 132, we intend to elevate the role of the head of the Federal Aid program, as part of our overall effort, in this bill, to give the program the full attention that it deserves. We do not intend, however, to mandate a change in the general Fish and Wildlife Service's administrative structure. No case has been made for such a change, and it could potentially be counterproductive.

   Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. As you know, under current law, States are authorized to use one half of the revenue collected from taxes on handguns and archery equipment for hunter education and the development of target ranges. Under our provision, any State that is fully utilizing the authorized amount for these purposes can spend the grant money on any project that is authorized in the Pittman-Robertson Act. States that are spending less than the authorized amount have to use the grant funds for hunter education and range development until they utilize the amount authorized by the Pittman-Robertson Act for those purposes. The States can then spend any remaining funds above the authorized level on hunter education, range development or any other project that is authorized in Pittman-Robertson. For example, say New Hampshire is authorized to use $270 thousand of Pittman-Robertson funds on hunter education and range development but is only spending $266 thousand. New Hampshire would be then required to spend $4 thousand of its grant money on hunter education and range development. After that New Hampshire could use any remaining amount on any project that is consistent with the purposes of the Pittman-Robertson Act.

   Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to encourage my colleagues to support final passage of H.R. 3671, the Fish and Wildlife Programs Improvement Act. I believe that this bill will enhance State wildlife conservation programs across the country. I am proud to be a cosponsor of this important legislation. 
   The Pittman-Robertson Act and the Wallop-Breaux Act created user-pay benefit trust funds. Together, these programs are called the Sport Fish and Wildlife Restoration Programs and are known more generally as the Federal Aid Program. The States are primarily responsible for managing the Federal Aid Program. They identify eligible projects and then pay for the projects up front. The projects must be directly related to old and sport fish restoration efforts. Projects that are eligible for funding through the Pittman-Robertson and Wallop Breaux Programs include: acquisition and improvement of wildlife habitat; hunter education; wildlife population surveys; construction of facilities to improve public access; management of wildlife areas fish stocking, boating and fishing access; and facility development and maintenance. States are reimbursed for up to 75 percent of the total cost of each project from the Federal Aid funds. 
   I am offering a manager's amendment in the nature of a substitute that makes several important changes to the Federal Aid bill that reported by the Committee on Environment and Public Works. I believe that in adopting these changes, we will not only improve the bill, but will also ensure that this important legislation is signed into law this year. In addition, the manager's package includes the National Fish and Wildlife Refuge System Centennial bill, and reauthorized the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation. This package has been negotiated with the House Committee on Natural Resources. 
   Earlier this year, the Environment and Public Works Subcommittee on Fisheries, Wildlife and Water held a hearing on the Fish and Wildlife Service's Administration of the Wallop-Breaux and Pittman-Robertson Acts and what we discovered was shocking. 
   The Pittman-Robertson and Wallop-Breaux Restoration Funds were created over 50 years ago. Congress intended to allow sportsmen to contribute to the preservation and enhancement of the fields, streams and great outdoors that they enjoy so much. These two programs together authorize the collection of excise taxes from the manufacturers and importers of hunting and fishing equipment. Congress entrusted the Fish and Wildlife Service, through the Federal Aid Division, with the responsibility of managing these programs and distributing the funds to the States. Unfortunately, a report issued by the General Accounting Office indicates that the Fish and Wildlife Service has violated that trust. 
   These are significant wildlife programs, with substantial resources to fund them. Last year alone, sportsmen contributed over $430 million to the  programs. Every time a hunter buys a gun, or an angler buys a rod, they know a portion of the cost is supposed to be given to the States to fund conservation projects, such as fish stocking or habitat restoration. I say ``supposed to'' because GAO recently found that not all of the money the States are entitled to is, in fact, being given to them. Both the Wallop-Breaux and Pittman-Robertson Acts allowed the Fish and Wildlife Service to reserve a percentage of the mounts received from the excise tax. However, the Acts also require that any excess amounts not needed for administration of the programs be distributed among the States. Unfortunately, for years, the Fish and Wildlife Service just ignored that requirement and shortchanged the States. 
   The problems that plague these programs are numerous. The Service created several grant programs which they had, at best, questionable authority to do. Initially, they failed to account for millions of dollars. They ignored their own established guidelines for approving travel. This is unacceptable behavior. 
   I believe that the manager's amendment will put an end to the mismanagement that plagues the programs today. At the same time, it will institute a more effective way in which to manage these programs in the future. We address the problems that were identified in the GAO report and in the hearing by making four fundamental changes to the wildlife restoration and sport fish programs. These changes are intended to enhance accountability within the Fish and Wildlife Service with respect to the administration of the Federal Aid Program; to provide further clarity regarding the use of administrative funds; to encourage safe hunting through education; and to provide additional flexibility to the States for regional conservation projects. 
   First, the manager's amendment authorizes $18 million in fiscal years 2001 and 2002, and $16.4 million in fiscal year 2003 and subsequent years, with an increase relative to the Consumer Price Index for the Secretary of the Interior to administer both the Pittman-Robertson and Wallop-Breaux Programs. I felt that it was extremely important for the Secretary to have enough resources to administer the program effectively, but not so much money that there would be an incentive to waste it needlessly. Although I am confident that the program can run effectively on the authorized amount, it is extremely important to revisit this issue in several years. This is particularly important because the administration was unable to justify many of its costs. The manager's amendment requires a biennial audit that will give the Committee additional information on whether or not the authorized amount needs to be adjusted. 
   Second, the manager's amendment enumerates legitimate administrative costs and limits the use of Federal Aid funds to those expenses. The General Accounting Office investigation found that the Fish and Wildlife Service, among other things, failed to maintain adequate controls over funds, expenditures, and grants, and used administrative funds inconsistently among different FWS regional offices. By specifically listing what constitutes appropriate administrative costs, these problems should not arise in the future. 
   Third, the manager's amendment creates a new Firearm and Bow Hunter Education and Safety Grant Program authorized at $7.5 million in fiscal years 2001 and 2002, and $8 million in fiscal year 2003 and every year thereafter. The authorized funds would be provided to the States in the form of direct grants. Under current law, States are authorized to use half of the revenue collected from taxes on handguns and archery equipment for hunter education and the development of target ranges. This new provision would allow any State that is fully utilizing the authorized amount for these purposes to spend the grant money on any project that is authorized in the Pittman-Robertson Act. States that are spending less than the authorized amount would be required to use the grant funds for hunter education and range development until they utilize the amount authorized by the Pittman-Robertson Act for those purposes. At that point, the States can spend any remaining funds above the authorized level on hunter education, range development or any other project that is authorized in Pittman-Robertson. 
   In my home State of New Hampshire, for example, the Department of Fish and Game is authorized to use $270 thousand of Pittman-Robertson funds on hunter education and range development, but is currently only spending $266 thousand. Under this bill, New Hampshire would be required to spend $4 thousand of its grant money on hunter education and range development; after that, however, the State would have the discretion to spend the remaining amount on any project that is consistent with the purposes of the Pittman-Robertson Act. This strikes a good balance between the interests of the hunting community that wanted states to spend the 50 percent level authorized under the law, and the States who want discretion to spend Pittman-Robertson funds to meet their priorities, both education and conservation programs. 
   Finally, the manager's amendment authorizes a new Multistate Conservation Grant Program at $6 million to allow for Federal Aid funds to be used for regional projects. The Multistate Grant program requires the International Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies International to submit a list to the Secretary of the Interior recommending projects that should receive funding. The bill as reported out of Committee prohibited the International from considering any grant submitted by an organization that opposes hunting or fishing. Shortly before the markup, we realized this approach raised First Amendment concerns, and I promised to work with interested parties to resolve this problem. The manager's amendment prohibits any grant funds from supporting, in whole or in part, any activity that promotes opposition to hunting and fishing. Any organization can apply for a grant but it can't use these funds in any activity that targets the individuals who pay the excise tax. This is a common sense solution that protects the first amendment rights of all, without penalizing sportsmen who help fund the programs. 
   This manager's amendment also reauthorizes the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation Establishment Act of 1984. The manager's amendment makes important changes in the Foundation's charter, changes that I believe will allow the Foundation to build on its fine record of providing funding for the conservation of our nation's fish, wildlife and plant resources. 
   The National Fish and Wildlife Foundation was established in 1984 to bring together diverse groups to engage in conservation projects across America and, in some cases, around the world. Since its inception, the Foundation has made more than 3,400 grants totaling over $435 million. This is an impressive record of accomplishment. The Foundation has pioneered some notable conservation programs, including implementing the North American Waterfowl Management plan, Partners in Flight for neotropical birds, Bring Back the Natives Program, the Exxon Save the Tiger Fund, and the establishment of the Conservation Plan for Sterling Forest in New York and New Jersey, to name just a few. 
   The Foundation has funded these programs by raising private 
   funds to match federal appropriations on at least a 2 to 1 basis. During this time of fiscal constraint, this is an impressive record of leveraging federal dollars. Moreover, all of the Foundation's operating costs are covered by separate private sources, which means that Federal and private dollars given for conservation are spent only on conservation projects. 
   The National Fish and Wildlife Foundation has more than fulfilled the hopes of its original sponsors. It has helped to implement solutions to some difficult natural resource problems and is becoming widely recognized for its innovative approach to solving environmental problems. For example, when Atlantic salmon neared extinction in the U.S. due to overharvest in Greenland, the Foundation and its partners bought Greenland Salmon quotas. I, like many others in Congress, want the Foundation to continue its important conservation efforts. 
   This legislation is quite simple. The manager's amendment would expand the Foundation's governing Board of Directors from 15 members to 25 members. This will allow a greater number  of individuals with a strong interest in conservation to actively participate in, and contribute to, the Foundation's activities. Also, it would authorize appropriations to the Fish and Wildlife Service and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration through 2003. 
   Finally, the manager's amendment would authorize the ``National Wildlife Refuge System Centennial Commemoration Act of 2000.'' This landmark provision commemorates the centennial of the first national wildlife refuge in the United States, established on March 14, 1903, by a great man and conservationist, President Theodore Roosevelt. By setting aside land at Indian River Lagoon on Pelican Island, Florida as a haven for birds, President Roosevelt began a conservation legacy known as the National Wildlife Refuge System. 
   Today, the National Wildlife Refuge System has evolved into the most comprehensive system of lands devoted to wildlife protection and management in the world--spanning nearly 93 million acres across the United States and its territories. By placing special emphasis on conservation, our nation's network of refuges ensures the continued protection of our wildlife resources, including threatened and endangered species, and land areas with significant wildlife-oriented recreational, historical and cultural value. 
   Currently, there are more than 500 refuges in the United States and its territories, providing important habitat for 700 bird species, 220 mammal species, 250 species of amphibians and reptiles, and over 200 fish species. The Refuge System also hosts some of our country's premiere fisheries, and serves a vital role in the protection of threatened and endangered species by preserving their critical habitats. 
   Approximately 98 percent of the Refuge System land is open to the public. Each year, the System attracts more than 34 million visitors to participate in a variety of recreational activities that include observing and photographing wildlife, fishing, hunting and taking part in system-sponsored educational programs. By providing the public with an opportunity to participate in these activities, refuges promote a sense of appreciation for the natural wonders of this nation and emphasize our important role as stewards of these lands. 
   The manager's amendment commemorates the Refuge System by creating a Commission that will oversee the Centennial anniversary and promote public awareness and understanding of the importance of refuges to our nation. Additionally, the manger's amendment directs the Fish and Wildlife Service to prepare a long-term plan for the Refuge System that will enable the Service to look ahead and determine the future needs and priorities of the system network. 
   Mr. President, I strongly urge my colleagues to support adoption of this bill.

   Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, it is with great regret that I rise today to oppose the conference report to the Transportation appropriations bill. 
   I want to begin by praising my colleagues on the Committee on Appropriations who have worked so hard on this bill and conference report. I know they have faced many difficult issues, competing demands for limited resources, and the pressure of time as this Congress winds down. And there are many good provisions in this bill, including several that will benefit my home State of New Hampshire. 
   These include: $2 million of the extension of the Commuter Rail line from Boston to Lowell, Massachusetts into Nashua, New Hampshire; A provision that designates the I-93 project as a national model for implementation of environmental streamlining; $1.5 million for improvements to U.S. Route 2 in New Hampshire; $500,000 for the Concord 20/20 Vision project; $250,000 for the Bedford, New Hampshire Route 101 Corridor Study and Improvements; $200,000 for a Feasibility Study of a High Speed Rail Corridor from Boston, MA to Burlington, VT, through New Hampshire; $10 million nationally for the Historic Covered Bridge Program, under which N.H. communities can apply for funds to repair covered bridges; $12 million for construction of the Broad Street Parkway in Nashua, NH; Over $137 million to the New Hampshire Department of Transportation under the states' federal highway allocation authorized by the 1998 Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century (TEA-21). 
   But this bill contains several objectionable departures from TEA-21, which are under the clear jurisdiction of the Environment and Public Works Committee, the authorizing committee which I chair. 
   First, I am concerned about the so-called .08 blood alcohol content (BAC) provision to mandate a nationwide standard for state drunk driving laws by threatening sanctions on highway  funding. In TEA-21 we specifically rejected this approach in favor of incentives to encourage stronger drunk driving laws. Congress worked hard to reach this compromise during TEA-21 so that states could address highway safety and drunk driving in a variety of ways, without the federal government forcing them to focus on whether their laws contain .08 as the magic number. This heavy handed approach that was pushed through on an appropriations bill threatens to take away highway funds from 32 states. I will carry my strong opposition to funding sanctions into the next transportation reauthorization bill, and I hope we have seen the last of this kind of federal intervention. 
   On this issue of funding, in TEA-21 we guaranteed collections into the Highway Trust Fund would be redistributed to the states and to DOT discretionary programs. When these collections are above TEA-21 estimates, the additional funds, called RABA funds, are distributed according to TEA-21. 
   This bill makes several major and minor adjustments to the RABA funds--including failing to provide for some programs, and diverting these funds to special projects. 
   On top of this, the bill also takes an extra $1.4 billion in funds from the Highway Trust fund to go to special projects. 
   This money is not authorized to be spent in TEA-21. This money comes out of Highway Trust Fund balances. This is like the balance in your checkbook that is there to pay outstanding bills and checks that are waiting to clear. 
   In TEA-21 we crafted careful compromises over how Highway Trust Fund dollars are spent and distributed. This bill ignores our work and includes page after page of earmarks for unauthorized projects. 
   We have not been consulted on the viability of these projects, we have no assurance that these projects are important, whether they have met environmental clearances, or whether the funds provided are based on engineering estimates for these projects. 
   The Highway Trust Fund money is to be distributed to states where they have local control over which projects are funded and when. This bill attempts to circumvent this process with funding earmarks. 
   I object to this intrusion into the Highway Trust Fund. It is unwise to pick and choose highway projects to insert in the appropriations bill. 
   As I stated at the beginning, there are many good provisions in this Transportation conference report. I applaud the work that my colleagues have done and appreciate the support they have given to important New Hampshire projects. Therefore, it is with great reluctance that I oppose the conference report.

   Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, it is with great regret that I rise today to oppose the Conference Report to the Interior Appropriations bill. 
   I want to begin by praising my colleagues on the Committee on Appropriations who have worked so hard on this bill and conference report. I know they have faced many difficult issues, competing demands for limited resources, and the pressure of time as this Congress winds down. And there are many good provisions in this bill, including several that will benefit my home State of New Hampshire. The bill includes two projects that have been particularly important to me and for which I requested funding--the Lamprey River & St. Gaudens. I appreciate the efforts of the Appropriations Committee to provide that funding. 
   Unfortunately, notwithstanding these and other good provisions, the bill fails to deliver what we as elected officials have promised the American people. I want to take this opportunity to explain, especially to my fellow Granite Staters, why I am voting against the Interior Appropriations Conference Report. 
   First, I am deeply disappointed that this bill does not include full funding for the Land and Water Conservation Fund or for the many important programs included in the Conservation and Reinvestment Act. In failing to provide this funding, I believe that we have truly squandered an opportunity that may never exist again. Even more importantly, I believe we failed to live up to the promise we made years ago to dedicate a percentage of the revenues from oil and gas production on the Outer Continental Shelf to the conservation and enhancement of fish, wildlife, lands and waters. 
   Congress came close to keeping that promise when the House passed by an  overwhelming margin of three to one a landmark conservation bill--the so-called Conservation and Reinvestment Act (CARA). The Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee passed a companion bill in July. The CARA bill reflects our collective commitment to investing in the environment for ourselves and for future generations. 
   I am proud that I was able to play a part in bringing attention to the bill in the Senate. On May 24, 2000, I held a hearing on the Senate bill in the Committee on Environment and Public Works. Although that Committee, which I chair, did not have primary jurisdiction over the bill, I felt it was important to hold the hearing to help build support for the legislation and to highlight some of the very important programs that would be enhanced by the passage of the bill. These programs included funding for the Endangered Species Act and Pittman-Robertson Act, both of which are in the jurisdiction of the Committee on Environment and Public Works. I said it then, and I want to reaffirm it today. Now is the time for the Federal government to step up to the plate and assist in the efforts to protect our natural resources--not by grabbing up more Federal land, but by working in partnership with States and private landowners and providing much-needed funding for critically underfunded programs. The CARA bill would have done that. 
   Instead, the Interior Appropriations Conference Report includes a mere shadow of the real CARA. 
   Instead of providing full permanent funding for the Land and 
   Water Conservation Fund, the Interior Conference Report appropriates only $600 million for one year and only $90 million of that is allocated for stateside funding. The CARA bill I cosponsored would have provided the States with a guaranteed $450 million a year to conduct numerous worthwhile conservation projects, including creating new parks and building soccer fields. The limited appropriation provided by the Conference Report, by contrast, with no guarantees for future years, isn't CARA; it's business as usual. 
   The bottom line is that Americans like to spend their time outdoors. Over half of all Americans will tell you that their preferred vacation spots are national parks, forests, wilderness areas, beaches, shorelines and mountains. And almost all Americans--94 percent believe we should be spending more money on land and water conservation. 
   I agree with those Americans who believe that it's time to invest some of the budget surplus in our environment. For years now, we have been telling the tax payers that there isn't any money available for conservation programs and that it's up to landowners to bear the burdens of saving our land and natural resources. Well, in my opinion, those days are over. It's past time for the federal government to contribute its fair share, and the Interior Conference Report falls far short in that respect. 
   Second, I am extremely troubled by the fact that the Conference Report provides no protections for private property rights. CARA did. The real CARA bill provided an unprecedented level of protection for the private land owner. For example, the Senate CARA bill that I cosponsored expressly prohibited the federal government from using any CARA funds to implement regulations on private property. In addition, all Federal acquisitions of land through the Land and Water Conservation Fund would have been subject to significantly more restrictions than under current law. Not one of those private property rights protections is included in the Interior Appropriations Conference Report. 
   Third, I cannot support the language in the Conference Report that establishes a vague new Federal ``wildlife conservation program'' that imposes new, but undefined, obligations on the States and gives broad discretion to the federal Fish and Wildlife Service to define those obligations. The Interior Appropriations Conference Report directs the Fish and Wildlife Service to create a new $300 million state grant program subject only to the approval of the Committee on Appropriations. That is inappropriate. 
   The Committee on Environment and Public Works is responsible for overseeing wildlife programs; it is our prerogative and responsibility to review, discuss, and ultimately authorize any wildlife program. Yet, this new program was inserted at the last minute, behind closed doors, without any public debate or consultation with the Committee of jurisdiction. For that reason, I must oppose its inclusion in this Conference Report. The concept may be a good one, but this is not the right process or the appropriate vehicle. 
   Finally, I must oppose the Conference Report because of the adverse impact it will have on thousands of citizens of New Hampshire who depend upon and enjoy the White Mountain National Forest. 
   When the Senate passed its Interior Appropriations bill in 
   July, it included an important provision excluding the White Mountain National Forest from this Administration's broad policy of prohibiting the construction of all new roads in previously undisturbed areas of national forests, the so-called roadless policy. We excluded the White Mountain National Forest from this ``one-size-fits-all'' roadless policy, not because we want thousands of miles of new roads in the White Mountains, but because these decisions should be made at the local level through the forest planning process, by the people who live near, enjoy, and use the National Forest. 
   I have deep concerns about the Administration's roadless policy because I believe it is intended to limit public access and legitimate public use of our national forests. But even more importantly, in the context of the White Mountain National Forest, it would specifically override an existing forest management plan that maintains a balance between economic activity, recreation and environmental protection--a forest management plan that was developed through a collaborative process involving state and local government officials, local citizens, and federal officials. I firmly believe that States and local citizens should play a significant role in making the management decisions relating to the forest lands in their communities, including the decisions about roads. 
   It was for that reason that I strongly supported the language that was included in the Senate bill that allowed the citizens of New Hampshire to make those decisions through the forest planning process for the White Mountain National Forest, rather than simply mandating a blanket roadless policy from Washington, D.C. That important provision, however, has now been dropped from the Conference Report. I believe that Washington D.C.'s roadless policy will hurt New Hampshire. It will have significant economic, social, and ecological impacts. And it will undermine the cooperative dialogue that took place during the revision of the forest plan. Therefore, I cannot support a Conference Report that does not include language protecting the White Mountain National Forest from unnecessary and inappropriate interference from Washington's bureaucrats. 
   The Interior Appropriations bill passed by the Senate last July also included a specific exemption for North Country residents from the user fees that the National Forest Service charges for access to the White Mountain National Forest. That exemption has now been deleted. 
   I have long been opposed to user fees in the White Mountain National Forest because I believe it is fundamentally unfair to local residents. In areas, like the North Country of New Hampshire, where the Federal Government owns much of the land, communities lose a significant portion of their property tax base which they need to fund schools and other necessary social programs and infrastructure. Residents in these communities then have to make up the shortfall. The user fee, on top of the loss in local tax revenue, imposes an unfair burden for local citizens. It is wrong for the Federal government to charge local residents in the North Country a fee for enjoying the White Mountain National Forest when they are already subsidizing the Forest. 
   As I stated at the beginning, there are many good provisions in this Interior Conference Report. I applaud the work that my colleagues have done and appreciate the support they have given to important New Hampshire projects. Therefore, it is with great reluctance that I oppose the Conference Report.

   Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise in support of H.R. 707, the Disaster Mitigation Act of 2000, and urge its passage by the full Senate. This legislation represents compromise language negotiated with the House of Representatives, but, is, substantively, very similar to the bill passed by the Senate in July of this year. This bill will ensure that FEMA not only remains responsive to local communities after a disaster, but also makes disaster preparedness and mitigation a priority. Further, I am proud that this bill will also result in both short and long term savings to the American taxpayer while, at the same time, providing the states and local communities with added resources for future mitigation efforts. Through added efficiencies this bill saves billions in the long run. 
   I would like to take this opportunity to thank a number of staff members who have worked so hard on this bill. In particular, I would like to recognize Marty Hall from my committee staff; Jo-Ellen Darcy, committee staff for Senator BAUCUS; Andy Wheeler and Mike Murray from Senator INHOFE'S staff; and Jason McNamara from Senator GRAHAM'S staff.

   Mr. SMITH. I would be happy to elaborate on the provision. The bill caps ``non-means-tested'' emergency home repair assistance at $5,000. In other words, as long as insurance proceeds were not available, an individual or household would be eligible for up to $5,000 of emergency home repair assistance before he/she was required to seek additional assistance from other sources, such as the SBA Disaster Loan Program. If that individual or household was not able to obtain an SBA loan, then he/she could be eligible for additional emergency home repair assistance, as long as the total amount of FEMA assistance to this individual or household does not exceed $25,000.

    Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to David Villotti of Amherst, NH, on being nominated for the ``Angels in Adoption'' award. David has worked tirelessly to improve the lives of many children throughout New Hampshire. 
   David's mission is to provide care and support to the neediest children and families in New Hampshire. David has worked to reunite ``his'' children at the Nashua Children's Home to their biological families or, if necessary, have them placed in foster care or adopted into loving families. Some of these children have experienced a tremendous amount of emotional and physical trauma. David creates an environment that is safe for these children to grow while they await word on their family situation. 
   When David first began working at the Nashua Children's Home 15 years ago, there were 18 children in residence. Today there are 46. David and his staff continue to provide support to families while allowing children the environment that they need to grow and mature into well-adjusted teenagers and adults. I am proud to have nominated David for the ``Angels in Adoption'' award for the state of New Hampshire. 
   David, it is an honor to serve you in the U.S. Senate. I wish you all the best in your future endeavors. May you always continue to inspire those around you.

   Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today in support of S. 2045, the American Competitiveness in the Twenty-First Century Act. 
   This bill provides for an increase in foreign workers possessing special skills to enter the United States on a temporary basis in the field of information technology. 
   This bill also encourages more young people to study mathematics, engineering, and computer science to insure that in the future, Americans can fill these high technology jobs. 
   I support this legislation, but I do have some concerns about the potential for the theft of American technology through immigrant high-tech workers. 
   H-1B is a visa classification. H-1B visas were created for non-immigrant foreign nationals admitted to the U.S. on a temporary basis. These H-1B visas are valid for three years and can be renewed for an additional three years. 
   In order to qualify for H-1B visa status, an individual must be in a specialty occupation which requires a theoretical and practical application of a body of highly specialized knowledge and at least a bachelor's degree in the specific specialty area. 
   In 1998, Congress passed, and the President signed, legislation increasing the annual ceiling for admission of H-1B visas from 115,000 in fiscal year 1999 and 2000, and 107,500 in fiscal year 2001. 
   In 1999, it took nine months to exhaust the H-1B annual ceiling. This year the ceiling was reached in 6 months. The high tech industry has not filled these jobs and the American economy is paying the price. 
   Another provision of this legislation addresses the long-term problem that too few U.S. students are excelling in mathematics, computer science, and engineering. We need to encourage more young people to study mathematics, engineering, and computer science and to train more Americans in these areas, so that there will be no need in the future for H-1B visas. 
   I do have national security concerns about the H-1B visa program. I would like to see a proper screening of candidates for H-1B visas by the Immigration and Naturalization Services to ensure that these foreign nationals do not steal technology for export to a foreign government. 
   I will be monitoring the implementation of this new law to ensure that national security and intellectual property rights are protected. 
   We also need to make a better effort to encourage these companies to train and recruit American workers for these high paying jobs. 
   Mr. President, I ask that the Senate support this increase in the ceiling on H-1B visas and this increase in funding to train young Americans to fill these important jobs in the high tech industry.

   Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to encourage my colleagues to support final passage of S. 1752, a bill to reauthorize the Coastal Barrier Resources Act, CBRA. I am offering a manager's amendment in the nature of a substitute that makes several important changes to the bill that was reported by the Committee on Environment and Public Works. These changes have been negotiated with the House Committee on Natural Resources. I believe that in adopting these changes, we will not only improve the bill, but will also ensure that this important legislation is signed into law this year. 
   Most people do not realize that coastal barriers are the first line of defense protecting the mainland from major storms and hurricanes. This extremely vulnerable area is under increasing pressure from development. From 1960 to 1990, the population of coastal areas increased from 80 to 110 million, and is projected to reach over 160 million by 2015. Continued development on and around coastal barriers place people, property and the environment at risk. 
   To address this problem Congress passed CBRA in 1982. This extremely important legislation prohibits the Federal Government from subsidizing flood insurance, and providing other financial assistance, such as beach replenishment, within the Coastal Barrier Resources System, System. Nothing in CBRA prohibits development on coastal barriers; it just gets the Federal Government out of the business of subsidizing risky development. 
   The law proved to be so successful that Congress expanded the Coastal Barrier System in 1990, with the support of the National Taxpayers Union, the American Red Cross, Coast Alliance and Tax Payers for Common Sense, to name just a few. The 1990 act doubled the size of the System to include coastal barriers in Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, the Great Lakes, and additional areas along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts. Congress also allowed the inclusion of areas that are  already protected for conservation purposes, such as parks and refuges. Currently the system is comprised of 3 million acres and 2,500 shoreline miles. 
   Development of coastal barriers decreases their ability to absorb the force of storms and buffer the mainland. The devastating floods of Hurricane Floyd are a reminder of the susceptibility of coastal development to the power of nature. The Federal Emergency Management Agency reports that 10 major disaster declarations were issued for this hurricane, more than for any other single hurricane or natural disaster. In fact, 1999 sets a record for major disaster declarations--a total of 14 in that year alone. As the number of disaster declarations has crept up steadily since the 1980's, so has the cost to taxpayers. Congress has approved on average $3.7 billion a year in supplemental disaster aid in the 1990's, compared to less than $1 billion a year in the previous decade. 
   Homeowners know the risk of building in these highly threatened areas. Despite this, taxpayers are continually being asked to rebuild homes and businesses in flood-prone areas. The National Wildlife Federation published a study that found that over 40 percent of the damage payments from the National Flood Insurance Program go to people who have had at least one previous claim. A New Jersey auto repair shop made 31 damage claims in 15 years. 
   At a time when climatologists believe that we are entering a period of turbulent hurricane activity after three decades of relative calm, the safety concerns associated with continued development of coastal barrier regions must also be considered. As roadway systems have not kept up with population growth, it will become increasingly difficult to evacuate coastal areas in the face of a major storm. 
   Beyond the economic and safety issues, another compelling reason to support the Coastal Barrier Resources Act is that it contributes to the protection of our Nation's coastal resources. Coastal barriers protect and maintain the wetlands and estuaries essential to the survival of innumerable species of fish and wildlife. Large populations of waterfowl and other migratory birds depend on 
   the habitat protected by coastal barriers for wintering areas. Undeveloped coastal barriers also provide unique recreational opportunities, and deserve protection for present and future public enjoyment.

    Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Donna Sytek as she retires as Speaker of the New Hampshire House of Representatives. Donna's dedication to public service is remarkable, and she has done much in her twelve terms in the House to make life better for the people of our great state. 
   Throughout her nearly quarter century as a member of the House, Donna has worked tirelessly on issues about which she feels passionate: crime, juvenile justice reform and education. She has shepherded numerous bills into law, including legislation that established the Department of Corrections, legislation that guarantees truth in sentencing; and an anti-stalking law. She also authored two amendments to the New Hampshire Constitution, including one to limit abuse of the insanity defense in 1984 and another to earmark sweepstakes revenues to education in 1990. Donna has held many leadership positions during her distinguished career as well. She has been active for many years in the National Conference of State Legislatures and currently sits on their executive committee. She is also a former chairwoman of the New Hampshire Republican Party and a past president of the National Republican Legislators association. 
   Donna's position in the state legislature has allowed her to travel the world to promote New Hampshire. She has visited Germany, England, Taiwan, Latvia, Zimbabwe, South Africa and Israel to learn about their cultures and economies while helping them learn a little more about our great state. 
   Donna and her husband John have been fixtures in their hometown of Salem since they moved there almost 30 years ago. They devote their time and energy to many local organizations including the Salem Boys and Girls Club and the Salem Visiting Nurse Association. 
   Donna's dedication to her community and the legislature are exemplary, and her accomplishments have not gone unnoticed. The editors of New Hampshire Editors Magazine named her ``the most powerful woman in New Hampshire'' in 1997. 
   Once again, I would like to thank Speaker Sytek for her tremendous service to the people of New Hampshire and wish her good health and happiness in her retirement. I am proud to call her my friend, and I am honored to represent her in the United States Senate.

   Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Madam President, this is the first major piece of environmental legislation debated on the floor since I assumed the chairmanship of this committee nearly 1 year ago. I am proud to bring the Water Resources Development Act before the Senate, of which a major portion is the Everglades which I will talk about in a moment. 
   This is a good bill. I am very proud of it. It is fiscally responsible. At the same time, it recognizes our obligation to preserve one of the most important and endangered ecosystems in the Nation, if not the world--America's Everglades. 
   This bill gets us back on track toward regular biennial Water Resources Development Act bills. The committee produced a so-called WRDA bill last year, but that bill was 1 year late. 
   I am proud of the WRDA portion of this bill. This is not a bill that includes numerous unnecessary projects. The committee established some tough criteria on which we worked very closely. We evaluated the old criteria and put in new criteria. We scrupulously followed this criteria in an effort to not let projects make their way into this bill that did not belong there. 
   As I noted in my opening statement a few days ago, the committee received requests to authorize more than 300 new projects. By holding firm on our criteria in this WRDA bill, we only authorized 23 new projects. We authorize 40 feasibility studies, and the bill contains 65 project-related provisions or modifications that affect existing projects. 
   I remain very concerned about clearing the backlog of previously authorized projects that will not or should not be constructed. Along with Senator VOINOVICH, we are working very hard to clear that backlog. Called the deauthorization process, this will be an element of the committee's efforts to reform the Corps and to get those projects deauthorized that should not be there. 
   This bill tightens that process by shortening the length of time that an authorized project can stay on the books without actual funding. 
   It is not the full answer, but it is a good answer, and it is a good beginning. 
   During floor consideration of the bill last week, we accepted an amendment that requires the National Academy of Sciences to perform two studies relating to independent peer review of the analyses performed by the Corps of Engineers. 
   I would like to make a few points about that amendment because it was a very important amendment. We certainly have read a lot about Corps reform in the local newspapers, specifically the Washington Post, over the last few months. The stories raised very legitimate issues about the economic modeling used to justify some of these water resources projects. 
   However, it is important to understand that a series of articles in a newspaper is no substitute for careful consideration of the facts and of the issues by the Congress. We have the oversight responsibility for the Army Corps, not the Washington Post. 
   Some Senators, such as Senator FEINGOLD, have proposed reforms that focus on one element in the Corps reform--whether or not to impose a requirement that the feasibility reports for certain water resources projects be subject to peer review. Others, such as Senator DASCHLE, introduced more comprehensive bills that would examine a number of the Corps reform issues, including peer review. 
   The committee needs more information before we can proceed with any bill that would impose peer review on the lengthy project development process that is already in place. We need to know the benefits of peer review and its impacts before starting down that road. 
   Senator BAUCUS and I are committed to examining this issue and other issues related to the operation and management of the Corps of Engineers next year. This will include hearings on Corps reform. 
   The hearings will take comments on the NAS study--the National Academy of Sciences study--the bills that have been introduced, as well as the issue in general. 
   I was very encouraged that the nominee to be the next Chief of Engineers, General Flowers, is receptive to working with the Congress on a wide range of reform-related issues. 
   I want to speak specifically about one major element in this legislation, the Everglades. There is an important element that separates this WRDA bill from all others, something that makes this WRDA truly historic. This WRDA bill includes our landmark Everglades bill, S. 2797, the Restoring of the Everglades, an American Legacy Act, very carefully named because it is an American legacy. We do have to restore it. That is what we have done. We have begun the process. 
   So many have asked--especially some of my conservative friends--why should the Federal Government, why should this Congress take on this long-term expensive effort? The answers really are not that difficult, if you look at them. 
   First, the Everglades is in real trouble, deep trouble. We could lose what is left of the Everglades in this very generation. 
   Secondly, the Federal Government, despite the best of intentions, is largely responsible for the damage that was done to the Everglades. The Congress  told the Corps of Engineers to drain that swamp in 1948--and drain it they did, all too well. 
   Finally, the lands owned or managed by the Federal Government--four national parks and 16 national wildlife 
   refuges which comprise half of the remaining Everglades--will receive the benefits of the restoration. 
   So there is a lot of Federal involvement here. This is a Federal responsibility. There is a compelling Federal interest. The State of Florida, to its credit, has already stepped up and committed $2 billion to the effort. And Congress needs to respond to that pledge. 
   Let's be clear on one thing right now: This plan is not without risks. This comprehensive plan is based on the best science we have. Because of the very nature of the plan, and the additional requirements in the bill, we are certain we will know more about the Everglades and the success of the plan in the future. 
   To those of you who want guarantees, who want to be absolutely certain every dime we spend is going to be spent in a way that is going to restore the Everglades, then I say to you you probably should not support us because I cannot make that guarantee. But what I can say to you is, if we do nothing we lose the Everglades. So if you want to restore this precious national treasure, then you have to be willing to take the risk. And we are cutting that risk dramatically by the way we are doing this. 
   But we take risks all the time. We take risks every time we invest in a new weapons program for the Defense Department or when we invest in cancer research. I am sure there would be no Senator who would come to the floor and say: We have not yet found a cure for cancer; therefore, we should not risk any more money. 
   We need to take this risk to save this precious ecosystem. It is well worth it. We have cut the odds. Because of the nature of this plan, and the additional requirements in our bill, we are certain we are going to know much more about the Everglades in the future; and we are going to be able, through the process of adaptive management, to change every year or so. If something is not going right, we can pull back, try something new, so we do not waste a lot of dollars doing things that we do not want to do. 
   We acknowledge uncertainty. The plan acknowledges uncertainty. So when my colleagues come down and say there is some uncertainty about this, we know that. We anticipate that this plan will change as we gain more knowledge, while we implement it over the next 36 years. 
   This is a 36-year plan that is going to spend in the vicinity of $8 billion, split equally between the State of Florida and the Federal Government. It works out to a can of Coke per U.S. citizen per year. That is not a bad investment to be able to save the wading birds and the alligators and this precious river of grass of which we are all so proud. 
   I am confident, because of the time I have spent on this issue, that adaptive assessment or adaptive management--whatever you want to call it--will succeed, even if the plan is modified based on the new information that we get in the future. 
   The Everglades portion of WRDA has broad bipartisan support. Every major constituency involved in the Everglades restoration supports this bill--every one of them. 
   Is it perfect? Did everybody get exactly what they wanted? No. But everybody is on board. It is bipartisan and it is wide ranging. It goes from the liberal side of the equation to the conservative side. It includes the administration. It includes both Presidential candidates: Vice President GORE and Gov. 
   George Bush. It includes the Florida Governor, Jeb Bush. It includes the Florida Legislature, both sides of the aisle unanimously. It includes the Seminole Tribe of Florida and the Miccosukee Tribe of Indians in Florida. 
   It includes major industry groups, such as the Florida Citrus Mutual, Florida Farm Bureau, Florida Home Builders, The American Water Works Association, Florida Chamber of Commerce, Florida Fruit and Vegetable Association, Southeast Florida Utility Council, Gulf Citrus Growers Association, Florida Sugar Cane League, Florida Water Environmental Utility Council, Sugar Cane Growers Cooperative of Florida, Florida Fertilizer and Agri-chemical Association; and environmental groups as well, including the National Audubon Society, National Wildlife Federation, World Wildlife Fund, Center for Marine Conservation, Defenders of Wildlife, National Parks Conservation Association, The Everglades Foundation, The Everglades Trust, Audubon of Florida, 1000 Friends of Florida, Natural Resources Defense Council, Environmental Defense, and the Sierra Club. 
   I think it is pretty unusual to bring a major environmental bill to the Senate floor with that breadth of support. Support for the bill, as it stands today, is even broader than the support that existed for the administration's comprehensive plan. 
   We have taken a good product and have made it better. How have we made it better? It is more fiscally responsible. We defer decisions on some of the riskiest new technologies until we have more information from the pilot projects, which will help us to understand whether these projects should be continued. It has ground-breaking provisions to assure that the plan attains its restoration goals. It has the creation of a true partnership between the Federal Government and the State. This type of partnership--State concurrence in all important decisions and regulations--has no precedent in our environmental statutes. It has more detailed and meaningful reports to Congress on the progress of the plan, almost on a yearly basis. 
   The Everglades bill is a great model for environmental policy development, a model I endorse, a model I have worked hard to implement since I have been the chairman. It is cooperative. It is not confrontational. It is bipartisan. It is flexible. It is adaptive. It establishes a partnership between the Federal Government and the State. 
   Already, there is support for this bill in the House. Congressman CLAY SHAW introduced this bill as H.R. 5121 on September 7. 
   He deserves credit for his leadership in that regard. Many others in the House on both sides of the aisle are ready to join the effort. I am asking my colleagues to join with me in support of this major piece of legislation. 
   I see my colleague and good friend from the State of Florida, Senator GRAHAM, is on the floor at this time. I will yield the floor in just a moment so he may speak. 
   Before doing so, I thank him, as well as Senator MACK, for his absolute and resolute involvement in this project. I went to Florida in early January at the request of Senator GRAHAM and Senator MACK to see for myself what the situation was. I spent several days there. We had a hearing in Florida. We listened to the people who were speaking on this issue. 
   I made a promise at that hearing that I would bring this bill to the Senate floor before the end of the year. With the help of good people such as Senator BOB GRAHAM of Florida and Senator MACK, Senator BAUCUS, and others, we have made that happen. I thank Senator GRAHAM publicly and personally for that. His cooperation has been splendid. Without him, we would not be here. 
   I yield the floor so my colleague from Florida may have a chance to address this issue that is so important to his State and to the Nation.

   Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Madam President, I thank my colleague for his very kind remarks. I very much appreciate his hard work on behalf of the Everglades, which dates back prior to his time in the Senate, as we all know, when he was the Governor of Florida. Then-Governor GRAHAM was very instrumental in keeping this project on line. 
   I think it is also important to understand that the Founding Fathers were a lot more brilliant than we sometimes give them credit. In this process, I think they foresaw an opportunity where a Senator from a State such as New Hampshire, which has nothing to do with the Everglades, could be chairman of a committee that would bring forth a major piece of environmental legislation in conjunction with the Florida Senators--a piece of environmental legislation as to another State about 2,000 miles to the south. It is a remarkable process we have here that would see that happening. I think the founders knew it. That is why we have a Senate, where we can work these things through in a way that has a national touch. 
   As I went down there and saw the Everglades firsthand and had the opportunity to have a hearing with Senators GRAHAM and VOINOVICH, who was also there, I realized--and I had visited there many times as a tourist--that the Everglades was in fact draining, that some 90 percent of the wading birds were lost, and animals and plant life were dying. On the one hand, on one side of the Tamiami Trial you had a desert; on the other side you basically had the wetlands that it was supposed to be. But the Tamiami Trail is a dam that needs to be removed to allow that water to flow all through that ecosystem from Lake Okeechobee to the Gulf of Mexico. It is a great project. 
   People might say, What is the Senator from New Hampshire doing here? Well, I remember the first time my son saw an alligator in Florida as a 6-year-old boy. It was a very poignant moment, and you don't forget those things. In talking to the park rangers over the years--and, most specifically, the last time I was there in January--you realize that the Everglades are in trouble. As I said earlier, there are no guarantees here, but I think we have cut the odds dramatically. I am very optimistic that this will work and work well. So I am certainly looking forward to the passage of this bill. I hope the House will quickly follow suit so that we can make this law before the end of the year. 
   I see Senator BAUCUS has arrived. I want to say before yielding to him how much I appreciate his help throughout this process. It has been a bipartisan effort. We are all guilty of partisanship from time to time, as well we should be; I think there are times when partisanship is important. But there was no partisanship on this issue. We worked together on it to bring this bill forward. Senator BAUCUS and his staff were very helpful, and we are grateful. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Madam President, since both Senator GRAHAM and Senator BAUCUS have both mentioned so many people to thank, we always run the risk of leaving someone out whenever we do that. With apologies to anyone that I do, I would like to reiterate and reinforce some of those who have already been thanked as well as perhaps a couple more. 
   I think first and foremost we should mention Senator John Chafee who certainly started the process of the efforts on the Everglades, along with Senator BAUCUS. I know that John Chafee would be very proud of this moment because he felt deeply about this ecosystem. I think it is a great honor to be here now and be at this point knowing that John Chafee would have wanted this. It is a great tribute to him because he started the process. All we did was jump into the harness that he had already put on the team. 
   I also thank Senator VOINOVICH, subcommittee chairman, because he brought a lot of debate on this issue. He helped us correct many provisions--certainly on the financing end and the cost end. We look a lot more closely at projects because of him. He was certainly a stalwart in seeing that this was a more fiscally responsible item than perhaps it may have otherwise been. 
   Certainly Senator BAUCUS, who I already thanked, and Senators MACK and GRAHAM. As Senator BAUCUS correctly said, it seemed as if Senator MACK was on the committee. But that is the way we worked it. They are the two Senators. We worked with them. Senator GRAHAM, of course, is on the committee. But we worked together, knowing that we wanted all the input we could get from all of them. 
   The administration was helpful. Mary Doyle and Peter Umhofer at the Department of the Interior. And Secretary Babbitt who was here for a press conference when we announced and released the bill; Joe Westphal and Mike Davis from the Department of the Army; Gary Guzy from EPA; Stu Applebaum, Larry Prather, and many others from the Corps of Engineers; and Bill Leary from CEQ. 
   From the State of Florida--they have been absolutely fantastic on both sides of the aisle: David Struhs, Leslie Palmer, and Ernie Barnett from the Florida Department of Environmental Protection; Governor Bush himself, who has just been outstanding in conversation after conversation, working together on all of the provisions of this bill; and Kathy Copeland from the South Florida Water Management District. 
   From Senator BOB GRAHAM's staff, Catharine Cyr Ranson and Kasey Gilletteand, have been wonderful. We appreciate all they have done. 
   Senator MACK's staff has already been mentioned by Senator BAUCUS. But I would also like to thank C.K. Lee, who was really the honorary member of the committee staff. 
   Senator VOINOVICH's staff: Ellen Stein, Rich Worthington; and, of course, Senator BAUCUS' staff: Tom Sliter, Jo-Ellen Darcy, and Peter Washburn, all worked together in a nonpartisan way. We tried to keep the doors open at all times. 
   Of course, my own staff, Dave Conover, who is the chief of staff on the committee; Ann Klee, Angie Giancarlo, and Chelsea Henderson, now Maxwell--she found time to get married after they got the Everglades set and ready to go. We let her get married and go on her honeymoon and come back to be here for the finale--and Stephanie Daigle and Tom Gibson, all brought a great blend of knowledge of the water issues and engineering, as 
   well, to the whole debate. 
   Let me say in closing to my colleagues that when you look back on your career in the Senate, I think you can be very proud of what you did. When you cast a vote to save the Everglades, I don't know if you are ever going to regret it. I think it is going to be a defining moment. Fifty years from  now when the historians look back, they are going to say when it came time to stand up for the Everglades, they did. I think it will be one of the finest things that you have done in your careers. I certainly feel that way about mine. The only regret would be if we didn't try. We did try, and I believe we will succeed as a result of the fact that we took this risk. 
   Some have said it would be ``bad politics,''--bad politics for the administration to work with the Republican Congress on an environmental issue; bad politics for Republicans to work with the administration with Florida as a ``swing State''; that maybe Governor George Bush will get too much credit, or AL GORE, who has been closely associated with the Everglades, is going to get too much credit. There is enough credit to go around. Who cares. 
   The point is that most everyone in Florida--and I do not know too many on the other side who do not--supports restoring the Everglades. Let the credit fall where it may. Let the credit be taken where people want to take it. But the truth is we did the right thing. That is all that matters in the long run. 
   There is a lot of history here. Congress initiated this plan in WRDA in 1992 when George Bush was in office and the Democrats were in the majority. It then refocused the Everglades effort in WRDA in 1996 when the Republicans were in the majority and Bill Clinton was in the White House. 
   I think you see that there is plenty of evidence of bipartisan support. 
   Congress set up the process under which this comprehensive plan was developed, but it was developed by this administration in cooperation with Florida, with tribes, and all other stakeholders. 
   Florida, under Jeb Bush, stepped up to the plate and passed the legislation, along with the funding, to keep this moving forward even before the Federal Government made its commitment. Florida made its commitment to put their money up. 
   When I became chairman, as has already been said, I took up the mantle and made this a priority. I believe in it. I made this restoration of the Everglades my highest priority. I am very grateful that my colleagues felt the same way and joined with me because, obviously, we wouldn't be here if it was just my priority. 
   It takes at least 51 Senators to have that priority as well or we wouldn't be here. 
   The Senate took the plan and made some important modifications, strengthened it, broadened the support; Senator VOINOVICH's input strengthened it. 
   We are poised to send the bill to the House, a bill that has the support of every major south Florida stakeholder, the State of Florida, the administration, and I think most Members of the Senate. 
   Restoration of the Everglades is not a partisan issue. I ask my colleagues, if you have any doubts and you are worried about every single ``i'' being dotted and every ``t'' being crossed, take the risk. You will be glad you did. This is the right thing to do. 
   I am very excited about this action. I am very excited by the fact we have looked to the future. In politics, sometimes we look to the next election. This time, with this vote, we are going to look to the next generation and respond so our grandchildren and their children will enjoy alligators and wading birds and the river of grass once again--not only those who have had the chance to experience it now, but it will still be there for centuries to come because of what we did. I am proud of everyone for help in doing this.

   Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. The Senator from Virginia, Mr. WARNER, is correct in his understanding of the potential impact of the provision. However, it is not my intent to deauthorize large navigation projects which enjoy strong state and federal support. The Committee has discussed this matter with the Corps of Engineers and we are aware that the provision may inadvertently capture a universe of active, ongoing projects. I can assure my colleague that we will work in conference to be sure that projects like the Norfolk Harbor and Channels project, as well as other critically important projects are not deauthorized as a result of this provision.

   Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. The committee has worked very diligently to reach this point. It was quite a challenge: 99 Senators and me. We had a lot of projects. We had a lot of differences of opinion and a lot of things to work through. We worked very hard personally, wherever possible, wherever I needed to, with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, to try to get accommodation for this bill. As it has been done since the Water Resources Development Act of 1986, the committee used a strict set of criteria to determine whether or not these projects would be included. Only those projects that met those criteria were included in this bill. As we know from many of the  hearings we had over the last year or so, there is a backlog of Corps projects which, with the help of Senator VOINOVICH, Senator BAUCUS, and others, we are trying to clear. We stuck to our criteria. 
   We received over 300 requests on harbor dredging, environmental restoration, flood control, a number of items in which the Army Corps would be involved. My colleagues and I drafted a bill that authorizes 22 new projects, containing 65 project-related provisions or modifications, and authorizes 40 feasibility studies--very complex, time consuming, a lot of detail, a lot of work at the staff and Member level to get there. 
   I appreciate the cooperation of Senator BAUCUS and his staff throughout this process, as well as Senator VOINOVICH on our side. Not even one-third of those 300 projects made the cut. I am proud of that. It is a reflection of the strength of the criteria that we worked so hard to keep in the bill and include in the bill, to stick to those criteria, trying not to make exceptions, because once you make exceptions, it opens the door to more and more projects which are not significant or important. 
   Our bill does not contain cost share waivers, environmental infrastructure projects, or authorized projects that are not technically sound, environmentally acceptable, or economically justified. Those are the criteria. I am very proud of that. We stuck to those criteria. We took some heat from some Members, but we thought we were fair to everyone by sticking to the criteria. 
   I commend Senators VOINOVICH and BAUCUS for their hard work, and their staffs, and, in addition to Senators VOINOVICH and BAUCUS, Senator MACK and Senator GRAHAM. Senator GRAHAM, of course, is a member of our committee. Senator MACK is not. But we treated Senator MACK as if he were a member of the committee. They had full input because of the Everglades issue which is such an important part of this bill. It was a pleasure to work with all of them in putting this bill together. It was very, very difficult. 
   This was a freestanding bill, the water 2000 provision, to restore America's Everglades. I introduced it with my colleagues, Senators BAUCUS, VOINOVICH, GRAHAM, and MACK, on June 27, 2000. The committee favorably reported out our Everglades bill by a bipartisan vote of 17-1, with an amendment to include the Everglades. It was an overwhelmingly bipartisan vote. I think we worked through this process in a bipartisan manner both at the staff level and at the Member level. 
   In January of this year in south Florida at the Everglades, I made a promise to the people of that State and to the Nation, with Senator GRAHAM by my side, as well as Senator VOINOVICH, that Everglades restoration would be the top priority of this 
   committee. Speaking for myself, it would be my top priority as the chairman. It certainly has been Senator BAUCUS' top priority as he has worked with me throughout this process. 
   Since that markup, the committee, the State of Florida, the administration, industry groups, environmental groups, and two Indian tribes impacted by the Everglades restoration have all worked diligently on the managers' amendment that we all can support. I am pleased to report that S. 2796 with the managers' amendment is strongly supported by all vital interests. It is truly bipartisan. It is truly historic. 
   A few moments ago, Senator BYRD spoke on the floor about some of the partisanship. It is out there. We all do it. There is a time and place for it. But we didn't have it in this bill. Whatever differences we had with individual Members, they had nothing to do with what somebody had next to their name. 
   I will briefly comment on the Everglades issue and then turn it over to my ranking member, Senator BAUCUS. 
   We might ask, Why is Everglades restoration necessary? The Everglades is the biggest part of this water resources development bill, and that has been controversial because other Members did not get as much as Florida. But Florida has a special issue. The Everglades are very special. It is a very environmentally sensitive region of the country. It clearly is a treasure. I want my colleagues to understand why we believe time is of the essence. 
   This is a national treasure. It is a vast freshwater marsh which once was connected by the flow of water, a sheet of water, a river of water, flowing south from Lake Okeechobee all the way into the Gulf of Mexico, and once covered 18,000 square miles. It is the heart of a unique biologically productive ecosystem. 
   But now the Everglades is in peril. It is half the size it used to be. What happened? In 1948, we had a Federal flood control project, and 1.7 billion gallons of water a day as a result of that project are now flowing into the sea, totally lost. We asked the Army Corps to do this because we had flooding. We basically created a dam. On one side of that dam is the dammed-up water; on the other side essentially is a desert. That is not what the Everglades ecosystem was designed to be. So we needed to correct it. The Federal Government, the Congress, and the administration's direction at the time, in 1948, urged us to do it. They spent the money to do it. Now I think it is the Federal Government's responsibility, in conjunction with Florida, to correct it. That is exactly what this bill does. 
   The original Central and Southern Florida Project was done with the best of intentions--the Federal Government simply had to act when devastating floods took thousand of lives prior to the project's construction. Unfortunately, the very success of the Central and Southern Florida Project disrupted the natural sheet flow of water through the so-called ``River of Grass,'' altering or destroying the habitat for many species of native plants, mammals, reptiles, fish, and wading birds. 
   We are going to recapture that wasted water, store it, and redirect it, when needed, to the natural system in the South Florida ecosystem. On July 1, 1999, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers submitted to Congress a ``Restudy'' of the Central and Southern Florida Project. Called the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan, this blueprint provides the details and layout of the 30-year restoration project. 
   The bipartisan Everglades legislation approves the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan as the overall framework to restore the ecological health of the Florida Everglades. The bill also includes authorization of the initial projects necessary to get restoration underway. Specifically, the bill includes authorization of 10 construction projects. These projects, which employ already proven, standard technologies, were carefully selected by the Army Corps of Engineers and the South Florida Water Management District and included in the plan as the projects that would, once constructed, have immediate benefits to the natural system. Almost right away, the plan gets at restoring the natural sheet flow that years of human interference has interrupted. 
   If anybody has been in south Florida, been to the Everglades, you know what the Tamiami Trail is. Basically, that is a dam that blocks the flow of that water. We will begin the process of punching holes in that dam and allowing that sheet of water to flow once again. 
   The bill includes authorization of four pilot projects to test new and innovative technologies that may be employed in future restoration projects. 
   There is a requirement that future components of the plan must have a favorable Project Implementation Reports [PIR] from the Secretary of the Army, similar to a Chief of Engineer's report. Future projects will be authorized through the biennial Water Resources Development Act. 
   Adaptive management and assessment. One of my favorite aspects of the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan is its inherent flexibility. If we learn something new about the ecosystem, perfect our modeling techniques, or just plain see that something is not working right, through the concept of adaptive management and assessment, we can modify the plan as new technologies and new methods become available. 
   Much is made of this and much more will be made of this issue in the debate. This is a 36-year plan. This is a risk. It is not a sure thing. We take risks all the time in the money we spend, whether it is for a weapons system or cancer research. I am sure we would not say we haven't found a cure for cancer so therefore let's not risk any more money in research. We are saying if we do not do something to save the Everglades, we will lose the Everglades. So we have to  try. We believe, on the best science we can find, that we have reasonable expectations here to invest approximately $4 billion over 36 years. That is a can of Coke a year for every American. That is not a lot of investment. I think we would be willing to do that so our grandchildren can see alligators and wading birds and enjoy the Everglades as I have with my children on many, many occasions. 
   So we have adaptive management. It is a great concept. If it doesn't work, we stop and we try something else. We are not locked into something for the next 36 years. We are going to perfect our techniques. If something isn't working right, we are going to modify it. 
   We have ``assurances'' that the environment will be the primary beneficiary of the water made available through CERP. The overarching object of the Plan is to restore, preserve, and protect the south Florida ecosystem, while meeting the water supply, flood protection, and agricultural needs of the region. These assurances also protect existing water users, such as the Seminole Tribe of Florida's water compact. 
   This bill has unprecedented broad, bipartisan support. My colleague Senator GRAHAM has compared our feat to achieving peace between the Hatfields and the McCoys. This truly is a remarkable accomplishment that deserves recognition by the Senate in the form of swift passage.

This is what we need to do. It is our responsibility now to do that. The Everglades provision in the managers' amendment is supported by these groups. 
   I urge my colleagues to preserve that Federal-State partnership in the Everglades restoration, to preserve this 50-50 O&M, and to reject this amendment because, again, I believe to pass this amendment would break the deal that we have already worked out so delicately among so many groups, No. 1, and, No. 2, it would be unfair. It would not be consistent with the law, WRDA 86, and it would not, in my view, be consistent with the precedent.

   Mr. SMITH. I am very glad that you asked that question. First let me explain what subsection (h)(3) does. Subsection (h)(3) requires the issuance of programmatic regulations to ensure that the goals and purposes of the Plan are achieved by guiding the implementation of the project implementation reports. 
   Confusion was raised due to the wording that we used in the bill as reported. In order to clarify section (h)(3)(B)(i), we deleted the words ``provide guidance.'' Despite the change in the manager's amendment, the report language for this section is still relevant, and reflects the committee's interpretation of this section. It is still the committee's intent that in developing the programmatic regulations, the Federal and State partners should establish interim goals-expressed in terms of restoration standards-to provide a means by which the restoration success of the plan may be evaluated through the implementation process. The restoration standards should be quantitative and measurable at specific points in the plan implementation.

   Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate today has unanimously passed S. 522, the Beaches Environmental Assessment and Coastal Health Act of 2000 and H.R. 999, the Beaches Environmental Awareness, Cleanup, and Health Act of 1999. These bills reflect what we can do when we work together cooperatively, and on a bipartisan basis to protect the environment. Most importantly, they will result in significant environmental benefits on the ground--cleaner and safer beaches for all Americans. I am proud to be a cosponsor of the Senate version of this legislation, S. 522.  
   I want to thank Congressman BILBRAY for taking the lead on this Beach legislation over the years and for all his hard work in making sure we pass this legislation. Without his hard work and determination over the years we would not have passed this legislation today. I also would like to recognize Senator LAUTENBERG for his leadership on this issue in the Senate. 
   Every year, over 180 million people visit coastal waters for recreational purposes. Over half of the population of the United States lives near a coastal area and traditionally a great majority of Americans visit coastal areas every year to swim, fish, hunt, dive, bike, view wildlife and learn. For many states, this tourism provides significant economic benefits. In fact, coastal recreation and the tourism industry are the second largest employers in the nation, and supporting 28.3 million jobs. In New Hampshire, for example, the seacoast region is one of the most popular tourism spots in the State. Rye Beach and Hampton Beach, to name a couple, provide beautiful vacation spots for those of us in New Hampshire and many of our friends in neighboring states. 
   Unfortunately, pathogens found in sewage spills, storm water runoff, and combined sewer overflows are impairing water quality and threatening the health of the public who visit our nation's beaches. While some States have strong programs for monitoring and informing the public of the presence of pathogens that are harmful to human health, others do not. 
   In response to the need for consistency among the States in monitoring and public notification of pathogens in coastal recreation waters, Representative BILBRAY and Senator LAUTENBERG introduced their Beach bills. 
   The bills require all states with coastal recreation waters to adopt water quality criteria that protect public health and welfare, consistent with EPA criteria guidance for pathogens and pathogen indicators. The legislation requires the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, in cooperation with State and local governments, to publish performance criteria that provide guidance for state monitoring and assessment, and public notification programs that protect human health. 
   The performance criteria will be used by the States as guidance to improve upon existing monitoring and notification programs or, in some States to establish monitoring and notification programs. In the case of New Hampshire, which as an extensive monitoring and notification program, these performance criteria will provide further guidance to improve upon our program. 
   The bills provides $30 million over 5 years in grants to States and local communities for the implementation and development of these monitoring and notification programs. In certain situations, such as the early stage of a program, EPA will be able to award as a grant a large percentage, up to 100 percent, of the costs of developing a program to some states. This provides those few States without monitoring and notification programs a great incentive through grant funding to develop and implement this comprehensive program. Improving water quality at our nation's beaches, as well as implementing monitoring and public notification programs, will benefit all Americans who have a right to expect that they can safely swim in the water. 
   The Committee filed the Report on S. 522 (Rept. No. 106-366) on August 25, 2000. The Committee Report and the text of S. 522, as amended in Committee, reflected a number of changes negotiated by the Committee and the two principle sponsors of the House and Senate bills, Congressman BRIAN BILBRAY of California and Senator FRANK LAUTENBERG. Over the past few months, I have worked with my colleagues on the Committee, particularly Senators LAUTENBERG and BAUCUS, and with Congressman BILBRAY to continue to improve the language of this legislation. Together, we have crafted a comprehensive Manager's Amendment that I believe provides States with needed flexibility and enhances environmental protection. As the manager of the bill, and a cosponsor of the Senate bill, I am pleased that the Senate passed this Manager's Amendment as a substitute to the text of both H.R. 999 and S. 522. Both bills, as passed by the Senate, reflect the agreements and principles set forth in Senate Report No. 106-366. 
   I thank Senator BAUCUS and my other Committee colleagues, as well as Senators LOTT and DASCHLE, for helping us continue the tradition of bipartisan action on environmental matters.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Yes. A rollcall vote on division I and division IV. 
   Mr. President, as you know, last Thursday, I offered an amendment that would require the Congressional-Executive Commission, which is created under the permanent normal trade relations bill on China, to monitor the level of Chinese cooperation on the POW/MIA issue and to pass this information to the American people as part of an annual report that the commission will issue. 
   I have long been an advocate of the POW/MIA issue. I believe the U.S. Government should make every effort to account for any missing American servicemen from any of our Nation's conflicts. I am sure you all agree that we have a solemn obligation to these brave Americans and their families. There are over 10,000 unaccounted-for American soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines from Korea, Vietnam, and the cold war, not to mention many from World War II. 
   The fate of many of these unaccounted-for Americans, especially from the Korean war, could be easily clarified by the People's Republic of China. This is an undisputed fact, that the Chinese continue to deny that they have any information that could help us account for our missing. 
   I have been to North Korea and have talked to the North Koreans on this issue. I have talked to the Russians. Both the Russians and the North Koreans indicated to me, in private discussions, that the Chinese had volumes of information on American servicemen, especially during the Korean war because, as we know, the Chinese were heavily involved. They maintained the camps in Korea during the war. 
   So all I am asking for in this amendment is that we can include this language so the commission can monitor and put some pressure on the Chinese to provide information. It is humanitarian. It is basic humanitarian information about our missing service men and women. 
   I do not think this is unreasonable. I do not think it is going to delay anything. It would simply go back to the House. The House would add the amendment, and off it goes: We have now made a statement to the Chinese Communists that we care about 
   our American POWs and MIAs. 
   I would be astounded if anyone would even consider voting against this  amendment, drawing the conclusion that somehow it is going to mess up the permanent normal trade relations deal. 
   It would take about 5 minutes to get it approved in the House, another 5 minutes for the President to take a look at it and sign the bill, and we are moving on and now have some attention on it. We have now said to the Chinese Government: Not only do we care about our missing, we want you to help us find some of our MIAs and POWs from those conflicts. 
   I would like to share with my colleagues just a small fraction of the information that I have--and, believe me, it is a small fraction. I pored through many intelligence files, and I am only giving you a smattering of these files. But I can tell you, the Chinese deny any information, when, in fact, our own intelligence community has volumes of information to the contrary, that they could answer about what happened to our POWs and MIAs, especially from the camps in North Korea, at the end of the war. But it is precisely the type of information I am going to share with you that makes it all the more important that we say to the Chinese: You have to cooperate with us on this humanitarian issue. 
   For example, there are numerous declassified CIA intelligence reports from the 1950s that indicate the Chinese have knowledge about American POWs from that war--numerous, numerous declassified intelligence reports, and many classified that we cannot talk about here. 
   I did this the other day when I offered the amendment. I believe I put these in the RECORD yesterday. I will check that. If I did not, I will enter them. But I believe they are in the RECORD. 
   Here is a good example of one. This is a Central Intelligence Agency Information report dated in May of 1951. So we were at the height of the Korean war in May of 1951. The subject matter is: ``American Prisoners of War in Canton,'' China. Some of the information is blacked out because of sources and methods. Even today, 40 years later, it is still blacked out. But, again, it is a reference to prisoners of war held by the Chinese in the Korean war. 
   If the Chinese held prisoners, clearly they would know what happened to the prisoners or at least could share some information on the records they maintained in the camps. 
   Here is another one: 27 June 1951, another intelligence report right here, entitled, ``Subject: American Prisoners of War in South China.'' I will just cite a couple of paragraphs from it:  
   A staff member of the State Security Bureau in Seoul [Korea] on 12 February stated that all American prisoners of war were sent to camps .....  
   And then they list several cities in Manchuria where they were put to hard labor in mines and factories. 
   So that is another CIA intelligence report. 
   Why would we not want to say to the Chinese: Look, here is our own intelligence. We know you held our prisoners in the war. All we want you to do is help us provide answers for their loved ones. 
   Yet I regret, sincerely regret, to say that people are going to come down to this Senate floor shortly, before the end of the afternoon, and they are going to vote no on this 
   amendment. I believe so many will vote no that it will fail. The reason they are going to give for that vote--and that is what they are going to tell their constituents--is: Of course we would like to get information on our POWs and MIAs. Of course we would like to have the Chinese cooperate. But we are not willing to put it in the permanent normal trade relations because--you know what?--we might make them angry, and we will not be able to sell them corn and wheat. 
   That is what we are saying. Maybe we can look our veterans in the eye and the families of these people in the eye and say: That's all right. But it is not all right with me. My conscience will be clear. I know how I am voting on this amendment. I would appreciate the consideration of my colleagues. It is not asking very much to send this back to the House with this one amendment that says we care. 
   It is interesting; there are many groups who oppose permanent normal trade relations with China. But I will tell you, the veterans groups oppose it. What does that tell you? The American Legion opposes it. Many veterans groups oppose it. They are the ones who made the sacrifice. I guarantee you, the families of these individuals who are missing would sure love to see this language put in this bill. 
   I could go on and on. I will not cite many, but here is another one: ``U.S. Prisoners of War in Communist China, 11 Aug. 1951.'' It is a CIA report. This is one of just thousands that we have had--classified and unclassified--just like this.  
   On 2 August fifty-two US prisoners of war from Korea, who had been held in the Baptist church .....  
   And they name the location--  
   left Canton by train for [another location] under guard.......  
   This is very detailed stuff. This is not just somebody who makes a general statement. These are specific eyewitness sightings of prisoners being moved around in China during the war and who never returned. 
   I am not maintaining that these people are alive. It would be nice if they were, but I am not maintaining that. But clearly, the Chinese, if they would sit down with us with these documents, we could talk to them, and we could trace this information. We could talk to the people in these provinces, and maybe we could get some information. 
   Perhaps where were these prisoners buried? How were they killed? What kinds of information do we have on them? Are there personal effects, anything like that? 
   Another report, September 1951, title: American Prisoners of War, Communist China, CIA. On and on and on. 
   All I am asking my colleagues is to say that that is not acceptable, that we will give permanent normal trade relations to China and not ask them to at least help us account for our missing. I say to those of you who might be skeptical, if you want me to provide you these documents in detail, I will provide the documents in detail. I can send you to the proper locations in the U.S. Government where the classified documents, which are far more specific than this, will give you even more specific information. 
   I went to North Korea. I sat down in Pyongyang with the North Korean officials several years ago, the first American Senator to visit North Korea. I talked to the North Koreans about those camps that were run during the war. They showed me photographs of the Communist Chinese guards who guarded those troops, our troops, our prisoners, American prisoners, during the war. They know what happened to those people. They can provide us information. Why is that asking so much--to say we want to monitor this to say to the Chinese, every time PNTR comes up for discussion, we want you to help us find answers? 
   I wrote a letter to the Chinese Government on this and got a blunt response: We don't have any information. We are not going to share any information with you. 
   We know that is not true. Yet why should they give us information if we say to them, you don't have to give us information because we are going to give you what you want, which is trade and credibility and recognition on the international plain? 
   This is just basic human rights--basic. Senator HELMS and others, Senator WELLSTONE and others, have offered amendments, over and over again, about human rights violations--all defeated, including mine. We talked about abuse in orphanages. We talked about forced abortions, women forced to have abortions at 9 months--all ignored, all voted down--all in the name of profit, all in the name of saying we don't want to risk antagonizing the Chinese. We don't want to take a few minutes to have this on the other side, to go back over to the House where they might have to add an amendment to send it to the President. That is the reason for this. 
   As you can imagine, it is difficult to investigate reports that are 50 years old. That is exactly why we need the Chinese to cooperate. You look at a report such as this; it goes back 50 years. We need the people on the ground. We need the Communist Chinese archives--not classified top secret Chinese secrets, that is not what we want. We want basic humanitarian information. They could give it to us, a lot of it. And probably we could clarify the fate of hundreds, perhaps even thousands, of American POWs and MIAs.  
   I will give one example. On my last trip to Russia, we were able to access some archives. The Russians were very cooperative. They provided 10,000 documents that helped us to identify flyers, American pilots, who were lost in the Korean conflict because the Russians--Soviets then--flew aircraft; they actually saw the shootdowns. They made notations about the tail number of the aircraft, how many pilots, did the pilot parachute out, did the plane go down in flames--very personal, 
   firsthand accounts, very helpful; 10,000 documents. 
   These documents will help us to be able to go to the families of these men and be able to say to them, this is what happened to your husband or your father, your brother, whomever, as best we know based on the testimony of the Russians. 
   The Russians, to their credit, are being cooperative. Why can't we ask the Chinese to do this? Why is that asking too much? This is the thing that disturbs me so much, that just basic humanitarian issues are thrown aside in the name of somehow taking a little more time. What is another day, if we are going to give the Chinese permanent trade status? What is another day to include this kind of language? 
   Secretary Cohen, to his credit, at my request raised this issue with the Chinese during his recent visit to China this last summer. Once again, the Chinese simply brushed it aside. They said: we don't have any information--when in fact our intelligence files and our own information flat out knows and says the opposite. 
   But let's not forget what the real issue is here. The Chinese stand to make billions from trade with the United States. Shame on us if we fail to demand that in return for those billions, we ask for basic humanitarian information on our servicemen. Shame on us. 
   All we can do is call this to the attention of our colleagues. I can't make colleagues vote the way I want them to vote, nor should I. It is up to them to make that decision. But I urge them to make the decision to ask for this basic information. 
   I have worked on this issue for 16 years, as a Senator and a Congressman. I know what I am talking about. I have been to China. I have been to Cambodia. I have been to Laos. I have flown a helicopter over the Plain of Jars. I landed in the Plain of Jars. I went into caves looking for American POWs. I scoured the hillsides and countrysides of Cambodia and Laos and Vietnam and Russia. They have all been relatively cooperative, some more than others, not cooperative enough. But the Chinese have done nothing--no access, zero, zippo. Yet here we are, giving them permanent status. It is wrong. 
   My concern extends beyond Chinese knowledge of Americans missing from the Korean war. We know approximately 320,000 Chinese military personnel served in Vietnam from 1965 to 1970. So moving now from the Korean war to the Vietnam war, it seems to me highly likely that many of these Chinese troops would be knowledgeable about the fate of some 2,000 Americans still unaccounted for from the Vietnam war. It also impacts the Vietnam war. It also impacts the cold war. 
   I am personally opposed to PNTR. I will vote against it. But it certainly would be nice if those who are going to vote for it, since I know it is going to pass, would be willing to at least have this basic noncontroversial amendment which would help to account for missing Americans. 
   Let me tell you what else it would do. It would provide a lot of solace to American families who for 50 years have waited for some word about their loved ones. Yet Senators don't want to vote for this amendment because to vote for it means it might have to go to conference. They don't want to short-circuit the legislative process. Did anybody ask these folks before they went off to war whether they cared about short-circuiting the legislative process? They went. They served. They were lost. They deserve this amendment. They earned this amendment. 
   My amendment would merely expand the scope of the commission in the permanent normal trade relations bill to include the monitoring of Chinese cooperation on the POW/MIA issue. It is about as noncontroversial as anything we could do. Not only should we vote for this amendment, we have an obligation to vote for this amendment. Anything less than that is wrong. You can rest assured that the 10,000 missing Americans from the Vietnam and Korean wars didn't fight so that the Senate could short-circuit the legislative process. That is not what they fought for. Ask the families what they fought for. I have a father who died in the Second World War. I know what my family suffered. 
   I know what it is like to grow up without a father. I knew what happened to my father. He was killed serving his country. Many sons and daughters out there have no idea what happened to their loved ones. Wouldn't it be nice if the Senate said we would like to try to find out and that we are willing to attach this to PNTR? This is the least we should do.

   Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I know Senator HOLLINGS is waiting. I just have one more amendment, the so-called division IV. I call up division IV at this time and ask for the yeas and nays on my amendment, division IV. 
   This amendment deals with the environment. Again, this is commission language that simply calls for the commission to report on the progress, or lack thereof, that companies and the Chinese Government are making in China regarding environmental laws. 
   Our companies in America are under strict environmental regulations, yet there are no regulations in China. All this amendment asks is that we monitor these regulations so we can find out what kind of progress is being made on these issues. 
   Over the past 30 years, we have heard a steady stream of arguments that strong environmental protections are necessary, and that punitive sanctions are indispensable, because corporations will sacrifice the long-term public interest in preserving the environment for the sake of short-term profits. 
   For the past 8 years, the Clinton administration has added its voice to that stream. The administration has consistently told us that the American business community cannot be trusted to deal with the environment in a responsible manner unless two conditions are met: First, we must have strong environmental laws on the books. Second, we must ensure that those laws are vigorously enforced--that individual firms can and will be aggressively sanctioned whenever they stray from what those laws allow. 
   To be sure, the Clinton administration has told us that economic progress can neatly coexist with environmental protection--that swords can be turned into plowshares without ruining the land to be tilled. But the administration has not suggested that we should exempt any business or State from compliance with Federal law. 
   Today, we have chance to implement those principles. I offer today an amendment to H.R. 4444 that would require the Commission established by the bill to report on the progress of China in the implementation of laws designed to protect human health, and to protect, restore, and preserve the environment. 
   Let me tell you why we need that amendment: 
   China's environmental record to date is grim: 
   It has been said that China is home to half of the world's 10 most polluted cities.--See www.SpeakOut.com, 5/17/00, Pages 1-2; Friends of the Earth--World Trade, www.Foe.org/international/wto/china.html, Page 1. 
   One source, however, says that the situation has worsened since 1995 and that China now has 8 of the 10 most polluted cities in the world.--See Foreign Broadcast Information Service (FBIS), July 30, 2000, ``China Expert Chen Qingtai Warns of Deteriorating Eco-System,'' Document ID CPP20000730000042, Page 2. 
   Yet another source now puts the number at 9 out of 10.--See China Focus, May 2000: China's Environment,  
   www.virtualchina.com/focus/environment/index.html.  
   ``By the Chinese government's own standards, two-thirds of the 338 Chinese cities for which air quality data are available are polluted. Two-thirds of those are rated `moderately'--though still seriously--or heavily polluted.''--See Michael Dorgan, ``China gets serious about cleaning up its air,'' Knight Ridder/Tribune News Service, August 1, 2000.  
   The Chinese capital of Beijing is one of the those top 10 cities with the world's worst air quality. In Beijing, the annual sulfur dioxide levels are twice the maximum set by the World Health Organization, and the particulates are four times the maximum WHO level.--See House Republican Policy Committee 2 (July 6, 1998). 
   In 1999, ``on one day out of four--Beijing's air quality--reached Level 4--out of 5--when even nonsmokers feel they have the 
   lungs of the Marlboro Man, or Level 5, when it's so toxic that a few breaths can leave a person dizzy and nearby buildings seem lost in a filthy fog.''--See Michael Dorgan, ``China gets serious about cleaning up its air,'' Knight Ridder/Tribune News Service, August 1, 2000. 
   An estimated 2 million people die each year in China from air and water pollution.--See Friends of the Earth--World Trade,  
   www.Foe.org.international/wto/china.html, Page 1.  
   Water pollution in China is widespread and toxic. IN fact, 80 percent of China's rivers are so polluted that fish cannot live in them.--See www.SpeakOut.com, 5/17/00, Page 2. 
   ``[T]he 25 billion tons of unfiltered industrial pollutants that the Chinese sent into their waterways in 1991 gave Communist China `more toxic water pollution in that one country than in the whole of the Western world.' ''--See House Republican Policy Committee 2 (July 6, 1998), quoting Gregg Easterbrook. 
   A recent report from the Ministry of Water Resources of the Chinese Government states that the water supply to as many as 300 million people in China fails the Chinese Government's health standard. 
   In addition, according to the China Economic Times, Chinese Ministry of Water Resources report said that 46 percent of China's more than 700 rivers were polluted, meaning that they fell within Grade 4 or 5 of the Chinese Government's 5-Grade water quality rating system. Under that rating system, Grade 1 is deemed clean and suitable for consumption, while Grade 5 is considered undrinkable. Ministry experts explained that industrial pollution was the main source of contamination. Those experts estimated that factories produced about 60 billion tons of waste and sewage each year and that 80 percent of that waste and sewage was discharged into rivers without treatment. 
   Ninety percent of the water sources in China's urban areas are severely polluted. 
   Acid rain degrades forest and farm land, and imposes an annual cost of an estimated $1.8 billion in economic losses.--See  
   www.greenpeace-china.org.hk/ press/19991101 Xpr X00.html.  
   China is the world's largest producer of chlorofluorocarbons, the chemicals that are said to be responsible for destroying the ozone layer.--See www.SpeakOut.com, 5/17/00, Page 2. 
   China already consumes more coal in energy production than any other nation. Energy planners expect that China's coal consumption will double, if not triple, by the year 2020. If China's coal use increases as expected over the next two decades, that growth alone will increase global greenhouse gas emissions by 17 percent--all but dooming efforts by the rest of the world to reduce a 50-70-percent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. See Mark Hertsgaard (July 19, 2000). 
   By 2020, China will become the world's largest emitter of greenhouse gases.--See www.SpeakOut.com, 5/17/00, Page 3. 
   Why is the environmental such a disaster in China today? The answer is simple--the people of China do not enjoy political and economic freedom. Per capita emissions in China are 75 percent higher than in Brazil, which has an economy of similar size. The difference is that the autocratic, Communist government in China robs the 
   people of that nation of the ability to seek both a prosperous economy and a healthy environment. 
   A free people will not consent to the type of environmental degradation seen today in China. Since 1970, in this nation we have been unwilling to put up with a far less dangerous state of affairs than China has today. We have enacted and enforced strong environmental protection laws, and we have supported environmental preservation in our decisions as consumers and as contributors to charitable causes. 
   Moreover, prosperity not only is compatible with a clean environment, prosperity also is a precondition for it. A rich people will have the ability to recognize the long-term benefits of preservation. Mature free market economies make increasingly efficient uses of resources, while leaving a smaller footprint on the air, the water, and the land. 
   Under our current law, we can urge China gradually to improve its environmental performance as a condition to being granted normal trading privileges. We lose that option if we pass H.R. 4444. For that reason, this bill is our only, and last best, chance to exercise leverage in order to influence China's decision in the environmental field. 
   We believe that laws such as the Clean Air Act are necessary for the health of this nation. Why should we expect less for anyone else--particularly China? We believe that enforcement is necessary for law to be meaningful in this nation? Why should we expect anything different across the Pacific? We believe that a sound economy and a healthy environment can and should be attained from the Atlantic to the Pacific? Why should we expect less from Pacific to the South China Sea? 
   There also is no good reason why, in the name of environmentalism, we should impose a greater burden on American citizens than we expect other countries to impose on themselves. 
   China now has 20 percent of the world's population, so what China does environmentally greatly affects everyone else. All that this amendment does it to require the Commission created by this legislation to monitor and report on China's efforts to protect the environment. 
   Former U.N. Ambassador Jeanne Kirkpatrick once criticized my colleagues across the aisle for their tendency to ``Blame America First''--that is, for their belief that there must be something wrong with this great Nation that causes the world's ills. Keep that in mind when you consider this amendment. If laws such as the Clean Air Act and the Clean Water Act are necessary for the environmental health of this Nation, then those laws--or something analogous--are necessary for China, too. That is, they are necessary unless you believe in a policy of ``Restrict America First, Always, and Only.'' There is no good reason for us to give up our opportunity to ensure that annually we can encourage, cajole, or prod China into improving its environment, for its sake and for everyone's, until we are sure that China no longer will be the world's superpolluter. 
   You might ask why China is such an environmental disaster. The same reason the Soviet Union was. The answer is, the people of China, as in the Soviet Union, don't enjoy political and economic freedom. Per capita emissions in China are 75 percent higher than in Brazil, which has an economy of similar size. They don't have a choice. They don't care. The Government doesn't care. They don't have a choice to clean it up. We could make a difference if we monitored this, talked about this to the world, brought this out each year in the commission report on PNTR. A free people would not consent to this kind of stuff, as we haven't--to this type of environmental degradation. Moreover, prosperity is not only compatible with a clean air environment, but a precondition for it. 
   So I hope we can move forward on this amendment and allow for the commission to monitor these environmental disasters, where we apply one standard to our Government and no standard to a government making huge profits as a result of our trade. 
   Again, this is a very noncontroversial amendment but one I think all of my colleagues who say they are pro-environment ought to support. I guess I am going to draw the conclusion that if you can't vote for this, you are pro-environment for America but not the rest of the world--especially China. That is kind of sad. I hope I will have support on this amendment, as well as the other amendment. 
   I ask for the yeas and nays.

   Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, very shortly there will be a vote on one of the divisions in my amendment to the PNTR legislation. This is a particular odious practice that occurs now in China called organ harvesting. It is hard to imagine that any nation in the world today would conduct activities as odious as this, but it does happen.  
   As we know from the debate that has been occurring on the permanent normal trade relations with China, most of the predictions are it is going to pass, perhaps overwhelmingly. I personally oppose the legislation. But if we are going to pass it, I believe we have an obligation to at least call to the attention of the rest of the world, and frankly to our own people here in America, the barbaric practices that are occurring in this country to which we are about to give permanent normal trade status. 
   Permanent is a pretty strong word. Permanent means permanent. Under the permanent normal trade relations bill, there is a process for monitoring the activities. There is a commission that is set up. My amendment is very simple. It says:  
   The Commission shall monitor the actions of the government of the People's Republic of China with respect to its practice of harvesting and transplanting organs for profit from prisoners that it executes.  
   So all my colleagues know, this amendment simply says the commission shall monitor these activities in China as best they can and report to the American people what they find. I believe very strongly it is wrong for us as a nation to look the other way and say it is OK to make money, to trade with China, sell our agricultural products, and ignore these types of human rights violations. 
   In the debate yesterday I discussed this briefly. We heard a lot about not delaying the bill. The House has sent us over a bill--which, by the way they amended, they added some things to the monitoring--and they sent it back to the Senate. Now many of my colleagues who are supporting PNTR are saying: Let's not delay this. If we agree to these amendments, the Smith amendment or the Thompson amendment or the Wellstone amendment or any other amendment that has been offered, we are going to delay the process. Maybe it is a good idea to call attention to the fact they are harvesting organs obtained unwillingly by executing prisoners, but we don't want to mess up the whole debate here. We do not want to mess up an agreement we have with the House. 
   We go to conference on hundreds of bills year after year. We are going to go to conference on 13 appropriations bills. It is what you do. That is why we have a House and a Senate. It is what the Founding Fathers wanted us to do. So if it takes a few days or a few hours--most likely a few minutes--to conference an amendment such as the one we are about to vote on, which I am about to speak on in a moment--if it takes a few minutes to have the House agree to it, so what. What is the big deal? 
   This is very disturbing. Yet my colleagues are saying to other colleagues: Don't vote for the Smith amendment, the 
   Wellstone amendment, the Helms amendment, the Thompson amendment, or any other amendment because it is going to require us to have to conference with the House, and therefore it might slow the bill down. 
   If we are giving permanent status to China, what is a few more minutes? If we pass it, the House passes it, we amend it here, send it over to the House this morning or this afternoon, by dinnertime the House agrees to it, puts it on the President's desk, he has breakfast tomorrow morning--has a glass of juice, coffee, whatever, a muffin--and then signs the bill. What is lost? 
   When we do that, we could get some of these amendments. This monitoring language we should have in this bill. To do otherwise, with all due respect to my colleagues, is simply to say: I am going to look the other way while organ harvesting takes place in China. We don't want to rock the boat. We don't want to offend the Chinese. We don't want to make anybody unhappy. We don't want to offend the House because they didn't put it in, so therefore we are not going to conference this. We don't want to rock the boat. 
   That is wrong. To put it bluntly, that is wrong. 
   Let me speak briefly about the content of my amendment. Organ harvesting, there was an expose done on this in 1997 by ABC News. This is not BOB SMITH talking. This is one of the three major networks that televised a documentary on the practice of organ harvesting in Communist China. In that documentary, in 1997, it depicted prisoners--these are not necessarily murderers. These are just prisoners. Some of them just put in there, actually charged with nothing--so-called crimes against the state. But it showed prisoners who were videotaped, lined up against a wall and executed with a bullet directly to the head. This, unlike a lethal injection, preserves the organs for harvesting. 
   The documentary also claimed the prisoners were executed on a routine basis. This was not an exception. Their organs were sold to people who were willing to pay up to $30,000 for a kidney, for example. 
   Human rights organizations have estimated that at that time, the time the documentary aired, more than 10,000 kidneys alone--just kidneys, not to mention any other organs--10,000 kidneys alone from Chinese prisoners had been sold, potentially bringing in tens of millions of dollars to--guess where the money goes--the Chinese military. Does this sound like Huxley's ``Brave New World'' or what--executing prisoners to get their organs to get the money to the Chinese military. 
   The Chinese Government, as it does with most human rights abuses, denies this practice takes place. But it is important to keep in mind that China does not have a rule of law. 
   Prisoners are subject to arbitrary arrest and arbitrary punishment without due process. People of religious faith, environmental activists, human rights activists, opponents of coercive abortion, student demonstrators, and anyone who appears to be questioning or challenging the Government of China is subject to harassment, intimidation, arrest, incarceration, including in the infamous laogai, or slave labor camps, and, in certain cases, execution. 
   When Tiananmen Square occurred in 1989, peaceful student protesters, including the sons and daughters of the Communist Party's elite, were mowed down, run over by PLA tanks. There are far fewer dissidents in China than there were 11 years ago after that experience. 
   Even the Falun Gong, which practices breathing and meditation exercises, has been subject to brutal repression by Chinese authorities, and many of these worshipers have disappeared in the Chinese gulags, and some have died in police custody--great candidates for organ harvesting. 
   ABC's report also found that Chinese nationals living on student visas were marketing these organs to Americans and other foreigners who had the funds to make a $5,000 deposit and who then traveled to China to the People's Liberation Army hospital where they received a kidney transplant. 
   These kidneys are tissue typed and the prisoners are also tissue typed in order to achieve an ideal match. Think about that. Prisoners are executed, some of them for doing nothing more than protesting against the Government of China. They are sent to prison and executed so that people can pay up to $30,000 for one of their kidneys or some other organ, and the money goes to the Chinese military. 
   I ask my colleagues, with all due respect--and I respect the rights of Members to exercise their own views and votes; of course, it goes without saying, but I ask you: Is it unreasonable to ask my colleagues to put this in the monitoring provisions of PNTR so that we can monitor these activities and report to the world what is happening? Is that so bad? If it delays this bill a few hours, if we have to conference it with the House--it is permanent--is that so bad? 
   We might save a few lives. The more the world knows about this, and the more world public pressure comes to the Chinese, we might save some lives. For the sake of a little time before we pass this bill that has been debated now for several days--it has been talked about for a year or two--is it so bad for my colleagues to vote to allow a commission to study and report on this? I ask them, is it really that big a deal for us to try to save people whose basic human right, the right to life, is being denied for the sake of organ donors? To make it worse, in some cases Americans are buying those kidneys, hearts, livers, and other organs. 
   U.S. law prohibits this activity. It is unlawful in the United States for ``any person to knowingly acquire, receive, or otherwise transfer any human organ for valuable consideration for use in human transplantation if the transfer affects interstate commerce.''  
   Congresswoman Linda Smith, before she left office, introduced a resolution 3 years ago which deplored this practice and called upon the administration to bar from entry to the United States any Chinese official directly involved in the practice of organ harvesting. It urged the prosecution of individuals engaged in marketing and facilitating these transplants under U.S. law. 
   There is no one in the House or Senate who would not recognize the name of Harry Wu, the renowned human rights activist and Chinese dissident who was arrested in China, detained, and finally released. Thanks to the work of Laogai Research Foundation, we are aware of ongoing Chinese engagement in organ harvesting of executed prisoners. 
   It is unreasonable, it is unfair for us to add this provision that will expose this to the world and say, once and for all, that it is wrong and that we are not going to allow ourselves to be dragged into saying that, for the sake of profit, for the sake of selling wheat, corn, rice, and other agricultural products, for the sake of greed and profit, we are going to ignore this? How can we do that in good conscience? 
   The sad part, frankly--the American people may not understand this--about what is happening in the Senate is that people are saying: Don't vote for the Smith amendment because that is going to slow the process down; don't vote for it. 
   It is not going to slow the process down enough to matter, and this is important. It is a commission. It is a study. That is all it is, and that is all we are asking. 
   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to print an article on incidents regarding organ harvesting in the RECORD.

   Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to vote for the Smith amendment on organ harvesting. Do not listen to the talk on the floor that we need to stay together on PNTR and not have any amendments which might slow down the process. I urge my colleagues to vote yes not only on the Smith amendment but other amendments that are offered by colleagues that will expose some of the basic human rights violations that have occurred in China and are still occurring in China. It is wrong to look the other way and to sanction it while we provide aid, food, and trade to this nation.

   Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I am proud to stand in support of the Helms amendment. On August 24 of this year, publications all around the world ran headlines very similar to this:  
   Chinese kill baby to enforce birth rule.  
   The article went on to describe how five Chinese Government officials intruded into the home of a woman who had given birth against the state's oppressive ``one child'' policy. They waited in her living room until she returned from the hospital. When she arrived, the officials ripped the baby boy from her arms where--to the horror of his mother and onlookers--they walked outside to a rice paddy and drowned the child in front of his parents' eyes. 
   A wave of anger obviously enveloped this small township in the following hours of the child's murder. However, this is China. Villagers are kept from speaking out against this atrocity, and they find themselves in a terrible state of unified silence as a fear of retribution, harm, or even death for their own families settles upon them. 
   This is the China to which we are giving permanent trade status with this bill. I find it unbelievable that we cannot get these kinds of human rights atrocities addressed in this permanent normal trade relations bill for China. We are saying this is fine, we will ignore it, not talk about it, as long as we can sell them wheat, corn, whatever, and make money. So we can ignore this. 
   I am the first to admit we cannot intrude, unfortunately, into the policies of the Government of China, but we can make known these policies to the world and we can say as a nation, supposedly the moral leader of the world, that this is wrong. 
   I am proud of Senator HELMS for bringing this to the attention of the Senate during this debate, and I cannot understand, for the life of me, why we cannot allow simple sense-of-the-Senate language to this permanent normal trade relations bill in an effort to stop this horrible, barbaric behavior. 
   The Helms amendment simply expresses the sense of Congress that, one, Congress should urge China to cease its forced abortion and forced sterilization policies, and two, the President should urge China to cease its detention of those who resist abortion and sterilization. It is a good amendment. There is nothing wrong with this amendment. It is fair and it is reasonable. 
   In addition, I also believe that Chinese women should have the right to choose. It is interesting, those who have been the strongest proponents of abortion in this Chamber--when it comes to a Chinese woman's right to say, ``I want to have my child,'' the silence is deafening. When a woman says, ``I have the right to choose to have an abortion,'' they are out here in full force. A little inconsistency? 
   The point is, a Chinese woman is told, in spite of the fact she wants to  have her child, that she cannot, and not only can she not have it, it is aborted forcefully. 
   I had constituents, a young couple, a few months ago come to me. They were both Chinese. They had been visiting America. She was about 5 or 6 months pregnant and was told if she went back to China the child was going to be aborted. I turned all hands on deck to get that case resolved so they did not have to go back, and she did not go back. She had that child, now an American citizen, born in freedom, but that child would have been aborted in China against the wishes of the mother. We cannot even get this issue addressed with sense-of-the-Senate language before we pass on the fast track permanent normal trade relations. 
   There is so much talk about choice, but the choice only runs one way--when one is talking about the woman's ``right'' to an abortion. When it comes to the right to choose to have her baby, silence. 
   It is a stated position of the Chinese Communist Party that forced abortion and forced sterilization have no role in the population control program. In fact, the Chinese Communist Government encourages both forced abortion and forced 
   sterilization. I emphasize ``forced.'' They accomplish this through a combination of strictly enforced birth quotas and immunity for local population control officials who use coercion to force abortion. 
   Nobody really knows for sure how many women undergo these abortions. We do not exactly have a population count on that score. Most women are afraid to report. The numbers are kept secret. 
   According to Harry Wu, the director of the Laogai Research Foundation, who once lived in China and now monitors and writes about his native homeland, the city of Janjiang alone experienced 1,141 forced abortions in one 9-month period in 1997. Those were women who wanted to have their children and were forced to have an abortion. 
   One can imagine the horror of the woman who has to go through that. I say with the greatest respect for those who disagree with the issue, where are you today? If you are for a woman's right to choose to have an abortion, why can you not be for a woman's right not to have one? Why the silence? Where are the votes on this amendment? 
   I want to spend the next minute or two telling about one brave woman who dared to come out of Red China to talk about this so-called planned birth policy. Her name is Ms. Gao. She testified before the House Subcommittee on International Operations and Human Rights a couple of years ago. According to Ms. Gao, in order to successfully carry out the policy, precise records of the women in her province were compiled, noting their names, births, marriages, pregnancies, reproductive cycles--all sorts of information. 
   Women who met the planned birth committee's criteria were then issued a ``birth allowance,'' while those women who did not meet the criteria were given ``birth not allowed'' notices. 
   This is the country to which we are giving permanent normal trade relations. Senator HELMS is not forcing us to do anything except to put this language in the bill as a sense of the Senate that alerts the world to this practice. That is all he is asking. We are told if we support Senator HELMS, we are going to delay the passage of the bill. So? Permanent is permanent. What are a few more days, hours, minutes? I venture to say, if we sent this back to the House with the Helms language in it, it would take the House about 5 minutes to approve it, and that would be the end of it. 
   What they are really afraid of is offending the Chinese--that is what this is about--because we do not want to lose the sales of our agricultural products. Sales of agricultural products are more important than the lives of children who are forcibly killed in front of their parents. If a woman is found to be pregnant and does not possess a birth-allowed certificate, she is immediately given an abortion, no matter how far along the pregnancy is. I repeat--no matter how far along the pregnancy is. 
   Enforcement is a crucial component of China's planned parenthood policies. Mandatory medical inspections for women of childbearing age is required. One can imagine the secrecy, trying to hide the fact you are pregnant if you want to have the child, maybe even keeping it from your own family, certainly friends, relatives, for fear you are going to be turned in to Big Brother, Communist China Government. Those who fail to undertake these medical examinations at the preordained time face jail and monetary fines. 
   Night raids to apprehend women in violation of state policy are frequent. Where are the proponents of women's rights on this debate? Why are they not standing with Senator HELMS? 
   If the Chinese Government cannot locate the woman, they will detain her husband or her parent or anyone in her family until she comes forward and surrenders to have that abortion. 
   This is happening in China. Let's not kid ourselves. Let's not pretend it does not happen. It is happening in China. 
   I want to read from Ms. Gao's testimony in 1998. It is pretty compelling, and it is not pleasant. She said:  
   Once I found a woman who was 9 months pregnant but did not have her birth-allowed certificate. According to the policy, she was forced to undergo an abortion surgery. In the operation room, I saw how the aborted child's lips were sucking, how its limbs were stretching. A physician injected poison into its skull, and the child died and was thrown into a trash can. To help a tyrant do evils was not what I wanted ..... I could not live with this on my conscience. I, too, after all, am a mother.  
   She goes on to say:  
   All of those 14 years, I was a monster in the daytime, injuring others--  
   and killing babies--  
   by the Chinese communist authorities' barbaric planned-birth policy, but in the evening, I was like all other women and mothers, enjoying my life with my children. I could not live such a dual life anymore. Here, to all those injured women, to all those children who were killed, I want to repent and say sincerely that I'm sorry! I want to be a real human being. It is also my sincere hope that what I describe here today can lead you to give your attention to this issue, so that you can extend your arms to save China's women and children.  
   Senator HELMS has fulfilled that lady's expectations by bringing this to the attention of the Senate, the American people, and the world, on behalf of China's women and children. 
   What is a real shame is, what the Senator is asking here will be rejected as we vote no. 
   Finally, Ms. Mao stated:  
   My conscience was always gnawing at my heart.  
   You see, because the official religion of the Chinese Government is atheism, as it is with all Communist regimes, their policies and officials do not have to answer to any higher power except to the state. There is no sense of morality behind their Government's decisionmaking process. 
   But let me ask a very poignant question. Is there a sense of our morality to ignore it? What does it say about our morality to say we will sell corn and wheat and make a profit and ignore this? Why not say: Stop this and we will sell you the corn and the wheat? Isn't that better? Aren't we supposed to be the moral leader? 
   When God is absent, human life is invaluable, isn't it? It does not have much meaning because we are children under God. If you do not believe that, then life has no meaning other than how it exists here on this Earth. 
   That is why you have forced abortions. That is why you have persecution. That is why you have guns pointed at students' heads. That is why you have tanks poised to run over protesters. 
   That is why you have harvested organs. I talked about that this morning in my amendment, I say to Senator HELMS, which got 29 votes, including the Senator's, for which I am very grateful. They also do that. That is another issue. China harvests organs--not from willing donors--from prisoners who sometimes do nothing more than protest against the state. They are executed by being shot in the head, and then organs are taken and sold for $30,000 apiece for a kidney, and the money is given to the Chinese military. 
   We lost on that amendment, I say to Senator HELMS, by a vote of 60-something to 29. What does that say? That we are unwilling to send this back to the House for 5 or 10 minutes in conference and pass it? 
   That is why I am strongly supporting this amendment by Senator HELMS. I am proud to support this amendment. I am proud to stand here on the floor of the Senate and say that this is wrong.  Sometimes you have to say things whether you win the debate or not. Sometimes it does not matter whether you win the debate or not; it is just having the debate that matters. 
   His amendment would encourage the Chinese Government to stop this atrocity, to stop this barbaric act, to stop forcing abortion on unborn children and forcing women to have those abortions. 
   It is not unreasonable to ask my colleagues to support this amendment which is vital to human rights in China. It is vital to the rights of a woman and it is vital to the rights of a child.

   Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, in the remaining couple of moments, I will just conclude by saying, I have been out here a number of times following, frankly, in the huge footsteps of Senator HELMS, in a very small way, to talk about protecting the lives of unborn children. 
   But this goes far beyond that. This debate now has taken a new level. It is now forcing abortions on women against their wishes. I hope that someday Senator HELMS and I, and others, will have the opportunity to stand here in the well and see this practice of abortion ended in this country. Because who knows what is next? If we do not respect the lives of our children, then what do we respect? 
   Children are a lot smarter than we give them credit for. I have raised three. A lot of you out there listening to me now have raised more than that. They are smart. They know when you say: Johnny, go off to school, be a good boy today, mind your teacher--meanwhile we will abort your sister. 
   Forty million children have died in this country alone from abortion. Those 40 million children will never get to be a Senator, a spectator in the gallery, a mother, a pastor, a CEO. They are never going to have the chance to be a page. They never had a chance, 40 million of them. We did. 
   So maybe we should not be too surprised that the Senate is willing to look the other way while they do it in China. We should not be real surprised. But someday I pray that I will be able to stand here and say thank you to at least 67 of my colleagues who put a  stop to it. Maybe that day will happen some time in my lifetime. I sure look forward to it. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, yesterday and today we heard my distinguished colleague, Senator THOMPSON, speak eloquently on the whole issue of the Chinese nonproliferation amendment. It is interesting that no one in the Senate wants to give us the opportunity to amend the legislation for fear somehow it might mess it up. On the other hand, it did not bother the House. They amended HR 4444 and sent it over here, and I believe the Senate has a responsibility to do likewise. Frankly, I believe we have that right to offer amendments, such as the Thompson amendment, whether I agree or disagree with it. I believe people ought to vote on those amendments based on how they feel about it. 
   This is a very important issue. Permanent meant permanent when I went to school. When you say ``permanent normal trade relations with China,'' permanent means permanent. I am going to touch on a number of issues, including the subject Senator THOMPSON has spoken so eloquently on over the past couple of days, but there are many other issues one might want to stop and have serious reflections on whether or not this is really what we want to do. 
   To the leader's credit, he has given us ample opportunity to have these debates. As Senator THOMPSON just said, one gets the feeling that it is a foregone conclusion; that we are wasting our time; we are basically taking the Senate's time for no apparent reason;  that it is already in the cards; that everybody is for permanent normal trade relations; we do not have to worry; we are just wasting time. 
   We waste a lot of time around here. I suppose we can say some of the greatest debates of all time have taken place in this Chamber. If it is a waste of time, so be it, but I believe these comments should be made, and I believe they ought to be considered. If people want to vote against the Thompson amendment, a Smith amendment, or other amendments, they have every right to do so. If they want to say proliferation matters, then they have a right to do so, and they will have a right to vote. 
   I applaud Senator THOMPSON for adding this amendment to the PNTR debate. He has been involved in the committee investigating some of these matters. He is able. He knows about these issues. It would be a shame if the Senate did not heed what he has advised them to consider. 
   I believe one of the greatest threats to the U.S. today is China's proliferation of weapons of mass destruction--nuclear, chemical, and biological, all three--and the means to deploy them; not just produce them, but have the mechanism to deploy them. We do not know whether they have the will or the desire. We do not deal with will and desire. What we deal with is capability. 
   This is a fact. This is not opinion, as Senator THOMPSON has pointed out. It is a fact that the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction--biological, chemical and nuclear--are occurring today by the Chinese. It is a fact. Despite words to the contrary, China continues to transfer technology to Pakistan, Iran, North Korea, and Libya. One can say: Fine, I do not care; it is more important to sell my agricultural products to China than it is to worry about proliferation of nuclear and missile technology. 
   That is fine if that is your opinion, but do not come to the floor and say that it is not happening because it is happening. This technology is being transferred to North Korea, to Libya, to Iran, and to Pakistan. It is happening, and that is a fact. One can say: Fine, I don't care about that; we will go ahead and feed the people who are doing it, but it is a fact that this technology is being transferred. 
   The Director of Central Intelligence reported on August 9 that China remains a ``key supplier,'' his words, of these technologies, particularly missile or chemical technology transfers. Some of these transfers have raised questions about violations of the Non-Proliferation Treaty which China signed and contradictions to the Missile Technology Control Regime which China promised to abide by, and U.S. laws, violations which may require sanctions. 
   China has not joined some of the international nonproliferation groups. The Clinton-Gore administration policy of ``comprehensive engagement'' with Beijing seeking to improve bilateral relations has failed. It is time for a tougher approach to advance U.S. nonproliferation interests. 
   This is not about coming out here and beating up on a country. The facts are the facts. They threatened Taiwan. They have threatened us if we interfere with them threatening Taiwan. They have actively engaged in seeking to control the Long Beach naval shipyard, the Panama Canal, and other regions in the Caribbean, and yet we are supposed to stand by and ignore this threat, all of it in the name of free trade. 
   Not only are we supposed to ignore it, we are not even supposed to have a vote on it; we are just wasting the Senate's time to point out that this is happening in the world today. 
   Maybe Senators have made up their minds, but I want to speak to the American people because, frankly, I am not sure the American people have made up their minds on this issue. Maybe they need to know. 
   I ask you: If you are a parent with a 17- 18- 19-year-old son or daughter--I have one 21 and one 18--whether or not you feel safe in providing this country of China with permanent normal trade relations; that is, giving them the best opportunities we can to trade with them and you are not worried about the fact that they are spreading weapons of mass destruction all over the world. If you are not, then I think you should sit silently and say to yourself: I am going to get my way; the Senators are going to vote the way I want them to vote. But if you are not satisfied, then you ought to let your Senators know because we are going to have a vote on this in the very near future. 
   Many in this body are adamantly opposed to amending this trade legislation. They argue that trade and national security concerns are not connected. We should go ahead and trade with China. We open up our country. We open up the dialog. We open up debate and just ignore all the other issues. Proliferation, human rights abuses, religious persecution, and all the other issues I plan to speak about will take care of itself. Don't worry about China. They will not hurt us. Don't worry about it. Just keep trading with them and provide more assistance. 
   No one is talking about ignoring 1 billion-plus people in the world. That is not what this debate is about. No one proposes to ignore them. I do not propose to ignore them. No one proposes to not talk with them or not to have relations with them. That is not what we are talking about. 
   What we are talking about is permanently establishing these normal trade relations, which gives them benefits that American companies do not even have and American citizens do not have. So if you want people who are trying to spread weapons of mass destruction all over the world--chemical, biological, and nuclear--to have better situations--their companies don't have to abide by environmental standards; they put people in slave labor in the textile mills, or whatever, for 50 cents a day--if that does not bother you, then fine, don't call your Senators and tell them. Leave it alone. They are going to vote your way. But if it does bother you, you may want to speak up. 
   This amendment, the Thompson amendment, is very relevant. People should be heard on it. Every Senator should be heard on it. 
   The Chinese Government realizes we are willing to abdicate our national security concerns to gain access to their meager markets at all costs. You think the Chinese are not watching this debate? You think they don't know what is going on? Here is what they are hearing: You know what. These guys will do anything to get our business. They will do anything to get our business. They will let us go ahead and spread weapons of mass destruction all over the world. They don't care about that. The United States will let us move into Panama and threaten the people of Taiwan as long as we can buy their corn and their wheat. Man, that is a good deal for us. 
   Boy, I will bet they are laughing in Beijing right now at this debate. But I will tell you what. If it ever comes, God forbid, to a conflict in the future, if you have a son or a daughter in that conflict, you are not going to be laughing. That is the reality. That is the way life is. 
   Ronald Reagan stood firm against the Soviet Union; and it worked. When President Reagan told Gorbachev to tear the Berlin Wall down, he tore it down. We won the Cold War because we stood firm. We did not kowtow to the threats and the intimidation to sell products. Some wanted us to, but we didn't. 
   Leaders in China believe the actions of this body are a foregone conclusion--over and done. The Chinese have acted accordingly by continuing to proliferate nuclear and missile technology during this whole process. It is still going on, as is evident by the latest report from the Director of the CIA. They are still doing it. And we are still going to give them permanent normal trade relations. 
   Sometimes--and I have been on both sides of many issues; I have lost debates and I have won debates--sometimes you have to have the debate. You know what. I want history to judge me on what my position is on this issue. I hope to God that I never ever have to come back to the Senate floor and say: See, I told you so. 
   I hope tomorrow the Chinese all become democrats--little ``d''--and we become one big, happy world family between the Chinese and the Americans. I hope that happens. 
   You know what, folks. Are you sure that is going to happen? Do you feel real good about that happening based on what is 
   occurring right now as we speak? Spies spying, stealing our secrets, stealing the whole arsenal of our  weapons, and we are about to let the person who stole that--he is going to go free very shortly. We are the laughingstock of the world. Unbelievable. Yet we sit here--so many of us--without even uttering a whimper and criticize those of us who speak up and talk about it, criticize us for even offering amendments to try to stop it. 
   I commend Senator THOMPSON. I admire him. I respect him. I served with him on that committee when he did this investigation. I respect what he has done. He is right. History will judge him right. Those of us who stood up and spoke out, history will judge us right as well. 
   That is all that matters because when you stand up here, you can speak and you can vote. That is about it on the Senate floor. And sometimes you lose. But it doesn't mean you shouldn't be heard. It doesn't mean you are always wrong when you lose. It doesn't mean you are always right, either. 
   The recent release of the State Department's annual human rights report states that China's human rights record has worsened, not improved. Are these the actions of a country that we believe are going to curb their dismal record of missile and weapons of mass destruction proliferation, atrocious human rights violations, or honor their trade agreements signed with the United States? 
   Quite frankly, actions speak louder than words--a trite expression. China has not even attempted to clean up its act. As Congress has debated this issue this year, they have not even attempted to clean it up because they know what the result will be. They have known all along: Free and open trade, and reduced vigilance. Free trade will facilitate the proliferation of technologies and systems for weapons of mass destruction and the means to deploy them. Make no mistake about it. Free and open trade, permanent normal trade relations with the Chinese, will foster the ability of this nation, China, to send weapons of mass destruction around the world, and the means to deploy them. We should speak up on the Senate floor about it. Frankly, we should adopt the Thompson amendment. If that means it defeats PNTR, good. 
   The same technologies that create Chinese space threats to the U.S. also enhance Chinese capabilities. We in Congress should not stand by passively and watch that happen, either. 
   Voting against the Thompson amendment will send a green light to Red China to continue to destabilize regions already mired in centuries-old conflicts. China's proliferation activities have sparked a nuclear arms race on the Indian subcontinent and have assisted Iran's nuclear missile programs, not to mention Libya's desire to become a nuclear power--a very comforting thought. The Chinese are helping Libya, Mr. Qadhafi, to become a nuclear power. I am sure that will comfort everyone. Why not? Let's help them. Let's feed them. Let's trade with them. Let's treat them as if they are a nice nation that does not do any of this; ignore it all, and let Libya be a nuclear power. That will be nice. 
   It is time that this body takes action. I urge Members to reconsider. Those of you who believe that THOMPSON is wrong, I urge you to reconsider that in the face of this debate. 
   It would seem that the main argument against these and every other amendment that is being offered is that since it was not in the House bill, as I said before, then we can't have it in the Senate bill. That, frankly, is an insult to all of us in the Senate. We have an obligation, as I said, to amend if we want to. 
   The proponents argue there can be no conference; that is, don't have the House and Senate sit down to work out any deal. That takes too much time. That is too much trouble. We just want to pass what the House sent over, even though they amended it. 
   Are the proponents suggesting that the Senate will not ask for any more conferences between now and the end of the session on any 
   bill? Are we going to conference appropriations bills? 
   We do 13 conferences usually on appropriations bills. But we can't do a conference on permanent normal trade relations with China? That is the process. The process calls for conferences between the House and the Senates. Even if we conceded that it was too late for a conference, the suggestion that a conference is needed is totally inconsistent with our framework of government. 
   When we pass a bill, it does not go to conference. It goes to the House. We all know that. If the Senate--given the overwhelming support for PNTR in this body--approves some commonsense modifications, then those amendments would eagerly be accepted by the House. It would not be a big deal. If there is an argument over it, fine. We settle the argument, as we do in every conference. 
   So if we amend the bill, it goes to the House. It takes no time. The clerk engrosses the amendments and sends it over. We can pass an amended bill at lunchtime, have it passed in the House in time for the Members to be home for dinner; President Clinton wakes up in the morning, has a little breakfast, and signs the bill. Over and done with. 
   What is the big deal? We make things too complicated around here. Frankly, they are phony arguments, as if this conference is going to take decades to finish. We are going to finish the conference. The fact that we might add a couple of amendments, whether it is proliferation or anything else, to this bill and that it is going to delay the conference and somehow mess up PNTR is nonsense, total nonsense. 
   I taught history. I taught civics. I taught how a bill becomes law. I have been on conferences. I am on two right now, the Department of Defense and the Water Resources Development Act. I can assure you, those bills are much larger and have many more time-consuming issues than this one. But I might ask you, are those bills any more important than this one? I don't think so. So why, then, are we conferencing them and not wanting to conference here? 
   Some have argued that the annual debate over whether to renew this was counterproductive. I would argue that it served as one of the few constraints on Chinese behavior. The fact that we had this debate in the Senate is good. At least China knows there are some of us who are concerned about it. 
   If we yield permanent MFN on PNTR to China, then we forever relinquish one of the few tools we have to foster change in China, which is our agricultural leverage. Unfortunately, since 1989, when MFN was once again renewed despite the carnage at Tiananmen Square witnessed by the rest of the world, the Chinese came quickly to understand that the U.S. Government valued its trading relationship with China above all else. It is a fact; that is how they view it. 
   What is of greatest concern is that a majority in Congress, like the CEOs of many major companies, appear to be mesmerized by this mythical Chinese market and are willing to ignore the egregious conduct. China's conduct should have, at a minimum, postponed China's admittance in the WTO. It is the kind of conduct you cannot ignore. You cannot ignore the atrocities that are occurring in this country. We don't have to ignore it. We can pass amendments to PNTR that highlight those atrocities in an effort to leverage the Chinese to stop it. I will get into some of those in a moment. 
   We are familiar with the 1996 campaign finance scandal where millions of dollars were delivered from China through conduits in an attempt to buy the White House. It was a big embarrassment for our country. We know that China plundered nuclear secrets from our national labs and that in fact, according to our own intelligence agencies, Chinese agents continued to steal that technology in the United States, including from DOE labs. This is happening. Countless news articles have underscored China's dangerous proliferation of missile technology and weapons of mass destruction to rogue regimes all over the world. As I said, two Sovremenny-class destroyers equipped with Sunburn missiles, these missiles were specifically designed to defeat our Aegis system and our carrier battle groups. That is the specific purpose of this class of destroyers. This represents a great leap forward on the part of the Chinese Navy and a serious threat to the 7th fleet and our allies in the Pacific. Are we so blinded by trade and the lure of profits that we can't recognize the danger to our strategic vital interests? Are we that blind? 
   In Hong Kong, only recently turned over to the Chinese Government, news reports over the weekend indicated  that pollsters are being discouraged from reviewing information which shows the declining popularity of Hong Kong's Chief Executive. The Chinese Government has warned businessmen on Taiwan they cannot be pro-independence if they expect to do business with Beijing. The Chinese military on a regular basis truly speaks of invading Taiwan, and the proliferation of missiles aimed at Taiwan lends credibility to this threat. While the Clinton administration rewards Beijing with support for MFN and PNTR and has supported military-to-military exchanges with the People's Liberation Army, it has opposed the Taiwan Security Enhancement Act which seeks to bolster the capabilities of the degraded Taiwanese military and upgrade United States-Taiwan military relations. 
   Most recently and, frankly, most shamefully, the Clinton administration discouraged members of both parties of Congress from even meeting with the democratically elected leader of Taiwan. What an insult. I just don't understand it. We are going to give permanent normal trade relations to China, sell them our products and feed them, and we are not going to offend them by talking to the leader of Taiwan. We are the world's greatest superpower. The rest of the world, I hope, still views us as the land of liberty and the beacon of freedom. And we are afraid to offend China by talking to the leader of Taiwan? What must they think when the administration denies the freedom of assembly, that all Americans enjoy, to a visiting democratically elected dignitary? Think about that. What signal are we sending? Are we not rewarding the intelligence of the regime in Beijing by snubbing the duly elected leader of the Chinese democracy? It is un-American and it is inexplicable. It just can't be about money because, in fact, we sell more goods to Taiwan than we do to China. 
   So why are we doing it? If we sell more goods to China than we do to the People's Republic, why are we snubbing the leader of Taiwan? We won't even talk with him. What is it about this administration that makes it so eager to kowtow to Communist leaders? 
   It may not be an accident. I ask unanimous consent that this be submitted as part of the RECORD.

   Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. This is from Congressman FRANK WOLF, which is a listing of the organizations opposed to PNTR. It is not an accident that most of the veterans organizations are opposed. They are the folks who have sacrificed. The Legion, Veterans of Foreign Wars, Naval Reserve, Fleet Reserve, Amvets, Order of the Purple Hearts; these are the guys who paid the price. They are not for PNTR. They have a right to talk. They have a right to be heard. They have a right to this debate occurring. They have a right to say to those folks who say let's not debate this, let's just pass it: Sorry, we paid the price; we paid the price to have this debate, and we should have this debate. 
   I am standing up for the American Legion and the Veterans of Foreign Wars and the Military Order of the Purple Heart and others. I am proud to do it. They are right. They have been right before. They have been right in the past and they are right now. 
   I conclude on six very brief amendments I have already offered but didn't get an opportunity to speak on the other day because of time constraints. 
   There is a commission that is created under this permanent normal trade relations bill to monitor certain levels of Chinese cooperation. One of the amendments I introduced last week was called the POW-MIA amendment. The purpose is to monitor the level of Chinese cooperation on the POW-MIA issue and to pass this information on to the American people as part of an annual report the commission will issue. All I am asking is that this be part of the commission's report, that we do a study on this, put it into the report. That is all the amendment is. 
   I have been a longtime advocate of the POW issue. I believe the U.S. Government should make every effort to account for its missing servicemen in our Nation's conflicts, all of them. I am sure my colleagues would agree that we have a solemn obligation to these brave men and women and their families. There are over 10,000 accounted for American soldiers, airmen, and marines from the North Korean, Vietnam, and cold wars. The fate of many of these Americans, especially from the Korean war, could be easily clarified and determined by the People's Republic of China. 
   I have written to the People's Republic of China. They have basically ignored my letters. They are not willfully coming forth with information. This is a humanitarian issue. What is wrong with having an amendment that says the Chinese should cooperate and help us account for our missing? Yet the sponsors of this bill are saying don't vote for the Smith amendment--it is being put around here on all the desks--don't vote for the Smith amendment because it will cause a problem. If we sent it over to the House, the House would have to agree that we should account for our missing POWs, that we ought to ask the Chinese to help us. Don't complicate things, don't put that amendment on. 
   I hope the American people are listening. Don't complicate PNTR by having China help us find our missing. Really. Unbelievable. 
   Let me share a small fraction of information that leads me to believe China knows a lot more than they are telling us. It is precisely this type of information that makes it all the more important for the Chinese to cooperate. I know some people say that is just a bunch of baloney, the Chinese don't have any information on POWs and MIAs. There are numerous declassified CIA intelligence reports from the 1950s that indicate Chinese knowledge about American POWs from the Korean war. I will enter all of these in the RECORD, but let me cite a couple of them. 
   Central Intelligence Agency, May of 1951, subject: American prisoners of war in Canton, China. It goes on to describe the sighting. June 1951, subject: American prisoners of war in South China. It goes on to talk about it. Fifty-two American prisoners were incarcerated in a Baptist church in Canton, on and on. A staff member of the state security bureau in Seoul on 12 February stated--this is 1951--that all American prisoners of war were sent to camps in China, Manchuria, where they were put to hard labor in mines and factories. Documented, and yet they don't give us any answers. 
   Prisoners of war in Communist China is another subject. In 1961, another report; another report in September 1951. American prisoners of war in Communist China; Chinese student had a sighting. 
   Whether these are true or not--I make no representation whether or not they are, but they have been brought to our attention. We know the Chinese have information as to what happened to those people. Yet, I repeat: We are told not even to amend PNTR because it is going to cause a couple of minutes of delay over on the House side to conference this and get it in there. 
   That is a real fine ``how do you do'' for the people who served our Nation and are now missing Americans. That is a fine ``how do you do.'' 
   I hope Senators who oppose this amendment can look into the eyes of the families of those prisoners and say: I had to do this because I wanted China's permanent status so badly, I couldn't care less whether I got any information on POWs and MIAs; I am going to be able to look in the mirror quite fine. 
   I could go on and on through 100 more. I have them. But I am not going to do that.  
   Secretary Cohen, to his credit, raised this issue with the Chinese during his visit to China last summer at my request. He raised it very forcefully. Once again, the Chinese simply said: We don't have any information on your POWs. And under their breath, as they walked out of the room, they said: What the heck, we have going to get PNTR anyway. Why bother? It is a foregone conclusion. 
   They make billions and billions of dollars in trade with the United States. Shame on us if we fail to demand that they provide answers on our missing servicemen. Shame on us for the sake of a few minutes in a conference with the House of Representatives--shame, shame, shame, shame. 
   Three-hundred and twenty-thousand Chinese military personnel served in Vietnam from 1965 to 1970. It seems to me pretty likely that some of those troops could tell us something about what they saw in Vietnam that may account for 1, 2, 3, 10, or 100 of our missing. We need the Chinese to tell us what they know. 
   Although I am opposed to permanent normal trade relations with China, this amendment would address these concerns. And at least, if it passes, it would be in there so that we would be saying to the Chinese: Here is your PNTR, but at least we care about our missing; help us. No. It might take a few minutes in conference. We can't do that. 
   The second amendment I offered deals with Chinese companies. 
   According to the proponents of PNTR, surrendering America's only real leverage to Communist China's actions on a myriad of national security and human rights issues is being heralded as a win-win scenario for the American people and the oppressed Chinese. This not only false, but it is detrimental to the American people and U.S. national security. 
   In the zeal to gain potential profits in China, we will be surrendering our most useful leverage tool that can be used to redirect China's atrocious human rights, religious persecution, and increasingly belligerent military. The proponents of PNTR have claimed that the Chinese citizens will enjoy economic prosperity and eventually democratic freedoms. 
   Both of these assumptions are uncertain. However, what is certain and can be tangibly observed right now is that the PLA and their companies--many of them increasingly high-tech in scope--are eagerly anticipating the benefits and profits of increased exposure to American consumers in the United States. It is almost ``laugh-out-loud funny'' to hear people say those companies in China don't have anything to do with the Government, that they are private companies. Hello. Private companies in China? Maybe you 
   ought to look at the Lippo flow chart, and how all of that works, and find out where it leads. Where does the trail lead to all of these companies? It leads directly to the People's Liberation Army. That is where it leads--to the Chinese Communist leaders. 
   Without a doubt, PNTR will facilitate and improve the People's Liberation Army's military capabilities. The profit they will make and the money we are going to provide them in these sales is going to go directly into the technology spread of weapons of mass destruction and improve their military capabilities, which--may God forbid and I hope not--may be used against us in the future. 
   Experts have concluded that the U.S. trade deficit with China is expected to grow if China wins PNTR. Our deficit will grow. That means more capital for China to modernize its military. That is what it means. Let's face it. Fine. OK. We sell wheat. Great. Sell corn. Great. Enjoy your profits, because let me tell you where it is going: More capital to China to modernize its military. 
   As PLA companies gain increased access to U.S. high-tech, dual-use technology, they will be able to buy increasingly advanced weapons from Russia and other nations. What they can't build they can buy. 
   To illustrate, the PLA navy has been aggressively improving its surface fleet by purchasing, as I said earlier, state-of-the-art Sovremenny-class destroyers from Russia. The Chinese military's ability to purchase these types of weapon platforms poses a direct threat to U.S. Navy aircraft carrier battle groups in the Pacific and our friends in Taiwan. 
   Is there anyone out there listening with a son or a daughter on a military or Navy ship in the South Pacific? You ought to be worried. You ought to be thinking about what your Senators are going to shortly do here. They are going to provide the capability of the Chinese military to knock those carriers and those destroyers right out of the water with the most sophisticated technology known to mankind. We are going to help them do it. We are going to help them do it. 
   If somebody wants to come down here and debate that and tell me that is not the case, come on down. 
   Currently the U.S. Navy has no defense--none--against the Sunburn missile which the Sovremenny destroyers of the Chinese military could use against U.S. aircraft carriers with 3,000 or 4,000 people, and some have as many as 6,000 people. It is a vulnerable city out there with your sons and daughters on it, and we are helping them to have the capacity to knock it out. 
   While many have opted to dismiss the national security risks that will accompany China PNTR, our own intelligence apparatus--that is the worst part of this for me to deal with. Our own intelligence has identified the threat the United States faces from trade. They have told us. It is not an opinion. They have directly told us trading with China threatens our national security. It threatens our national security, and we still ignore it. Not only do we ignore it, but we are being told not to debate it. 
   According to the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency, the PLA has established ``sixteen character'' policy guiding the mission and profits as companies realize from the sale to U.S. consumers. Specifically, these companies wish to profit from the manufacture of ordinary consumer goods to pay for the development and production of weapons; subsidize and profit from these industries in times when the PLA does not need to use their manufacturing infrastructure to produce defense-related weapons and goods; and to seek foreign trade and investment to modernize its defense infrastructure. 
   According to reports in the South China Post, the PLA has kept 1,346 companies, dumping thousands that were not profitable for the Chinese military. 
   Think about that--dumping companies that were not profitable to their own military. 
   These military-owned companies produce and ship a wide variety of goods to the United States for sale to unknowing American consumers. 
   What do we do? We say to them: As long as we can sell our corn and our wheat, we don't care. No problem here. 
   Regrettably, these same U.S. consumers were unaware that the People's Liberation Army goods they purchased in 1989--do you want to know what happened when American consumers purchased goods in 1989? They helped to fund the Chinese Communist Party's brutal crackdown and massacre of the countless pro-democracy demonstrators in Tiananmen Square. That is where the money went. 
   Currently, President Clinton and his administration have impeded the process by which the United States monitors and keeps track of PLA businesses allowing American citizens to fill the PLA coffers unchecked. The increased trade embodied in PNTR may only contribute to a future of more brutal crackdowns by the PLA and Chinese security forces funded by unknowing American citizens. 
   I am trying to help American citizens know: Don't do it. Urge your Senators to vote against this. 
   I propose at the very least that the Senate consider and accept a simple commonsense amendment, which I am offering, which would allow the Defense Intelligence Agency of the United States and the FBI to monitor and report to Congress on the activities and national security assessments and implications where U.S.-consumer-generated money is being directed within the PLA. 
   That is all my amendment asks. 
   I believe the American people would be aghast if they knew that their hard-earned money was greasing Communist China's brutal crackdowns, dangerous saber-rattling toward the democratic island of Taiwan, and increasing the credibility of the Chinese Communist  Army's weapons of mass destruction as top generals in Beijing threaten to vaporize cities on the American west coast should the U.S. come to the defense of our democratic friends in Taiwan. 
   That is an eye opener. Not a comforting thought if you live on the west coast. 
   As this Nation's top decisionmakers, I believe the American people deserve to have a Congress that watches out for their best interests. Sometimes in the short run what one thinks is in the best interests are not the best interests in the long run; it is nice to make a little profit on the sale of food, but look at the long run. 
   I know I am not supposed to be up here taking all this time to talk about this. ``Permanent'' is a long time after this debate--a long, long time. Once the damage is done, recovery is going to be difficult. 
   I have an amendment regarding space and the implication of the Chinese and what PNTR will do to that. Space is of huge importance. Whoever controls the skies in the future, I believe, is the winner in the next war. The U.S. is becoming ever more reliant on space capability, especially in the areas of command and control. While we are ahead of any potential rival in exploiting space, we are not unchallenged, and our future dominance is by no means assured. We have already observed major national efforts to conceal the Indian and Pakistan nuclear tests and the North Korean space launch capability from U.S. space assets. It would be naive to think our adversaries are not considering and capable of a wide range of methods to counter U.S. military muscle in general, and our current space advantage, in particular. 
   A 1998 report said, one, China is constructing electronic jammers that can be used against our GPS receivers; two, China's manned space program will contribute to an improved military space system. 
   We hear the argument in the United States, let's not put weapons in space. That is exactly what the Chinese are doing. That is their goal. We will help them do it. We will help them out. Feed them, trade with them, have them make some money, and help them to move right on and get their technology into space while we sit back and argue whether or not we should militarize space. 
   I will not go into all of the arguments on that other than to simply say this amendment directs the Congressional Executive Commission on the People's Republic of China, which was created in the House language, to monitor--that is all I am asking--a number of important issues so that we can report annually on Chinese space capabilities and the activities that affect the development. All we are asking in this amendment is it be monitored as part of this Commission. 
   Again, same argument; same old story: Don't waste the Senate's time, don't amend it. If we amend that we have to confer with the House--it might take a couple of hours, who knows--to come to a conclusion. No amendments. We don't want to delay this. But look at the long-term implications. 
   Another amendment that I have offered, No. 4, is in the area of environment. I serve as the chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee in the Senate. I will briefly explain this. In America, if you run a business, there are environmental regulations; strict, EPA-regulated laws that you have to abide by. It costs money. I am not complaining. I think some of the environmental regulations are good. Some have been a little bit too harsh. On the whole, the Clean Water Act, Safe Drinking 
   Water Act, the Clean Air Act, all the bills and laws we have passed through the years have been effective in cleaning our air, lands, and water. I think companies now realize that. 
   However, it has cost a lot of money. We have accepted it. Why do we want to allow the Nation of China, which we are now giving permanent normal trade relations to, to not enforce any environmental laws? Why do we want to say to China, you can produce a product, dump it on America's market to one-third or one-fourth, or one-tenth of what we can sell it for, and not have to abide by any of the environmental regulations? 
   China is part of the world. America is part of the world. The atmosphere and the oceans and the land are all part of the globe. Why do we let them off the hook? Why do we punish our people and not even ask that the Chinese be forced to somehow abide with basic environmental laws? That is why we need this amendment. It simply says that the Commission will monitor the lack of environmental regulations and use that as leverage for when we trade with them. 
   Here again, the same old argument: Let's not debate it. Let's not add it on. Don't vote for the Smith amendment on environmental regulations because we may have to go to conference and it might slow the bill down. 
   Why is the environment such a disaster in China today? The answer is simple: Because the people in China don't enjoy political and economic freedom. They don't have any choice. They have no choice but to breathe that filthy air. Per capita emissions in China are 75 percent higher than in Brazil which has an economy of similar size. The difference is, communism doesn't work. A prosperous economy and healthy environment can go together. A free people wouldn't consent to this type of environmental disaster. We shouldn't consent to it, either. But we are. We are saying: No problem, don't want to have a conference, don't want to waste any time, don't want to take an extra day or two to add an amendment here that says we will monitor China's lack of environmental standards and regulations. No problem. We don't want to slow it down. 
   That is what my amendment does. If you feel it is fine that China continues to pollute at a 75-percent higher rate than any other country in the world, for the most part you don't care, you want to keep right on trading with them and keep on making profits, keep on feeding them, fine. 
   Former U.N. Ambassador Jeane Kirkpatrick once criticized my colleagues across the aisle on the Democrat side for their tendency to ``blame America first,'' for their belief that there must be something wrong with this great Nation that causes the world's ills. 
   Keep that in mind when you consider my amendment. If laws such as the Clean Air Act and the Clean Water Act are necessary for the environmental health of this Nation, shouldn't they be beneficial to China as well? Do we really want to make a profit so badly that we are willing to say let those people live in that filth, in that dirty air; let that dirty air move out of China and across the ocean and into other parts of the world? Do we really want to make a profit that badly? If we do, shame on us. 
   I have two more amendments. 
   No. 5, one of the most shameful experiences regarding human rights violations in the country of China. I have already heard the argument and been told by colleagues, don't offer this amendment because we don't want to delay the process again. I think the picture that I am showing is not pleasant to look at. I don't like to look at it. But the American people need to see this picture. My colleagues need to see it. This amendment that I am offering seeks to improve the quality of life for orphans such as this little girl who are currently waiting to be adopted out of Chinese orphanages. What a horrible experience, to be a child in a Chinese orphanage. 
   What are we saying? No problem, no problem, that is China. We need to sell our wheat, man. We need to sell our corn. We need to make a profit. We will just ignore that. That will take care of itself. Don't worry. 
   What would happen if that was an orphanage in the United States? We all know what would happen, and justifiably so; it would be shut down. The Government would be in there like hornets, as well they should be. 
   But we are not going to worry about it, it is China, it is not our country. 
   We can't shut their orphanages down. I am not proposing to do that. But we can monitor it and we can say to the Chinese if PNTR passes, you keep this up and we are not going to trade with you. 
   But, oh no, that might mess up the deal. This amendment would encourage the Chinese Government to provide specific data such as the survival rates of orphans--like this young lady, certify that orphans are receiving proper medical and nutritional care, and show that all efforts are being made to help  the children--particularly those with special needs, who are the ones who are the most punished in these orphanages--to be adopted into loving homes by way of Chinese international or U.S. adoption agencies. 
   How can we ignore this? How can anybody in good conscience say: Senator SMITH, you are right, this is a terrible atrocity but we are not going to put this on the bill because it might delay the bill and it might cause a problem with the Chinese and we might not get PNTR passed. How can you say that? 
   The conditions of millions of orphans in China are deplorable, just like this. Many Chinese people want--and frankly feel they need--to have a baby boy with the expectations that a son will take care of them when they are old. A son carries the family name. It is considered honorable to have a son. Not so with a girl. A girl is expected to grow up and leave the family with her husband and will not care for her parents when they are old. If a Chinese woman bears a baby girl, many times they will drop her off anonymously at an orphanage, abandon her, kill her outright, or throw her into the garbage. Or even worse, as I think Senator HELMS is going to talk about shortly--abort the child without the consent of the mother. 
   It is unbelievable what these little children suffer. Some are lucky and they get adopted, but believe me, not many. Americans have adopted 20,000 Chinese baby girls. Some babies leave China for America every month. However some of these little girls and baby boys with special needs are left to languish and die in dark rotting rooms in state-run orphanages in China. 
   How can you ignore it? How can you come down here and say we are going to ignore all this and give them permanent normal trade relations? 
   One of my constituents, a young couple, came to me a few months ago. They were here on a green card. They said: Senator, if I go back, I am pregnant, they have told me they are going to abort my child. I want my child. 
   One of the greatest experiences I have ever had was crying with them when we got their deportation blocked and she had that baby right here in America. You cannot ignore this kind of horrible atrocity. 
   Many of these babies were not even fed or given water. Some are starved to death. Why is it so bad? Why is it so harmful, I plead with my colleagues, to say let's ask the Commission to report on this in PNTR? It is not so bad. Is that so terrible that maybe the House has to agree with me and the conferees have to agree and send it back over for another 5 minutes of debate? Really? 
   This baby girl is Mei-Ming. Do you know what Mei-Ming means in China? ``No name.'' She was discovered in one of these orphanages in 1995 and, according to the orphanage staff, Mei-Ming became sick. They had no medication for her--none. So they put her in a back room under a pile of clothes and they shut the door. 
   This is a picture of her at 10 days without food or water--in an orphanage. She lived another 4 days just like this and then she died. The orphanage denied that she even existed. They said she was never there, this Chinese Government that allows this, the Government that allows this to take place. 
   The only remaining memory of Mei-Ming--let's hold it up here--the only remaining memory of Mei-Ming is this photograph right here. I say to my colleagues, in the name of Mei-Ming: Please, agree to this amendment; agree to this amendment. Let the House 
   take a few minutes to add language in there that the Commission, in the name of Mei-Ming, could report on this kind of atrocity as you reap your profits. Is that asking too much? 
   Some orphanages in the 1990s had death rates estimated as high as 90 percent. I have heard reports that, since the public scrutiny of the last decade, the conditions in the Chinese orphanages have improved. I would like to thank the Chinese Government if that is, indeed, true. But it would be nice to have this as part of the language, to find out. 
   The last amendment and then I will not delay the Senate any longer, Senator BOB SMITH will no longer hold up the Senate business, you will be able to pass PNTR, ignore all these things, ignore all the amendments and we will be able to move on and make our profits. Just a few more minutes. 
   Organ harvesting in the People's Republic of China. You think that's bad? It is bad. Let me tell you about organ harvesting. 
   In America what organ harvesting means is in America you are willing to donate your kidney to your sister or brother or mother or dad; or your heart when you die in an accident you give so someone else may have life. That is organ donors. 
   Organ harvesting in the Peoples Republic of China, sponsored by this Chinese Government that we are so hell-bent to help--let me tell you what they do. They take prisoners--we are not talking about murderers here, we are talking about prisoners who have, for the most part sometimes minor crimes--and they take their organs so they can place them in the military officers or other high, important people in the Communist hierarchy. 
   In 1997, ABC News televised a very shocking documentary on the practice of organ harvesting in Communist China. The documentary--this is ABC, now, not BOB SMITH talking--depicted prisoners who were videotaped lined up, executed by a bullet to the head--a technique of execution which unlike lethal injection preserves the organs for harvesting. 
   Don't tell me it doesn't go on and don't tell me you are going to ignore it, because it goes on, it happens. Probably right now as we speak. This documentary claimed that prisoners are executed routinely and their organs are sold to people willing to pay as much as $30,000 for a kidney. Human rights organizations estimated at the time the ABC documentary aired, that more than 10,000 kidneys alone--not to mention other organs--from Chinese prisoners had been sold, potentially bringing in tens of millions of dollars. Guess where those dollars went? To the Chinese military. That is where the money went. 
   The Chinese Government, as it does with most human rights abuses, denies that this happens. My amendment simply requires the commission, under permanent normal trade relations, to monitor this, to try to secure as much information as they can so they can report on it annually as we continue the process under PNTR. 
   It is important to keep in mind that China has no rule of law, therefore prisoners are subject to arbitrary arrest and punishment without any due process. Can you imagine a young man or woman being arrested, not told what they are charged with, because there is a need for an organ, to be shot in the head, executed with no due process, no trial, and then their organs are donated to somebody who is willing to pay $30,000 to the Communist Chinese Government. 
   Pretty bad. After the Tiananmen Square massacre in 1989, when peaceful student protesters, including the sons and daughters of the Communist Party's elite, were mowed over by PLA tanks, there are far fewer dissidents in China than there were 11 years ago. It is pretty tough to speak up against China. Do you want to go to jail for publicly speaking out against the Government? That is the good news. The bad news is you will be shot in the head and your kidneys, your heart, and other organs will be donated to somebody in the Chinese military. 
   ABC's report also found that Chinese nationals living on student visas were harvesting these organs to Americans. Hello? That is right, harvesting these organs to Americans and other foreigners who have the funds to make a $5,000 deposit, who then travel to China to the PLA, People's Liberation Army, hospital where they receive the kidney transplant. The kidneys are tissue typed, and the prisoners are also tissue typed in order to achieve an ideal match. 
   Can you imagine the horror of being thrown in jail for a political crime--speaking out against the Government, perhaps--and having your tissue samples taken, knowing full well what it is for, then to be summarily shot and your kidneys sold perhaps to an American? There is no way anyone in the Senate or the House would not recognize the name of Harry Wu, the renowned human rights activist and Chinese dissident who was arrested in China, detained, and finally released. Thanks to the work of the Laogai Research Foundation, we are aware of ongoing Chinese engagement in organ  harvesting of executed prisoners. I will not go into any more detail on this. 
   In conclusion, we are talking about the most unbelievable and atrocious violation of human rights. I have just identified six. There are dozens more. I did not want to come down and offer 40 amendments. I believe I made my point. I had about 20 of them identified, and we were looking at another 20 more, but I said I am going to take some of the worst. I do not support PNTR, but all I am asking is for those of who do, allow these amendments--the proliferation amendment of Senator THOMPSON and the other six amendments I have outlined, and maybe others as well. Allow them to pass. What harm does it do? Take a few minutes and go to conference for the sake of people such as this little girl or somebody right now who may be fattened up for execution for kidneys. 
   It is time that America wakes up and understands what is happening in the world. I know some are going to say this is Smith again beating on China. It is not a matter of beating on China. These are facts. These are not opinions. These are facts. These are documented. Every single thing I read to you, every single thing I said to you is documented from proliferation to organ harvesting. It is documented. 
   The issue before the Senate when we vote on PNTR and on these amendments is very simply this: I am against PNTR and not going to vote for any of it, which is fine, that is my position. Or I am for PNTR and I am willing to pass these amendments to at least monitor these kinds of atrocities in an effort to stop them. 
   I yield the floor, Mr. President.

   Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I would like to introduce the Junior Duck Stamp Reauthorization Act of 2000. 
   The Junior Duck Stamp Program is a wonderful program that allows children from kindergarten through twelfth grade to participate in an integrated art and science curriculum that is designed to teach environmental science and habitat conservation. It also raises awareness for wetlands and waterfowl conservation. Students and teachers work together through a set curriculum that incorporates ecological and wildlife management principles, allowing students to learn about conserving wildlife habitat while they explore the esthetic qualities of wildlife and nature. 
   As part of the curriculum, each student is encouraged to focus his or her efforts on a particular waterfowl species. The culmination of the curriculum is an artistic depiction of that species. Each state selects a Best-of-Show winner and that piece of artwork competes to become the national winner of the Junior Duck Stamp contest. The winning depiction is chosen as the Federal Junior Duck Stamp, and the student receives $2,500. Revenues from selling the stamp are used for conservation awards and scholarships to the participants. 
   By all accounts the Junior Duck Stamp Program has been extremely successful. Last year alone more than 44,000 students entered the state competitions. The Fish and Wildlife Service and educators estimate that for every child who enters the state program, ten others are exposed to the curriculum. The program has also been very successful in introducing urban children to nature, allows all children to develop an important connection to the environment, and motivates students to take an active role in conservation of waterfowl species. 
   This legislation is a simple reauthorization of the program through 2005. The U.S. Fish and wildlife Service would be authorized to receive $250,000 a year for the administration of the Junior Duck Stamp Program. In addition, the Junior Duck Stamp Conservation and Design Program Act of 1994 would be amended to allow schools in the District of Columbia and the U.S. territories to participate in the program.

    Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Bob and Miriam Smith upon the recent dedication of the Norman S. and Lida M. Smith Academic Technology Center at Bentley College in Massachusetts. 
   Bob and Miriam have a long history of philanthropy to the college. They have established numerous scholarship programs, many for deserving students from disadvantaged communities. Bob and Miriam's financial donation will give Bentley College the chance to enhance its business education program. As the retired chief executive officer of American Express Bank, Bob understands the value of a superior business education. Named in memory of Bob's parents, Norman and Lida Smith, the Center will give students the advantage of a business education enhanced by the most advanced technology available today. 
   Bob's dedication to his alma mater is a testament to his integrity, hard work, and impressive business skills. In addition to the outpouring of generous financial donations, Bob's strategic guidance plan has supported the college through tough economic times and demographic changes, and continues to do so today. 
   Without the support of generous citizens such as Bob and Miriam, our nation's colleges and universities would not have attained the leadership status in the world of academia that they currently enjoy. Bob and Miriam's donation gives Bentley College the competitive edge. It is an honor to serve them both in the United States Senate.

   Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I realize we are in a tight time situation so I will be brief in explaining my situation because I have to be brief in explaining it. 
   This amendment proposes a number of commonsense additions. These all amend the section of the bill that creates a commission which is to monitor and report on Chinese activities. 
   The six subjects I am urging we include are very reasonable. I am amazed, really, they have not already been included in the commission's reporting responsibilities. Let me just list and give a brief line or two on each one. 
   The first division or item is monitoring and reporting on Chinese cooperation on POW and MIA issues. We all know that the Chinese Government possesses information about Americans who are missing from the Korean war--and perhaps even the Vietnam war, but certainly the Korean war; maybe World War II--which could bring closure to literally thousands of families. Yet this Government, the Chinese Government, has refused to provide us even basic information. In fact, it denies it even possesses this information when we know they do. So this amendment would merely let the American people know in an objective manner on this commission the extent to which the Chinese are not cooperating on this humanitarian issue. 
   The second item is monitoring and reporting on commercial activities between the United States and the People's Liberation Army. Currently, the Chinese People's Liberation Army directly or indirectly owns scores of businesses. They conduct commerce with U.S. companies. That includes the sale of products to U.S. consumers. So this amendment would simply require the FBI to monitor and report to Congress on the activities of the PLA's, the People's Liberation Army's, businesses here in the United States. Specifically, they would take data collected by the DIA, CIA, customs, and other agencies and report their findings to Congress on the dollar amount of PLA revenues and where these revenues are being directed within the Chinese military. This report will also monitor any technology transfers between PLA companies and U.S. companies, including an assessment of the impact upon the U.S. military, U.S. interests, and our allies. 
   That is all it does. I think it is a very reasonable amendment and should be approved by the Senate.  
   The third item in the division is monitoring and reporting on development of Chinese space capabilities. We know the world has observed our military space advantage and has taken steps to acquire their own military space systems to counter ours. In particular, we have observed the Chinese are developing military space capabilities that could threaten the United States and threaten our allies' military, civilian, and commercial systems. Free and open trade, and the reduced vigilance free trade fosters, will facilitate the development and proliferation of space technology needed to expand Chinese space capabilities. This commission would monitor this activity and report on it so we would have good information as to exactly what was going on in that regard. 
   The fourth item is monitoring and reporting on the cooperation on environmental protection. Our Nation has some of the strongest environmental laws in the world. Yet Chinese companies can operate with lower costs and compete with U.S. companies because they do not have to comply with the same requirements that U.S. companies do. 
   If we are going to give permanent trade status to the country of China, then why not make them play by the same rules U.S. companies do? If you wonder why they can sell their clothes and other products over here so cheaply, that is one of the reasons they compete with us and can pay such low labor costs. They do not have to abide by the same regulations. 
   This amendment simply monitors the extent to which China is enforcing their own environmental regulations. We cannot dictate how they do that--they are their own nation--but we can monitor it and we can let the American people know that we are, by passing PNTR, saying we are going to ignore their environmental infractions and we are going to enforce ours. I think we ought to have that as part of this agreement. 
   The fifth division is monitoring and reporting on conditions relating to orphans and orphanages in China and the extent to which they are providing access to U.S. and international adoption agencies. Every year, untold numbers of Chinese baby boys and girls with special needs are left at state-run orphanages in horrible situations. Throughout the nineties, several human rights organizations revealed deplorable conditions and inhuman treatment. The death rates for these children are oftentimes astronomical. They are left to die of starvation. When we give all this wonderful treatment to the country of China, I hope we think about that and see if we have any concerns about these human rights violations. 
   My amendment would simply monitor and encourage China to determine that the quality and care of its orphans is improving by providing specific data on the survival rates of these children. Isn't that the least we can do if we are going to trade with them and help them? Why not help the children in China who are stuck in these orphanages. 
   Finally, No. 6, monitoring and reporting on organ harvesting and transplanting in the People's Republic of China. One of the most despicable, horrible acts of any nation in the world--and I cannot understand why we would look the other way and not even report and let the American people and the world know what they are doing. This amendment would task a commission with monitoring this barbaric and inhuman practice of literally taking organs involuntarily from executed prisoners. They are not prisoners executed and then having their organs taken after execution, they are executed in order to get the 
   organs, so we understand what this is. We would require a report on the actions taken by the PRC to end organ harvesting. 
   In conclusion, this is a good amendment. There are six divisions. They are good divisions. I say to my colleagues who say we cannot amend this because it is going to mess up the whole PNTR issue, this is not messing up anything. This commission is going to monitor these six areas that are, for the most part, outrages really that the Chinese are allowed to get away with. 
   I urge the adoption of this amendment at the appropriate time. I thank my colleagues, and I yield the floor.

   Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, Section 403 of the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act requires that a statement of the cost of reported bills, prepared by the Congressional Budget Office, be included in Senate reports. On July 27, 2000, the Committee on Environment and Public Works filed Senate Report 106-362, accompanying S. 2796, the Water Resource Development Act of 2000, and Senate Report 106-363, accompanying S. 2979, Restoring the Everglades, An American Legacy Act. The cost estimates were not available at the time of filing. The information subsequently was received by the committee and I ask unanimous consent to print it in the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD.

    Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Richard Cyr upon receiving the Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis Award for outstanding public service. 
   In a time where random acts of kindness seem to be waning, Richard has proven that kind souls are still in abundance. He has established one of the most important volunteer efforts in the state, if not the country. Richard formed David's House, a program for the parents of sick children that provides much-needed support and love during critical times of treatment programs. It is this tireless dedication to helping others that garnered Richard a national award for this efforts. 
   Richard understood how difficult it was for families of sick children to remain close to their loved ones without having to add hotel costs to the growing number of bills. He was in the same situation himself when his foster child, David, became ill with acute lymphocytic leukemia. Richard spent countless nights sleeping in his car or in the hospital lobby to be closer to his child. After David's death, he decided  that a safe refuge for families was necessary during illness. 
   David's House gives parents the ability to concentrate on their children without worrying about where to sleep, eat or shower during hospital visits. The House is staffed entirely by volunteers and receives donations from private sources. After fifteen years of operation, David's House has assisted hundreds of families and eased the pain of coping with illness. Such stability and growth is a testament of the true importance and need for institutions like David's House. 
   Richard's dedication to helping others in a grave time of need is truly inspirational. It is an honor to represent him in the United States Senate.

   Ruth's dedication to the citizens of Portsmouth and its surrounding communities has spanned an impressionable thirty years.

Ruth gives one hundred percent of her time and efforts to bettering the lives of those less fortunate. Her kind-hearted care and concern for the well-being of all she encounters proves her deep commitment to making New Hampshire a better place to live. Such dedication to her community and state is heart-warming and truly inspirational in a time where civic responsibility seems to be waning.

   As director, Dr. Levenson will have the responsibility of leading the VA Medical Center into the 21st century. The level of dedication and commitment required by such a prestigious position would seem overwhelming to many, yet Dr. Levenson has proven himself willing and capable of providing the best leadership for the center. 
   Prior to his appointment as the director for the VA Medical Center, Dr. Levenson served as the acting director of the center. During that 22 month period, Mark dedicated his time to improving medical care access for veterans. His efforts to expand clinics in Manchester and Portsmouth are just some examples of his loyalty and commitment to America's veterans. 
   Dr. Levenson has used each and every day of his career with the VA Medical Center to remind his peers and the surrounding community of their commitment to those men and women who served our great nation.

   In a world full of waning civic responsibility, it is always heartwarming to hear of selfless citizens devoting time to their communities. Mary's tireless dedication to Portsmouth schools has garnered her state-wide recognition for her efforts. She initially started working at the Dondero Elementary School when her children started kindergarten seven years ago in order to become more fully involved in their education. She offered to sign up for everything to get to know the teachers and the parents better, and hasn't stopped since. Her work now stretches to other schools in the area as well. 
   Mary has established a number of successful programs at the school, such as the Class Popcorn Giveaway and the Magical Mailbox program, heads numerous committees, and has overseen countless art shows, bake sales and book fairs. She puts together the middle school newsletter and continues to do publicity for the elementary school. She truly enjoys volunteering and cites her love of children as the driving force behind her efforts. 
   Mary's work is truly inspirational and typifies what is good about American citizens today. Without the help of dedicated volunteers, our schools would not be able to run smoothly, and it is the children who ultimately would suffer. It is truly an honor to represent her in the U.S. Senate.

    Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to McLane, Graf, Raulerson and Middleton upon their recognition as a 2000 New Hampshire ``Business in the Arts'' award winner in the medium-sized company category. 
   The firm has been a long time contributor to the development of the arts in New Hampshire. They not only donate time and money to various arts events, but they have established themselves on numerous boards and sponsorships and are well-known for distributing complimentary tickets to clients and friends. This extensive sponsorship of different arts programs is carried out on a more personal level by the firm's employees, whose individual contributions of time and money make a significant impact on the organizations they support. 
   The firm has placed a considerable interest in promoting musical events throughout the State, and avidly supports the Opera League of New Hampshire, the New Hampshire Symphony Orchestra, the Portsmouth Music Hall, the Concord Community Music School and the Nashua Symphony, to name a few. Their list of achievements stretches even further to other venues of the arts as well, such as the Palace Theater in Manchester, the Currier Gallery of Art and Strawbery Banke, a historical site in Portsmouth. 
   This strong commitment by the firm to providing the opportunity for arts programs to come to the State is truly commendable. The firm understands the true importance of the arts in communities, and without their generous support, these programs would not be possible. The firm has taken on new projects, most notably a year 2000 celebration with cultural activities such as a Black Heritage Trail and a YMCA art auction. These sort of events enrich the lives of the entire community and prove that private businesses can indeed make a huge impact on bringing the arts to all citizens. It is an honor to serve the firm and its employees in the U.S. Senate.

Mike has taken the role of CEO to a whole new level of relationship building by embracing those around him, not only within his company, but within the surrounding community as well. He consistently works hard to ensure that all employee and business concerns are met and addressed. It is his dedication to relationship building that exemplifies what public relations is all about. 
   Mike is an extraordinary leader who leads by example, most notably by his involvement with numerous non-profit organizations. As chairman of Kids Voting New Hampshire and the former campaign chairman of the Greater Manchester United Way, Mike demonstrates the importance of civic responsibility and giving back to the community. He listens carefully to others and diligently tries to bring the disenfranchised into the inner circle. He makes people feel included and valued.

   Lauren, crowned both Miss Lakes Region and Miss New Hampshire, is a 1998 graduate of Nashua Senior High School. Not only did she graduate in the top ten percent of her class, she went on to continue her education at the University of New Hampshire, where she is a sophomore majoring in molecular, cellular, and developmental biology. In addition to her premedical program course work, she minors in English as well. 
   Despite a double major and challenging courses, Lauren finds time for her singing passion, performing with the All-State Classical Choir for the past 3 years, and she gives back to the surrounding community through her involvement as a kindergarten catechism teacher at St. Thomas Moore Parish, as well as a Wentworth Douglas Emergency Room volunteer. 
   Her platform of attachment and adjustment disorders in children is especially poignant in an age where violence and mental disturbance with America's youth is all too common. Her dreams of entering the field of Pediatric Neurology will surely allow her to further research this field of study. 
   Lauren is an excellent student who cares about her community and the state. Her talents, hard work and dedication are truly commendable, and it is an honor to represent her in the U.S. Senate.

   For the past ten years, under the direction of partners Joel and Cathy Bedard, the Mount Washington Hotel and Resort has become a cornerstone of the White Mountain Community, providing not only a place for the people of New Hampshire to rest and relax, but giving back to the surrounding community as well. 
   The Mount Washington Hotel and Resort had not been locally owned until 1991, after several failed business ventures attempted to capitalize on the property. The hard work and dedication of each individual who worked on renovating and revitalizing the hotel is truly commendable. As a result, the Mount Washington Hotel and Resort was saved from demolition and currently thrives as one of New Hampshire's greatest treasures. 
   The Mount Washington Hotel and Resort is the largest employer in the local economy, providing 450 jobs in the summer months and 550 throughout the winter season. They are also an active member of their community, lending their support to programs such as New Hampshire Public Television, the Littleton Regional Hospital Auxiliary and other worthy programs and causes.

   Olde Port Bank proves that time and money are not the only key factors necessary for the successful continuation of arts programs. They have provided exhibit space in its offices and lobbies and promoted the activities of employees and customers who are artists as well. It is this sort of personal attention and support that make various programs available to the local community. The bank also understands the importance of a strong financial backbone, and helps to secure loans and credit lines so that the arts can remain part of the seacoast community. 
   The Children's Museum of Portsmouth is one such grateful recipient of Olde Port Bank's efforts. The bank has given generous financial support for an endowment fund to the museum and established corporate membership and sponsorship. Bank employees spend countless hours assisting the museum in many of its events and activities. This sort of high participation is a testament to the staff's deep dedication to making the arts more accessible to the Portsmouth community. 
   Olde Port Bank recognizes the importance of arts in education and the community. Forty percent of the bank's contributions budget is earmarked for arts organizations in the Portsmouth area, and this support is consistently growing each year. This company recognizes their power to lead by example, both economically and physically. 
   Without the support of dedicated businesses like Olde Port Bank, the arts would not be able to flourish in New Hampshire. Olde Port Bank truly signifies the deep personal commitment of small businesses across the state to supporting the causes that make New Hampshire one's chosen place to call home. It is an honor to serve them in the United States Senate.

    Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Lillian ``Billie'' Noel for her recognition as the Portsmouth Rotary Club's ``Paul Harris Fellow'' award winner. 
   Billie's deep commitment to preserving New Hampshire's precious woodlands is truly commendable. Instead of selling 35 acres of land to developers, Billie sold it at a reduced price to preservationists, ensuring the land will remain untouched for a long time. It is because of her dedication to assuring the future of New Hampshire's forests that she was honored by the Portsmouth Rotary Club in option for preservation over profit. 
   Billie made the decision to sell her property for $600,000 to the Society for the Protection of New Hampshire's Forests, even though it is worth three times that amount. This generous sale will ensure that the scenic waterfront property is not touched by developers. One of the last remaining undeveloped pieces of land in the fast-growing seacoast area, residents would have lost a treasured piece of their New Hampshire heritage had it been sold to developers. The Society plans to add walking paths and areas to picnic and bird watch, preserving the land's charm and scenic appeal. Billie's contribution to New Hampshire's citizens proves that there are still people dedicated to saving nature's delicacy rather than making a mere profit. It is this type of private initiative which keeps New Hampshire as the beautiful ``Live Free or Die'' state. 
   New Hampshire is lucky to have citizens like Billie who are committed to saving our state's beautiful lands. Our state's scenic areas are too precious to lose and I commend Billie for her hard work and dedication to the environment. It is an honor to represent Billie in the United States Senate.

    Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to the Honorable Susan B. Carbon upon receiving the ``Frank Rowe Kenison'' award for her contributions to New Hampshire citizens through the field of Law and Justice.  
   The ``Frank Rowe Kenison'' award was established to recognize those individuals who, through the administration of justice, the legal profession or the advancement of legal thought, have worked towards improving the lives of New Hampshire citizens. 
   Susan has bettered the life of hundreds if not thousands of New Hampshire citizens through her pursuit of justice. Her personal and professional journeys have inspired her to seek an end to family violence. 
   As president of the New Hampshire Bar Association, Susan was instrumental in establishing the Family Violence Conference. She has also served as a member of the Executive Committee for the Governor's Commission on Domestic & Sexual Violence and a trustee for the National Council of Juvenile and Family Court Judges. This involvement has allowed her to combat domestic violence on a national level. 
   Susan's tireless dedication to domestic violence prevention is a testament to the philosophy of Frank Rowe Kenison, who stated ``The Supreme Court and the Judiciary of this State will continue to maintain and guard its house justice for the humble as well as the powerful, for the poor as well as the rich, for the minority as well as the majority and for the unpopular as well as the popular.'' 
   In her many years in the legal profession, Susan Carbon has carried out Rowe's vision of justice. She has turned to the most sacred and powerful groups within society and the family in order to ensure that each individual is able to live without the fear of impending violence. 
   Susan's dedication to her profession, ending domestic violence and to her surrounding community is remarkable. It is both an honor and a great pleasure to represent her in the United States Senate.

In addition to holding the position of Vice President of the Endowment, he has also been Alumni Director and Vice President for Development.

He has been active with the Council for the Advancement and Support of Education, the National Society of Fund Raising Executives, Catholic Medical Center, New Hampshire Center for the Preforming Arts, the National Commission on Alcohol and Drug Abuse, New Horizons for New Hampshire, the Manchester Diocese School Development Committee and the Bedford Library Foundation. 
   Walter Gallo is truly an extraordinary individual.

   Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, today I have introduced legislation, S. 2962, which I believe will deal once and for all with the MTBE problem that is facing us all across America, specifically New England. In the Northeast, as well as California and other areas of the country, we are beginning to see evidence of MTBE in ground water. This is a serious environmental problem that must be addressed. It is certainly a problem in New Hampshire. 
   I rise today to speak for my constituents in New Hampshire who are now having their wells, several a week by the way, being contaminated by MTBE. This is my home State. This is a serious problem there. I am here to offer this legislation to help my constituents in New Hampshire get relief from MTBE, which is a pollutant in their wells. But I am also here to speak for all Americans across the country who have MTBE in their wells, whether they be in California or New Hampshire. 
   MTBE has done more damage to our drinking water than we would care to know. MTBE has been a component of our fuel supply for over two decades. In 1990, we amended the Clean Air Act to include a clean gasoline program. Unfortunately, we did not look at the science that was probably more evident than not. Because we did not look at that science, we have now created another environmental problem of a huge magnitude, which is probably going to cost billions of dollars to clean up. If there is a moral here, or lesson, it should be: Use good science. Look carefully before you leap into some of these environmental dilemmas. 
   That program in the 1990 Clean Air Act amendment mandated use of 2 percent oxygen in the gas, by weight. In other words, 2 percent of the weight of a gallon of gasoline should be oxygen. That was put in the fuel. 
   MTBE was one of two options that could be used. The problem with MTBE is that it has this ability to migrate through the ground very quickly and then into the water table. What is MTBE? It is an ether, and in the event of a leak or gas spill, the MTBE will separate from the gas and migrate through the ground very quickly. The real problem starts when MTBE finds its way into the ground water, which it frequently does.  
   Several States have had gasoline leaks, or spills, that led to the closure of wells because of MTBE. It smells. It tastes horrible. It is not the kind of thing you want to see come out of your shower or your faucet when you are ready to use your water. This is a serious problem. Some have made light of it, frankly, in this body, in the sense that maybe it is not such a serious problem and maybe we should look at some other alternatives other than banning it. But we need to ban MTBE. The legislation I am introducing today will do that. It does it in a responsible manner, which I will explain. 
   Several States have had these leaks or spills, as I said. So this bill will address the problems associated with MTBE, but--and this is a very important point--will not reduce any of the environmental benefits of the clean air program. That cannot be said with every option that has been presented on this issue. Again, we can ban MTBE, but we will not reduce any environmental benefit that the MTBE has brought to clean the air and that is important. 
   Briefly, this bill will allow the Governor of any State to waive the gasoline oxygen requirement of the Clean Air Act--waive it. But it will preserve the environmental benefits. It 
   will also grant the State and the Federal Government authority to ban MTBE. It authorizes an additional $200 million out of the Leaking Underground Storage Tank Fund to clean up MTBE where these wells have been contaminated because of these leaking tanks. In other words, if we could repair those leaking tanks, we are going to cut back on the amount of problems we are going to have in the future. So it is important we have this as part of the legislation to get the money there to fix these tanks, to cut back on the amount of MTBE that gets into the ground water. If it does not leak out of the tank, the gasoline tank, it will not get into the ground water. But it is leaking out of tanks and we have to fix it. 
   The bill also authorizes an extensive study of numerous environmental consequences of our current fuel use. It was my hope to have marked up and sent to the floor from the Environment and Public Works Committee, which I chair, a bill this past week. In fact, it was our goal to do it yesterday, but we could not get the parties together who I needed to make this bill a reality, in the sense that it would pass. We could have introduced a bill, could have marked a bill, perhaps, but it would not have passed because we would not have the support. This problem is too serious to play politics. 
   MTBE is a pollutant in our wells. We need to get it out. We have to have legislation to do it and it has to pass. There is no point introducing a bill that will not pass. There are people who are dug in on all sides of this issue for various reasons. But the point is, we need to compromise. We all cannot get what we want, but the end result must be that we get MTBE out of our ground water. That is the bottom line. 
   So I agreed, reluctantly, but I agreed, in the interests of working together with my colleagues, to hold off until September in order to resolve the few remaining issues, but I intend to hold that markup in September. In fact, the specific date is September 7. In that legislation that we mark up, we will ban MTBE. 
   The issues that are in this legislation include the treatment of ethanol. I am pleased with the recent progress we have made on this. But there is a serious problem that we have to deal with, those who advocate more ethanol in fuel. I expect these issues to be resolved. We are working behind the scenes very hard to resolve these issues before the September 7 markup. It will give the staff something to do during the August recess. I know they will work out the details. But I thank the many Senators on both sides of the aisle I have been working with very closely to resolve these issues. This is a tough, tough issue, and it is hard to get agreement. Everybody is not going to get what they want, but the bottom line is, we have to get MTBE out of the water. 
   Let me address the ethanol issue for a moment. Some weeks ago I circulated a draft that included a clean alternative fuels program. This is a very complex issue. What are alternative fuels? It could be premium gasoline. It could be natural gas. It could be electricity. It could be fuel cells. It could be ethanol. But if you say ``renewable fuels,'' then you are talking for the most part only ethanol. So when we are talking alternative fuels, what alternatives do we have to MTBE that would help us meet these requirements in the Clean Air Act? This has proven to be a good step toward addressing the ethanol question. 
   The program will also enhance the development of cleaner 
   and more efficient cars which will help with the Clean Air Act issues as well. There has been growing support for this alternative fuels approach since the time we first brought this up. We do not want to create more MTBE problems. We do not want to create dirtier air by eliminating MTBE because we created dirty water by putting MTBEs in gasoline. 
   So last week in an effort, again, to reach out, I received a letter supporting that approach from 32 States represented by air quality planners in the northeastern States and the Governors' Ethanol Coalition. So for the first time we now have ethanol, and the Northeast, you have specific problems here with the MTBE issue, talking, working together, and, as we said, from this letter of support from 32 States, they support this approach. 
   We have not dotted every ``i'' and crossed every ``t'' yet, but in concept they support the approach. 
   The bill I am offering today, while that bill does not include the exact language they are talking about in that letter--and I want to make that clear--it is a bridge. It is a bridge from where my legislation is to where they are. Actually, simultaneously to the bill I have introduced, I have also offered an amendment No. 4026, which crosses that bridge. I have introduced what I would like to have, what I believe is the most cost-effective method to deal with this problem, but I recognize that even though it is the least costly, it does not have the amount of support I need to pass it. So I have offered another amendment to my own bill, which is my way of saying: OK, you offered me the bridge. I am willing to walk across it and meet you at least halfway. 
   I will describe this bill in a little more detail first. This is a complex issue. The Environmental and Public Works Committee has been struggling with this, certainly in the last 7 or 8 months I have been chairman of the committee, and I am sure they were struggling with it many months before that. I have tried to craft a solution that is direct and balanced. I believe I have accomplished that. That is my goal. It is not to ramrod anything through to make anybody angry. It is a legitimate attempt to get a consensus to deal with a serious environmental problem, not to deal with everybody's own opinions. 
   If anybody comes to the table and says: If I do not get this, I will leave the table--I tell the people who say that: Don't bother coming to the table; you are wasting my time and yours. If you want to, talk, compromise, and reach a rational conclusion. I am willing to talk, and Senators on all sides of this have done just that. We have talked to many industry folks and environmental people as well on this very issue. 
   The bill waives the oxygen mandate. The Reformulated Gasoline Program, or RFG, requires at least 2 percent of 
   gasoline by weight to be oxygen. MTBE and ethanol are the principal additives that help satisfy this mandate. It is ethanol or MTBE. They will bring us to that 2 percent oxygenate requirement. Because MTBE is rarely used outside the Reformulated Gas Program, a sensible starting point was to allow each State, if they wish, to waive the oxygen requirement. 
   What about the so-called environmental backsliding; in other words, slipping back and allowing more dirty air? There is concern that if the Governors waive this mandate that this will affect the environmental benefit--clean air--of the Reformulated Gas Program. 
   Let me be very clear: My bill ensures there will be no environmental backsliding. We are not walking away from the requirements of the Clean Air Act. If this bill is adopted, the environment--at least the air--will not know the difference. There will be no negative impact on the air, and the water will be cleaner. 
   Phaseout of MTBE: Eliminating the 2 percent oxygen mandate alone does not  mean the elimination of MTBE. MTBE is an effective octane booster, and refiners still may want to use it. Since only a very small amount of MTBE will cause a tremendous amount of damage, it is important to consider the fate of MTBE. 
   This bill will give the EPA Administrator the authority to ban it immediately. If EPA does not do so in 4 years, then this bill will, by law, ban MTBE. The EPA has 4 years to ban it. If they do not, the bill will. 
   EPA could, however, overturn the ban if it deemed it was not necessary to protect air quality, water quality, or human health. If it gets to the point that it is not a problem, then EPA does not have to ban it. Notwithstanding EPA's decision, the bill gives the States the authority to ban the additive. 
   Since there is already massive contamination caused by MTBE, this bill will authorize, as I said, $200 million to be given to the States from the Leaking Underground Storage Tank Program for the purpose of cleaning up MTBE-caused contamination. 
   Since a Federal mandate caused this pollution--remember that a Federal mandate caused this pollution. This is not the fault of the oil companies. It is not the fault of the MTBE producers. They did what they were asked to do. They produced this additive to clean up the air. Since a Federal mandate caused the pollution, it would be irresponsible for the Federal Government not to bear some of the financial burden associated with the cleanup. Unfortunately, that is the case. 
   I do not like to spend taxpayers' dollars, but this was a mandate, and because of that mandate, we have a problem. 
   It is also important to point out that although it is not part of my legislation, it is reasonable to think of some way of perhaps trying to work with the MTBE producers to help them through this transition if, in fact, MTBE is banned. I certainly am willing to work with them to come up with some solution, some help in terms of their movement from one industry to another, or whatever the case may be. 
   Finally, the bill authorizes a comprehensive study of the environmental consequences of our current fuel supply. In order to be better informed to make future environmental decisions regarding fuel policy, the bill directs EPA to undertake a study of our motor fuel. 
   I will talk a little bit about the cost, a very important point. 
   Lately, we have heard a great deal about gasoline prices, certainly fuel oil prices, as well, in New England. These concerns underscore the question of the costs associated with limiting MTBE use. 
   MTBE, like it or not, is clean, it is cheap, and it helps to clean up our air. Placing it in our fuel supply and keeping the fuel supply clean will have a cost. We have to replace it. We cannot backslide. We do not want to dirty the air while we take MTBE out. 
   It is my belief the Senate is not prepared to reduce our clean air standards or allow for the continued contamination of our drinking water. 
   We have two issues: Contaminated drinking water and do we backslide off the clean air provision. I believe my colleagues in the Senate are willing to work with me to clean up the water to get the MTBE out of our wells and to preserve the integrity of the Clean Air Act and not backslide or move back from the cleaner air we have accomplished by using MTBE. 
   The question, though, becomes: What is the most effective and cost friendly option for achieving this goal? I have a chart which will help illustrate the options. Each one of these options--the red line, yellow line, green line, and the blue line--bans MTBE, but it is a little more complicated than that. 
   One option is simply the elimination of MTBE with no other changes in the law. That is the red line. These show costs. This is the highest cost option because it is about an 8-cent increase in gas prices per gallon. This is a ban of MTBE, and it replaces it with ethanol in the Reformulated Gas Program. One might think: That is fine, it is ethanol, produced by corn, a nice natural product; what is wrong with that? Let's do it. 
   The problem is, in areas in the Northeast, such as New Hampshire, and in other States such as Texas, these States would have to use ethanol to meet that oxygenate requirement because there is no other option. In order to meet the 2-percent oxygenate requirement if MTBE is removed, they have to use ethanol. 
   One may say: What is wrong with that? Ethanol makes gas evaporate more quickly and those fumes would add to smog and haze in New England and it would be serious. Obviously, California would have the same problem. 
   Refiners would have to make gas less evaporative and thereby increasing the cost. In other words, they would have to do something to deal with that rapid evaporation and it would cost more to do that. This is not an option for New England nor California nor any other State that has this particular problem. 
   If we are going to be responsible, then we should work with our colleagues who have these problems. I happen to have that problem because I am from New Hampshire, and as the chairman of the committee, I need to work with all regions of the country to get a compromise that is acceptable to everybody so that we do not have more environmental problems in New England or California or some other place by simply banning MTBE and letting ethanol take over. Some want that. 
   Obviously, the ethanol producers would love it, but that does not help us. We do not want to create more problems. That is not a responsible approach, I say with all due respect. 
   The next line is the orange line in terms of cost. 
   That is the Clinton administration's position. That represents the cost of eliminating the oxygen mandate, but replacing it with a national ethanol mandate. You have no other alternative other than ethanol. 
   The cost of mandating a threefold increase in ethanol sales is very expensive. So the options represented by the orange line shown on the chart cost less than what is shown with the red line because it does not mandate that the reformulated gas contain ethanol. It does not mandate it, but that is what is going to happen. But, shown with this orange line on the chart, it simply mandates the total ethanol market. So you are mandating the market here, and that is no good. That does not work. Unlike what is shown with the red line, there would be no regional constraint. It would not be acceptable. 
   Now, what is shown on the chart with the blue line is legislation that I am introducing today, without the amendment initially. In my view, that is the cheapest and most responsible way to deal with this problem. However, for reasons which I respect--I might not agree with them, but I respect them--it does not have enough support, either, to pass the Senate. I recognize that, but I want everybody to know where I am coming from. 
   I believe we should use the cheapest alternative that gets the job done. That is my view. But I understand, as I said before, I am willing to build that bridge to go from what is shown with the blue line to what is shown with the green line. I will not go to what is shown with the orange or red lines, but I am willing to go from what is shown with the blue line to what is shown with the green line. 
   As I have said, what is shown with the blue line is the bill I have introduced. That bill will cost more to make clean gas without MTBE, but because we place the fewest requirements on the refiners on how to achieve that clean gas, this bill would cost the economy less than all other options. It is very important for me to repeat that. We place the fewest requirements on the refiners on how to achieve the clean gas. We want clean gas achieved. That is the goal. This bill would cost the economy less than all of those other options. 
   While my bill addresses all of the concerns with MTBE, I am also sensitive to the concerns of the Senators who understand that this bill might have an impact on ethanol. So in order to address these concerns, I have prepared an amendment to my own legislation, amendment No. 4026, which I have already sent to the desk. 
   This amendment seeks to address the concerns over ethanol that Members have. I am hoping that over the course of the next 30 days we will be able to build this bridge from what is shown by the blue line to what is shown by the  green line, to get to what I think is an acceptable and responsible approach. 
   I indicated earlier there is a lot of interest. Thirty-two States have expressed interest in this, in my letter. This amendment seeks to address the concerns of the ethanol industry by establishing a segment of the fuel market that must be comprised of either ethanol or fuel used to power superclean vehicles. 
   About 10 days ago, I had the opportunity to ride in a fuel-celled bus. It had hydrogen cells. I had never experienced anything like it: No fumes, no smell, very little sound, and no pollutants whatsoever. I road several miles in 
   it. 
   The current occupant of the Chair, the Senator from Utah, Senator BENNETT, drives a hybrid car which is part electric, part gas. You see, we are moving in the right direction. Hybrid cars, fuel cells--they are the future. The more we do that, the less we need of any type of gasoline, whether it is ethanol or just oil based. It does not matter. 
   The point is, we are moving in the right direction. That is what we want to encourage. This bill will establish a segment of the fuel market that must be comprised of either ethanol or fuel used to power those clean vehicles. We do not want to stop them from having that option. 
   If we just go with the renewables that the administration wants, all they can use is ethanol. What we want them to do is use ethanol, if they wish, but to use hybrid cars if they wish. Encourage that, encourage fuel cells, whatever, or premium gas, but let the market deal with it. 
   So there are a lot of exciting things happening. This amendment is going to create competition. There is nothing wrong with competition, good old competition. You pick winners and losers--no guarantees--with competition between the ethanol industry and the clean vehicle market. So why mandate ethanol and exclude clean vehicles? It does not make any sense. 
   So the estimated cost of this approach is represented by the green line on the chart. This is a very good approach that I believe is a compromise that gets us there. It costs us a little more, but it gets us there. Because we can't get there with what is represented by the blue line, I am willing to go here, with what is represented by the green line. 
   Mr. President, I know my time is pretty close to expiring, I am sure. 
   To those who will ask, why does this have to be so complicated, I did not create the issue. I have spent the last 6 months trying to understand it and learn about it. I think I am getting there, with a lot of help. It is a complex issue, with many competing interests. That is the thing. But a simple ban of MTBE does not get everybody there--all the regions of the country. It does not get it done. 
   So a simple ban of MTBE makes gas more expensive and air more dirty. It is not acceptable. We cannot do that. A stand-alone mandate of ethanol does not get you there, either. Smog concerns, cost concerns--particularly in New Hampshire, and other areas of the Northeast, as well as California--that does not get you there. 
   Simply eliminating the reformulated gas mandate does not work, either. That is another option. MTBE would continue to be used and the potential adverse impact on ethanol would be there. 
   I am committed, I say to my colleagues, to a solution that, one, cleans up our Nation's drinking water, and, two, preserves the environmental benefits of the reformulated gasoline program, which is the most cost-effective option for the whole Nation. And that is shown right there with the green line. That is the one we can get it done with. I wish it were here with what is depicted with the blue line, but this will get us there with what is depicted with the green line; and we will do it. 
   So I am convinced this is the right approach. I look forward to working with my colleagues. This is an honest attempt to sit down with everybody and get to a resolution, because to continue to argue about this and debate this, while 
   more and more wells every day get polluted with MTBE, is irresponsible. It is totally irresponsible. 
   We should not be talking about somebody's profit at the expense of somebody's well being polluted. Let's compromise. We will work with you. You can make some profit, but you are not going to make so much profit that we have to stand around and have our wells polluted. That is simply wrong. It is unacceptable. It is irresponsible. I am not going to stand for it. I don't think anybody would who had these kinds of problems. It is irresponsible. So we are going to work together. 
   I am very encouraged by the folks, especially the ethanol Senators, who I have talked with, and their staffs. We have talked to folks in the oil industry. They are not real thrilled about some of this, but, again, this is a solution that we must find. We cannot continue to say we will talk about it next week or we will deal with it in conference or we will deal with it next year. We need to deal with it now. This is a responsible effort to do that. 
   So, again, I look forward to working with my colleagues, and I look forward to that markup on September 7. I intend to be ready for it, and to send that bill out of the EPW Committee and on to the calendar in the Senate.

    Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Paul Montrone upon his recognition as the 2000 New Hampshire ``Business in the Arts-Leadership'' award winner. 
   In order for arts programs to run smoothly and efficiently, there must be a strong leader behind the operation. Paul has been instrumental in the development of the arts in New Hampshire for many years. He has been a leading figure in enhancing corporate and individual financial support both regionally and nationally, and has a demonstrated interest in improving the operation and effectiveness of arts organizations. 
   Paul's strong leadership has proven to be an effective model for others to follow. He gives generously of his time by serving on the boards of many non-profit organizations such as the Wang Center in Boston and the New England Conservatory, and also serves as the president and CEO of the Metropolitan Opera. He personally assists the Mayer Arts Center at Phillips Exeter Academy which attracts visiting artists to display their work on campus and establish residencies and workshops in the surrounding community. He also supports the scholarship program at Phillips Exeter Academy, designed to help support gifted students pursue their dreams in the arts. His early and consistent support of the Music Hall in Portsmouth is yet another testament of his vision and long-term commitment to the community. 
   Without the support of generous financial donations, arts programs would suffer tremendously. Paul has long patronized arts organizations and has convinced major corporations to do the same through ``challenge'' grants. These grants are made at significant points of the fund drive, thereby motivating other potential donors to donate. His keen business skills are evident in the large amounts of financial support he earns for particular programs. 
   It is citizens like Paul who exemplify the importance of civic responsibility. His work in making the arts more accessible to the community is commendable. Without the support of such dedicated people like Paul, the arts would not be able to thrive in New Hampshire. It is an honor to serve him in the United States Senate.

    Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the town of Bedford on its 250th anniversary, an important and historic milestone in New Hampshire's history. 
   The town was incorporated on May 21, 1750. Once an unsettled wilderness located in the heart of New Hampshire, Bedford has grown into a booming residential and commercial community. Its close proximity to the center of Southern New Hampshire makes it very convenient for residents to commute to bigger cities like Manchester and Nashua. Bedford is a thriving small town with a strong commitment to family and community values, evidenced by a first-rate school system and active participation by many residents in civic groups such as the Rotary Club and the Lions Club. 
   The town has come together to celebrate its anniversary with year-long events, such as town picnics, exhibits and a parade marking the town's official birthday. A 250th anniversary ball is planned as the cumulation of the year's events. These celebrations strengthen town organizations' staying-power and provide an opportunity for residents to congregate and enjoy all the town has to offer. The overwhelming number of Bedford residents who attended these events is a testament to their commitment to town and civic affairs. 
   Slowly but surely, this quiet former farming town has seen tremendous commercial growth within the last 50 years. Bedford is now home to many small businesses and office parks, but has certainly not lost that small-town charm. With 16,500 citizens, it is easy  to meet familiar faces in passing. Although the town may be steadily expanding its collection of businesses, the residents have not let them overwhelm their beautiful scenic community. 
   Once again, I want to congratulate the town of Bedford on its 250th anniversary. Stable and secure communities such as Bedford are essentially the backbone of this great nation. It is an honor to serve its citizens in the United States Senate.

    Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the outstanding leadership of Tom Schwieger, President and CEO of the Greater Manchester Chamber of Commerce. Tom's seventeen years of service have been marked by integrity, vision and dedication, earning him the respect and admiration of the people of New Hampshire. 
   During his tenure at the Manchester Chamber, Tom has initiated and overseen some of the most important revitalization projects of the last fifty years. He was the driving force behind the development of the Manchester Airport and the newly approved Civic Center. In 1998, as a testament to the success of Tom's efforts, Manchester was named the best small city in America in which to live. 
   When I speak with Tom, I am always left with the impression that he truly loves what he does. His energy and enthusiasm is contagious and Tom has assembled a very prestigious Board of Directors. As BJ Eckhardt of Business New Hampshire Magazine remarked, ``people are honored to serve on the board; no one says `no' to Tom.'' 
   In addition to his many professional achievements, Tom has served as a mentor and an inspiration to many members of the Chamber staff. Many current New Hampshire community leaders credit Tom with giving them their start and helping to shape their careers. 
   Walter Lippman once said, ``The final test of a leader is that he leaves behind him in other men, the conviction and the will to carry on.'' In his seventeen years at the Chamber, Tom has given the organization direction, drive, and a sense of mission. He has served with spirit and devotion, and his legacy will serve as an example to his successors for years to come. 
   Tom, it has been an honor and a pleasure to serve you in the United States Senate. I wish you the best of luck in your future endeavors. May you always continue to inspire those around you.

    Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Sitesurfer Publishing upon its recognition as a 2000 New Hampshire ``Business in the Arts'' award winner in the microenterprise category. 
   Sitesurfer Publishing has proven that a little bit of time and energy is all it takes to make a significant impact in the arts. This company has allowed such organizations as the Capitol Center for the Arts in Concord to become more competitive in today's high-tech world of on-line business. Sitesurfer created a website for the Capitol Center which resulted in thousands of dollars worth of contributions and tickets sold. This type of competitive edge has attracted worldwide visitors and increased the appeal of corporate sponsorship packages, proving to be the sort of revenue needed to continue the Capitol Center's many programs. 
   Sitesurfer has gone a step further in assuring the future of the Capitol Center's newest technology by providing the necessary hands-on training for the Center's staff to maintain and update the website, while still making itself available for support and hands-on work when it is needed. Sitesurfer understands the importance of making the arts accessible to others by providing memberships and complimentary tickets to their employees and clients. 
   Without the support of dedicated businesses, the arts would not be able to flourish in the state. Despite its small size, Sitesurfer Publishing has demonstrated that even small businesses can take an active role in the community not only by donating money, but by investing time and hard work into civic causes. Sitesurfer truly signifies the deep personal commitment of small businesses across the state to supporting the causes that make New Hampshire the place to call home. It is an honor to represent them in the United States Senate.

    Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Lou Sisson upon her recognition as the Wakefield Citizen of the Year by the Greater Wakefield Chamber of Commerce. 
   Lou's tireless efforts to better her community are truly inspirational in a time where civic duties are declining. Aside from her duties as owner of the Wakefield Inn, Lou has been an active member of the Lions Club, the Women's Club, the Heritage Commission and a founding member of the Wakefield Arts Club. Her long list of involvements are a testament to her strong dedication to the community and her commitment to making various events and programs available to all Wakefield citizens. 
   Lou's hard work on the Sidewalk Committee led to the construction of numerous sidewalks throughout downtown Wakefield, making the streets safer for pedestrians. She is also involved in a summer youth program which recently created a two-mile heritage trail that outlines information about the town's historic sites, providing educational and recreational opportunities for all town residents. Lou truly enjoys volunteering and cites the friendly, personable town atmosphere as the true motivation for her efforts. 
   It is citizens like Lou who make our communities stronger and exemplify what is good about America today. Lou's dedication to making her community a better place to live is commendable. It is truly an honor to serve her in the United States Senate.

   Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Smith-Boxer amendment on Wildlife Services was accepted to the Agriculture appropriations bill. 
   Our amendment will create a pilot study in four States that will examine the effectiveness of nonlethal predation control methods under Wildlife Services. Our amendment is reasonable and fair. 
   Let me briefly talk about the lethal predator control program administered under the Wildlife Service program. 
   With our scarce tax dollars, Wildlife Services personnel kill more than 80,000 mammalian predators a year, mainly coyotes, but also black bears, mountain lions, foxes, and bobcats. 
   They conduct this killing by engaging in aerial gunning, poisoning, and trapping. 
   Since 1993, there have been 18 aerial gunning crashes. In addition, the aerial gunning program has caused the deaths of seven individuals, both Federal and contract employees. 
   Banned in 89 nations because it is so inhumane, leghold traps catch any animal unlucky enough to trigger the device. Animals caught in traps languish and suffer for days, sometimes resorting to twisting off or chewing off a leg to escape its vice grip. 
   I am not standing before you today saying that every program that Wildlife Services executes is harmful or a waste of taxpayer money.  
   There are some valuable programs dealing with property protection, human health and safety, crop protection, natural resources, forest and range protection, and aquiculture which are not affected by this amendment. 
   However, Wildlife Services spends more than $10 million a year on lethal predator control programs. 
   But does the lethal predator control program really work? It does not seem to be controlling the coyote population, it has tripled in number and increased in range because 
   the surviving coyotes will breed more often and produce larger litters. 
   In fact, according to a recent article in the Washington Times, coyotes have now spread to Virginia and Maryland. 
   In addition, this program has been under scrutiny for decades. Several presidential commissions, including commissions in the Kennedy, Johnson, and Carter administrations have criticized the program's needless reliance on lethal predator control. 
   In 1995, the General Accounting Office came to the same conclusion, stating the Animal Damage Control had failed to opt for non-lethal programs. 
   I am well aware that ranchers need to protect their livestock, their investment. During the last 2 decades, there have been a variety of practical and effective nonlethal husbandry techniques developed and put into practical use: The use of guard animals, such as dogs, donkeys, or llamas; the use of electronic sound and light devices; predator exclusion fencing; shed lambing; and night penning, et cetera. 
   By deploying these techniques, ranchers can minimize the need for lethal responses to predators, which are indiscriminant and cruel to animals. 
   In closing I would like to read you a quote from the Tulsa World newspaper, which says it all:  
   Despite steady increases in the Wildlife Services annual budget, and an 8 percent increase in the coyote kill in the past decade, livestock losses to predators have not declined. The statistics show that in every state where predator control was practiced, the agency spent more money on control than the value of livestock lost. It would be cheaper simply to compensate ranchers for their losses.  
   I will repeat that last sentence: ``It would be cheaper simply to compensate ranchers for their losses.'' 
   In short, the lethal predator control program doesn't work, it is dangerous for humans, cruel to animals, and a waste of taxpayer dollars. 
   I thank the managers of the bill for including this pilot study of nonlethal predator control methods in the Agriculture appropriations bill.

   Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, as have so many of my colleagues, I rise today to pay tribute to a friend, PAUL COVERDELL. 
   It is very difficult to look at those flowers, which are silent. As my colleagues do, I find it difficult to deal with. It is something that is very hard for all of us to understand. 
   We are here to pay tribute to PAUL COVERDELL and to express our sincerest condolences to Nancy and his entire family. 
   They say true friends are there when you need them most. We know PAUL COVERDELL was there when we needed counsel. I remember about a year ago I went through some rather difficult times on the floor of the Senate. PAUL was there to counsel me and to give me a lot of advice through all that--for which I will always be grateful--in a political world often poisoned by partisanship. PAUL was always there for counsel and friendship. He was there for all. He was not a partisan person. He could be partisan when he had to be. There is a difference between being partisan and being mean. 
   The Atlanta Journal Constitution said it best when they said: There is a lot of meanness in politics. But he wasn't one of the mean people. I don't think it can be said much better than that. He was a fierce partisan on the battlefield of ideas but not among friends. We are 100 people here who are friends. Even though we have our partisan differences from time to time, we don't take it off the floor. PAUL was certainly a stalwart in leading the way in that. He knew what friendship was and what it meant. Friendship to PAUL couldn't be obscured by any party label or disagreement or an argument. 
   That is why so many of our colleagues have been here today to make tributes. It is also one of the reasons why history will record PAUL COVERDELL as a great Senator. I remember vividly the first time I came to the well and signed the book, being joined with a very distinguished few individuals, a little over 2,000 people throughout the course of our country who have become U.S. Senators. Senator ROBERT BYRD came over to me and said: Don't ever forget that. That is something that they can never take away from you. 
   When you think through the years of all those people, PAUL will be remembered in that way as one of the best in terms of friendship, in terms of his own issues he felt so passionately about--drugs, what drugs were doing to our society, especially to our young people, and education for which he fought so hard. 
   He was a passionate man, a caring man. I don't believe anyone who has ever served here who wasn't compassionate and didn't care could ever be considered an outstanding Senator. PAUL was the best when it came to that. 
   He had the disarming personality, the humor, the quick mind. He had rock solid philosophical groundings. These are traits that made for a great and potent legislator. Most importantly, if he gave you his word, that was it. You could trust his judgment. You could trust his instincts. Most of all, you could trust his motivations were right. They were heart felt; they were sincere; they were honorable. I think that is the most important. 
   There is a campaign slogan that Senator COVERDELL had: COVERDELL works. Those who worked with him every day knew he was tireless. He was working on the day that he was stricken. He was a hard worker. He worked hard for his State and he worked hard for his country and the people in whom he believed. 
   In 1732, when the colonists came to PAUL's great State of Georgia, they came on shore, touched the shore, they kneeled down and said: Our end in leaving our native country is not to gain riches and honor but singlely this--to live in the glory of God. 
   I think PAUL COVERDELL has lived up to that about as well as any human being could, certainly as well as any Georgian 
   could. You can certainly be proud of this Georgian. 
   Abraham Lincoln, on the passing of Henry Clay, said about the ardent patriot and profound statesman: He had a quality possessed by few of the gifted on Earth. His eloquence has not been surpassed in the effective power to move the heart of man. PAUL COVERDELL was without an equal. I think I agree with Abraham Lincoln on that. 
   We all have vivid memories of the last time we spoke to PAUL COVERDELL. I remember on the Senate floor, with all the confusion of the votes on Friday, all the things going on, and although I can't recall a specific conversation, you can always remember PAUL engaging somebody in a conversation. 
   The worst part for me, when I reflect on a sudden death, is if I had the chance to say goodbye, what would I have said? I also find myself wishing I had known so I could take the time to say goodbye. I didn't get that opportunity to say goodbye to a friend that I loved and respected, but if I had the chance, I would have thanked him for his friendship because it means more than anything else here. I would have said: Thanks, PAUL, for being there for me. 
   In his letter to Mrs. Fairbanks, Mark Twain wrote about friendship:  
   ..... I remember you and recall you without effort, without exercise of will; that is, by natural impulse, undictated by a sense of duty or of obligation. And that, I take it, is the only sort of remembering worth having. When we think of friends, and call their faces out of the shadows, and their voices out of the echoes that faint along the corridors of memory, and do it without knowing why save that we love to do it, we can content ourselves that that friendship is a Reality, and not a Fancy, that it is built upon a rock and not upon the sands that dissolve away with the ebbing tides and carry their monuments with them.  
   That is how I feel about PAUL COVERDELL today. 
   The second thing I would have thanked PAUL for, if I had had the chance to say goodbye, was his sense of humor. He had a great sense of humor. Lord knows, one needs a sense of humor serving in this place. It gets intense from time to time. I remember two cases, one recent and one a long time ago, which I will recall. I will take the long time ago first. 
   Some of my colleagues will remember PAUL had a very interesting election. Georgia, at that time, had a law that candidates had to get 50 percent of  the vote to win. PAUL got a little less than that. His opponent got a little bit more than PAUL but less than 50 percent. So PAUL was here and he was talking to Members, saying: I want to join you guys, but I need a little help, a few contributions. We need to have another election and I have to face this guy again with the third guy out. 
   I said: I will help you, but I am not sure that law is right. Maybe the other guy should have won; he got more votes than you the first time. 
   PAUL said: Well, it is all right to change but not yet. 
   I remember that. PAUL said that in his gregarious way, not meaning anything malicious. 
   The second memory I have of his humor was more recent, about 2 or 3 weeks ago. PAUL, who is the conference secretary, came out with this little card. He held the card up proudly. He wanted people to have this for the Fourth of July recess. It proudly boasted ``The Republican Priorities for the Surplus,'' and he want down through the list. We all looked at them and after he finished, Senator after Senator stood up and said: I don't know where you got that, that is not my priority. Who gave you this. And on and on and on for 10 minutes. PAUL took it well. 
   After it was over, I walked up to him and I said: Do you regret you printed the card? 
   He said: Were those guys drinking something; what was going on here? 
   It was a fond memory, but so typical. There was no animosity, no anger, just rolling with the punches. 
   He said: Next time, I will check with a few people before I print the card. 
   If I had the chance to say goodbye, I would have thanked PAUL for that. 
   Let me close by referring to comments that were made several years ago on this floor by our distinguished colleague, ROBERT BYRD, who was talking about the death of William Fulbright. He quoted Longfellow. In quoting Longfellow, Senator BYRD said: 
 There is no death! What seems so is transition; The life of mortal breath Is but a suburb of the life Elysian, Whose portal we call death.  
   Then he went on to say about William Fulbright the same thing I would say right now about PAUL COVERDELL:  
   Life is only a narrow isthmus between the boundless oceans of two eternities. All of us who travel that narrow isthmus today, must one day board our little frail barque and hoist its white sails for the journey on that vast unknown sea where we shall sail alone into the boundless ocean of eternity, there to meet our Creator face to face in a land where the rose never withers and the rainbow never fades. To that bourne, from which no traveler ever returns, [PAUL COVERDELL] has now gone to be reunited with others who once trod these marble halls, and whose voices once rang in this Chamber--voices in this earthly life that have now been stilled forever. Peace be to his ashes!

   Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendments to the Stafford Act in the form of H.R. 707. I would like to thank Senators INHOFE and GRAHAM and their staff for all their hard work in developing a good bipartisan bill. I am proud the committee I chair was able to report a bill to the floor with strong bipartisan support. I am also very pleased the version the Senate passed will save the taxpayer money both in the short and long term. 
   This bill makes great strides to enhance FEMA's ability to better serve the public in times of disaster. It will also help local communities to better prepare and mitigate potential problems prior to a disaster. The mitigation focus in this bill will ensure better protection of life and property as well as providing savings to the taxpayer. 
   The substitute H.R. 707 that has been agreed to by the Senate is identical language to that in S. 1691 as amended by the Committee on Environment and Public Works with the additional Technical and Managers' amendments that were filed. Those who wish to research the legislative history of H.R. 707, as passed by the Senate, should refer to the legislative history of S. 1691 and the report, number 106-295, filed by the Committee on Environment and Public Works on S. 1691.

    Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to honor William Wentworth upon his recognition as the 2000 Entrepreneur of the Year by the New Hampshire High Technology Council. 
   Bill is the President and CEO of Source Electronics, a software programming company that he has increased in size from three employees in 1988 to its current number of 220. Bill's strong commitment to customer service and the highest levels of quality are the primary reason why Source Electronic was able to grow into such a successful business. 
   Source Electronics illustrates true dedication to its clients by tailoring programs to meet their needs, such as an interactive website allowing customers the ability to submit and track their orders. It is competitive advantages like these that set Source Electronics apart from other companies and allows them to do business with large firms such as Lucent Technologies, Cabletron and Motorola, to name a few. The enthusiastic dedication to serve and support the customer is also demonstrated by the entire staff at Source Electronics, undoubtedly a result of the examples Bill has set for others. Under Bill's strong leadership, Source Electronics was voted one of the top ten companies in New Hampshire in 1997 and 1999. 
   The hard work Bill has invested into his company proves his keen business skill. The dedication he has exhibited in placing customer concerns first is truly commendable. It is companies like Bill's that prove New Hampshire's competitiveness in the technological field. Bill, it is an honor to represent you in the United States Senate.

   Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I am proud to come before the Senate today to introduce the ``National Wildlife Refuge System Centennial Commemoration Act of 2000''. This landmark bill commemorates the centennial of the first national wildlife refuge in the United States, established on March 14, 1903, by a great man and conservationist, President Theodore Roosevelt. By setting aside land at Indian River Lagoon on Pelican Island, Florida as a haven for birds, President Roosevelt began a conservation legacy known as the National Wildlife Refuge System. 
   Today, the National Wildlife Refuge System has evolved into the most comprehensive system of lands devoted to wildlife protection and management in the world--spanning nearly 93 million acres across the United States and its territories. By placing special emphasis on conservation, our nation's network of refuges ensures the continued protection of our wildlife resources, including threatened and endangered species, and land areas with significant wildlife-oriented recreational, historical and cultural value. 
   Currently, there are more than 500 refuges in the United States and its territories, providing important habitat for 700 bird species, 220 mammal species, 250 species of amphibians and reptiles, and over 200 fish species. The Refuge System also hosts some of our country's premiere fisheries, and serves a vital role in the protection of threatened and endangered species by preserving their critical habitats. 
   Approximately 98 percent of the Refuge System land is open to the public. Each year, the System attracts more than 34 million visitors to participate in a variety of recreational activities that include observing and photographing wildlife, fishing, hunting and taking part in system-sponsored educational programs. By providing the public with an opportunity to participate in these activities, refuges promote a sense of appreciation for the natural wonders of this nation and emphasize our important role as stewards of these lands. 
   The bill that I introduce today marks a milestone in the history of conservation and celebrates 100-years of the National Wildlife Refuge System on March 14, 2003. The bill commemorates the Refuge System by creating a Commission that will oversee the Centennial anniversary and promote public awareness and understanding of the importance of refuges to our nation. Additionally, the bill directs the Fish and Wildlife Service to prepare a long-term plan for the Refuge System that will enable the Service to look ahead and determine the future needs and priorities of the system network. 
   This bill celebrates the legacy of our national refuge lands, and recognizes the tireless efforts of numerous dedicated individuals from both the private and public sectors who have worked to preserve this invaluable national heritage. I encourage my colleagues to show your support for the National Wildlife Refuge System by co-sponsoring this legislation. I ask unanimous consent to print the text of the bill in the appropriate place in the RECORD.

   Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, the estate tax better known as the ``death tax'' is an onerous tax that should be eliminated. A recent poll revealed that 77 percent of the voters believe that the tax is unfair. 
   This tax is slowly destroying family businesses by slowing growth. And it's unfair that families who have worked their entire lives to build a successful family farm or business should be penalized. 
   Individuals who look forward to leaving something behind for their children should not be punished by confiscatory, anti-family taxes. 
   In fact, after years or even generations, children are often forced to sell the family farm or business just to pay the tax. This is both unfair and unconscionable. 
   However, not only is it the children who must suffer the loss of the family business, but the workers and their children who suffer when they lose their job because the business they've been working at is liquidated to pay the death tax. 
   But it doesn't stop there. The local community, particularly small towns suffers as well because their customers can no longer afford to buy their products after having lost their job. 
   The estate tax is outdated, it raises little money, and it imposes a large cost on the economy. 
   In 1999 the estate tax generated about $24 billion. However, it is estimated that administrative costs to enforce the tax are over $36 billion. 
   A recent analysis by the Heritage Foundation, found that the U.S. economy would average nearly $11 billion per year in additional output. 
   The National Association of Manufacturers states that 40 percent of its members had spent more than $100,000 on attorney and consultant fees related to death tax planning. In addition 3 out of 5 members pay at least $25,000 a year to prepare for the death tax. 
   A 1998 study by the Joint Economic Committee found that if the death tax was repealed, as many as 240,000 jobs would be created and Americans would have an additional $24.4 billion in disposable personal income.

   Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, the hearing the Armed Services Committee held April 6 on the issue of security clearances revealed a shocking lack of concern within DOD for protecting our national security secrets. 
   As a result of that hearing, I proposed an amendment. My amendment, again, is simple. It would prevent DOD from granting security clearances to those who are under indictment for, or have been convicted in a court of a crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding 1 year. 
   It would also disallow a clearance for anyone who is a fugitive from justice; is an unlawful user of, or addicted to any controlled substance; has been adjudicated as a mental defective; or has been dishonorably discharged from the Armed Forces. 
   As I said on the floor earlier, in an investigative series by USA Today, it was reported that DOHA, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals, granted clearances routinely to felons, including a murderer, individuals with chronic alcohol and drug abuse problems, a pedophile and an exhibitionist, and a convicted cocaine dealer. All received security clearances to work for defense contractors. Another individual was awarded a clearance while on probation for bank fraud, yet another was allowed to keep his clearance after taking part in a $2 million fraud against the Navy. Another had a history of criminal sexual misconduct for which he was still undergoing therapy. 
   Common sense dictates that one convicted murderer--or one convicted drug dealer with a security clearance--is one too many. 
   One individual can wreak havoc on national security. The damaging legacy of Aldrich Ames, Jonathan Pollard, the Walkers, and now suspect spy, Wen Ho Lee, is well-known to all of us who deal with national security issues. We simply cannot afford to have loose standards when it comes to protecting our secrets--and protecting lives. 
   Let me just add that during the Armed Services Committee hearing on this issue, the witness from DOD's C3I,  which oversees the Defense Security Services, said this in response to my questioning:  
   I agree wholeheartedly with your observation that one unqualified person for a clearance is one too many, and clearly, I think zero defects is the goals for all of us.  
   Zero defects--that is what DOD said its goal is for security clearances--well, I agree with that completely, but we have to take measures to reach that goal--not just talk about it as an ideal. 
   Realistically, we cannot take all of the risk out of the system, but we can at least take a practical approach to denying clearances to those people who have broken the law by serious infractions. And we can send a message to DOHA that it has been far too lenient in granting clearances. This amendment sends that message.

   Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, in section 1402 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal year 2000, Congress required annual reports by the agency Inspectors General on the transfers of militarily sensitive technology to countries and entities of concern. The first report was issued this spring and focused on so-called ``deemed exports'' or the release of technical data to a foreign national working in or visiting a federal facility in the United States. 
   The DOD IG found that Defense Department research centers released militarily valuable information to foreign visitors without ever determining whether export licenses were required. For example if foreign scientists (whether Chinese or Swedish) visit DOD or other federal labs, export licenses are not being requested before information is transferred. The IG found that Defense Department laboratories and research facilities lack procedures for determining whether export licenses are required, and the auditors found that the services were not even aware of the concept of ``deemed'' exports. 
   During FY99, DOD never asked for a deemed export license and out of 783 deemed export license applications to the Department of Commerce, only five came from the federal government (2 from NASA and 3 from DOE) despite wide-ranging scientific exchange programs with foreign nationals coming to our labs. (The 778 other licenses were requested by industry.) 
   The IG's report reveals another in a long line of security weaknesses recently uncovered. Militarily useful technology is leaking out of the U.S. in many different ways--either by direct commercial sale through relaxed export controls or by lax security procedures and information security polices that encourage effective espionage by nations who do not share U.S. interests. Deemed or knowledge exports are becoming ever more important to U.S. national security. It makes little sense for the U.S. to control the sale of weapon systems abroad, if we allow our potential adversaries to obtain the underlying know-how behind our weapons systems technology and manufacturing processes through scientific exchanges and knowledge transfers. 
   The Inspectors General made a series of recommendations to address the problems with deemed exports policies and procedures in order to better protect U.S. technology. It is anticipated that the IGs will make many more recommendations regarding export control procedures over the next 7 years. Historically, there is always a problem with effective implementation of any oversight recommendation. Without effective follow-up or interest shown by Congress, many IG recommendations are only partially implemented or not at all. The amendment I am offering ensures that Congress will receive a record of the status of agency implementation of recommends made by the Inspectors General on not only this year's deemed exports report, but on the next 6 annual export control reports. This will serve as a basis for possible legislation next year and in the future if agencies are behind schedule in implementing the IGs' recommendations.

   Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I thank the Senate managers for including my amendment in the managers' package. This amendment relates to the Request for Proposals (RFP) recently issued by the National Institutes of Health for the care of 288 chimpanzees recently acquired by NIH from The Coulston Foundation. The Coulston Foundation, an animal research facility in Alamogordo, New Mexico, has a very troubling record of animal care, and has been investigated and charged by the U.S. Department of Agriculture numerous times for egregious violations of the Animal Welfare Act relating to the deaths of several chimpanzees and other primates. At least 14 chimpanzees and 4 monkeys have died at the lab in the past seven years, due to negligence and a lack of appropriate veterinary care. 
   Last August, following the deaths of several chimpanzees at Coulston, USDA ordered the lab to halve its chimpanzee colony, leading to the transfer of 288 chimps to NIH. However, the transfer was in title only. For the time being, the chimpanzees will remain in Coulston's physical possession, in direct defiance of the spirit and intent of the USDA order. 
   I am eager, therefore, for NIH to proceed with its RFP to secure the services of an entity that can provide high quality care for the 288 chimpanzees. The easiest way to ensure this is to insist that bidders for the contract be accredited by the Association for the Assessment and Accreditation for Laboratory Animal Care, International, or AAALAC. AAALAC is a private, internationally recognized accrediting body. Its stamp of approval guarantees that a laboratory provides high standards of care to its animals. AAALAC accreditation is often required in Public Health Service (PHS) contracts and, in fact, is strongly based on strict compliance with NIH's own Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. In 1994, NIH made a site visit to The Coulston Foundation, and recommended that Coulston achieve AAALAC accreditation within 3-5 years. That was six years ago, and Coulston is still not accredited by this international organization, despite applying. 
   Although I would expect that any entity selected by NIH to receive this contract would be highly qualified and therefore AAALAC-accredited, bidders for the contract that are not accredited may demonstrate their qualifications by holding a valid PHS Animal Welfare Assurance. In theory, an Animal Welfare Assurance shows that a laboratory is compliant with the federal Animal Welfare Act and PHS policy on animal care. Sometimes these assurances are restricted. For instance, Coulston's assurance is restricted because of its poor animal care record. However, it is still considered valid. 
   I think it is important to stress that the recipient of NIH's contract should have a good record of animal welfare and should be compliant with federal animal welfare laws. As such, I have included language in my amendment which states that NIH cannot give its contract to a facility that has been charged multiple times with egregious violations of the Animal Welfare Act, as is the case with The Coulston Foundation. These animals can live to 50, even 60 years of age, and are very similar to humans in many ways. We should make certain that they receive the level of care appropriate to them. The amendment which I am offering will address these concerns. I would like to thank the managers for working out this language and for supporting my amendment.

   Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I commend the chairman of the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources on this important piece of legislation. I believe that this legislation, and the electric reliability organizations created by this legislation, will significantly improve the reliability of our transmission system. I understand that a question has been raised, however, about the potential scope of authority of these electric reliability organizations and specifically their authority to waive environmental requirements. I would like to seek clarification of this issue. It is my understanding that nothing in this legislation in any way waives or modifies any environmental requirements, or exempts any facilities covered by the bill from any otherwise applicable federal or State environmental law or regulations, including the requirements of the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, the Endangered Species Act, or any other environmental law.

   Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, the amendment I have offered is a very simple one. It says that none of the funds made available in this act may be used to pay--either directly or indirectly--reimburse, or otherwise compensate any abortion provider, fetal tissue procurement contractor, or tissue resource source for fetal tissue or the cost of collecting, transferring, or otherwise processing fetal tissue if that tissue is obtained from induced abortions. 
   So this amendment is not going to shut down any research using fetal tissue. Some will say that, but that is not the case. It will not do that. 
   I believe it is morally wrong to take the life of an innocent child, an unborn child, in order to advance the health needs of another human being because that child has given no consent for that. So, to be perfectly honest, it would be fine with me if fetal tissue research, using elective abortions, were abolished, but that is not what this amendment is about. 
   I am absolutely in favor of using fetal tissue obtained from spontaneous abortions or miscarriages. There is a difference between a miscarriage and an induced abortion. The difference is that one innocent human life was not deliberately destroyed for the sake of another. In fact, Georgetown Hospital currently conducts research using only spontaneous abortions--very successfully I might add. 
   So this is a reasonable amendment. I am hoping I will be able to work with the other side on this issue to come to some conclusion so it will not be a huge controversy on this bill. We have been working with the distinguished Senator from Pennsylvania on that. 
   But I want to make it clear I am not prohibiting the use of aborted fetuses for research. I am only advocating that Federal taxpayer funds should not be used to pay an abortion clinic or middleman who acts as a fetal tissue procurement contractor for such tissue. 
   Let me repeat this important point. My amendment allows the Federal Government to use fetal tissue from induced abortions, but they cannot pay an abortion provider or a middleman for that tissue, which includes his costs associated with preservation, storage, processing, and so on, because, according to the NIH, there does not seem to be a necessity for a middleman. 
   So the amendment I am offering is really quite simple: No purchasing of fetal tissue from induced abortions. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I appreciate that many of my colleagues, I am sure, as I, have been stuck in the tram coming over here. 
   I thank the managers who have worked so hard to resolve the amendment that I had on fetal tissue research. I know Senator SPECTER is opposed to illegal trafficking of fetal tissue. This amendment, I hope, will get some information on the Federal Government's policies in this regard. 
   I look forward to reviewing the study that we have set up in this amendment that was agreed to. It is my hope that we can ensure that the spirit of the law is being adhered to when it comes to fetal tissue research. 
   This amendment will set up a GAO study of the practice of fetal tissue transfer to determine whether or not any fetal tissue is transferred illegally for research purposes. The GAO will conduct a comprehensive study of Federal involvement in the use of fetal tissue for research purposes. 
   I am pleased that my colleagues have seen fit to work with me to agree to this amendment. I look forward to receiving a report from the General Accounting Office in the very near future as to how much, if any, illegal trafficking is occurring in the area of fetal tissue. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I am proud to join my colleagues, Senators VOINOVICH and BAUCUS, in the introduction of the Water Resources Development Act of 2000. As many of you know, the administration presented a proposal to Congress in April of this year, which I introduced by request at that time. The bill we introduce today includes a number of the provisions contained in the Administration's request, in addition to those Member requests which met the criteria agreed to by myself, Senator VOINOVICH, the chairman of the Transportation and Infrastructure Subcommittee, and Senator BAUCUS, the ranking member of the Committee. 
   In responding to questions regarding what projects were included in this bill, I remind my colleagues that it has been the policy of the Committee to authorize only those construction projects that conform with cost-sharing policies established in the Water Resources Development Act of 1986, and amended by subsequent WRDAs. In addition, it has been the policy of the Committee to require projects to have undergone full and final engineering, economic, and environmental review by the Chief of Engineers to ensure that the project is indeed justified. 
   In ensuring the integrity of the WRDA process, that criteria served as the base to guide us to where we are today. S. xxxx is a responsible bill that provides for the traditional mission of the U.S. Army Corps of engineers and which also recognizes the Corps' expanding presence in the area of environmental restoration. This bill contains 23 authorizations for flood control, navigation, shoreline protection, and environmental restoration projects for which a Chief's Report is expected by the end of the calendar year. In addition, there are approximately 31 project-related modifications and provisions, as well as 35 feasibility studies. While half of the projects in this bill are in the navigation mission, nearly a quarter are dedicated to environmental and ecosystem restoration projects, demonstrating this chairman's belief that the Corps is moving in the right direction. This bill strongly adheres to the fundamental purposes and principles of the Army Corps of Engineers. 
   This sound bill deserves prompt action by not only the Senate, but our counterparts in the House of Representatives, The number of legislative days left this year is dwindling. If we are to enact water resources legislation prior to adjournment, it will take the full cooperation of both Chambers of Congress and our respected leadership. I look forward to working with my colleagues to move the WRDA process forward as expeditiously as possible.

   Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, today is a historic day. I am pleased to be joined by Senators GRAHAM, MACK, VOINOVICH, and BAUCUS, in introducing a measure to restore, preserve and protect one of America's unique ecosystems: the Everglades. More than six months ago, I went to Florida and made a promise to the people of that state and this nation. I promised to make Everglades restoration my top priority as the new chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee. I am proud to say that after many months of hard work, intense negotiation, and through it all, uncompromising dedication, we have before us the bill to restore America's Everglades. 
   Our bill not only has the support of the two Senators from Florida, the chairman and ranking member of the Environment and Public Works Committee and the chairman of the subcommittee of jurisdiction, it has the support of the State of Florida and the administration. It truly is bipartisan. It truly is historic. 
   We all know that the Everglades face grave peril, but such dire situations do not always serve to motivate Congress to act, particularly in a presidential election year. The truth of the matter is that the federal government is partially responsible for the condition of the Everglades and it is our obligation to fix what we helped break. The Everglades cannot afford for Congress to delay. 
   The unintended consequence of the 1948 federal flood control project is the too efficient redirection of water from Lake Okeechobee. Approximately 1.7 billion gallons of water a day is needlessly directed out to sea. The original Central and Southern Florida Project was done with the best of intentions--the federal government simply had to act when devastating floods took thousands of lives prior to the project's construction. Unfortunately, the very success of the Central and Southern Florida Project disrupted the natural sheet  flow of water through the so-called ``River of Grass,'' altering or destroying the habitat for many species of native plants, mammals, reptiles, fish and wading birds. 
   Well, we are going to recapture that wasted water, store it, and redirect it, when needed, to the natural system in the South Florida ecosystem. It sounds simple, but in actuality, the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan is quite complex and will take 30 years to construct. Each step in the Plan was carefully chosen and the bill my colleagues and I have introduced today represents the first stage of that process. 
   A project of this size is not without uncertainties. Our bill authorizes four pilot projects to get at some of those unknowns. In addition, this bill authorizes an initial suite of ten construction projects. These projects were carefully selected by the Army Corps of Engineers and the South Florida Water Management District and included in the plan as the projects that would, once constructed, have immediate benefits to the natural system. Almost right away, the plan gets at restoring the natural sheet flow that years of human interference has interrupted. 
   Our bill goes farther, by authorizing programmatic authority for the Corps and the non-federal sponsor to move forward with critical projects that will have immediate, independent, and substantial benefits to the natural system. Together, these components represent the first phase. The rest of the projects will come to Congress for authorization as part of the biennial Water Resources Development Act. 
   One of my favorite aspects of the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan is its inherent flexibility. If we learn something new about the ecosystem, perfect our modeling techniques, or just plain see that something isn't working right, through the concept of adaptive management, we can modify the plan based on the new information on hand. 
   Is this bill expensive? I suppose that depends on your point of view. I am well-known as a fiscal conservative and I certainly do not believe in wasting the taxpayers' money. The total cost of implementing the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan is $7.8 billion dollars. The total cost to the Federal government, however, is $3.9 billion. That's right. The State of Florida is picking up fifty percent of the tab. $3.9 billion over the number of years that this project will be constructed amount to an average of $200 million a year. That is about a can of coke, if you can find the right machine, for each American each year to restore this national treasure. It should be noted that I fully support increasing the budget of the Corps of Engineers so that it can comfortably fund not only this project, but the numerous other meritorious projects within the Corps mission. 
   I hear my colleagues asking: how do we know the natural system is going to be the primary beneficiary of the water made available by this project? I'll tell you how. Our bill contains painstakingly negotiated ``assurances language'' that provide the mechanism by which water is reserved and allocated for the natural system. The Secretary of the Army and Governor of the State of Florida will enter into an up-front, binding agreement that will ensure that water available from the plan will be available for the natural system. Furthermore, the Secretary of the Army, in concurrence with the Governor of the State of Florida and the Secretary of the Interior will promulgate programmatic regulations to ensure that the goals and purposes of the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan are achieved. 
   I repeat for the benefit of my colleagues, this bill has the support of the State of Florida, the administration, and a bipartisan group of co-sponsors. This truly is a remarkable feat that deserves recognition by the Senate in the form of swift passage. 
   I am afraid too often people forget that the Everglades is a national environmental treasure. Restoration benefits not only Floridians, but the millions of us who visit Florida each year to behold this unique ecosystem. We need to view our efforts as our legacy to future generations, as my dear friend and predecessor, the late John Chafee so exemplified. Many years from now, I hope that this Congress will be remembered for putting aside partisanship, politics, self-interest and short-term thinking by answering the call and saving the Everglades while we still had the chance.

    Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to an individual who has distinguished himself in the State of New Hampshire by performing the outstanding heroic act of saving the life of a resident of the town of Bedford. 
   Ryan Belanger acted selflessly on April 9th, 2000, to rescue resident Paula Halla, only moments before her car exploded. Paula's car had been struck off the road by a tree that fell during a storm, leaving her trapped in the burning vehicle anxiously awaiting rescue crews. 
   Belanger, who noticed the vehicle after also striking the fallen tree, checked on the passengers in his vehicle and immediately rushed to the aid of Paula. Without hesitation, Ryan Belanger began to attempt to put out the fire, and pulled Paula from the burning car only moments before it exploded. 
   Citing his late grandfather's influence and love of life, Belanger stated, ``He was my father, and made me who I am. If it wasn't for him, I wouldn't have pulled that lady out of the car.'' Had Ryan not acted with haste, Paula would have most likely been killed in the incident. Instead, she escaped with minor bruises and cuts. 
   I am honored to recognize a true American hero, and to commend him on his successful efforts to rescue a fellow resident of the state. He quickly rescued Paula Halla from her vehicle, saving her life. He is an inspiration to the town of Bedford, his home town of Manchester, and the state and nation as a whole. I applaud his courage and perseverence in the daring rescue. It is truly an honor and a pleasure to represent him in the United States Senate.

    Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the town of Salem on its 250th anniversary, an important and historic milestone. 
   Since being incorporated as a town on May 11, 1750, Salem has provided its residents with a safe place to raise families in a convenient location on the border of New Hampshire and Massachusetts. This thriving community boasts countless recreational opportunities. Canobie Lake attracts boaters, fishermen and those just looking for a peaceful place to relax. People from all over New England flock to Canobie Park to enjoy a day of games and fun during the summer months, and those who are looking for a little history can visit America's Stonehenge. 
   Salem's 26,000 residents have seen a great amount of change throughout its 250 years. The town is now home to numerous industrial firms, and will soon welcome Cisqo to the growing number of businesses that call Salem home. Salem also offers numerous shopping outlets, most notably the Mall at Rockingham Park, with opportunities for great tax-free shopping. 
   Salem is also home to some very talented athletes. Olympic Women's Hockey Gold Medalist Katie King was a multi-sport star at Salem High before the world took notice in Nagano in 1998. And Salem High's softball team is a perennial state power, taking the state title once again this year. 
   Salem is also a very politically active town as it recently opened its Republican Town Committee offices. Also, the town has come together to celebrate its 250th anniversary, celebrating with events that began with a tremendous First Night party to mark the year 2000 and will culminate with a party on the Fourth of July. Once again, I want to congratulate the town of Salem on its 250th anniversary. It is an honor to serve its citizens in the United States Senate.

   Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. I rise in support of the Enzi amendment. 
   Senator ENZI's amendment would delay the costliest mandate ever imposed on small businesses. 
   The Occupational Safety and Health Administration, OSHA, has published a rule that is the broadest and most expensive rule ever, let me say that again, ever proposed by OSHA. There needs to be more study of this rule before it is implemented. 
   Ergonomics is the science of fitting the job to the worker. 
   The OSHA proposed ergonomics rule would require employers to eliminate or materially reduce hazards in the workplace that lead to injuries such as carpal tunnel, tendinitis, and back injuries. 
   OSHA's cost estimate is $4.2 billion a year. Clinton administration's own Small Business Administration reports that the true cost would be $40-$60 billion a year--at least 10 times OSHA's estimate. 
   The Heritage Foundation estimates that the cost would be $5.7 billion to $10.8 billion per year without adding in the cost to state and local governments, and $6.6 billion to $12.5 billion per year if public-sector workers are included. Private industry estimates the bill's cost would be even higher. 
   OSHA expects that the proposed rule will significantly increase the number of requests for state compliance assistance and consultation services. That means this regulation will cost even more money. 
   The ergonomics rule probably would expand state workers' compensation systems, increasing claims and fraud. 
   This is yet again, an unfunded mandate on the states. Yet the OSHA has a limited public comment period that does not take into consideration the huge cost to business and the probable stress to the unprecedented economic growth that the U.S. is currently experiencing. 
   I urge your support for Senator ENZI's amendment, so that OSHA can reassess their proposed regulation that would burden the business community with a costly regulation. 
   On the prescription drug plan, I oppose the Robb plan. In my hand is a report, the actuarial report from Norman and Robinson, which says it will cost seniors $40 per month, up to almost $500 a year, and cost hundreds of billions of dollars to the taxpayers. That is the Robb plan. 
   Senator ALLARD and I have a plan and we want to try to get the attention of the Finance Committee. This plan has no premium increases on seniors. It saves seniors $550 a year. It is budget neutral. It covers 50 percent of the cost of drugs, up to $5,000. 
   Those are the two alternatives. This was done by King Associates. Guy King was a former actuary at HCFA. 
   I think the distinction is clear. How did we help seniors by raising premiums, when we don't have to raise premiums with this plan? 
   I hope my colleagues pay close attention to what Mr. King has said. This plan is sound. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I compliment my colleague from Florida for his leadership. He has been stalwart over the years he has been a Senator from the State of Florida, as well as a Congressman, in his efforts to bring the end to the Castro regime. I applaud his leadership on that issue. We will miss him when he leaves the Senate. 
   This amendment establishes a commission on U.S. Cuban policy. The problem is it is totally irrelevant to the underlying legislation. It is an important issue, no question. But this deals with a controversial foreign policy matter, not a defense matter. It doesn't belong on the Defense authorization bill where we are funding programs that are vital to our national security. This is just one more issue that  comes before the Senate and causes heartburn for all who are trying to get a Defense authorization bill passed. 
   I know it is of great frustration to the chairman of the committee, Senator WARNER, who is a strong and steadfast supporter of the fine men and women in our Armed Forces. We have the Senate Foreign Relations Committee; we have the House International Relations Committee. They are composed of Members who have been duly elected, as we were, by the American people. It is their responsibility to examine United States policy toward Cuba. I think those committees have done a commendable job in overseeing U.S. Cuban policy. 
   This administration has had almost 8 years to reexamine or redirect, if they so choose, a policy towards Cuba. Why a commission now, in the twilight hours of the administration, providing 8-4 representation of the President's party to ``reexamine U.S. policy toward Cuba''? As the Senator from Florida said, it is political. Why should this administration, with 6 months left, tie the hands of the next administration, whatever that administration is? 
   As the Senator from Connecticut said on the floor last Friday, the commission is supposed to take a new look at Cuba because the Senator believes current policy is not working. That leaves me to suspect that this commission is stacked and will have a predetermined outcome based on its flawed composition. We can make that case. I believe its objective is to support lifting the embargo originally supported by John F. Kennedy but given teeth by passage of the Helms-Burton law, signed by President Clinton. President Clinton wants to open relations now with Castro, appoint six members of the commission and, for the minority, two more. It is pretty obvious what the objective is. 
   I don't understand how the Senator from Connecticut could have so vigorously supported economic sanctions against South Africa, because of apartheid, but believes we should lift sanctions against Communist Cuba. As a matter of fact, Jeff Jacoby, in an article in the Boston Globe in 1998, said it best when talking about those who support this lifting of the embargo:  
   When they looked at the Filipino dictatorship, America's foreign policy said, ``Marcos must go.'' 
   When they look at Chilean dictatorship, they said, ``Pinochet must go.'' 
   When they looked at the Haitian dictatorship, they said, ``Cedros must go.'' 
   Of Zaire they say, ``Mobutu must go.'' Of South Africa they said, ``Apartheid must go.'' Of Burma they say, ``SLORC'' (as the dictatorship is called) must go. Of East Timor they say, ``The Indonesian occupiers must go.'' 
   But of Cuba, which bleeds under the bitterest and most implacable tyrannies on the planet, they say: The U.S. embargo must go.  
   You can't say it much better than that. 
   The Senator from Connecticut believes the embargo has impoverished Cubans. This is the old ``blame America'' argument. It is Castro who impoverished Cuba, no one else. We know that. Cuba trades with the rest of the world and its economy is still a basket case. That is because the Soviet Union is no longer in existence and no longer propping them up. The Senator from Connecticut says U.S. policy should not be focused on one individual. But it is that individual who dictated that trade with Cuba could only be conducted with himself and its ruling elite--no one else. So it is Castro who is the issue. 
   Cuba, according to the standards of the Department of State, is a state cosponsor of international terrorism. Why should America reward a declared terrorist nation by reconsidering our appropriate tough stance toward Fidel Castro and its cruel regime? Cuba is a major international trafficker of illegal drugs, drugs which fuel crime in this country, spousal and child abuse in this country, and other social ills in America which result in the deaths of some 14,000 young people every year. 
   Congressman BEN GILMAN, who chairs the International Relations Committee, called for a thorough investigation of Cuba's link to drug trade, noting seizure of 7.5 metric tons of cocaine consigned from Cuba. 
   I don't understand the logic of this issue, aside from the fact it is on the wrong legislation. 
   Our Drug Enforcement Administration testified that such a massive shipment did not represent the first time Cuba was involved in transiting illegal drugs. Regrettably, despite this enormous seizure, the administration declined to include Cuba as a major drug transit nation. Imagine, declining to include 7.5 metric tons of cocaine from Cuba, and yet we didn't see fit to list them as a major drug transit nation. 
   We don't need a taxpayers' subsidized commission to figure out what is wrong with Cuba. We have plenty of evidence, and it is Fidel Castro. The State Department lists Cuba in its annual State Department country reports on human rights practices, citing the deplorable record of abuse by the Castro regime. Amnesty International has condemned Cuba's human rights violations. 
   Last month, the United Nations Human Rights Commission condemned Cuba for the eighth time for its systematic violation of human rights. 
   Let's not forget something that is very important, which I do not think anyone else will bring up here today but I will. It has been stuck in my craw for a long time. That is how Cuba treated American POWs during the Vietnam war. I want to get into a little bit of detail because these people who did this are still free in Cuba, still have the opportunity to conduct their lives as usual. We have never brought them to justice. 
   From August 1967 until August 1968, a small detachment of Cubans, under the direct leadership of Fidel Castro, brutally tortured a select group of American POWs at a POW camp on the outskirts of Hanoi known as the Zoo, appropriately named. The goal of this Cuban detachment was most likely to test new domination techniques and involved a combination of brutal physical torture and cruel psychological pressure. 
   During the first phase of this program, 10 American POWs were selected and separated from the remainder of the prison population. The POWs were then unmercifully beaten and tortured in ways I will not even discuss here on the floor of the Senate they were so bad. Other prisoners were often forced to watch what the Cubans did, torturing their cellmates. Despite their heroic efforts, by Christmas all 10 POWs were broken. 
   Not satisfied with breaking the 10 American POWs, the Cubans began to select a second group of POWs in early 1968 and the torture started again. John Hubbell, in his classic study of the POW experience in Vietnam, described one of the Cuban's victims:  
   The man could barely walk; he shuffled slowly, painfully. His clothes were torn to shreds. He was bleeding everywhere, terribly swollen, and a dirty, yellowish black and purple from head to toe.......his body was ripped and torn everywhere; hell cuffs appeared almost to have severed the wrists, strap marks still wound around the arms all the way to the shoulders, slivers of bamboo were embedded in the bloodied shins and there were what appeared to be tread marks from a hose across the chest, back and legs.  
   That POW later died as a result of his torture, and those individuals who did that still survive in Cuba. They still have not been brought to justice. We will lift the embargo right after we find out who those people were and we bring them to justice, Mr. President, with all due respect. The Cuban program ended in 1968. The North Vietnamese continued to utilize the barbaric methods that the Cubans taught them under the direction of Fidel Castro. They learned their torture well. 
   Who were these barbarians? Only Castro knows for certain. We should also demand that the Cuban murderers of the ``Brothers to the Rescue,'' unarmed civilian American pilots whom President Clinton promised would be punished in 1996, be brought to justice as well. 
   In Castro's Cuba, the Code for Children, Youth, and Family, provides for a 3-year prison sentence for any parent who teaches a child an idea contrary to communism. Imagine that, a 3-year prison sentence for any parent who teaches a child ideas contrary to communism. The code states that no Cuban parent has a right to ``deform'' the ideology of his children. And the State is the true ``father.'' 
   That is parental rights, Cuban style. Welcome back to Cuba, Elian. 
   At the age of 12, children are separated from their parents for mandatory service in a work camp. According to the renowned Cuban dissident Armando Valladares, children in these camps  suffer from venereal diseases and teen pregnancies which inevitably end in forced abortions. 
   You know what. We don't need a commission to figure this stuff out. We know what is going on. The best way to bring it down is to keep the pressure on Castro. 
   Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time and yield the floor.

   Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, in closing, I want to respond to a few remarks that have been made. The Sun-Sentinel, in an article entitled ``Why Trade With Such A Deadbeat?'' says:  
   If the U.S. trade embargo is lifted and Castro gets fresh U.S. lines of credit to buy American products that Castro can't and won't repay, it will be the American taxpayer who will then be stuck with the bottom line.  
   Our colleagues should be reminded of the fact we will extend credit, but we will wind up paying for it because Castro will write off the debt and will not bother taking the time and trouble to pay us back. 
   Also, the School of International Studies, University of Miami, points out:  
   Without major internal reforms in Cuba, the Castro Government and the military, not the Cuban people, will be the main beneficiary of lifting of the embargo.  
   I respond to my colleague who made a point of saying Nixon went to China in 1972. Look at China today: forced abortions and some of the worst human rights violations in the history of mankind. There is still a regime in power that represses human rights worse than any regime in history. 
   Let's compare that to Ronald Reagan who stood up to the Soviet Union and said: This is the evil empire, and I will not back down in doing the right thing, which is to keep the pressure on them until they fade away. 
   The differences in history are pretty obvious. It is not that difficult to understand. Cuba was a small country when Fidel Castro took power, and now 1.5 million people have left that country. We should not be working at all to remove the embargo from that country.

   Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise to oppose the Murray amendment. Under current law, performing abortions at military medical facilities is banned, except for cases where the mother's life is in jeopardy or in the case of rape or incest. So what this amendment would do is strike this provision from the law, thereby, in my view, turning military medical treatment centers into abortion clinics. I think we have to think hard about that, whether or not that is really the purpose of military medical treatment centers because that is the bottom line. That is what this would do. 
   The House recently rejected a similar amendment by a vote of 221-195. It was offered by Representative LORETTA SANCHEZ of California. A number of pro-life Democrats joined with Republican colleagues to defeat this amendment. 
   In 1995, the House voted three times to keep abortion on demand out of military medical facilities before the pro-life provision was finally enacted into law. Over and over again in Congress, we had votes. Last year, I think it was 51-49. It was very close. I will not be surprised to see the Vice President step into the Chamber, anticipating a possible tie vote, because this administration is the most abortion-oriented administration in American history. I think we can be treated, probably, to that little scenario as well. I think that shows a stark difference between the two candidates for President of the United States, I might add. 
   When the 1993 policy permitting abortions in military facilities was promulgated, many military physicians as well as many nurses and supporting personnel refused to perform or assist in these abortions. In response, the administration sought to supplement staff with contract personnel to provide alternative means to provide abortion access. 
   This is a very sensitive situation. You may have a military nurse or person who is a member of the military who works at that hospital who may be opposed to abortions, does not want to perform them. So when that happens, the President now has asked that we get contract personnel to come in because people opposed to this on a moral basis, because of conscience, refuse to perform them. That is basically the way it is in American society today. 
   The dirty little secret about the abortion industry is the doctors who perform them are not really considered to be the top of their profession. In fact, it is usually the dregs who are performing the abortions, not the good doctors. So if this amendment were to be adopted, not only would taxpayer-funded facilities be used to support abortion on demand, but resources, Government resources, would be used to search for, hire, and transport new personnel simply so abortions could be performed on demand.  
   It would be nice if we could spend a little time debating the defense budget on the Defense bill. I sat through 2 hours of one nongermane amendment a while ago on Cuba sanctions, now abortions on demand, where we are talking about bringing all kinds of new people, a new bureaucracy, if you will, who are to hire, transport, search for personnel to perform abortions because people of conscience in the military do not want to perform them, so we, therefore, have to replace them. 
   As the Congressional Research Service confirms, a 1994 memorandum from the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs directed the Military Health Services System:  
   ..... to provide other means of access if providing prepaid abortion services at a facility was not feasible.  
   This is absolutely wrong. It is wrong morally, No. 1. But it is also a waste of precious military resources, which are so much needed today. By the way, because of this amendment and other nongermane amendments, we are holding up the passage of this bill, which includes a pay raise for our military that this President has sent all over the world time and time again. So this is an unnecessary amendment. The DOD has not been made aware of a single problem arising as a result of this policy. 
   American taxpayers should not be required to pay for abortions. In 1979, the Hyde amendment was passed to prohibit the use of taxpayer moneys to fund abortions. In Harris v. McCray, the U.S. Supreme Court held the right to an abortion does not include the right to have the taxpayer moneys pay for it. It is DOD policy to obey the laws of the nations in which bases are located. Thus, even if the Murray amendment is adopted, abortions will still not be available on all military bases. Spain and Korea prohibit abortion, for example. 
   The ban is not intended to and does not block female military personnel from receiving an abortion. As the Senator from Arkansas has pointed out, DOD has a number of elective procedures for which it currently does not pay. As the Senator said, any woman can fly on a military aircraft for $10 on a space-available basis to have an abortion somewhere else, unfortunately. 
   In other words, the woman could still get an abortion if she wanted one, again, unfortunately. In fact, many women often travel back to the U.S. to receive their abortions. The question is, Should we pay for it at the hospital? That is the question. Should we hire more people, more support people just for the purpose of performing abortions in these military hospitals? I say the answer to that is no. 
   Some would argue the woman would be inconvenienced, that she would have to have her leave approved, she would have to get her transportation. But she could still get her abortion. I am not sorry, frankly, that someone has to be inconvenienced for having an abortion. Frankly, I wish somebody would give them the time and counsel to discuss this issue so they could fully realize what they are doing, taking the life of an unborn child who has no voice, who has no opportunity to say anything. I wish we would have that opportunity to provide that woman that kind of counseling so she would not do it and regret that decision for the rest of her life. Abortion should never be convenient because when a woman chooses an abortion, she is choosing to kill her baby. It is not a fetus, it is a baby. It is an unborn child. Her baby never had a choice. 
   Military treatment centers, which are dedicated to healing and nurturing life--healing and nurturing life--should not be taking the lives of unborn children. Also, these hospitals treat the combat wounded in war. Those who are hurt are treated. There have been so many hospitals throughout the years that have been so outstanding in their treatment, saving so many lives. The great attributes they have received for doing that should not now become a part of this abortion debate and be involved in killing innocent children, that some of the people who were treated in those hospitals, if not all, fought so they could be free, 
   so those children could be born in freedom. Those people who were wounded and treated in those hospitals did not do it to take innocent lives. They did it to allow those innocent lives to be born into freedom. 
   That is the bitter irony of all this: the taking of the most innocent human life, a child in the womb, taking place in a hospital that treated those who fought to allow that child to be born into freedom. 
   What a dramatic irony that is. The bottom line is it is immoral to make hard-working taxpayers in America pay for abortions at military hospitals, and it is immoral to perform those abortions. I urge my colleagues to vote no on the Murray amendment. 
   I yield back the remainder of my time.

   Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. I yield myself 1 minute. 
   It is not our fault that Cuba is repressive. It is Castro who is to blame. Appeasing Castro by instituting the commission whose stealth objective is to lift the embargo without Castro having undertaken any reforms is nothing more than a unilateral and unwarranted concession to a regime which refuses to concede even the smallest effort to reform human rights. 
   This is not the appropriate vehicle for this bill, the Armed Services Committee. There are other important things with which we need to deal. Cuba should first change its policy toward its own people, and after that, the United States can change its policy toward Cuba.

    Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the outstanding leadership of PSNH President and CEO Bill Frain. The core qualities of a great leader--vision and values--are often overlooked in the hustle of today's corporate society. PSNH President and CEO Bill Frain is one leader whose accomplishments and dedication to both his vision and values have gained him the respect and admiration of individuals across the state. 
   After years of service to PSNH and its surrounding communities in the great state of New Hampshire, Bill Frain is retiring from the company. It has been both a great honor and a distinct pleasure to work with Bill over the years, and I salute him for his unwavering dedication to New Hampshire, its citizens and its economy. 
   Bill often quotes the adage, ``Storms make oaks take deeper roots.'' Through his navigational skills and constant perseverence, Bill brought PSNH to a level where it is currently one of the most respected companies in the state and that earned him the honor of being named ``Business Leader of the Decade'' by Business New Hampshire Magazine. 
   Bill is often described by his peers as a strong leader who is able to motivate those around him to continued success. Over the years, I have seen first-hand his ability to inspire, and I applaud his talents and dedication to New Hampshire. 
   I wish Bill much happiness as he embarks on this new journey in life, as he will be missed. I want to leave Bill with a poem by Robert Frost, as I know that he has many more miles to travel and endeavors to conquer.  
   The woods are lovely, dark and deep. 
   But I have promises to keep, 
   And miles to go before I sleep. 
   And miles to go before I sleep.  
   Bill, it has been a pleasure to represent you in the United States Senate. I wish you the best of luck in your future endeavors. May you always continue to inspire those around you.

   Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, this is one of these issues that gets convoluted. Unfortunately, in my role as the chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee, I must object to this authorizing amendment to the appropriations bill. I join several of my distinguished colleagues, including my ranking member, Senator BAUCUS, in this regard. 
   I point out upfront I am a cosponsor of S. 1144. I support State flexibility. I support a cost-effective rail system that is efficient. And I encourage Amtrak to move towards privatization. The States do have an interest in developing passenger rail. I want the States to have that flexibility, which is why I cosponsored S. 1144. 
   Rail funding flexibility is a complex subject central to the so-called TEA-21 legislation which was debated and negotiated over many months in the last Congress. This issue is squarely in the jurisdiction of the authorizing committee, not the Appropriations Committee. We have had this fight many times before. The majority leader has spoken eloquently on this matter time and time and time again. We basically render the authorizing committees powerless, useless. What is the purpose? 
   I have spent days and days and days and weeks and weeks in an effort to resolve a matter that deals with buses, an amendment or some language that would be acceptable so we could vote for this. If we had done that, perhaps we wouldn't be here now. Instead, we are now faced with a decision. I have to oppose something that in essence I support, but for some language that would deal with the problems the bus companies have. 
   This is an authorizing committee matter. Time and time 
   again we legislate on appropriations bills, and time and time again the authorizing committees become useless. Since it has been reported, I have spent several months working on substantive amendments to this bill. This bill has holes. On behalf of rail flexibility and the railroads, I have tried my best to get around the holes, to no avail. 
   This provision requires more thought, more consideration, better timing. Members of the Environment and Public Works Committee have a difference of opinion on this amendment. I respect that. That is the way the process works. I have no problem with people having their own views, and I am sure they don't have a problem with me having mine. We ignore the authorizers' concerns if we shove this through on an appropriations bill. The House appropriations bill had another version of rail flexibility, and it was struck by a point of order. 
   I am very concerned about continuing Amtrak competition with intercity bus service, which is why I have spent with my staff on the committee weeks and weeks negotiating, working, trying to come up with language that would be acceptable. Rail service will prosper if it is integrated with feeder bus service. That is how rail will prosper. The rails have limits as to where they can go. Feeder buses have more flexibility. That enhances the rail. 
   Not included in this amendment is a specific prohibition against these funds being used for Amtrak operating subsidies. Not included in this amendment is any mechanism to prevent below-cost pricing that damages existing bus service. And not included in this amendment is any mechanism to ensure rail and bus service are integrated. This amendment in its current form leaves many holes in this important policy, without protecting the buses or the State government from the influence of Amtrak. 
   Balanced intercity transportation is important. This amendment cannot strike the right balance, I regret to say. I ask my friends in the Senate to keep this provision in the jurisdiction of the Environment and Public Works Committee where it belongs. If you are on the committee, do what I am doing, even though in essence, with the exceptions I noted, I support S. 1144. Keep this matter in the jurisdiction of the committee where it belongs. 
   We will continue our hard work on making it good legislation for all the competing interests. If this provision goes on the appropriations bill, my committee cannot work on negotiations in conference. All who worked so hard to craft this, going back to when my predecessor was chairman of this committee, Senator John Chafee, when the process began, S. 1144 was marked out of committee and put on the Senate calendar. The idea behind that is, if there is a conference on this bill with the House Members of the Environment and Public Works Committee, which brought the bill out, we would have a right to conference. We are not even going to be in the conference now. We are totally shut out of the process. 
   I say to my colleagues, I don't care where you are on the issue itself--whether you are for rail, bus, no rail flexibility, total rail flexibility--the right thing to do here is to support a rule XVI point of order because it is legislating on appropriations. Senator LOTT has spoken about that issue over the past several weeks. I encourage my colleagues to support the rule XVI point of order. I am not sure who yet will raise that point of order. I may do it, Senator BAUCUS may do it. We will talk about that. The point is, the rule should be raised and will be raised. I encourage my colleagues to support the rule XVI point of order to this legislation on appropriations bills. 
   I yield the floor.

    Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, today I rise along with Senators DURBIN, KERREY, LAUTENBERG, and JEFFORDS to introduce the Chimpanzee Health Improvement, Maintenance and Protection (C.H.I.M.P.) Act. This legislation will create a nonprofit sanctuary system for housing chimpanzees that federal researchers have decided are no longer needed for their research. Our bill, establishes a public/private matching fund which will provide for the permanent retirement of these animals. This is a wonderful opportunity for the Senate to support the sanctuary concept which is backed by many distinguished scientists, including Dr. Jane Goodall and humane people across the country. Mr. President, in the wild, the chimpanzee is an endangered species. We are fortunate that we have an opportunity now to provide decent, humane care for a species which is, sadly, on the decline in its natural habitat. 
   At this point in time we have a tremendous surplus of research chimpanzees in the United States. It began in the 1980's, when the terrible AIDS epidemic first appeared. Researchers in Federal agencies created breeding colonies of chimpanzees in five regional chimp centers. The hope was that chimpanzees, because of their genetic similarity to humans, would be a good model for various AIDS vaccine experiments. Scientists discovered, however, that although the chimpanzees proved to be carriers of the virus, that once it was injected into them, the chimps do not develop full-blown AIDS. 
   For this reason, many researchers are, in their own words, getting out of the chimp business. The chimpanzee does not serve as a model for how the disease progresses in humans and the researchers want to divest themselves of these intelligent animals. The problem is that there is really no place for the chimpanzees to go. Many of the chimps will live to be 50 years old! It is estimated that several hundred of the approximately 1,500 chimps currently in labs are ready to be sent to sanctuaries, but that we lack the sanctuary space to house them. 
   In a sanctuary the chimps can be put in small groups rather than living in isolation as many do in labs. Small social groups enable the chimps to recover from research more quickly both physically and mentally, and it is far more cost-effective than housing them in the present laboratory system. We should remember that taxpayers are currently footing the bill for what is basically the ``warehousing'' of these animals in expensive and inhumane labs. 
   I have based many of the features of the C.H.I.M.P. bill on a report entitled ``Chimpanzees in Research: Strategies for Their Ethical Care, Management, and Use,'' that was published in 1997 by the National Research Council. In this study of research chimps, the well-respected National Academy of Sciences (NAS) reported that there may be approximately 500 chimpanzees that are no longer needed in research. The NAS recommended that NIH initiate a breeding moratorium for at least 5 years, that surplus chimps be placed in sanctuaries rather than be euthanized, and that animal protection organizations, along with scientists, have input into the standards of care and the operation of the sanctuaries. 
   Our bill has addressed all these issues and is supported by The American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, The American Anti-Vivisection Society, The Humane Society of the United States, The National Anti-Vivisection Society and The Society for Animal Protective Legislation. I want to again point out that our bill does not interfere with any ongoing medical experiments involving chimps. The bill allows for the retirement of chimps only after the researchers themselves have decided that a chimp is no longer useful in research. This is the humane, ethical, and fiscally responsible way to handle the question of what to do with a surplus of intelligent animals who have contributed to the knowledge of science and the health and well-being of humanity. This really should be a nonpartisan issue and I am proud to ask for the support of all my Senate colleagues.

   Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Michigan for working with me. I wish to clarify that he is not necessarily agreeing with all of it, but he has agreed to the modification allowing me to modify my amendment, which he did not have to do. I appreciate it very much. 
   Before getting into the detail of the tragedy of the U.S.S. Indianapolis, which happened so many years ago in 1945, I commend my colleague and the chairman of this committee, Senator John WARNER, a former Secretary of the Navy. When I first approached Senator WARNER on this topic, he was somewhat skeptical, as I was frankly, when I first learned of it. But he took the time to listen to the details and the facts that came forth. He granted a hearing at my request on the U.S.S. Indianapolis matter. We heard from survivors and we heard from the Navy. We heard from all sides. As a result of that hearing and the information provided, Senator WARNER worked with me to draft language in this bill to correct an egregious mistake. 
   Some have said that we are rewriting history in this debate. I am a history teacher. I don't believe you can rewrite  history. I think history is either factual or it isn't. But I think we can correct this. If a mistake is made, or has been made, then I think we have an obligation to correct that mistake. In that view, I want to share with my colleagues over the next few minutes what happened in 1945. 
   Senator WARNER mentioned an old colleague of his, a friend of his, who had been one of the officers to rescue the crew of the U.S.S. Indianapolis. It was only 4 months before that my own father, a naval aviator, was killed just prior to the end of the Second World War after having served in that war. This incident happened just days before the end of the war in which over 1,200 men went down and only 300 and some survived. 
   These tragedies happened. It is terrible. It is part of the war. 
   I wish to share with my colleagues what happened and why we are doing what we are doing. I believe that a grievous wrong was committed 55 years ago, and it stained the reputation of an outstanding naval officer. I refer to the late Capt. Charles Butler McVay, III, who was tried and convicted at a court-martial, unjustly I believe. I believe that firmly. I believe that based on the facts. He was tried and convicted unjustly as a result of the sinking by a Japanese submarine of his ship, the U.S.S. Indianapolis, shortly before the end of the Second World War. 
   The loss of the U.S.S. Indianapolis to a Japanese submarine attack happened on July 30, 1945. It remains without question the greatest sea disaster in the history of the U.S. Navy. Eight-hundred and eighty men perished. Of the 1,197 men aboard, 880 died at sea. An estimated 900 men, however, survived the actual sinking, but they were left, in some cases, without lifeboats, without food, and without water. And they faced shark attacks for 4 days and 5 nights. 
   If you can, imagine the horror of that experience of being thrown into the sea in a matter of minutes after a torpedo attack by an enemy submarine and to be in the water with sharks for 4 days and 5 nights without lifeboats, in some cases, and without food and without water. Only 317 of those men remained alive when they were discovered by accident 5 days later, because when their ship failed to arrive on schedule, believe it or not, it was not missed. The ship that was scheduled to 
   arrive in port 4 or 5 days before was never even missed. The Navy had completely lost track of this cruiser, the U.S.S. Indianapolis, and its entire crew. When it didn't come into port, nobody missed it. These men literally stayed at sea for 4 or 5 days. The only hope they had was the fact that an SOS had been sent out and somebody had heard it, and they would be found. 
   This tragedy, as you might expect, was a great embarrassment to the U.S. Navy. It was such an embarrassment to the Navy with a ship going down that the news was not given to the public until the day that President Truman announced the surrender of Japan, thus, lessening its coverage by the media, and as a result its impact on the American people. 
   Let me frame this again: In the same day's news, President Truman announces the surrender of Japan and then this footnote that the U.S.S. Indianapolis was sunk with 317 survivors. 
   Today, only 130 men still live who survived from the U.S.S. Indianapolis. In April of 1998, I met for the first time with 12 of those survivors. 
   I might add that, sadly, as the months go by survivors pass away. Most of these men are in their seventies and eighties. Every day that goes by and we don't get this issue resolved is another day that we lose survivors. 
   But they were in Washington to plead for legislation for one simple reason: To clear their captain's name. They were accompanied by a young boy by the name of Hunter Scott of Pensacola, FL, whose school history project had led him to join their cause. I learned from those survivors and from this young boy, who was only 13 years old at the time, the story of the sinking. I had heard about it. I had read about it. But I didn't really know all of the facts. I learned that the survivors had been unanimous for over a half a century in their efforts to have their captain's good name restored. For 50 years, they have fought to restore their captain's name, saying that he was unjustly court-martialed and found guilty of the loss of the U.S.S. Indianapolis. 
   Hunter Scott's involvement had renewed interest in their cause, and Hunter Scott's involvement, I think, as a young boy, came as a result of the book called ``Fatal Voyage: The Sinking of the U.S.S. Indianapolis,'' written by Dan Kurzman. 
   With no financial interest in the book, I would certainly recommend that book to anyone who wishes to know the facts of what happened with the U.S.S. Indianapolis. 
   But Mr. Scott had attracted the attention of the media as well as the attention of his Member of Congress in the House of Representatives, Congressman Joe Scarborough, who had already introduced legislation in the House which called for a posthumous pardon for Captain McVay. 
   Hunter Scott can be very proud. He demonstrated that one person with grit and perseverance, in search of justice, can find that justice in the Halls of Congress. This boy, at the age of 12 or 13, brought the facts of this case to the Congress. As a result, language now is in this Defense authorization bill which will clear Captain McVay's name as a result of this 12 or 13-year-old boy. 
   When we hear stories about young people today, we always hear the bad things. This is good. He is a very impressive young man. He testified before the Armed Services Committee. He wasn't nervous. He held his own. He answered tough questions. He had the answers without any hesitation. 
   Last April, I had another meeting with a second group of survivors, and young Hunter Scott, who had returned to Washington once again in their effort to right what they believed was a wrong. In spite of the hearing, we still haven't gotten it done. Their story, in turn, got my attention and led me to introduce Senate Joint Resolution 26, which expresses the sense of Congress that Captain McVay's court-martial was morally unsustainable; that his conviction was a miscarriage of justice, and that the American people should now recognize his lack of culpability for the loss of the ship and the lives of 880 men who died as a result of the sinking. 
   Mr. President, this language does not erase the conviction of Captain McVay from his record. We in Congress don't have the authority to erase the conviction of a court-martial. It must remain on his record. But it is not, in my view, a stain on Captain McVay's record. I believe it is a stain upon the conscience of the Navy. Until this or some future President sees fit to order it be expunged, we can't do that. If I could, I would, with the stroke of a pen. I urge President Clinton, or any other President in the future, to do it. But I can't do it. This Senate can't do it. 
   This resolution does something very important. It represents acknowledgment from one branch of this Government, the U.S. Congress, House and the Senate, that Captain McVay served capably, that his conviction was morally wrong, and that he should no longer be viewed by the American people as responsible for this horrible tragedy which haunted him to the end of his life. 
   I will take you back 55 years, the end of the Second World War, the late summer of 1945. After surviving a kamikaze attack off Okinawa in March of 1945--which killed 17 of his crew--Captain McVay returned the Indianapolis safely to California for repairs. For those who are probably too young to remember the war, a kamikaze attack was a Japanese aircraft that flew directly into the ship with the pilot of the Japanese aircraft giving up his own life to crash land the aircraft into the ship to blow it up. Kamikaze attacks killed a lot of Americans. 
   McVay's ship and McVay survived, but it killed 17 of his crew. McVay got the ship back to shore. Remember, this ship was just hit by kamikaze attack, but this captain was so well respected and admired by his naval superiors that once the ship was repaired, they didn't even have time to go out and have a shake-down cruise. It was selected to transport components of the atomic bomb which was ultimately dropped on Hiroshima by the Enola Gay. They were to deliver the components for that bomb. McVay, among all other captains, and McVay's ship, the Indianapolis, was selected for that critically important duty. 
   It successfully delivered the bombing parts to the island of Tinian--and, coincidentally,  setting a speed record across the Pacific for surface vessels which stands to this day. 
   Here is a ship that was hit by a kamikaze. There was very little time to check the repairs, no shake down, the repairs were performed, and they were given the materials for the bomb and departed for the island of Tinian. The ship was routed on to Guam after that duty for sailing waters to Leyte. At Guam, Captain McVay requested a destroyer escort--this is very important. At Guam, Captain McVay requested a destroyer escort across the Philippine Sea. No capital ship without antisubmarine detection equipment, such as the Indianapolis, had ever made that transit unescorted throughout World War II. No ship had ever gone from Guam to Leyte during the war without an escort. McVay requested one. McVay was denied. No escort. He was told it was not necessary. 
   Navy witnesses at a hearing last September on this resolution conceded that this was the case. The Navy conceded that no escort was provided, even though it was requested. Even worse, McVay was not told that shortly before his departure from Guam, an American destroyer escort, the U.S.S. Underhill, had been sunk by a Japanese submarine within the range of his path. Navy witnesses in our September hearing on this bill conceded that this was the case. A request by McVay for a destroyer escort to go from Guam to Leyte. Request denied. Never happened before. They always had escorts. 
   Second, the U.S.S. Underhill had been sunk by a Japanese submarine in the same sea route. They never admitted this. 
   Third, U.S. intelligence furthermore broke the Japanese code and learned that the I-58, the Japanese submarine, the very submarine which sunk the Indianapolis, was operating in the path of the Indianapolis. So we had U.S. intelligence that had broken the Japanese code and said the I-58 Japanese submarine was operating in the path of the Indianapolis. Many responsible for routing the ship from Guam to the Philippines were aware of the intelligence, but McVay was not told. Navy witnesses at our hearing conceded that was true. That is why, to his credit, Senator JOHN WARNER came over to this issue. 
   Mr. President, upfront I will say my duty is not to dump on the Navy. I am a former Navy man. My dad was a naval aviator. I love the Navy. 
   But if a mistake is made, we ought to admit the mistake. When the Indianapolis was sunk, naval intelligence intercepted a message from the I-58 that it had sunk an American--they said battleship--along the route of the Indianapolis. That message was dismissed as enemy propaganda. Naval witnesses at our hearing conceded that was also the case. 
   So after the ship was sunk, they stayed in the sea for 4 to 5 days because they thought it was propaganda that the Japanese said they sunk a ship. It was a reasonable mistake, I suppose, but maybe they could have checked it out. 
   It should be remembered at this point that hostilities in July 1945 had moved far to the north of the Philippine Sea. We were preparing for the expected invasion of Japan over 1,000 miles away. The Japanese surface fleet was virtually nonexistent. Only four Japanese submarines were thought to be operational in the entire Pacific region. It is fair to conclude from these facts that there was a relaxed state of alert on the part of naval authorities in the Marianas, and it is also fair to conclude, as a result that, Captain McVay and the men of the Indianapolis were sent into harm's way without a proper escort or the intelligence which could have saved the ship and the lives of the 880 members of its crew. 
   They were in a relaxed state. Captain McVay was basically given no reason to be alarmed about anything. 
   Following the sinking, the Navy maintained the ship had sunk so fast it had not time to send out an SOS. For many years, this was never contested. But following appearances on several national TV programs, Hunter Scott, this 13-year-old boy, had received word from three separate sources, each providing details of a distress signal of which they were aware which was received from the ship and which, in each case, had been ignored. So the SOS did go out, but it was ignored. 
   At the September hearing, one of the survivors who had served as a radio man aboard the ship testified that a distress signal did, in fact, go out. He said he watched the needle ``jump,'' on one of the ship's transmitters, signifying a successful transmission. Today, however, the Navy still holds to its position that a distress signal was never received and the truth will likely remain a mystery in this incredible story, never to be resolved. 
   Following his rescue from the sea, Captain McVay was faced with a court of inquiry in Guam, which ultimately recommended a court-martial. Fleet Adm. Chester Nimitz and Vice Adm. Raymond Spruance, who was McVay's immediate superior and for whom the Indianapolis served as flagship, both of these legendary naval heroes of war went on record as opposed to a court-martial for McVay--opposed. Adm. Ernest King, then-Chief of Naval Operations, overruled both Spruance and Nimitz and ordered the court-martial. To the best of my knowledge, this is the first time in the Navy's history that the position taken by such high-ranking officers has been countermanded in a court-martial case. 
   The question has to be, Why does the Chief of Naval Operations overrule the two officers in command? Admiral Nimitz, one of the most highly respected officers in the entire war in the Navy, recommended no on the court-martial. He was overruled by the CNO, who was not even there. Why? Why? 
   I believe one of our witnesses at the September hearing, Dr. William Dudley, Chief Naval Historian, may have given us the answer. He testified that Admiral King was a strict 
   disciplinarian who, ``when mistakes were made, was inclined to single out somebody to blame.'' 
   I am forced in this instance to use the word ``scapegoat'' because I believe that is exactly what Captain McVay became. Brought here to the Washington Navy Yard to face his court-martial, Captain McVay was denied his choice of a defense counsel and assigned a naval officer who, although he had a law degree, had never tried a case before. Neither Captain McVay nor his counsel were notified of the specific charges against him until 4 days before the court-martial convened and the charges against him were specious at best. 
   The Navy settled on two charges against Captain McVay: No. 1, failing promptly to give the order to abandon ship, and, No. 2, hazarding his ship by failing to zigzag. In other words, if you know there are enemy ships in the area, if you zigzag, it is harder for the enemy ship to get a reading on you and sink you. 
   He was ultimately found innocent on the first charge, failing to promptly abandon ship, when it became apparent--and it should have been long before the charge was brought--that there was no foundation for such charge because he did give the order. The torpedo attack had immediately knocked out the ship's intercom and officers aboard the ship were forced to give the abandon ship order by word of mouth to those around them. The ship was hit and it sunk in a matter of minutes. The entire intercom system was knocked out and you had to give the order to abandon ship one person at a time. 
   This charge, the second charge, failure to zigzag, including the phrase ``in good visibility,'' became the basis for his conviction. In other words, failure to zigzag in good visibility became the basis for his conviction, one which effectively destroyed his career as a naval officer. 
   Let's look at the validity of that charge. Captain McVay sailed from Guam with orders to zigzag at his discretion. Shortly before midnight on July 29, 1945, the day before, with visibility severely limited--you zigzag in clear weather--visibility severely limited, and with every reason to believe the waters through which he is sailing were safe, McVay exercised discretion with an order to cease zigzagging and retired to his cabin, leaving orders to the officer of the deck to wake him if the weather conditions changed. 
   Whether weather conditions changed is debatable. Some survivors say it did. Some were not sure. But survivors were unanimous in depositions taken shortly after their rescue that it was very dark prior to and at the time of the attack; that the visibility was  poor. Chief Warrant Officer Hines, for example, stated he could hardly see the outlines of the turrets on the ship. His and other similar depositions were not made available to Captain McVay's defense counsel. 
   Again, why not? The Navy maintained, and still does today, that the visibility was good when the Indianapolis was spotted and subsequently torpedoed and sunk that night, ignoring the sworn statements of those who were there when it happened; ignoring them. 
   Why is this important? It is important because there were no Navy directives in place then, or today, which either ordered or even recommended zigzagging at night in poor visibility. The order to zigzag was discretionary even if the weather was poor. 
   Moreover, in voicing opposition to Captain McVay's court-martial, Admiral Nimitz, in charge of the Pacific Fleet, 
   pointed out:  
   The rule requiring zigzagging would not have applied, in any event, since Captain McVay's orders gave him discretion on that matter and thus took precedence over all other orders.  
   This is a point, I might add, which Captain McVay's inexperienced defense counsel never even addressed at the court-martial. 
   To bolster its case against McVay, the Navy brought two witnesses to the court-martial. I have to say this has to be in the category of the unbelievable. One of the witnesses at Captain McVay's naval court-martial, brought in by the U.S. Navy, was a man by the name of Hashimoto, who was the captain of the submarine which sank the U.S.S. Indianapolis. The captain of the submarine which sank the U.S.S. Indianapolis, the enemy sub, the captain was brought in to testify against a naval captain. That, my colleagues, was uncalled for. It was the height of insult. Imagine this captain, after losing his crew to an enemy torpedo, not even being told by his superiors that there were enemy ships in the area, has the captain of that ship testify against him--an outrage. 
   The other witness was Glynn R. Dunaho, winner of four Navy Crosses as an American submarine captain during World War II. Neither helped the Navy's case. Both Hashimoto and Dunaho testified that, given the conditions that night, either one of them could have sunk the Indianapolis, whether it had been zigzagging or not. 
   They thought Hashimoto would have helped them. He said he could have sunk the ship; it didn't matter whether it was zigzagging or not. Unbelievably this testimony was brushed aside by the court-martial board. 
   In our hearings in the Senate this year, high-ranking Navy witnesses insisted Captain McVay was not charged with the loss of his ship; he was not even considered responsible for the loss of the ship or the loss of life. They insisted he was guilty only of hazarding his ship by failing to zigzag. 
   One question they declined to answer: Would he have been court-martialed if he had arrived safely in the Philippines but had failed to zigzag that night? The answer, quite obviously, is no. And the Navy's argument simply denies logic. 
   In other words, if failure to zigzag is the problem, then you ought to nail an officer who doesn't do it before a tragedy, not after. If he had arrived in port safely, would he have been charged? The answer is no, of course, he wouldn't have been charged. He had an unblemished record as a naval officer. 
   It defies logic, but it happened. 
   In truth, McVay's orders gave him discretion to make a judgment, but when he relied on the best information he had, which indicated his path was safe, and exercised that discretion on a dark night, he ended up with a court-martial and humiliation. 
   No intelligence was given to him. Nobody told him there were enemy submarines in the area. Nobody told him the Underhill was sunk days before. No one told him any of that. They also told him he had discretion to zigzag. 
   In spite of all that, they court-martialed him. They humiliated him for making a judgment call under circumstances which any one of us would have done the same, including those who court-martialed him. 
   Captain McVay's judgment call to zigzag was not responsible for this disaster, period. Other judgment calls may have been. Let's review some of them. 
   There was a judgment that his passage was safe; to deny him destroyer escort; to deny him the intelligence about the sinking in his path of the Underhill; to ignore the Japanese submarine's report that it had sunk an American battleship along his route; to ignore the failure of the Indianapolis to arrive on schedule; if they were, indeed, received, to ignore the distress signals which were reported to be sent out; and to deny Captain McVay the vital intelligence that the Japanese submarine which sank his ship was operating in its path. 
   Those responsible for these judgment calls were far more responsible for the loss of the Indianapolis and its crew than its captain. Guess what happened to them. Nada. No court-martial. Nothing. Nothing happened to those who ignored the intelligence. Nothing happened to those who did not tell the captain about the Underhill. Nothing happened to those who did not even report the loss of the ship. Nothing. 
   Recently, my distinguished colleague and chairman, Senator WARNER, received a personal letter from Hashimoto, the captain of the Japanese submarine.

   Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, in his letter, Hashimoto confirmed his court-martial testimony by stating that he could have sunk the Indianapolis whether it had zigzagged or not. Then he went on to say:  
   Our peoples have forgiven each other for that terrible war and its consequences. Perhaps it is time that your people (to) forgave Captain McVay for the humiliation of his unjust conviction.  
   That came from the man who sank McVay's ship. He was a dedicated, committed Japanese officer who, if you read Mr. Kurzman's book, was glad at the time he sank the ship and, in fact, was looking for a ship to sink. 
   Hashimoto attended that court-martial. In the English translation of a recent interview Hashimoto gave to a Japanese journalist, here are some excerpts about the court-martial of 
   McVay:  
   I wonder (if) the outcome of that court-martial was set from the beginning.....because at the time of the court-martial, I had a feeling it was contrived.......  
   That came from Hashimoto. There are other comments Hashimoto makes, Mr. President. 
   There is one direct quote I want to give from his interview:  
   I understand English a little bit even then, so I could see at the time I testified that the translator did not tell fully what I said. I mean it was not because of the capacity of the translator. I would say the Navy side did not accept some testimony that were inconvenient to them.  
   As I conclude, I repeat, I love the Navy. I served the Navy in Vietnam, and I would do it again. My father was a naval aviator and a graduate of the Naval Academy. He was killed at the end of the Second World War after serving in the Pacific and in the North Atlantic. I have no intention of embarrassing the Navy. That is not my purpose in sponsoring this legislation. 
   It is apparent that the old Navy made a mistake when they court-martialed Captain McVay to divert attention from the many mistakes which led to the sinking of the Indianapolis, mistakes beyond McVay's control and responsibility. 
   It is important to note that at least 350 ships were sunk by enemy action during World War II. No other captain was court-martialed. Only McVay. Tell me, after listening to this testimony, how hard and convincing was the evidence that he deserved to be court-martialed? The answer is no hard evidence that he deserved to be court-martialed. 
   Captain McVay was a graduate of the Naval Academy in 1920. He was a career naval officer who had a decorated combat record, which included participation in the landings in North Africa and an award of the Silver Star for courage under fire earned during the  Solomon Islands campaign. He was a fine officer and a good captain, and his crew members who survived readily attest to it. To the man, to their dying breath, they have defended this captain after 50 years. What kind of a man would have that kind of capacity? What kind of man would have the crew 50 years later, after enduring this, and with every reason to be angry with him, with every reason to hate him after almost dying in the sea, with him? 
   The court-martial board found McVay guilty of hazarding his ship by failing to zigzag. His sentence of a loss of grade was remitted in 1946, and he was restored to active duty by Admiral Nimitz who replaced Admiral King as Chief of Naval Operations. But his naval career was ruined. You do not survive that stigma. He served out his time as an aide in the New Orleans Naval District before retiring in 1949 with a so-called ``tombstone promotion'' to rear admiral. 
   Sadly--and this is the worst part of the story--Captain McVay took his own life in November 1968. Those who knew him feel strongly that the weight of his conviction and the blame which that conviction implied for the loss of the Indianapolis and the death of the crew was a reason for his suicide. 
   Captain McVay is gone. It is too late for him to know what we propose to do, but the undeserved stain upon his name remains. Time is running out for the 130 people out of 300-some who survived, united and steadfast for half a century to clear his name. We owe it to them, to him, and to his family to clear 
   his name. 
   We have forgotten that these men survived 4 terrifying days and 5 frightening nights in the sea, fighting off sharks, starvation, and no water. Let's not forget them again. 
   Again, I thank Senator WARNER. Without Senator WARNER, we would not be able to make this happen. I am pleased to hear the House Armed Services Committee adopted the original legislation which I introduced in the Senate. I look forward to working out some language differences on this matter in conference. 
   We now have the opportunity to give the remaining survivors of this terrible tragedy what they deserve and have fought for so hard and so tenaciously for so long: an acknowledgment by their Government, by their Navy that they made a mistake. After 55 years, we make it right that their captain was not to be blamed for the loss of the Indianapolis nor the loss of their shipmates. This is not historical revisionism. It corrects a longstanding historical mistake and rights a terrible wrong.

   Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Virginia, the chairman of the Armed Services Committee. The ``U.S.S. WARNER'' has been under siege on the floor for the last few days, but, as usual, he  holds up well under hostile fire and keeps his ship on course. 
   If anyone needs to be reminded, this is a debate supposedly about the bill to fund the operation of our armed services. It is a good bill for our military. It doesn't do everything we would like, but it certainly makes a vast improvement over what we have been doing. 
   I rise to show support for that bill. As a member of the committee, I helped to write it, and also to show support for my chairman who has endured some hostile fire, I think, unfairly. 
   During the recess last week, the Members had the opportunity to remember those who fought for the freedom that we enjoy in this Nation, and remember those who paid the ultimate price in giving their lives. That was the Memorial Day recess. 
   I think in deference to those and to those who now serve us, I think we ought to stay focused, as the chairman has tried to do here, on the issue at hand. This is not a debate about campaign finance, nor should it be. We owe it to the soldiers, sailors, and airmen who serve today, who will serve in the future, and to those who have already served, to get this bill passed, and to do so quickly. 
   I think we should be reminded that this bill authorizes over $300 billion in defense spending--a 4.4-percent real 
   increase--reversing some 14 years of neglect. 
   You can go down the list: But aircraft, helicopters, submarines, surface ships, many other weapons systems, and missile defense, on and on--not to mention addressing some real critical needs in readiness. 
   The bill adds about $1.5 billion for key programs in readiness, including ammunition, spare parts, maintenance, operation, and training. This is very important. 
   I think it is below the dignity of those who have served and will serve and who are serving to reduce this debate to something other than what the issue is at hand. That is what disturbs me. 
   I understand and fully respect the right of any colleague to offer an amendment that is within the rules, and I respect it. But I also don't think it is good judgment to do it. 
   This bill is going to modernize our forces. It will allow us to develop the technologies that we need to address the threats that we face in the coming century in areas such as missile defense. 
   My colleague, Senator ALLARD, who chairs the subcommittee I used to chair on strategic forces, has done an outstanding job in addressing that, as have so many of my other colleagues. This will allow us to address the quality of life of our service men and women and their families. There is a 3.7-percent pay raise in this bill. 
   I am not commenting on the importance or lack of importance of the other issues that we debate here. But it is not the appropriate place to do it. Is it within the rules of the Senate to do it? Yes. In that sense, I suppose you can say it is appropriate. But is it the right thing to do on a military budget and on the defense budget of the United States? I don't think so. I think it does not dignify the debate. I think it reflects badly on the Senate. That is my honest opinion. 
   I know the frustrations. We have had debates on campaign finance and the proponents of campaign finance reform have lost, repeatedly. I understand the frustration. I have been on the losing side on many of debates many times. I look forward to the day some of the debates will have a majority to win. 
   Maybe that is the approach we ought to take, rather than, with all due respect, dragging this defense bill into this debate. 
   I will highlight a couple of other things. As chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee, this bill has $1.27 billion for environment restoration. I thank the chairman for his outstanding leadership in putting this together, as well as Senator LEVIN. 
   The bill also authorizes additional funds for programs important to New Hampshire and the Nation. These programs address unfunded military requirements, continue or enhance current promising Department of Defense programs, or support the technology base needed for future military systems. Inclusion of these additional funds is testament to the technical expertise and successful competition for DOD contracts of defense companies and institutions in my home State of New Hampshire. 
   In addition to authorizing a $350 million increase for important missile defense programs that I support, this bill provides important funds that the President neglected in his budget that are important for the U.S. to maintain its leadership in military space power. It authorizes $25 million for the Kinetic Energy Anti-Satellite (KE-ASAT) program that will provide a last-resort ``hard-kill'' capability for the U.S. to protect our troops from enemy surveillance. It authorizes an additional $15 million for the Space Maneuver Vehicle to leverage the NASA X-37 investment in an area that also holds great promise for military applications. It also authorizes an additional $12 million for micro-satellite technology that demonstrates key future space-control concepts. 
   The bill also pays a fitting tribute to our former President Ronald Reagan and his vision for our nation's missile defense by renaming the Kwajalian missile test range in his honor--a facility we use to test and refine our missile defense concepts making an NMD deployment possible today. 
   Finally, it includes additional tasks for the Space Commission which is just getting started not only to assess the organizational and managerial changes needed to ensure U.S. space power in the years ahead but also address the cultural issues in the military that dampen our ability to become a true space power. 
   I will mention one other item before I yield the floor. I have an amendment I have offered that has not yet been voted on. I will highlight it for a minute. The amendment was modeled on the restrictions which have been placed on gun ownership. It says if you are a felon, you don't get a security clearance. That is the essence of it. It is pretty well refined. The language is a little tighter than that so the definition of ``felon'' is restricted. 
   It is very interesting that under current law you can have access to some of the highest ranking military secrets, about some of the biggest weapons in America's arsenal, but you can't buy a handgun. What does that say about the security clearances we are issuing, if you can't have access to a pistol or rifle, but you can have access to the most lethal weapons in America's arsenal? It is happening now. Murderers, robbers, and pedophiles are getting security clearances, and they couldn't have access to a handgun. I think it is pretty interesting that we are in this situation. 
   My amendment, which, hopefully, will be added to the bill, prohibits security clearances for persons actually sentenced to over a year--in essence, a felon. If you plead, bargain down a sentence to under a year, you can still never own a firearm but you could, without my amendment, get a security clearance. 
   I hope we will pass my amendment. I look forward to a vote on that amendment. If it is accepted, that will be fine. If it is not accepted, I look forward to the vote. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, to refrain from the debate that might delay the passage of this legislation, and send a message to our troops that we care about them, we are ready to help their readiness, we are ready to help with the new weapon systems they need, and we are ready to give them the pay raise they deserve. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Today, the chairman of the Committee on Environment and Public Works, ranking minority member of the committee, chairman of the Subcommittee on Superfund, and ranking minority member of the subcommittee, have come together to introduce a bill that protects the environment, encourages community involvement, promotes economic redevelopment, encourages the preservation of green spaces, and sets the stage for future efforts of comprehensive Superfund reform. 
   As a nation, our industrial heritage has left us with numerous contaminated abandoned or underutilized ``brownfield'' sites. Although the level of contamination at many of these sites is relatively low, and the potential value of the property may be quite high, developers often shy away from developing these sites. One reason for this is uncertainty regarding the extent of contamination, the extent of potential liability, or the potential costs of cleanup. 
   With the introduction of the Brownfield Revitalization and Environmental Restoration Act of 2000, we focus on the uncertainty facing developers, property owners, and communities as to the status of low-risk contaminated sites. 
   At the beginning of this Congress, Administrator Browner and Assistant Administrator of Office of Solid Waste and Emergency Response, Tim Fields, testified that EPA was interested in pursuing legislative reform only in some narrow property owner areas and in brownfields. We have worked to address their suggestions and hope that in the future they can work with us to address a broader comprehensive Superfund effort. 
   Concerns exist for some Committee members that taking brownfields out of a comprehensive Superfund reform package will jeopardize future Superfund reform. Although I agree with my colleagues that comprehensive reform is needed, I feel that we can move forward with brownfield legislation without compromising comprehensive reform. 450,000 brownfield sites exist in the United States. These sites are low risk sites and are not the traditional Superfund sites that would be affected by comprehensive Superfund reform. If States and citizens are discouraged from cleaning up these sites, continuing the barriers to redevelopment, these sites may someday become Superfund sites. 
   As brownfield sites are outside of the scope of Superfund, I believe that liability carve-outs are outside of the scope of any brownfields legislation. As I have in the past, I continue to oppose narrow carve-outs. Carveouts weaken attempts at overhauling the remedy selection and liability allocation provisions in the current Superfund statute and, frankly, make a bad system worse. This brownfield legislation does not affect the allocation of liability at Superfund sites, instead, it provides  needed resources to address sites, provides certainty to those who voluntarily cleanup, and prevents brownfields from being included in the Superfund web. Brownfield legislation presents a win-win for all involved and should jumpstart action on substantive Superfund reform in the next Congress. 
   This is a new era of environmental and infrastructure legislation. Since we have been paying down the debt, we are now able to return money to local communities to help them solve environmental problems and are encouraging partnerships are between federal entities, States, and local communities. It is an exciting time to be working and investing in our environment.

   Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, this amendment is really quite simple. It involves the issue of whether or not a felon should get a security clearance. That is the essence. If you favor felons having a security clearance, you would vote against my amendment. If you think it is wrong that convicted felon should have a security clearance, then you would vote with me. 
   On April 6 there was a hearing the Armed Services Committee held that touched upon an important and urgent issue, that of the longstanding protections set in place to guard the most vital secrets of the Nation and of our national security community. But we had a virtual security meltdown in this administration, from our DOE labs to people without clearances getting White House passes, to the recent scandal of missing and highly classified State Department laptops. It goes on and on. While we couldn't possibly begin to address all our Nation's security deficiencies within this one authorization bill, I believe we can make progress in one very specific area. 
   A reporter by the name of Ed Pound of USA Today has done an outstanding job with recent news reports and investigative reporting on this issue.

   Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. At the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals, USA Today reported that felons, convicted felons--I want my colleagues to listen carefully here--convicted felons, including a murderer, individuals with chronic alcohol and drug abuse problems, a pedophile, an exhibitionist--all received security clearances in order to work for defense contractors. 
   I want to repeat that because I think most people would say, you have to be kidding, that really happened? The answer is yes, which is why this amendment is so urgently needed. This was investigative reporting by USA Today that reported that a murderer, people with chronic alcohol and drug abuse problems, a pedophile, and an exhibitionist received security clearance to work for defense contractors. 
   There was another individual who was awarded a clearance while on probation for bank fraud. Yet another was allowed to keep his clearance after taking part in a $2 million fraud against the U.S. Navy. Another had a history of criminal sexual misconduct for which he was still undergoing therapy. 
   For goodness' sake, I say to my colleagues, most of us and the American people would say: Gee, to get a security clearance, that is a big deal; you get to see all the secrets. At least that is what the people think. We have different levels of security clearances, from confidential, to secret, to top secret, to code level. These are security clearances for individuals who have no right to get those clearances, and I think every American would agree: $2 million in fraud against the U.S. Navy, pedophiles, murderers, chronic alcohol and drug abusers getting security clearances to see the highest classified material on various defense contracts. 
   An even more egregious example is that an administrative judge at the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals--that is who hears these cases--granted a clearance to a defense contractor's project manager who had a lengthy history of drug and alcohol abuse, including two convictions of selling cocaine for which he served two separate terms in Federal prison. Overriding Government lawyers who said this man's criminal past made him ineligible for a clearance, the judge at this defense hearing ruled this individual ``had no desire to ever engage in criminal conduct again.'' 
   I repeat. This is an individual who was granted a clearance by an administrative judge at the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals. He had a lengthy history of drug and alcohol abuse, including two convictions for selling cocaine and served two separate prison terms for it. The Government lawyers said: No, this guy should not have a clearance; what are you talking about here? 
   They were overridden. The judge ruled the individual ``had no desire to ever engage in criminal conduct again.'' Therefore, we will give him his clearance. 
   The case in point, when somebody else comes along tomorrow and says: Yes, I robbed a couple of banks, killed a couple of people, but I am sorry; I will not do it again if you will just give me my security clearance, that is what I am talking about. That is the logic: Yes, I sold a little cocaine, maybe I used a little cocaine; I am sorry. Can I have my clearance? I want to get access to classified secrets so I can work for a defense contractor. 
   It is unbelievable to think this is happening in our Government, but it is. Common sense dictates that one convicted murderer or one convicted drug dealer with a security clearance is one too many. 
   I have been told by at least one former DOD official that the USA Today's reported cases of felons granted security clearances is probably only the tip of the iceberg. These are the ones we know about. 
   I am also informed that the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals is the only organization dictated to by attorneys, while in the others--for example, the military services--the security specialists are in charge. We want the security specialists to be in charge, and apparently they are not. 
   A frequent complaint is when there is reasonable doubt about an applicant, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals judges rule in favor of the applicant rather than the national 
   interest. This is a very important point. Do you err on the side of national defense, national security, national interest, or do you err on the side of the individual? 
   This is not rocket science, and it is not a big deal about how they do this. Yet it is happening. In other words, err on the side of the individual; he will be OK; he is sorry; he is not going to do it again; do not worry about the cocaine; do not worry about the murder; do not worry about that; it is fine; we think he will be OK so we are going to err on his side, not on the side of national security. 
   I say to my colleagues, we all have staff who get security clearances. My colleagues know how tough it is to get them and how long they wait and what they put these guys and gals through. My colleagues know what is on the forms and how long it takes to get a  clearance. It is an outrage this is occurring. 
   The adjudicative guidelines require that national security be the first priority. Those are the guidelines. These guidelines are not being enforced. As my colleagues watch me, they must be thinking: This cannot be true; he has to be blowing smoke; no way. 
   It is true. I have researched these cases. Senator HARKIN, who has done an outstanding job, has also researched these cases. Senator HARKIN is with me on this amendment. In fact, he first helped bring this to my attention. 
   When I repeatedly questioned the DOD general counsel at the April 6 hearing about whether it is acceptable to grant a clearance to an individual who committed a cold-blooded murder, he would not say no to my question. 
   I said to him: Is it acceptable ever to grant a clearance to an individual who committed a cold-blooded murder? I wanted him to say no. I gave him every opportunity to say no, but he refused to say no. 
   If you do not say no, it has to mean there is a time when it is in the interest of the individual, never mind national defense, to grant the clearance because he may not commit a murder anymore and he might be great. He could be the greatest contractor employee the Defense Department ever saw, but do we want to take the chance? Do we want to take a chance? 
   If my colleagues had a staff member who was asking for a security clearance--I do not know if they would be working for them if he or she committed a murder, but if they did and tried to get one, good luck. We know they would not get it. Therefore, if that is the rule for staff, then it ought to be the rule for those contractors who work for the Defense Department. 
   Senator HARKIN's press release about this scandal when it broke argued very persuasively:  
   No one has a right to a national security clearance.  
   No one has a right to it. Senator HARKIN, who testified at the SASC hearings on the DSS and DOHA, argued people go through intense scrutiny just to serve on the Commission on Library Sciences, and they do not have to handle any Government secrets. We should at least have the same high standards for those holding security clearances as we require of those serving on the Commission of Library Sciences. Senator HARKIN is absolutely right. I agree with him. 
   Additionally, there were examples of the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals granting clearances to people with recent drug and alcohol addictions. Why is the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals, knowing there will always be risks that some people with clearances will betray their country for money or for ideology, placing an additional risk into the system by giving these felons clearances? Why do we take the risk? There are many good, decent people who have never committed a crime in their lives who do not gain access to classified material because they do not need to know and, therefore, they do not get their clearances because they do not need to know. Why does a convicted murderer, rapist, or convicted drug dealer need to know? The answer is simply they do not. 
   You might say: We should give this person a chance. No, we should not, no, no, no; not if we are going to risk the national defense of our country, we should not give them a chance. 
   As Senator HARKIN has said: It is not a right. It is a privilege that you earn. Additionally, there were examples of, as I said, clearances for those with recent drug and alcohol problems. Why would we want these convicted lawbreakers given access to these secrets? We know how much damage just one individual can wreak on national security. We have heard the stories--the legacy of Aldrich Ames, Jonathan Pollard, and the Walkers, the Rosenbergs. Go back as far as you want to go. It is well known to all of us who have dealt with national security issues, we simply cannot afford to have loose standards when it comes to protecting our secrets and protecting lives. They are loose enough as it is. 
   We have had stolen secrets from our atomic weapons labs going to the Chinese. We certainly do not need to invite people into critical areas, where sensitive technology and sensitive information is bandied about, to have a person who would have that kind of a background to get a security clearance. 
   I emphasize, again, I know in America we are all in favor--and I am, too--of giving people a break, giving a person a chance, giving them a second chance, but not when it comes to national security. 
   I guarantee you, for every cocaine dealer you think is fine now and would be a great person to work for a Government contractor--I guarantee you--there are 100 who never had any cocaine convictions who would be just as good. I guarantee it. We ought to start looking down the line to find them. 
   In some States, an individual would lose his or her right to vote based on a felony conviction. The 1968 Gun Control Act stripped individuals convicted of felonies of their constitutionally protected second amendment right. I have known of an instance where a Capitol Hill staffer was denied a clearance because he was a few months behind in his student loan payment. 
   Keep in mind, a security clearance is not a right; it is a privilege. In fact, it is more than that. It is an honor. That says something about this person, that this is a special person who can be trusted with the secrets, sensitive information about the U.S. Government, about the weapons we make. 
   To say that we would dumb those standards down at that level is a disgrace and, frankly, it is an embarrassment to our country, to our Government, to our Defense Department, to our administration, to everybody involved, and, yes, even an embarrassment to the members of the Armed Services Committee of the Senate that this is happening. It is an embarrassment. The only way to correct it is to stop it and say it is wrong. 
   Right now you can have a felony conviction and still be granted a clearance and access to sensitive secrets; and that does not pass the commonsense test. It does not pass the smell test, folks, that a convicted murderer can be granted a security clearance. Believe it or not, they had an explanation for it. It was not a good one. They had an explanation for it: He's reformed now. He's OK now. 
   In conclusion, the bottom line is, my amendment is very simple. It would prevent DOD from granting security clearances to those who have been convicted in a court of a crime 
   punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding 1 year. It would also disallow a clearance for anyone who is an unlawful user or addicted to any controlled substance or has been adjudicated as mentally incompetent or has been dishonorably discharged from the U.S. Armed Forces. 
   It is sad, though, that we have to pass an amendment on the floor of the Senate, add language to the DOD authorization bill that says the people who do these things--the people who review these cases, who review these individuals--we have to pass an amendment which is nothing more than common sense that says you cannot put murderers and felons and cocaine dealers, people who have been convicted of these crimes, in positions where they have access to national security information. We have to pass an amendment because the people we put in charge are not doing this, are not stopping this. Can you imagine that? 
   That is what it has come to. I am embarrassed by it. But I will tell you what. I would rather be embarrassed by it than have it continue to happen, where our secrets get compromised because somebody could be compromised as a result of this kind of background. 
   We cannot take all the risks out of the system no matter how good we are, no matter how good the DOHA, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals. No matter how good they are, they are going to make mistakes. That is human. Sometimes people such as Pollard and Walker get clearances, unfortunately. And they ought to pay the price for it when they are caught. But let's not take this kind of ridiculous risk and dumb down the entire operation. 
   I might add--it does not say this in the amendment--if we have people who are looking at these cases, and assessing the risks, and they are concluding that people with these kinds of backgrounds can get security clearances, we may want to change some of the people who are doing the evaluating as well. That may be the next step if it does not stop.  
   I regret that many of the committee members missed the DSS, the Department of Security Services, and the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals hearing that we had because it was an eye-opener for me. Even though I read the press articles relating to the scandal, I was surprised those individuals I questioned--when I gave them the opportunity when I questioned them--still said they would not say no when I asked them whether they believed it would be all right to give somebody such as that a clearance. They would not say no, which gives me the impression there would be circumstances where they should be able to get the clearances. 
   That is my amendment. I know the manager of the bill is not prepared to vote at this time. But at this point, Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on my amendment.

    Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise to introduce a resolution concerning our trade relationship with the Socialist Republic of Vietnam. On June 2, 2000, the President of the United States formally recommended a waiver of the application of the Trade Act of 1974 with respect to Vietnam. I am deeply troubled by the President's decision to grant this waiver in light of Vietnam's continuing poor record on human rights. One need only look at the 1999 U.S. State Department report on human rights practices in Vietnam to recognize that the Vietnamese Government once again has failed to meet recognized standards with respect to such fundamental rights as freedom of emigration, freedom of speech and freedom of religion, to name only a few, which are so often taken for granted in our great country. 
   I would like to quote from this revealing report to emphasize my point. The State Department declared the following regarding Vietnam: ``The Government's human rights record remained poor; ..... and serious problems remain ..... The Government continued to repress basic political and some religious freedoms and to commit numerous abuses ..... the Government arbitrarily arrested and detained citizens, including detention for peaceful expression of political and religious views ..... The Government significantly restricts freedom of speech, the press, assembly, and association ..... The Government restricts freedom of religion and significantly restricts the operation of religious organizations other than those entities approved by the State ..... Citizens' access to passports frequently was constrained by factors outside the law, such as bribery and corruption. Refugee and immigrant visa applicants sometimes encountered local officials who arbitrarily delayed or denied passports based on personal animosities or on the officials' perception that an applicant did not meet program criteria or in order to extort a bribe.'' The list of violations outlined by our State Department goes on, but I will stop here. 
   Mr. President, the resolution I have introduced keeps faith with the original Congressional intent of the Trade Act of 1974. Our dedication to fundamental human rights must be resolute, even when it means one powerful interest group or another does not get its way. Unfortunately, the President's decision to grant this waiver once again undermines the United States' long-standing dedication to human rights and sends a message to the rest of the world that the United States is more interested in profits over principles. Finally, rewarding Communist Vietnam by allowing U.S. tax dollars to subsidize business operations in Hanoi, while at the same time their leaders hold back key POW/MIA records from the war, is a disgrace to the men and women who valiantly served our country and were honored just last week on Memorial Day. This Presidential waiver should be overturned by the Congress, as is our right under the law.

   Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today in opposition to the nominations of both Mr. Dyk and Mr. Lynch. But I also rise to briefly discuss the role of the Senate in judicial nominations, the issue of advice and consent. What is the appropriate role for the Senate? Should we be out here opposing nominations? You can be criticized for it because they say: Well, the President is in the other party; therefore, every time you oppose a nomination, it is for political reasons. 
   The truth is, by either voting for or not asking for a recorded vote, I have allowed many Clinton nominees to move forward. But I think we have an obligation under the advise and consent clause of the Constitution that if we don't think the judge is qualified to be on the Court, or perhaps he or she is too much of an activist and not really upholding the Constitution as it was written, then I think we have an obligation to say that. 
   It is with some reluctance I must do that. That is my view. When I say ``qualified,'' we don't merely look at the educational background of the nominee or to the employment history to understand qualifications. I am more interested in the judicial philosophy: Is this nominee going to be an activist judge for one issue or another? Whether conservative or liberal, is that the purpose of a judge--to go on the Court and be an activist for some particular issue--or is it more appropriate for the judge to go on the Court and be an activist for the Constitution of the United States and interpret that Constitution correctly? The latter is what I believe is the appropriate thing to do. 
   As a member of the Judiciary Committee, I have searched 
   through many of the nominees this President has sent forward. I must say I am shocked at the amount of judicial activists. We have had some great clashes in this body on Presidential nominees for the Court--Robert Bork, to name one, and Clarence Thomas was another. It seems that when the liberal side of the aisle goes after a judge, it is always appropriate, but if we go after a judge because we think he or she is too far to the left in terms of activism, then, of course, it is wrong. 
   But article II, section 2, of the Constitution states that the President ``shall nominate, and by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, shall appoint Ambassadors, other public Ministers and Consuls, Judges of the Supreme Court, and all other Officers of the United States, whose Appointments are not herein otherwise provided for, and which shall be established by Law.'' That means the lower courts, to put it in simple terms. 
   The Senate is not a rubber stamp for any nomination, nor should it be. We  have a right to speak out, and I specifically, along with Senator SESSIONS, asked for a recorded vote in the case of Mr. Dyk and Mr. Lynch because I believe the Senate should go on record. Sometimes if the nominees are not controversial but simply share a different philosophical view from mine and are not activist, and based on their background I believe they will look at the Constitution as fairly as possible, in an objective manner, I don't object to those nominees. 
   I don't expect President Clinton to appoint a judge I might appoint. I respect that, and I understand that. That is not the reason for the advise and consent clause, to simply disapprove every single nominee because you disagree with the President's politics. 
   The framers of our Constitution settled on a judicial selection process that would involve both the Senate and the President. Remember, these are lifetime appointments. There is no going back, unless some horrible thing happens in terms of malfeasance, where the judge is impeached. But for the most part, a judicial appointment is lifetime. A Federal judge is a Federal judge for life. So if a few of us come down to the Senate floor, as Senator SESSIONS and I have done, and talk about these nominees, I don't think that is so bad. They are appointed for life. So if we have concerns, I think they should be raised. That is legitimate on either side of the aisle. 
   Nominees who are a danger to the separation of powers, who have shown evidence of legislating from the bench, those are the kinds of nominees to whom I am opposed. I am not opposed to nominees based on a President's political philosophy. I am opposed to nominees who have shown evidence of legislating from the bench. That is a very important point to make. 
   I might also say, before discussing specifically the two nominees just for a moment, that there is some irony in this debate today because this is the first time nominations have come before the Senate for a vote since the President of the United States has been recommended for disbarment as an attorney by the State of Arkansas. Now, I don't know if that has happened in American history before. I don't believe so. So I think I am correct in saying this is the first time in American history that a sitting President has been recommended for disbarment from the State he came from, and then that same President is submitting nominees to the courts in our land. 
   I do not mean to imply anything by this in terms of the qualifications of the nominees, about their conduct in office or anything such as that. That is not the intention. The intention 
   here is to point out that it is somewhat ironic that a man who showed total disregard for the law, according to the law in the State of Arkansas, would now be sending judges up to the Senate for approval. So I bring this to the attention of my colleagues because it is the first time in American history this has ever happened. We are standing here in judgment of people who are appointed by a President who has been recommended for disbarment. 
   The Arkansas bar, as you know, a day or so ago recommended this. A committee of the Arkansas Supreme Court recommended this past Monday that the President be disbarred because of ``serious misconduct'' in the Paula Jones sexual harassment case. A majority of the panelists who met Friday to consider two complaints against the President found that the President should be disciplined for false testimony about his relationship with Monica Lewinsky, the Arkansas Supreme Court said. He was, indeed, fined by another judge from Arkansas for lying under oath. 
   So it is ironic we are debating the qualifications of many fine jurists, frankly, before us today, and in the newspapers we read about how our President is facing disbarment. So it is a unique situation we face here and one I want everybody to understand. 
   We break a lot of ground here. We do a lot of things that have never been done before. We had an impeachment trial in the Senate a few months ago. The Senate, in its infinite wisdom, said the President was not guilty, but the Arkansas bar said otherwise. So it is a very interesting twist of fate that now nominees are being sent to the Senate by a man who is recommended for disbarment, and probably will be disbarred, from the practice of law in the State of Arkansas. 
   Let me conclude on a couple of points on the nominees. I have spent a lot of time on the nomination of Timothy Dyk, and I am very much opposed to Mr. Dyk being a District Judge for the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. Some of the material I looked at I am not going to go into on the Senate floor. But a couple of things in which Mr. Dyk was involved concerned me. 
   In a Washington Post article appearing in May of 1984, the Post reported that Timothy Dyk ``agreed to work for free for the anti-censorship lobby, People for the American Way, to sue the Texas Board of Education over the board's 10-year-old rule that evolution be taught as ``only one of several explanations of the origins of mankind.'' 
   People for the American Way is pretty much a liberal activist, anti-Christian group that seeks to rid public education of any mention of God at all in its educational language and literature, or in schools. 
   The president for the People for the American Way, Ralph G. Neas, spoke in January of 1999 about his vision of the People for the American Way. Listen to what he said because you have to remember that Mr. Dyk worked for them pro bono, for nothing. Mr. Neas said:  
   As you may know, People for the American Way has always carefully monitored the radical religious right and its political allies.  
   Mr. Neas believes that most if not all Republicans are members of the ``radical right.'' 
   He further said:  
   The effort by some elements of the conservative religious and political movements to undermine support for public education goes back decades before Phyllis Schlafly and Gary Bauer and Pat Robertson came on the scene, before the days of the Heritage Foundation, back before Newt Gingrich and the Contract with America.  
   As you can see by his comments, People for the American Way is now and has always been an anti-Christian, anti-conservative organization. 
   He continues by attacking ORRIN HATCH, Governor George Bush, and Senator JOHN MCCAIN for supporting schooling voucher legislation. 
   Let me repeat that. He attacked Senator JOHN MCCAIN, Senator ORRIN HATCH, and Governor George Bush for supporting school vouchers. 
   I guess Timothy Dyk might turn out to be one of the greatest judges in the history of the world, for all I know. I can't predict that. I am not in the business of predicting the future. I am trying to take a look at what I have before me to make a decision on whether or not a person is fit to be on the court. 
   I understand that the U.S. Chamber of Commerce is a staunch supporter, but I have to vote no because I don't believe that a potential judge who uses that kind of language and who makes those kinds of decisions with those kinds of organizations on a pro bono basis is the kind of person I want on the court. 
   I must say that there are thousands of judges--and thousands of people who want to be judges--all over America who serve, do it honorably, and interpret the Constitution as fairly and as equitably as possible. 
   Why is it that time and time again before this body come these outrageous judicial activists appointed by this President? Some have said, well, the other side of the aisle gave you a lot of judges during the Bush administration. A lot of those judges, if not most, were not judicial activists. 
   It is one thing to have a different philosophical view and to be nominated by a President of a different philosophical view. We are not interested in philosophy on the Supreme Court, or on any court. We are interested in supporting the Constitution and interpreting the Constitution the way the founders would have wanted us to do it. They are not your activists. I don't care about your activists. But I think when you hear people representing on a pro bono basis--for no money; you are doing it because you want to do it; you are not getting paid--there is a difference. When somebody retains 
   you as a lawyer, you have every right to do that. That is the American way, and you have every right to do it pro bono. But it tells you about somebody when they represent somebody pro bono. Terrorists were represented pro bono by Mr. Dyk.  
   I think when you are looking at these things, you have to say to yourself, well, these are the people with whom he wants to surround himself with pro bono services. I guess I have to ask, isn't there anybody out there somewhere that we could have as a nominee who doesn't have to be out there talking about and criticizing Members of the Senate because they support school vouchers and are representing groups that do that, or even on the issue of evolution? I think it is going too far. I think it is sad, frankly, that we have to deal with it. 
   The other nominee before us who has been talked about already is Gerald Lynch for the Southern District of New York. The reason I oppose his nomination is for the same reasons. 
   As my colleague, Senator SESSIONS, quoted, Attorney Lynch wrote:  
   Justice Brennan's belief that the Constitution must be given meaning for the present seems to me a simple necessity; his long and untiring labor to articulate the principles of fairness, liberty, and equality found in the Constitution in the way that he believed made most sense today seems far more honest and honorable than the pretense that the meaning of those principles can be found in eighteenth or nineteenth-century dictionaries.  
   That is a pretty legalistic phrase. Let's put it in English. It means what the founders said in the 1700s isn't relevant. It is not relevant. It is relevant today. What is relevant today is relevant today. And, frankly, the Constitution those guys wrote in the late 1700s doesn't apply to us today. The Constitution is not the same. It is totally wrong. 
   Why is it that we criticize those who wrote the Constitution when we attribute time and time again to some great people who profess to be scholars on the Constitution? They come down here on the Senate floor saying: You know, the founders didn't mean that; that isn't what they meant; they didn't mean to say that; if you look at it literally, it does not mean that. 
   When you go back and find the comments of the founders, over and over again the founders say exactly what they meant. Not only did they write it in the Constitution but they explained it in their own words in the debate. And they still say they didn't mean what they said. 
   I think if you find a document that was written by somebody and then you find the explanation, and it says what they meant--they said, ``This is what I meant''--that is pretty obvious. 
   I think we are seeing evidence here again of a person who will be another judicial activist who is going to say the Constitution isn't relevant today, so, therefore, I can put my interpretation into the Constitution. That is the kind of nominees that we are talking about here. This is very troubling. 
   That is why I rise today to oppose both the nominations of Timothy Dyk and Gerard Lynch, and I will also oppose a couple of other nominees in the future.

    Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to honor Todd Rossetti for receiving his high school diploma from Concord High School. 
   For some, a high school diploma is taken for granted. For Todd Rossetti, it is a celebration of the trials and tribulations that he has endured his entire life. 
   Although Todd was born with cerebral palsy, his illness has not prohibited him from accomplishing anything that he has set his mind to. In the Concord School System, Todd was immersed in a new ``inclusion'' program, allowing him to participate in the mainstream curriculum. 
   Though Todd's illness hinders his ability to communicate, his peers,  teachers and administrators have grown to love him and take pride in ensuring that he is able to remain in mainstream classes. This support web has enabled Todd to attend school, follow through with scholarly activities, and find employment. 
   When it was believed that Todd might not be able to receive his diploma with his class, it was that support network that spoke out. Because of the love and efforts of his peers, Todd will be able to graduate. 
   As a former teacher, I feel great compassion for his struggle. He is a courageous and dedicated student, and it is an honor to represent him in the United States Senate.

    Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to honor Mrs. Georgina Leland for being honored with Ossipee's Citizen of the Year Award for 2000. This award recognizes one who is dedicated to reaching out to his or her community. Georgina Leland is just such a person. She is noted for her gregarious nature, her gritty honesty and her love of her community. 
   Georgina has been a pillar of Ossipee's community for fourteen years. Over the course of these years, Georgina has made her name made known among both the young and the old. She is a member of both her church choir and her Bible study group, and she is a regular volunteer at church functions. Allowing elderly residents to experience life to its fullest, Georgina volunteers as a driver for the Clipper Home in Wolfeboro, for R.S.V.P. and for Families Matter. When this vibrant woman isn't in her car driving around the state of New Hampshire, she is consumed with her work at the Public Library and at the Mountain View Nursing Home. 
   Georgina, too, takes a special interest in her community's governmental affairs. She is a noteworthy volunteer at Ossipee's Concerned Citizens events where she never fails to make herself noticed with her efforts or her words. Acting as the Past President of the Ossipee Valley Women's Club for four years, Georgina was charged with bringing to life the scholarship program. In addition, Georgina volunteers her summers to the Chamber of Commerce's information booth. 
   Her efforts as a volunteer and as a citizen have earned Georgina numerous commendations. In 1998, she was named the Volunteer of the Year by the Clipper Home. She also received recognition from both R.S.V.P., Families Matter, VFW Post 8270 and Auxilary for her efforts as a volunteer. 
   Georgina is a role model for us all. It is certain that she has set an example for those of her community, for all of us and for her seven children and fourteen grandchildren. Though her family is quite large, Georgina has made efforts to invite the entire community into her family fold. Her efforts and achievements are to be commended. 
   It is an honor to represent Georgina Leland in the United States Senate. Mary Jo and I wish you the best of luck in your future endeavors. May you always continue to inspire those around you with your dedication to the community.

    Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to honor Lakes Region General Hospital for their designation as one of the ``Businesses of the Decade'' by Business New Hampshire Magazine. 
   For the past ten years, under the leadership of President Thomas Clairmont, the Lakes Region General Hospital has become known for encouraging area agencies and organizations to work together, combining resources and taking risks in order to meet not only the health care needs of the Lakes Region, but of the entire state. 
   Mr. Clairmont has gone above and beyond the call of duty to give back to the group. In fact, he was recently honored with the American Hospital Association's PAC Award for outstanding service in the area of public policy, as well as the NH Hospital Association's Leslie A. Smith's President's Award. Mary Jo and I commend and congratulate him on his hard work and dedication to the Lakes Region General Hospital. 
   A key player in the Rural Health Coalition of New Hampshire, their HealthLink program has received national recognition as a model program that allows people to take charge of their own health, and provides health care for those individuals without health insurance. The efforts of the management and staff at Lakes Region General Hospital, in conjunction with this program, earned them recognition by the American Hospital Association through its 1994 NOVA Award. 
   Lakes Region General Hospital is a true community leader and a friend to the people of New Hampshire. Their efforts over the past ten years are truly commendable, and it is an honor to represent them in the United States Senate.

    Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to honor Tyco International Ltd. for their designation as one of the ``Businesses of the Decade'' by Business New Hampshire Magazine. 
   For the past ten years, under the leadership of Chairman Dennis Kozolowski and Senior Vice President Dave Brownell, Tyco has effectively continued their tradition of growth through increased efficiency and technology. With more than 100 acquisitions worldwide, they have truly become dominant on the international market as well as within the United States. 
   For all its growth, Tyco has not forgotten its role in the surrounding community. Tyco has donated money and time to United Way of the Greater Seacoast and the Greater Piscataqua Community Foundation's Jeffery Gutin Fund for Young Adults. Furthermore, Tyco's contribution of $500,000 was critical in the transformation of the Strawberry Banke Museum into a year-round educational and community resource. 
   Their commitment to community does not end with donating money to worthy causes. Tyco's employees, from senior staffers to entry-level workers, volunteer their time and energy to many non-profit organizations across the state. Perhaps more important, Tyco makes this commitment to service possible by allowing its employees to incorporate volunteerism into their busy schedules. 
   Tyco's success is irrefutable proof that a company can give back to its community while improving its ``bottom line.'' I commend the employees of Tyco for their efforts. It is an honor to serve them in the United States Senate.

    Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to honor The H.L. Turner Group for their designation as one of the ``Businesses of the Decade'' by Business New Hampshire Magazine. 
   For the past ten years, under the leadership of President Harold Turner, Jr., the Turner Group has truly struck a balance between business success and social responsibility. Incorporated in 1990, they have made significant inroads into the community and will surely continue to do so in the future. 
   The Turner Group has won national recognition for their commitment to the environment, a commitment that I echo as Chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee of the Senate. They have been recognized for their Indoor Air Quality standards, and received the 1996 United States Environmental Protection Agency's Environmental Merit Award in ``recognition of demonstrated commitment and significant contributions to the environment'' for their design of the Boscawen Elementary School. The Turner Group has pledged itself to achieving environmentally friendly designs at the same cost as less efficient designs with questionable air quality. 
   Employees of the Turner Group have donated countless hours to the Audobon Society as board members, the Silk Farm Center Building Committee as members, Concord's Conference and Trade Center as visionaries for planning and design, and as ``educational consultants'' for New Hampshire's Junior Achievement's collaboration with U.S. FIRST, the LEGO Corporation and three Manchester schools for the first-in-the-nation business and robotics program.

    Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to honor William T. Frain, Jr., upon his recognition by Business New Hampshire Magazine as the ``Business Leader of the Decade'' in the state of New Hampshire. 
   William, or ``Bill'' Frain, is the President and CEO of a company that has seen New Hampshire through many of its most difficult economic periods, Public Service of New Hampshire. Although faced with adversity throughout his tenure with the company, Frain successfully pulled them through near bankruptcy, an acquisition by Northeast Utilities, and industry deregulation. 
   Bill is an extraordinary leader, the type that does not always manifest itself, but who motivates and encourages those around them to give above and beyond one hundred percent of themselves. As a result, over 150 of his employees sit on boards throughout the state, and many more volunteer their time to give back to communities throughout the state. In addition, employees at PSNH have contributed more than 1.3 million to the United Way since 1990. 
   Bill's most notable achievements include winning the Yankee Chapter of the Public Relations Society of America Yankee Award for demonstrating leadership during a crisis, earning the Special New Hampshire District Advocacy Award from the United States Small Business Administration, acting as a key facilitator in forming the Amoskeag Fishways Partnership in order to bring life back into the Merrimack River, and being a co-founder of the Junior Achievement of New Hampshire Advisory Council in 1995. A member of too many organizations to list, he has truly exemplified the qualities of strong leadership. 
   It has been a pleasure and a privilege of mine, during my time in office, to have worked with a leader as extraordinary as Bill Frain. His hard work, determination, and ability to motivate those around him to reach greater heights are truly commendable. Bill, it is an honor to represent you in the United States Senate.

   For the past ten years, and for many before that, under the direction and guidance of President Fred Kfoury Jr., Central Paper has donated time and experience to economic development and civic improvement projects across the state. They were actively involved in many of the major projects in the state, namely the Airport Initiative, the Civic Center, the Manchester Housing Authority, United Way, Easter Seals and the Manchester School System. 
   Central Paper, because of their ability to be flexible in the technological field, is often working at a rate more efficient than companies three times their size. Their dedication to technological advancement has brought them to the forefront of their field, and I commend them for it. 
   Employees of Central Paper Products helped to found the Science Enrichment Encounter and FIRST, and continue to work with these programs on a national scale. In 1991 and 1992, Central Paper Products was named ``Best of the Best'' by the National Paper Trade Association for their commitment to community service, and President Fred Kfoury, Jr., was named ``Greater Manchester Chamber of Commerce Citizen of the Year'' in 1998. 
   Central Paper Products is a true community leader and a friend to the people of New Hampshire. Their efforts over the past ten years are truly commendable, and it is an honor to represent them in the United States Senate.

   For the past ten years, under current President and CEO Michael Hickey, Bell Atlantic has faithfully upheld the cornerstones of their company: corporate responsibility, good citizenship, and core values. It has instilled this sense of giving back to the surrounding community not only in their management, but to their employees on every level. 
   Bell Atlantic's commitment to the surrounding community is evident through their participation in Kids Voting, their Adopt-A-School relationship with Beech Street School and their participation in Manchester's School-to-Work Program for electrical workers. They also worked with Cabletron and Project WINGS to ensure that schools throughout the state were wired to the Internet, sponsored the Smithsonian Folklife exhibit from New Hampshire and worked closely with various other community groups to educate and guide youths and adults throughout the state. 
   Additionally, Bell Atlantic has worked tirelessly over the past ten years to achieve the newest technological links for both businesses and homes across the state. Over the past five years, Bell Atlantic has invested nearly $100 million in technological upgrades, and will continue to do so well into the future. 
   Bell Atlantic is a true community leader and a friend to the people of New Hampshire. Their efforts over the past ten years are truly commendable, and it is an honor to represent them in the United States Senate.

   For the past ten years, under the leadership of President Michael Whitney, Fleet Bank has made phenomenal inroads to assisting the surrounding community, and I applaud the hard work and dedication of each and every employee of the company. 
   The greatest examples of this are ``Team Fleet,'' a group of more than  200 staff members who have donated thousands of hours to over 375 non-profit organizations and efforts within the state from Special Olympics to NH Public Television, and their financing of one of the largest community development projects undertaken by the City of Manchester in order to rehabilitate one hundred low-income rentals on Elm Street. 
   Fleet Bank gives back to the community on a continual basis, forming the ``Fleet All-Stars'' in 1996, a company-funded, community-wide, public/private partnership developed in order to revitalize neighborhoods in various communities through volunteerism in youth organizations and other civic groups. In 1999 alone, they were able to reach out to over 30 youth programs and approximately 2,381 children throughout the state. 
   Fleet Bank is a true community leader and a friend to the people of New Hampshire. Their efforts over the past ten years are truly commendable, and it is an honor to represent them in the United States Senate.

   Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, new revelations from ``Newsweek'' and ``Inside the Pentagon'' show that the air war against Serbia was inaccurately portrayed. These reports allege hyper-inflating of reports of damage done by allied bombing. 
   Now we are awakening to the realization that we expended a small fortune in precision munitions with very little effect--but the administration felt it necessary to exaggerate grossly the results of the air campaign in an attempt to buy public support for the war. 
   This is shameful--and the individuals involved in this deceit ought to be reprimanded. 
   The bombing triggered a refugee crisis--that was its main result. There was never any threat to NATO from the conflict in the Balkans. 
   In fact, the real threat to NATO is that it has abandoned its traditional role of being a defensive alliance, and under this administration has blundered and contorted into a post-cold war crisis management agency with a lost sense of mission. 
   NATO's bombing killed innocent civilians and raised regional tensions. 
   Like Haiti and Somalia before, the war in Kosovo has cost the taxpayers billions, exhausted and demoralized our men and women in the armed forces, and accomplished nothing, yet damaged our image in the region as a nation that believes in democracy and justice. 
   As a result of demonizing Milosevic in Serbia, we have become tacit allies with the Kosovo Liberation Army, a group in the recent past acknowledged to be an organization which commits terrorist acts and which appears to be supported by the Albanian mafia, which is said to be a major supplier of heroin in the European market. 
   In our zeal to ``stop the killing'' in the Balkans, we, as a result, aligned ourselves with a terrorist mob with links to drug traffickers and killed a lot of innocent people. This is peacekeeping run amok, and it has to be brought to an end as quickly as possible. 
   I support the Byrd-Warner amendment, not that it goes far enough. It does not. We should have never gotten involved in the Balkans, and we should have gotten out long ago recognizing that our intervention was damaging, and like too many other missions from which we have failed to learn any lessons, open-ended, and lacking any clear objectives. 
   We are using our young men and women in uniform as police officers, something which they are not trained to be and which they understandably resent. 
   They are not policemen, they are soldiers. If they had wanted to be police, they could have signed up in their local towns and at least have been home with their families at night. 
   I want to make one thing perfectly clear. I am tired of hearing those who support the Balkan blunder say that we are ``undercutting'' our troops by seeking authorization for the mission's continuation. 
   I believe that sending our armed forces into harm's way into a conflict in which we have no identifiable national security objectives undercuts our troops. 
   I believe that wasting our precious military resources in a futile peacekeeping mission undercuts the troops. 
   I believe that we undercut the troops when we plunge into a conflict without Congress making a declaration of war. Did we learn anything from Vietnam? 
   Finally, I warn my colleagues that rather than admitting to a colossal mistake in Kosovo, which this administration would never be willing to do, it is likely that it will blunder more deeply, possibly into Montenegro, even if the Byrd-Warner amendment were to pass the Congress. 
   General Wesley Clark's latest comments, as well as a reading of Agence France Press and some of the other foreign news sources, including comments by some of Europe's war hawks, reveal that Montenegro and the Presovo Valley might be the next jumping off point. 
   In fact, the KLA can read between the lines. If they create yet another provocation, and force the Serbs to respond, creating an atmosphere charged with allegations of atrocities or another humanitarian crisis, it will give NATO the excuse it needs to blunder more deeply into the Balkan quagmire. 
   We need to start pulling down our forces in Kosovo and winding down this operation. We need to be able to admit to a mistake when we make it. 
   Our military forces are stretched as thin as they have ever been. This year, the services' unfunded requirements list was in the realm of $15 billion. 
   We cannot afford to squander our limited military dollars in Kosovo.

   Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Idaho for yielding. 
   I should have known that as election season approaches we would have to be down on the floor with more debate on gun control, and, unfortunately, the hostage held here--for our service men and women who are waiting--is the military construction appropriations bill. It is now being held hostage by this debate. It is unfortunate that some of our colleagues would do this to our military who we know are very much in need of a lot of the dollars and programs that are in that budget. 
   Frankly, there is nothing more politically expedient or coldly opportunistic or blatantly unconstitutional, frankly, than gun control. It is pretty clear. 
   I do not know how our colleagues can say the first amendment is all right and the second amendment isn't. 
   Of course, it is an unmistakably and an unspeakably horrible tragedy when someone is killed. And it is very difficult to sometimes respond to the emotionalism of those who have lost a loved one in a tragedy such as a shooting or any other tragedy. But our response, my colleagues, should not be to disregard our oath of office and to walk away from the Constitution of the United States. We took an oath right there in the Well to ``defend and support'' the Constitution. The last time I looked, the second amendment was part of that Constitution. I would have more respect for my colleagues if they came down and offered an amendment to remove it. At least that would be more honest. 
   Our response should be to encourage gun safety, too, and to crack down on the scum, the criminals, who commit these horrible 
   acts against us, and to take an introspective look at ourselves and our children. 
   We need to restore respect for all human life ourselves. We need to stop calling gratuitous and indiscriminate violence in the popular media, in TV, movies, and in videos ``art'' and start calling it the trash that it is because it is corrupting young people's minds, and it ruins their souls. These are the problems about gun violence--not guns. 
   My colleague from California, Senator FEINSTEIN, a few minutes ago on the floor, made some very interesting remarks. She said, and I am using her words:  
   Debunk certain myths that the National Rifle Association has developed; the first is the myth they have developed with respect to the second amendment of the Constitution.  
   She said:  
   ``Well-regulated militia'' refers to the National Guard.  
   She said:  
   No individual right to keep and bear arms under the second amendment.  
   She said the second amendment is a:  
   [F]raud on the American public by special interest groups.  
   She said:  
   The second amendment refers to the right to keep and bear arms only in connection with a state militia. In other words, the National Guard, not an individual.  
   She also said:  
   The second amendment does not guarantee an individual's right to keep and bear arms.  
   Those are startling, shocking statements from a colleague whom I respect immensely. She is entitled to her position. But my colleague mentioned various court rulings that supposedly decided that the right to keep and bear arms is only for the Government. It is exactly the opposite. The courts said so; so it must be right. 
   But let me tell you about some decisions that the courts made that weren't right. 
   No. 1, they said in Dred Scott in 1857 that a black man couldn't sue in Federal court because he was property. Do you know what. The courts were wrong when they said that--dead wrong. 
   I also point out that in Plessy v. Ferguson they said ``separate but equal'' public facilities for blacks and other facilities for whites. The courts said that, too, and they were wrong. 
   I don't think my colleagues would have argued on the floor of the Senate that the Supreme Court was right in those cases. There are plenty more cases where the courts were wrong--morally, legally, and constitutionally wrong, wrong, wrong. 
   So don't come down to the floor of the Senate and say just because some court said it that it is right, right, right, right, because it isn't. 
   My colleague also mentioned various judges. There are many judges who have upheld the individual right to keep and bear arms. There is a long list of them. I am not going to go through the list. I would rather quote instead of the judges, those fine people who wrote the Constitution, and who lived it. 
   They know what they meant. They said what they meant: Inalienable right to keep and bear arms. 
   Let's hear from a few who I think knew what they were talking about. 
   Thomas Jefferson: ``no free man shall ever be debarred the use of arms.'' That was when he proposed the Virginia Constitution in 1776. 
   Any uncertainty about that statement?  
   Laws that forbid the carrying of arms ..... disarm only those who are neither inclined nor determined to commit crimes........Such laws make things worse for the assaulted and better for the assailants; they serve rather to encourage than to prevent homicides, for an unarmed man may be attacked with greater confidence than an armed man.  
   That was Thomas Jefferson's ``Commonplace Book,'' 1774-1776, quoting from ``On Crimes and Punishment'' by criminologist Cesare Beccaria, 1764. 
   George Mason, of Virginia:  
   [W]hen the resolution of enslaving America was formed in Great Britain, the British Parliament was advised by an artful man, who was governor of Pennsylvania, to disarm the people; that it was the best and most effectual way to enslave them; but that they should not do it openly, but weaken them, and let them sink gradually ..... I ask, who are the militia? They consist now of the whole people, except a few public officers.--Virginia's U.S. Constitution ratification convention, 1788.  
   Further: ``That the People have a right to keep and bear Arms; that a well regulated Militia, composed of the Body of the People, trained to arms, is the proper, natural, and safe Defence of a free state.''--Within Mason's declaration of ``the essential and unalienable Rights of the People,'' later adopted by the Virginia ratification convention, 1788. 
   Samuel Adams, of Massachusetts:  
   The said Constitution [shall] be never construed to authorize Congress to infringe the just liberty of the press, or the rights of conscience; or to prevent the people of the United States, who are peaceful citizens, from keeping their own arms.--Massachusetts' U.S. Constitution ratification convention, 1788.  
   In other words, freedom of the press, Freedom to bear arms--yes, yes, yes. 
   William Grayson, of Virginia: ``[A] string of amendments were presented to the lower House: these altogether respected personal liberty.''--Letter to Patrick Henry, June 12, 1789, referring to the introduction of what become the Bill of Rights. 
   Richard Henry Lee, of Virginia:  
   A militia when properly formed are in fact the people themselves ..... and include all men capable of bearing arms ..... To preserve liberty it is essential that the whole body of people always possess arms ..... The mind that aims at a select militia, must be influenced by a truly anti-republican principle.--Additional Letters From the Federal Farmer, 1788.  
   James Madison, of Virginia: The Constitution preserves ``the advantage of being armed which Americans possess over the people of almost every other nation ..... (where) the governments are afraid to trust the people with arms.''--The Federalist, No. 46. 
   Tench Coxe, of Pennsylvania:  
   The militia, who are in fact the effective part of the people at large, will render many troops quite unnecessary. They will form a powerful check upon the regular troops, and will generally be sufficient to over-awe them.--An American Citizen, Oct. 21, 1787.  
   We could go on and on. 
   Noah Webster, of Pennsylvania:  
   Before a standing army can rule, the people must be disarmed; as they are in almost every kingdom in Europe. The supreme power in America cannot enforce unjust laws by the sword......  
   Don't come down to the floor and tell me the founders meant that the second amendment didn't mean anything. They put it in because they knew the dangers of an unarmed citizenry. Just because we have these terrible acts of violence perpetrated upon innocent people in this country--by criminals, by scum who prey upon us--is not a reason to take away our rights under the second amendment. It is a reason to put them away, put them in jail and throw the key away and leave them there, and stop having sympathy for these people who do this. 
   I have a long list of people, founders who knew what they were talking about. They wrote the Bill of Rights. The Bill of Rights is about individual rights, not about government rights. It is about individual rights. That is why they put all 10 amendments in the Constitution. 
   Does my colleague mean to say that the right to free speech, the right to free expression, the right to the freedom of religion or trial by jury or freedom against cruel and unusual punishment belongs to the State? That sounds like Communist Russia. 
   One member of the Supreme Court, Justice Joseph Story, appointed by James Madison, in his ``Commentaries on the Constitution,'' considered the right to keep and bear arms the ``palladium of the liberties of the republic'' which enables the citizenry to maintain and defend a free society. 
   And now let's take a look at the Thesaurus. 
   A synonym for infringed, as in ``the right to the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed,'' is encroach. 
   Encroach is defined by Webster's New World College Dictionary as ``in a gradual or sneaky way''; ``to advance beyond the proper, original, or customary limits; make inroads on or upon.'' 
   That sure sounds like what some of my colleagues are trying to do, 
   trying to sneak around or circumvent the second amendment. They are using terrible tragedies that we all deplore to do it. I would like to punish personally, if I could, every single one of those people who committed those atrocities, but we must not trample the Constitution of the United States while we do it. Let's remember that oath we took: Uphold the rule of law and uphold the Constitution.

    Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate and honor two young New Hampshire students who have achieved national recognition for exemplary volunteer service in their communities. Julia Tobias, 17 of Exeter and Gustav Owen, 14 of Barlett have been named State honorees in the 2000 Prudential Spirit of Community Awards program, an annual honor conferred on only one high school student and one middle-level student in each state. 
   Ms. Tobias is being recognized for founding ``Youth Across Borders'' a nonprofit fund to benefit a youth center in Bosnia and to raise awareness in her own community about issues of prejudice, tolerance and the Bosnia cause. Though thousands of miles away, Julia felt she could make a difference for these young people by providing money for school supplies, teachers and other materials needed to support the center's ethnic reconciliation programs. She then expanded her mission to promote racial harmony among youth in her city. So far, she has raised $2,500 through various school and community fund-raising for her project. 
   Mr. Owen is being recognized for conceiving and organizing a school-wide assembly on bus safety and emergency procedures. During his school's semiannual bus evacuation drills, Gustav noticed that his fellow students did not fully understand what to do or why the drills were necessary. He felt that if the students were more aware, they would be better prepared for a true emergency. So Gustav approached his principal with the idea of conducting a school assembly on the subject, and began researching the bus driver's handbook for more information on emergency procedures. He then called a meeting with the bus drivers, the fire chief, and a police officer to discuss how to involve the students. Finally, he wrote a plan for assembly, recruited volunteers to help, and hosted the actual event, which was followed by bus evacuation demonstrations for the entire school. 
   Mr. President, in light of numerous statistics that indicate Americans today are less involved in their communities then they once were, it's vital that we encourage and support the kind of selfless contributions these young People have made. People of all ages need to think more about how we, as individual citizens, can work together at the local level to ensure the health and vitality of our towns and neighborhoods. Young volunteers like Ms. Tobias and Mr. Owen are inspiring examples to all of us, and are among  our brightest hopes for a better tomorrow. 
   I applaud Ms. Tobias and Mr. Owen for their initiative in seeking to make their communities better places to live, and for the positive impact they have had on the lives of others. It is an honor to serve both Ms. Tobias and Mr. Owen in the United States Senate.

   Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, as chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee, I was very proud to report out just a couple weeks ago a bill to designate the federal building at 500 Pearl Street in New York City, New York, as the ``Daniel Patrick Moynihan United States Courthouse.'' When I first joined this committee, the chairman's seat was occupied by the Senator from New York. His generosity and kindness in helping me, a freshman Senator from the other side of the aisle, is something I will always remember and for which I will be forever grateful. I have since come to rely on his advice, counsel and wisdom on issues ranging from transportation to Superfund, as have so many of my colleagues. 
   Our friend, Senator DANIEL PATRICK MOYNIHAN, is someone who has served this nation with great integrity and true patriotism. He is the only person in our nation's history to serve in four successive administrations as a member of the Cabinet or sub-Cabinet. He served two Republicans and two Democrats--but he would rather tell you that he simply served four Presidents of the United States. He was Ambassador to India, as well as the President of the United Nations Security Council. And since 1977, he has been the cerebral center of the United States Senate. 
   He is among the most intelligent Senators ever to serve in this body. He has taught at MIT, Harvard, Syracuse, and Cornell, and has been the recipient of over 60 honorary degrees. Few can match his r&#233;sum&#233; and none can surpass his commitment to this nation. He will be sorely missed. 
   The building to be named for DANIEL PATRICK MOYNIHAN is a magnificent structure in New York City that will be a fitting tribute to the distinguished Senator. Completed in 1994 and built to last 200 years, the courthouse is an extraordinary work of art inside and out. It will serve as an enduring monument to our good friend Senator MOYNIHAN and his 47-year career in public service.

    Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Dennis Pope upon receiving the New Hampshire Superintendent of the Year Award for the 1999-2000 school year. This honor was awarded to Mr. Pope by the New Hampshire School Administrators Association, and both Mary Jo and I applaud the hard work and dedication that has earned him such high esteem. 
   Dennis Pope was chosen from eleven other nominees, and it was ultimately his actions and the respect of his peers that elevated him over the competition. He has dedicated nearly three decades of his life to education, the past eleven years of which have been as the Bedord, New Hampshire, Superintendent of Schools. Dennis Pope's goal has always been to make a difference in the lives of his students and in the education process, and he has succeeded. Mr. Pope's efforts exemplify the Association's motto ``Champions for Children.'' Dennis is a champion of both our children and New Hampshire school systems. 
   Dennis Pope's presence in the Bedford community extends far beyond the walls of its schools. Dennis is an individual who leads by example. He has been a member of the Rotary club, numerous town committees and is currently the Vice-Chairman of the Visitation Committees for the NEASC. 
   Dennis has illustrated that one can't be a passive participant and prosper. He has taken the initiative of reforming the scholastic curriculum, and he has encouraged community involvement in school affairs. He has shown that being fiscally conservative doesn't detract from an academically rich school system. 
   Again, I commend Dennis Pope on this very special honor and on his service to the Bedford School System. His work is greatly beneficial to the Town and the State, and I wish him all of the best as he continues to make a difference in his community and in the lives of its young citizens. It is truly an honor to represent Dennis Pope in the United States Senate.

   Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, first, I want to make my colleagues aware I have a resolution regarding the Holy See. This resolution would block any effort to remove or demean the nine-member permanent observer status at the United Nations held now by the Catholic Church. I want my colleagues and the American people to know this is being blocked from being heard by the other side of the aisle, which is a very interesting story considering the controversy on the House side regarding the Chaplain. It is interesting that this simple resolution that says we will not block or demean in any way the nine members of the permanent observer status at the United Nations by the Pope and the Catholic Church is being blocked on the other side of the aisle. 
   I want the American people to know I can't get this to the floor because of holds on this bill on the other side. When we hear the stories about who is anti-Catholic and who isn't, we ought to shine the light where the light should be shined.

   Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I want to pick up on a couple of points I made last night regarding Elian Gonzalez. 
   My colleagues need to understand today this young boy is going to be yanked from the arms of his family, literally, at the direction of Janet Reno, and placed on an airplane and taken God knows where--we are hearing maybe to Bethesda--where he meets with Juan Gonzalez in the confines of the Cuban control which is where this Cuban diplomat lives, or perhaps ultimately on an airplane and headed for Cuba. There are no restrictions. We don't know. 
   The speech I made on the floor last night I thought was very compelling regarding this situation. There is talk about how this young man is going to go back to his father. I will repeat briefly what I said last night. He is not going to go back to his father, if we let this young boy go back to Cuba. The Cuban diplomats have already said this young man is controlled by Cuba. He is a child of the state. He is a child of Cuba. He is not a child of Juan Gonzalez--only biologically. Beyond that, he is not the son of Juan Gonzalez; he is the son of Cuba. 
   We have a 6-year-old little boy who survived a terrible incident at sea, watching his mother drown. Her dying words literally were: Please get Elian to the shores of America. The two survivors told me that themselves because they saw her die, as did Elian. 
   Later they were separated and Elian floated for 3 days in an inner tube. When he was picked up by two fishermen, he was surrounded by dolphins. We know dolphins are a protection because sharks do not interfere with dolphins. He was being protected by the dolphins. He had no sunburn after 3 days at sea. He told me he saw the Virgin Mary while he was floating in this inner tube. 
   This is a very special little boy who had never been inside a church until he came to America. We now have said, the Justice Department has said, Janet Reno has said, this boy has no rights under the law. She is wrong. She has discretion under the law to send him back, but there is no law that says he must go back. I want to make that very clear. 
   I think the Senate should go on record, as tough as it is, and take a vote one way or the other, binding or nonbinding, but take a vote. Every Senator should let the American people know how they feel about this because Elian went through an awful lot--a lot more than most of us go through in our lifetimes. His mother died trying to get him to America, and we have now taken her rights away. She has no voice because she can't speak for herself. Perhaps ultimately in the custody court without the Justice Department would be the right way to resolve it. However, the Attorney General has chosen to be confrontational, as she did at Waco, and said he will be taken. She has made this statement over and over in the past several days. 
   I read the polls that say 61 percent of the American people say Elian Gonzalez should go back to his father. This is not about polling. There were no polls out there when Elian was floating around in the ocean in rough seas for 3 days. 
   I have met Elian Gonzalez and until yesterday I don't think Janet Reno had. He is a special boy. He is going to be Castro's main objective when he gets back to Cuba. This boy cannot succeed in saying good things about America to his classmates. This boy will go into a Communist education camp. He will be taken away from his father most of the time, probably 11 months out of 12, and he will be ``reeducated.'' Fidel Castro himself has  said this boy will be reeducated. He will be reeducated all right. Ask some of the Vietnamese who came out of Vietnam what a reeducation camp is and ask some of the Cuban American community today what it is like in Cuba and why thousands have come here and thousands more have died trying to get here. 
   Now because little Elian's mother drowned, he has no rights. I thought this was America. But I guess it isn't anymore. 
   I want everybody to understand what happens to Elian Gonzalez. We hear about Fidel Castro. You would think he loved this little boy and would want to get the little boy back to his father. ``That is all I want,'' says Fidel. 
   I will close on this point: On July 13, 1994, 72 Cuban men, women, and children boarded a tugboat called the 13 de Marzo and they set sail, hopefully, they thought, to freedom in the United States. Three hours later, 32 of them would be forced back to Cuba and imprisoned and another 40--23 children among them--would be killed by the Cuban goon squads of Fidel Castro. 
   Do you know how it happened? I will tell you how it happened. We got this firsthand from the survivors: Two Government firefighting boats pummeled the helpless passengers, who were unarmed, with water from high-pressure firehoses 7 miles off the coast of Cuba. The passengers repeatedly attempted to surrender to Government officials, going so far as to hold their children in their arms up like this, saying: Please, these are my children, stop, stop. 
   But the Cuban Coast Guard was relentless. The firehoses were enormous. Survivors said children were sprayed from the arms of their mothers into the ocean waters. Other children were simply swept off the deck by the firehoses and drowned in the sea. Desperate to protect their children, some of the mothers went down below deck with their children. What did they get for that? The Cuban Coast Guard rammed their vessel again and again and sank it with these people in the hold. 
   Here is a picture of a little girl, Caridad Leyva Tacoronte, 4 years old. She was one of those children. 
   If Castro's goons could have caught that boat, they would have done the same thing to Elian Gonzalez. 
   So I don't want to hear any more of this talk about how this is going to be the nicest thing for Elian, to go back to his wonderful little home in Cuba and live happily ever after with his dad because that is a bunch of pure, unadulterated garbage. Let's face reality. If the Senate does not have the courage to stand up and vote and be on record against that, then what do we stand for? What do we stand for? 
   Here is another one, Angel Rene Abreu Ruiz, 3 years old, sprayed from the arms of her mother by a high-pressure firehose and drowned in the ocean before her mother's eyes. 
   Elian did not get caught, so Castro did not kill him. He made it to the ocean. The ocean, though, took the lives of his fellow passengers, all but two. One other couple and Elian survived. His mother died. 
   So rather than send this to a custody court--I am not asking anybody to make a decision on where Elian should go. All my resolution does, that I have been trying to get a vote on now for a month and a half, is it gives permanent residency status to Elian, to his father, to his father's current wife, and to his child, to Elian's two grandmothers and grandfather--all the family. It lets them come here free of Castro, sit down as a family, talk with the Miami relatives, and decide how little Elian's fate should be resolved. That is all I am asking. 
   But, oh, no, we cannot do that because Janet Reno and Fidel Castro have decided the kid has to go back to Cuba. I want everybody in America to know what is going to happen. I promise you, this is the kind of stuff that happens in Cuba. He is going to go into a little reeducation camp, and he is going to learn all about communism, and we are going to make mighty sure, in Cuba, that he does not tell his classmates about Disney World or anything else nice that happened here in America. He is not going to let that happen. So he is a special little boy, all right, to Fidel Castro. 
   When I hear all this stuff about this nice little happy relationship with Juan Gonzalez, his father--where has his father been for 4 months? Has anybody stopped him from going to Miami and sitting down with the family and talking this out? Yes. Fidel Castro has stopped him. 
   Do you know where Mr. Gonzalez' mother is right now? She is under house arrest in Cuba so she cannot move freely. Let's get real here. That is where she is. He is afraid to say anything because he fears for his mother's life. He has his wife and child here but he doesn't have his mother here. 
   What a tragedy this is, that this little boy, who survived all of this, is now going to be forced back and he has nothing to say about it. I am never going to forget, as long as I live, no matter what happens, that little boy looking me in the eye about 2 months ago, 3 months ago, and saying: Senor, ayudame, por favor--help me, please. I don't want to go back to Cuba. 
   I asked him: Elian, don't you want to see your father? 
   He said: Si, senor--yes, but I want my father to come here to America because that is what my mother wanted. 
   Frankly, that is what his father wanted, too, but he can't say it. His father knew Elian was coming. He spoke to the hospital the night Elian was rescued and he was in the hospital. The father spoke to the doctors and to the family and thanked the family and the doctors for taking care of him and said, ``I'll see you soon.'' But, oh, no. Then comes the Attorney General blundering into this thing: Oh, no, this is an immigration matter. 
   Do you think he came in here by yacht? 
   Once again, I plead with my colleagues, whoever the powers that be are around here: Bring this thing to a vote today before 2 o'clock. Don't block it. Bring it to the floor and allow us to be recorded so the American people will know where we stood on a matter as important as this.

   Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I would like to talk a bit about The Voluntary Medicare Prescription Drug Plan Act of 2000--S..2319. 
   This bill allows seniors to enroll in a new program under Medicare which will provide for prescription drug coverage without increasing Medicare premiums or costing the Federal Government one penny. 
   This is an issue about which, as you know, many seniors are very concerned. 
   The Senate unanimously approved a sense-of-the-Senate amendment on the budget resolution offered by myself, Senator ALLARD, and Senator DOMENICI. 
   This sense-of-the-Senate is very simple. First of all, under the plan the Senate Democrats are committed to passing this year, there are six basic principles. 
   I agree with them all. 
   No. 1, it is voluntary. 
   I agree with this. If the senior doesn't want it, he or she should not have to take it. 
   No. 2, it is accessible to all Medicare beneficiaries. 
   I agree with that. A hallmark of Medicare is that all beneficiaries, even those in rural or underserved communities, have access to dependable health care. It should be accessible to everybody. The Smith-Allard plan is fully accessible for all beneficiaries. 
   No. 3, it is designed to provide meaningful protection and bargaining power for Medicare beneficiaries in obtaining prescription drugs.

   Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. There it is, folks. It's revenue neutral. 
   Let me talk about the premium issue, because this I believe is the most explosive political side of this. 
   Seniors watch their budgets closely. If you try to sock them with a new premium, they will not be happy. 
   Let me remind my colleagues what happened the last time we tried to slap new premiums on seniors. 
   This picture is an incident that occurred when seniors who were angry with the enactment of the so-called Catastrophic Act assaulted Congressman Rostenkowski's car. 
   Congressman Rostenkowski wrote the legislation which increased premiums on certain seniors. 
   It would be a grave mistake to interpret seniors' desire for prescription drug coverage as a call for new higher premiums. 
   It would also be a huge mistake to think that there is any need for such premiums. 
   Let me show you how my plan compares with the Administration's plan as far as premiums and benefits. 
   This chart shows that the Clinton plan's benefits do not even start until 2003, and the benefits are not fully effective until 2009. 
   These premiums are just the new added government premiums. They do not count other premiums such as Medigap.

   Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. This chart shows all the premiums seniors  would pay. As you can see the drug premium is nothing. If a senior has Medigap, premiums substantially decrease from current law under Smith-Allard. Under the administration plan, they stay the same--averaging $230.75 per month. So, if you compare all premiums, a senior would save an average of $96.83 per month.

   Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Some might say this is not much money. But let's take a look. 
   What could a senior do with $96.83 each month? 
   You can see that this is a lot of money when you think of how it would impact other expenses seniors have. 
   These numbers come from the Bureau of Labor Statistics Consumer Expenditure Surveys. 
   Finally, Mr. President, we will look at annual deductibles. 
   Smith-Allard combines the hospital, medical, and drug benefits into a single deductible. 
   Because seniors spend an average of $670 per year, they would just about reach the full hospital and medical deductible with just drug expenses. 
   Under the Clinton plan, drugs don't count toward the deductible, so even though seniors would have a 50 percent drug benefit, they would not be paying down their deductible. 
   I have talked about this plan with seniors, and they understand this concept. They love it.

   Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Let me just conclude speaking on this bill by saying that the benefits in this plan are delivered by private companies and regional entities, such as pharmaceutical benefit managers. These entities would negotiate with large drug companies and provide the drugs to Medicare seniors. 
   In addition, according to the actuaries who reviewed the legislation, there will be no adverse selection. Both the healthy and the sick will have an incentive to choose this plan. Everybody is in. 
   There are many different methods of providing prescription drug coverage for seniors, but I urge my colleagues--I plead with my colleagues--to look to the revenue-neutral methods that fund this benefit by the elimination of waste in the present system. I urge my colleagues to resist the temptation to raise Medicare premiums on the people who can least afford it. 
   I have vivid memories of seniors rocking Mr. Rostenkowski's car a few years ago when he decided to raise Medicare premiums. Let's look at it more specifically. The House's fiscal year 2001 budget--this is important--sets $40 billion aside for prescription drugs. 
   In the Senate, we are expected to do a budget that is going to set aside $20 billion now for prescription drugs, and $20 billion later. 
   We don't need either under my plan. We don't need any more money. We don't need $20 billion. We don't need $40 billion. We don't need $2 billion. 
   Let's use the money for debt reduction or tax credits for the uninsured rather than providing for prescription drugs. Let's use my revenue-neutral prescription plan instead. 
   I urge my colleagues to take a look at this approach. It provides prescription drugs in a way that will meet seniors' needs without hiking their premiums or adding more burden to the Federal treasury. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce today with my colleague from Idaho, Senator MIKE CRAPO, the ``Water Pollution Program Enhancements Act of 2000.'' I believe this bill will significantly improve water quality and, over the long term, reform the way the Environmental Protection Agency and the States implement the Total Maximum Daily Load, TMDL, program for impaired waters. 
   I emphasize at the outset that I strongly support the goals of the Clean Water Act. I believe all Americans should be able to enjoy clean water to drink, and that our rivers and lakes should be ``fishable'' and ``swimmable.'' And we have made substantial progress over the past 25 years since the Clean Water Act was enacted in cleaning up our nations rivers, lakes and streams. According to EPA, 60-70 percent of our nation's waters are now safe for fishing and swimming. Certainly, there's more work to be done. How we control runoff from agricultural and urban areas, and forests--so-called nonpoint source pollution--is our challenge for the future. 
   I also support the original concept underlying the TMDL program of helping ensure that water quality standards are met on all of our nation's rivers and streams and lakes. However, I believe that there may be other tools to help us achieve those laudable goals; TMDLs are not the only answer. We should be looking to the States for alternative, innovative solutions, particularly in the area of controlling nonpoint source pollution. And I believe that if we look, we will find that the States have better, more cost effective solutions to improving water quality. Is there a role for the Federal Government in addressing nonpoint source pollution? Absolutely. The Federal Government--EPA--should work in partnership with States and the private sector to achieve our shared goal of fishable and swimmable water. 
   EPA's approach to solving the nation's remaining water quality issues, however, continues to be based on more ``top-down'' regulations from Washington, D.C.; more confrontration, instead of collaboration; and more interference with State programs. We are taking the step of introducing this legislation today because EPA has made it clear that it plans to expedite the process for finalizing two controversial rules that it proposed last August that would make a number of significant changes to the existing programs to control the discharge of pollutants and to improve water quality. The first rule would significantly expand the requirements for establishing the total amount of pollutants that can be discharged to a waterbody--so-called ``total maximum daily loads.'' The second rule would expand EPA's authority to revoke or reissue state-issued permits under the Clean Water Act to implement the new TMDL requirements. The combined effect of these rules would be to dramatically expand EPA's authority over issues that have traditionally been within the jurisdiction of the States, such as farming, ranching and logging operations, and additionally to give EPA a potential new role in local land management use decisions. 
   I have serious concerns about the substance of these rules. But I am also  deeply troubled by the process that EPA has adopted here. It began last summer when EPA initially proposed the rules. At that time, it stated that it would only accept public comments on the proposed rules for 60 days. Such a short period of time for public review was obviously inadequate given the length of the proposed rules and their complexity. Congress intervened and EPA was ultimately compelled to extend the comment deadline for an additional 90 days. 
   Even before the comment period had closed, however, EPA indicated that nothing would stop it from pushing the proposed rules through the process as quickly as possible. Over the past month, EPA has announced its plans to issue final rules before the end of June in spite of the fact that it received over 30,000 comments in February, at least 27,000 of which were critical of the rule, and can hardly have had an opportunity to give these comments serious consideration. There have been at least six hearings on the proposed rules in both the House and Senate in which serious concerns were raised about: the legality and practicality of the rules; the lack of reliable science underlying the existing TMDL program, not to mention any proposed expansion; the potential impact on successful State programs; the burdens that an expanded TMDL program would impose on individual landowners and small businesses; and the lack of a completed cost assessment of the proposed rules. 
   Senator CRAPO has held two hearings so far on EPA's proposed TMDL rules. Through that process, and in many meetings with stakeholders, I have heard about all of the problems with EPA's proposed rules--the lack of science, the overly broad scope, practical problems in implementing the rule, trampling of state programs, and the cost. Let me detail just a few of the comments that I heard. 
   On the question of the science underlying the TMDL program, GAO recently issued a report, and provided testimony on the basis of the report, that States do not have the data they need to accurately assess the pollution problems in their waters and further, do not have the data they need to develop TMDLs. In his statement to Senator CRAPO's subcommittee, Peter Guerrero noted specifically that the ``ability [of the States] to develop TMDLs is limited by a number of factors. . . . [S]hortages in funding and staff [were cited] as the major limitation to carrying out [the States'] responsibilities, including developing TMDLs. In addition, states reported that they need additional analytical methods and technical assistance to develop TMDLs for the more complex, nonpoint sources of pollution.'' He went on to state that only three states have the data they need to identify nonpoint sources of pollution, and only three States have the majority of the data they need to develop TMDLs for nonpoint sources. To me, this information from GAO sends a clear signal that TMDLs are not the answer for nonpoint source pollution. The science just isn't there. 
   We also heard from a variety of businesses and landowners who told us of other substantive problems with EPA's proposed rules. For example, Tom Thomson, a certified Tree Farmer from my home State of New Hampshire and the owner of the Outstanding Northeastern Tree Farm of 1997, testified that EPA's proposal to regulate tree farming as a point source and impose TMDLs would just make it harder to do the job of improving water quality. He explained that through aggressive, private and voluntary stewardship, private woodlot owners all over the country are doing a good job to address water quality issues related to forestry. Compliance rates now approach 90 percent in many of the States where forestry best management practices, BMPs, are in place. Total river and stream miles impaired due to silviculture declined 20 percent just between 1994 and 1996. The number of miles deemed to have ``major 
   impairment'' from silviculture fell 83 percent. In 1996, EPA dropped silviculture from its list of 7 leading sources of river and stream impairment. That same year, silviculture contributed only 7 percent of total stream impairment. In Tom's word's this seems to be a classic case of ``if it ain't broke, don't fix it.'' In this case, it would seem clear that water quality issues related to forestry are being addressed and progress is being made through State BMP programs and other voluntary, non-regulatory measures undertaken by landowners. 
   To his credit, EPA Assistant Administrator for the Office of Water, Chuck Fox, has recognized that the proposed rule caused confusion and does have many problems. I met with Mr. Fox last week and was pleased to learn from him that EPA has heard at least some of the concerns that were raised and is ready to make some changes to their rule. He indicated that in any final rule, EPA would ``drop threatened waters; allow more flexibility in setting priorities; drop the offset requirements for new pollution; and revise the approach for forest pollution.'' 
   Some of the changes may be significant and that's good news, but as always, ``the devil is in the details.'' I am still concerned that many of the major problems have not been addressed. I also wonder why, if EPA is willing to acknowledge that many of the concepts included in the proposed rule were indeed flawed, it hasn't been willing to withdraw the August draft and reissue a new proposed rule that reflects its current thoughts. Surely doing that and seeking public comment on a revised rule would result in a better, more informed end product. It would almost certainly enhance public confidence in EPA's process. However, EPA has consistently declined to consider this approach. 
   In my opinion, EPA simply hasn't done the work that must be done to justify and explain the rule to the public. States and the regulated community deserve to have their comments and concerns considered seriously by EPA, as well as to have an opportunity to review and provide comment on the cost assessment in the context of the proposed rule. Now apparently, EPA may be making significant changes that will never have been subject to public comment. In its desire to rush to judgment on a final rule, EPA is effectively neutering the role of public participation in the rulemaking process. 
   Therefore, Senator CRAPO and I have drafted legislation that will address several of the key problems with EPA's proposed rules and, in addition, defer any further EPA action on the rules until the National Academy of Sciences has conducted a study of the scientific issues underlying the development and implementation of the TMDL program. 
   Senator CRAPO and I are taking the first step to not only address some of the problems raised by EPA's proposed rules, but also to improve water quality on the ground right now. 
   Our bill will do three fundamental things. First, it significantly increases federal funding to $750 million for States to implement programs to address nonpoint source pollution, to assess the quality of their rivers and streams, and to collect the data they need to develop better TMDLs. This will represent a significant increase from current funding levels for Fiscal Year 2000 of $155 million for nonpoint source programs under section 106 and section 319 of the Clean Water Act. More money now will enable landowners, businesses, and States to do things now on the ground to improve water quality--things like putting in buffer strips and water retention ponds. With this approach, we won't have to wait 10 or 15 years for EPA to impose new regulatory requirements on landowners after a lengthy and onerous TMDL process. 
   Second, the bill directs the National Academy of Sciences to conduct a study on the science used to develop TMDLs and make recommendations about how to improve it. The NAS will also evaluate existing State programs to look at what works, particularly for nonpoint sources. Better science will make for better TMDLs. 
   Third, it includes a pilot program for EPA to compare different State approaches to improving water quality. TMDLs should not be the only tool that we rely on to meet our water quality goals; they may be appropriate and effective for a chemical company, but not for a farmer or woodlot owner. There are better solutions out there, particularly to deal with the problems associated with nonpoint source pollution. For example, States are using their own authority and incentive-based programs under the Safe Drinking Water Act and the farm bill to work together with farmers, ranchers,  loggers and their cities to substantially reduce runoff. 
   The bottom line is that States, public utilities, landowners, and businesses now are spending billions of dollars to improve water quality. If we are going to ask them to spend billions more--and we are--Congress and EPA have a responsibility to make sure that the programs we create are based on good, reliable science, and make the best use of limited resources. 
   Again, it's not a question of challenging the goals of the Clean Water Act; it's a question of seeking the best way to achieve them. 
   The bill also includes a provision to defer the finalization of EPA's proposed TMDL and related permit rules. We're serious when we say that we want EPA to base its regulations on good science. And we're serious when we say that we want EPA to respect the role of the States in solving the problem of nonpoint source pollution. That's why the bill provides for the National Academy of Sciences to look into those issues. We believe that EPA also should welcome the NAS Study and look forward to the opportunity to use that Study to improve its rule. Therefore, the bill directs EPA to review the NAS Study and take into consideration the recommendations of the National Academy of Sciences before it finalizes any new TMDL rule. We believe that in the long run, waiting 18 months for the NAS analysis will only improve the rule and increase public confidence in it. 
   Mr. President, I know our critics will charge that we are undermining the Clean Water Act. They could not be more wrong. This legislation will enhance the Clean Water Act. By seeking better science and increasing needed Federal funding, this bill will strengthen programs on the ground that work--programs that improve water quality and help us achieve the fundamental goals of fishable and swimmable waters. 
   I commend Senator CRAPO for his leadership on this issue. I believe that in crafting this legislation, he is taking an important step in the right direction. I urge my colleagues to support this bill.

   Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, we did spend some time today debating the elimination of the marriage penalty tax. This is something I have been working on for all the years I have been in Congress in the Senate. I look forward to the day we can repeal it. I was hoping we would have this vote in the near future. I very much regret the delay that was imposed upon us by the minority because by putting nongermane amendments on this, we slow down what we could accomplish here in the very near future, which is finally to eliminate the marriage tax penalty. 
   I have an amendment prepared to implement elimination of the marriage tax penalty a lot sooner. I am contemplating offering that. I will see how much support there is for it. Before I do that, however, instead of the proposed phase-in period of 6 years, which is the underlying proposal, my amendment would eliminate the marriage penalty tax immediately, bringing working parents tax relief right away. 
   According to the Congressional Research Service, as this graph shows, the additional savings my plan would bring married couples over the Roth plan would be almost $3,000. If you look at the years, we go from $69 versus $879 in 2002, all the way over to 2008, where it evens out. The point is, these are savings for a married couple--about $810 in the first year, 2002--if we put it into effect immediately. 
   With today's cost of living exploding, education, tuition, high prices at the pump, that is a substantial savings for an ordinary working family. I think we ought to make this effective today, as soon as it passes, and not implement it over a 6- or 7-year period. Married couples have been waiting for a large number of years, since this ridiculous provision was put in the IRS Code. 
   It is not often we have the opportunity to right a wrong around this place, but this is an opportunity. I sincerely hope we take advantage of it. 
   Today, however, not only do we have the opportunity to turn back a tax, we also have an opportunity to turn back an unjust tax that punishes an institution that is the very backbone of society, at least in most of our minds. 
   You hear some people say that it isn't. But marriage is the backbone of our society, the essence of our families. One of the reasons why we are having a lot of cultural problems today is a lack of emphasis on the family and marriage. Twenty-five million couples are subject to the marriage tax penalty in America and, frankly, those of us who have not had the courage to overturn that tax over the past several years deserve some of the blame because it punishes married people. In New Hampshire alone, almost 140,000 couples will be hit with a marriage tax penalty. In a small State such as New Hampshire, which only has a little over a million people, this tax is antimarriage, antifamily, and antichild. Children reared in two-parent homes are more likely to succeed in school, stay away from drugs, and not become involved in crime. We should not penalize married couples. It doesn't make sense. 
   A way for couples to avoid the marriage tax penalty is they could file for divorce and save money or they could not get married and save money and just live together. That kind of tax policy doesn't make sense. The average marriage penalty is $1,400, or more, in additional Federal income taxes, which is more than $100 a month. That is an extra $1,400 that could be used to buy school clothes for kids, pay for a home computer, perhaps, or a little health insurance, or maybe take a family vacation. The point is, you would have control over an additional $1,400 to do with what you want, and not have the Government taking your money whenever it wants. 
   I have received a lot of mail on this issue over the years asking for relief--I might say, begging for relief, for the Congress to do something. Just one example. A gentleman by the 
   name of Roy Riegle from Derry, NH, wrote this:  
   I am a software engineer working in Merrimack and living in Derry. Via the Web, I just learned of the House Passage of the ``Marriage Tax Cut'' bill. (I think it is H.R. 6). I want to heartily encourage you to vote for this bill when it reaches the Senate. We are one of the classic middle class families (I'm an engineer and my wife teaches in Chester) who are trying to pay for our kid's college education. Our cost to send our second daughter to Trinity College in Hartford, Connecticut, next year is expected to be $20,000. We need assistance of some sort, and this will help. Thank you for your consideration. ROY RIEGLE.   
   That is so true of many families trying to meet expenses and pay education costs. For all these millionaires and billionaires you read about and hear about all over the country making all this money, maybe $100 a month isn't important. But it is real important to people such as the Riegles and so many others who have written me on this issue over the years. 
   Since 1970, the number of dual-income couples has risen dramatically and continues to rise. It is these families who will benefit from the repeal of this tax. What an outrageous tax this is, to discriminate against people who are married. It is just un-American, and how it ever got in the code is beyond me. Why it hasn't gotten out in all these years is beyond me. 
   I think we should understand that the reason why, as we stand here now, we have not been able to pass this on the floor of the Senate today is because of delays, because the other side wants to offer nongermane amendments to slow it down, to say we have to pick and choose which family gets a break. You have to be in a certain income tax bracket, or you have to be a certain type of person to get a break, and all this nonsense. Everybody should get the break. The marriage tax penalty itself is unfair. It is not more or less fair for one family or another, depending on the income. It is an unfair tax. Let's get rid of it, period. There is nothing complicated about that. This year, Americans will give 39 percent of their income to the Federal Government. As tax levels rise, women who might otherwise stay at home are forced to enter the job market. The percentage of single-worker households in the U.S. has plunged to 28.2 percent, compared with 51 percent in 1969. However, the harder parents work to keep pace, the greater their chances of moving into a higher tax bracket and winding up giving more to the Government. 
   Mr. President, in conclusion, these families are right. These taxes do penalize. If we are going to penalize the  sacred institution of marriage and offend our sense of decency and morality, if that is what is going on in the Tax Code, we need to correct it. 
   We should be encouraging the makeup of the family, not the breakup of the family. We should bring tax relief to married couples today--not tomorrow, not next year, not 6 years down the road, but today. They have waited all these years with this discriminatory tax. We can never make it up to them, so let's start today and make it effective today. We can bring tax relief to these couples by passing my amendment and, if not mine, at least we should get started with the underlying bill. It is better to do it down the road, over the course of 6 years, than not at all. With my amendment, we can do it immediately and save all of this money each year for each of these families.

   Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I want to talk on a subject that has been in the news a lot. I will take a few minutes of the Senate's time. I have been involved in a lot of issues. I have debated just about everything known to mankind on the floor of the Senate, as have most of us. I am in my tenth year in the Senate, and I have never been involved in an issue that has gotten to my heart more than the Elian Gonzalez case--never. Last night, on the Geraldo Rivera show, a poll was shown saying 61 percent of the American people said Elian Gonzalez should go back to his father, and 28 percent of them said he should stay here in America. 
   Here is this little boy who floated in the ocean on an innertube after his mother died trying to bring him to America. So we are now going to conduct policy about what to do about Elian by reading polls. Where is the leadership in this country when we need it? This is not about polls. I don't care what the polls are. I could care less what the polls are. If Lincoln had taken a poll on slavery, we would probably still have slavery because the majority of the people in America at that time supported slavery. But he didn't take a poll or put his finger to the wind. He did what was right. 
   Again, I plead with my colleagues in the Senate to grant Elian Gonzalez and his family permanent residency status so this issue can be handled by a Florida custody court. This should not be an immigration matter. Elian Gonzalez did not get on a yacht and cruise into Miami Harbor. He and two other people almost drowned while everybody else on the boat--10 or 12 other people --lost their lives. And his mother's dying wish was to ``please get my son to American soil.'' 
   I have heard a lot about the father's rights. I have nothing against him. He could be the nicest guy in the world. I have met Elian. I didn't get a chance to meet Elian's mother because she didn't make it. If she had made it, we would not be here talking about this because, under the law, she and Elian would be allowed to stay here. So because she died, Elian has no rights. 
   Those of you listening to me now who think this is a father-son issue, I want you to listen carefully to what I have to say because it is not a father-son issue. That is a totally bogus argument. There are reports in Miami that Elian is reluctant to travel to Washington to see his father. He is a frightened little boy. Wouldn't you be after you survived that? Has anybody listening to me now ever gone through an experience like that--floating on an innertube on the high seas for 3 days, after you watched your mother die, and everybody else on the boat is gone except two others he didn't know were alive because they were drifting off somewhere else. And then to be sitting in a home in Miami, with people who love him, who have taken care of him, and to wonder if today, right now, tonight, tomorrow morning--he doesn't know when--maybe noon tomorrow, in comes the large, sweeping hand of the Justice Department and Janet Reno, and they yank him from the arms of these people who love him and drag him back to Cuba. That is what he is sitting through now and worrying about now. He is a frightened little boy. When are we going to be concerned about this frightened little boy? 
   I am tired of hearing about everyone else's rights in this debate. I am sick of it. I am sick of the fact that I can't get a vote on the floor of this Senate because the people do not have the guts to vote. They do not want to be recorded. I am sick of it because this little boy is going to be dragged back to Cuba, and he is going to be used as a pawn in Castro's--God knows what--forsaken land over there. And we have to live with it. We ought to be recorded, and we ought to be on record. We ought to stand up and be counted. I am sick of it. I have been quiet too long. I am not going to be quiet anymore. 
   He is fearful of returning to that country. I talked to him. He said: Senator SMITH, please help me. Don't send me back to Cuba. I said: Elian, do you love your father? Do you want to go back with your father? He says: Yes. I want to be with my father. I don't want to go back to Cuba. 
   Mr. Gonzalez, if you are listening to me, why don't you defect? It is a heck of a lot better here. 
   I am going to tell you that there is one shining example of why it is not about father and son. It is not about father and son. I am sick of it. Listen to me--one shining example of the human rights violation of Fidel Castro. 
   Where are all the human rights people who care about this? Where is the Catholic Church that sheltered all of these Communists during the Nicaraguan and El Salvador issue? Where are they? Silent. 
   Let me tell you about Fidel Castro and what little boys such as Elian look forward to, and what Elian will have to look forward to when he is dragged back to Cuba--for his father. Give me a break, Ms. Reno. 
   On July 13, 1994, 72 Cuban men, women, and children boarded the 13 de Marzo, a tugboat, trying to sail for freedom to the United States, just like Elian did. Less than 3 hours later--3 hours later--32 of them would be forced to return to Cuba--they were the lucky ones--while the other 40, 23 children among them, were left by the Cuban authorities, their bodies scattered at sea. 
   At 3 o'clock in the morning, 22 men and 30 women boarded a recently renovated World War II tugboat in the Bay of Havana. With them were over two dozen children, one an infant, and several others between 5 and 10 years old. 
   I am going to show you some pictures of the children who boarded that boat who never returned. I want to show you pictures of children who died such as these children right here: 
   Caridad Leyva Tacoronte, dead, 4 years old; 
   Angel Rene Abreu Ruiz, dead, 3 years old; 
   Yousel Eugenio Perez Tacoronte, dead, 11 years old. 
   Let me tell you how they died with this dictator who tells you that he wants to welcome this little boy back to Cuba so he can be with his father. If Castro had caught him, he would be dead. All of them would have been. He would have killed them. But he didn't catch them. They drowned. 
   Now Elian has to be told that he has to go back. His father said the other day, ``Four months I have been waiting for my son.'' 
   Where have you been, Mr. Gonzalez? Nobody is stopping you from coming here, except Castro. We don't have any policy that says you can't come here. 
   Let me tell you what happened to these kids. This little tugboat was detected, and it was approached by the Cuban coast guard. The government boat did not attempt to stop the 13 de Marzo, the boat. It didn't try to stop it. Instead, it stalked it for 45 minutes along the coast of Cuba, 7 miles out at sea--stalked it, intimidating it.

   Following general morning business, Senators will begin statements with regard to the marriage tax penalty issue during a morning business period. By previous consent, at 2 p.m. there will be a cloture vote on the pending amendment to that important legislation. 
   It was hoped that an agreement would be reached to complete this measure after the Senate considered relevant amendments. Unfortunately, a consent could not be granted and, therefore, the 2 p.m. cloture vote is necessary. If cloture is not invoked on the substitute, there will be a second cloture vote on the underlying measure. Therefore, a second cloture vote may occur. 
   With April 15 fast approaching, this issue is of the utmost importance to many married couples and, therefore, it is essential that we vote tomorrow on moving forward with the bill. 
   Following the cloture votes, the Senate is expected to consider the budget resolution conference report. Therefore, additional votes will occur tomorrow afternoon.

   Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, this amendment is quite simple. It saves $40 billion that is now in the budget which we don't have to spend because the Smith-Allard amendment costs nothing. It is revenue neutral. It provides no increase in premiums for seniors. It takes effect as early as 2001, rather than 2009 under the President's plan. It covers 50 percent of prescription drugs, up to $5,000. For every dollar spent, 50 cents is covered, up to $5,000, and the prescription drug goes toward the deductible. So if we want to save money on the budget and allow seniors to have prescription drug coverage at no cost to the Government--revenue neutral, no increase in premiums to seniors--it is a good deal. I encourage my colleagues to support the amendment.

   Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. I thank my colleague for yielding this time. 
   I have an amendment, No. 3031, called prescription drug amendment, along with my colleague, Senator ALLARD. Three or four minutes does not give much time to explain a complicated amendment, but I say to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle it meets the criteria of the Democrat plan with a couple of additions for improvement. 
   It is revenue neutral. It eliminates the need to spend $40 billion in the budget. It takes effect as early as 2001, and there is no premium increase for seniors. It is voluntary. It is accessible to all Medicare beneficiaries. It is designed to provide meaningful protection. It is affordable for all beneficiaries. It is administered using the private sector. It is consistent with broader Medicare reform. It is revenue neutral. It does not increase premiums. It provides full prescription drug benefits as early as 2001. 
   The cost to the trust fund under Smith-Allard is zero; the cost to the trust fund under the Clinton proposal is $203 billion over the next 20 years. 
   It is supported by Mr. King, the former HCFA Administrator, in a letter. 
   Monthly premiums under the Clinton plan, $51; Smith-Allard, zero for drugs; Part B, $45.50, versus $45.50; Medigap, $134 versus $88. 
   The total is $230 versus $133. The Smith-Allard premium savings is $96.83 a month. It works simply. The annual deductible under Clinton is $876--$776 plus $100. Under Smith-Allard, the combined deductible is $675. And prescription drugs are in part going toward the deductible. 
   In conclusion, this is a very good approach. It saves $40 billion out of this budget resolution, with which we could do a lot of things. It is revenue neutral. It takes effect as early as 2001. There is no premium increase for seniors. 
   I encourage my colleagues to support my amendment. I yield the floor.

   Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I am very pleased that the Senate is taking up today an important piece of legislation that will enhance our ability to protect the Nation's most valuable shoreline habitats. This bill, S. 835, the Estuary Habitat Restoration Partnership Act, is a great tribute, I think, to not only our leadership in the Senate but also to our late colleague, Senator John Chafee. I urge my colleagues to support this bill and move it forward quickly, to get it into law.

   Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I want to comment for a moment on some of the things that happened today. Yesterday, I introduced legislation to provide permanent residency to Elian Gonzalez because I wanted to try to diffuse what I think is a very volatile situation in south Florida. I believe Elian Gonzalez should be allowed to go to custody court and allow his family--all of his family from Cuba, not just Juan Gonzalez--to come here so they could be free from any encumbrances or any threats or hostility toward them by Fidel Castro. They can sit down as a family, the way a family should, and try to work out the fate of Elian Gonzalez. If that could not be worked out, that it go to custody court. 
   Regretfully, we couldn't get enough people to support this action. So we have postponed any action. Some have objected and caused a series of delays which did not provide the opportunity for me to have a vote here today, which I regret. It is my sincere hope that the Attorney General over the next several days will not move to do something that I think would be not only silly but dangerous and not in the best interests of Elian Gonzalez--trying to drag this boy from his home in Miami and send him off to Cuba. 
   I believe Senators should go on record and say how they feel about this. I have heard some say, I don't want to be involved in a custody battle. I don't either. That is not the job of a Senator. We are asking in this resolution, not to have a Senator interfere with a custody battle, but to allow a custody proceeding to occur. 
   Right now, this is an immigration situation. Elian Gonzalez didn't come here the way most people immigrate to the United States or immigrate into the United States. He came here floating on a raft, picked up by fishermen after his mother died trying to get him here to freedom. 
   He deserves his day in court. He deserves to be heard, like any child in America. I want that to happen worse than anything. I want all 100 Senators to speak on this. I hope that happens. I want to let Janet Reno, the Attorney General, know that I urge her to take the time to think this thing through, meet with Elian Gonzalez, talk with the family, and understand that it is in the best interests of this child that his family, all of his family, come here from Cuba--that is what my legislation does--on permanent residency status. They can go back anytime they want to. They are not provided citizenship. They can come here of their own free will without Castro's influence. They can make a decision about this little boy. That is the right thing to do.

   Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. I will read a couple lines:  
   From the very beginning, I have said that Elian Gonzalez's case is at heart a custody matter. It is a matter that should be decided by the courts that have the experience and expertise to resolve custody cases--with due process, and based on Elian's best interests.  
   My sentiments exactly.  
   Let us be clear, the real fault in the case lies with the regime of Fidel Castro. Elian should never have been forced to choose between freedom and his own father. Now we must take action, here on our own shores, to make sure that Elian's best interests are served.  
   That is a very powerful statement. I commend the Vice President for making it. I hope the Vice President now can work with some of his colleagues on the other side of the aisle who have been opposing this opportunity to have the permanent residency status on Elian Gonzalez. 
   This bill is a perfect solution for those who are not prepared to grant full citizenship for this boy. This is a compromise, not full citizenship, and it is not sending him back to Cuba. It is a compromise. It is one on which I have worked for a long time. It is the perfect solution for those who are concerned that the Senate would be stepping into a custody matter. This bill makes this a custody case, as I just said. It removes the issue from the pro-Cuba or anti-Cuba politics. It allows the issue to be settled by a judge who has the expertise in family custody matters to resolve the status of Elian without any intimidation or any threats from Fidel Castro. 
   As I have stated, this is a decision the Attorney General has made. I applaud the Vice President's endorsement, and I hope and plead with him to pick up the telephone, call some of his former colleagues, and urge them to support this legislation or urge Janet Reno to pull back from this insistence that Elian Gonzalez not have permanent residency status. 
   I will have more to say on this when we return on Monday.

   Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, this bill refers to a matter that is on everyone's mind. I know the Senator from Nebraska has had some concerns on this. I rise to explain what this legislation does. 
   I think timeliness is important. This is an urgent matter. I introduced this bill along with my colleagues from Florida, Senators MACK and GRAHAM. I am pleased to have their support in introducing the bill. I am doing it today to correct an injustice. 
   There is an injustice being committed, as we speak, by the Attorney General and the Immigration and Naturalization Service against Elian Gonzalez. I thank Senator MACK for his leadership in sponsoring a private relief bill to grant Elian Gonzalez citizenship. A grant of citizenship to Elian Gonzalez has the practical effect of removing the Elian Gonzalez controversy from the immigration law and places the controversy in the Florida courts for a custody proceeding. 
   This bill today does not grant Elian Gonzalez citizenship. Again, I am doing this with the full support of Senator MACK and Senator GRAHAM. This grants what is called family permanent residency to the family of Elian Gonzalez--that would be Elian, Elian's father in Cuba, Elian's father's current wife in Cuba, Elian's father's son in Cuba or child in Cuba, Elian's two grandmothers and one grandfather, all of them--so they can now come to America, sit down as a family and resolve this matter. If they have to go to custody court, it takes it out of immigration and puts it into the custody court. This does not grant citizenship. It does not interfere in any way other than to 
   say, let's do it in a custody matter, the same way as any other 6-year-old boy would have to do. 
   Permanent residency status will settle the status of Elian Gonzalez under immigration and nationality law and leave the case to be resolved in the Florida State courts in a custody matter, not an immigration matter. 
   Some ask: What is the difference between permanent residency and citizenship? Why are they doing this as opposed to citizenship? Frankly, a lot of my colleagues have expressed concern about citizenship. We want to make it palatable because of the confrontation that is beginning to brew now and may come to a head as early as tomorrow morning where we have a deadline of 9 a.m., where literally this boy could be dragged kicking and screaming from the arms of his uncle, put on a plane, and sent to Havana. 
   Do we want to see that in America tomorrow? Do we want to see that? That is a confrontation I don't want to see. It is not called for. We don't have to let it happen. This Senate could act today, but under the rules, we may have to act on Tuesday or Wednesday, if it is delayed. Apparently, some have indicated they want to delay it. 
   I wish to make it clear, it could be acted on if there weren't delays being called for. Permanent residency status would make Elian Gonzalez a resident alien. Resident aliens don't have the privileges of citizenship. They are not allowed to vote and can be deported for committing a crime. Their status is as a resident alien, subject to Federal laws regarding deportation provisions. A citizenship bill would grant the individual all the rights of citizenship: voting rights, no deportation, and all other rights associated with being a citizen. 
   Do I support that? I happen to support that. I would be glad to give Elian Gonzalez citizenship. I know a majority of my colleagues do not. I am looking out not for what BOB SMITH wants to do but I want to do what is right for Elian Gonzalez. I want Elian to have his day in court as any other child would have in a custody matter where relatives were trying to determine who should have custody. 
   At 4 p.m. today, Lazaro Gonzalez, his uncle, Elian's uncle in Miami, is going to meet with representatives of the INS. They are going to ask Lazaro, in this meeting at 4 o'clock, to give up all rights to this boy, all rights to keep the boy in the country pending a possible appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court. If Lazaro Gonzalez says, ``No, I will not give up those rights,'' then as early as 9 a.m. tomorrow, Elian Gonzalez's parole status will be revoked and the boy could be sent back to Cuba without Elian's appeal being heard by the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals. 
   Very seldom do we come down on the floor with an issue as urgent as this. This is an outrage. This is urgent. I have heard some people say: We don't want to vote on this thing. We should not have to vote on this. We don't want to deal with it. It is too hot to handle. We are not going to vote on this. 
   Whatever way they vote, I am not trying to tell Senators how to vote. I am asking for a vote. I think the Senate should say to the United States of America, to Fidel Castro, and to the Cuban American community, that we don't want to see this confrontation--and frankly, to Janet Reno--at 9 a.m. tomorrow or 9 a.m. on Friday or 2 o'clock on Saturday or Sunday or next week or next month. I don't want to see on my television screen pictures of Elian Gonzalez being dragged from his home in Miami and placed on that airplane crying and screaming and kicking. I don't want to see that. Not only  do I not want it to happen, I don't want to see it happen, either. 
   It doesn't have to happen. We can stop it. But if we wait and we delay and delay, and we don't send this message to the Attorney General that we mean business, it will happen. She has backed the family into a corner. Why, I will never know, but she has. We can stop it right here. We can stop it. I want my colleagues to know that if we don't vote and this happens, then it is on our conscience. We can stop this; we have the capacity to do it. 
   The INS and Justice Department to this day have not spoken to Elian Gonzalez. 
   Isn't it interesting? I spoke to him. I met with him for 2 hours. Diane Sawyer has spoken to him. She spoke to him. Senator BOB SMITH spoke to him. He is available. But Janet Reno can't speak to him. Do you know why? He doesn't have any rights. I say to anybody out there who has a 6-year-old child--and I have had three in my time, but they are long past 6 now, and they were pretty smart--at 6 years old, you know what is going on. 
   Do you know what happened to this little boy? I bet it didn't happen to too many boys anywhere in the world. He saw his mother die, slip under the waves and drown. The last words that came out of her mouth to the other survivors were: Please get Elian to America. That is my dying wish. 
   He didn't come here on a yacht. He wasn't escorted in some rich boat somewhere and brought to the shores and kidnapped. He was found drifting at sea for 3 days, surrounded by sharks. He survived, and his mother wanted him to be here. His mother had custody. She died. She can't speak for him. Do you know what? If she had lived--this is the irony--this would not be before the Senate. It would not be before the INS. They would have 13 months to work this out. He would be allowed to stay. So because his mother died, Elian is now being punished. So Diane Sawyer can talk to him, BOB SMITH can talk to him, but the Attorney General can't be bothered with it because Elian has no rights. 
   Are we in the Senate going to stand by and tolerate that? Do we want that on our conscience? I hope not. We need a vote on Senator MACK's bill for citizenship, if you wish, or on my bill on permanent residency status, if you wish. It doesn't matter to me. I want to have the vote on what we can get the most votes on so we can win, so that Elian wins, so that the process wins. 
   This is a little boy we are talking about, who endured more than most children would ever endure collectively throughout the world. I hear all the stuff about it is a family matter. Do you know what? It is a family matter, and we make it a family matter if we pass this resolution because then the family can come here from Cuba, if they care about this little boy. No restraints, no restrictions. Just come and sit down with Elian's family here in America, with the Cuban family, and work it out. If you can't work it out, then go to custody court in Florida, where this matter should be played out. 
   Without this vote--and I will repeat it for clarity--if we don't take a vote on this, Elian Gonzalez likely will be dragged kicking and screaming from the arms of his Uncle Lazaro and sent off to Cuba. Without this vote, that will happen, most likely. Or another alternative--perhaps worse--is violence, because people are up in arms about this, and they have a right to be. They have been very restrained. 
   I am proud of the Cuban American community for the way they have conducted themselves in this matter. But we don't need to let this kind of confrontation happen. Do you remember Waco? Janet Reno is doing the same thing again. So we need a vote. Now, if we vote and we vote no, at least you were heard; you are on record. The American people can say, Senator SMITH, or Senator so and so, this is how you voted. We heard you and you voted however you voted; we know how you felt about it. 
   At least have the courage to cast your vote on this matter. 
   My legislation grants Elian's family in Cuba permanent residency status. For the record, it includes Juan Miguel Gonzalez, Elian's father, for permanent residency status in America; Nelsy Carmenate, Juan Miguel's wife; Jianny Gonzalez, Juan Miguel Gonzalez's son; Mariella Quintana, Elian's paternal grandmother; Raquel Rodriguez, Elian's maternal grandmother; and Juan Gonzalez, Elian's grandfather. It grants all of them permanent residency. Does it mean that if they come to America, they have to stay? No. But it means if you care about Elian, then you have to come to America and talk to the family here. 
   I have been told by members of Elian's extended family that Juan Miguel Gonzalez, Elian's father, had expressed an interest in coming to the U.S. a few months before Elian was supposed to arrive. 
   The cold war is over, they say. It is over every place, I guess, but in the Senate because we want to say that Elian doesn't have any rights and we want to let Fidel Castro dictate what happens. Why would we want to let Fidel Castro determine the fate of Elian Gonzalez? Let Juan Gonzalez come here. If Castro cares, let the Gonzalez family come here. We are not going to keep them. They can stay if they want and they can go home if they want. We just want them to come and meet with the family here in Miami. 
   I am deeply concerned about this arbitrary deadline. I repeat it again for emphasis: I am very concerned about this 9 a.m. deadline. I am very concerned that such a deadline would be imposed because it is inflammatory to remove this parole status of Elian Gonzalez. 
   The goal in introducing this bill is to get the Justice Department and the INS out of the case and turn it over to the Florida courts and make it a case for custody, so that any 6-year-old boy--if you think of America today, there are custody cases going on right now as we speak. And to 
   say this child doesn't have any rights--how about a child abuse case? Children are interviewed by psychiatrists and psychologists all the time under allegations of child abuse. In custody battles and divorces, they hear from children in custody battles. They are heard every day. Yet Elian can't be heard because of this decision--a regrettable decision--by the Attorney General. 
   I am going to end with a plea to the Attorney General: Please remove the arbitrary 9 a.m. deadline. Let the courts hear Elian Gonzalez's appeal. This is America. We have courts to resolve custody issues. It is not an immigration issue. He didn't immigrate here. He didn't immigrate into this country. He didn't emigrate from Cuba. He left Cuba. He wanted to get out of there and so did his mother. His mother died, and you are punishing him because she died. The other two people who survived--and I met with them as well--are adults, and they are here for 13 months. They are here. No problem. But Elian doesn't have any rights. Find a place in the law that says there is any age limit. At what age does he have rights? Is it 6, 7, 8, 9, 13, or 14? Find it in the law, Madam Attorney General. It is not in there. 
   We have courts to resolve these matters. Let the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals hear Elian's case before you attempt to send him back to Castro's open arms. Don't make the 6-year-old boy be paraded through the streets of Havana by Fidel Castro. Please, remove the arbitrary deadline. Let the Senate be heard. We will be heard, I hope, as early as Tuesday, perhaps Wednesday or Thursday--whenever we can work this through. 
   I appreciate the cooperation of the majority leader, who has been very helpful in this matter. I am grateful for that. But there are certain things he can't control. Senators have rights to delay, and that is what is happening. Please, I say to the Attorney General, don't try to impose that deadline. Remove it and let reason prevail.

   Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill entitled the ``Voluntary Medicare Prescription Drug Plan Act of 2000.'' This bill allows seniors to enroll in a new program under Medicare which will provide for prescription drug coverage. This is an issue about which, as you know, many seniors are very concerned. 
   Seniors who join this plan would have a combined Part A and Part B deductible of $675, which would include all hospital, medical, and drug expenses. After the deductible is met, seniors would receive 50-percent coverage of their prescription drug costs  up to $5,000. If a senior has $2,000 in expenses for prescription drugs, $1,000 of that would be paid for under this plan. 
   I have spoken to senior groups and health care providers, both in Washington as well as in my State over the past several weeks, about this proposal. The response has been very enthusiastic. Seniors want a prescription drug benefit. Doctors and nurses understand the importance of providing coverage for seniors because of the expense of prescription drugs in this country. It would be a victory for seniors and for health care in this country if we could provide this coverage to them. 
   I have had discussions with many of my colleagues in the Senate who are working on this very issue. We have all heard from our constituents about the importance of prescription drugs. Senators BREAUX and FRIST have included prescription drugs in their overall Medicare reform package. Senators KENNEDY, SNOWE, WYDEN, GRAMS, and JEFFORDS all have proposed various plans that provide some level of prescription drug coverage in Medicare, and many others are working on separate proposals of their own. 
   In a recent press conference, President Clinton and Senator DASCHLE outlined their goals for prescription drug coverage. Leaving the politics aside, the fact that elected leaders from both parties are looking at this issue of prescription drug coverage is good news for the senior citizens of America. I have talked with several of my Republican colleagues, and it is clear to me there is overwhelming support for allowing seniors to have this choice. The only question among us all is how we can responsibly structure such a program. 
   I have heard from seniors in my State about what they are looking for in a prescription drug plan. 
   First, they are concerned about the solvency of the Medicare program. They want a program that does not add some huge financial burden to the trust fund which will be passed on to their grandchildren. They do not want to increase the national debt, either. Yes, seniors are concerned about the national debt. Ask them the next time you speak to a seniors group. 
   The President's proposal, as it is written, blows a $168 billion hole in the trust fund, threatening its solvency. 
   Second, seniors do not want new premiums. My plan requires no premium hike for seniors. Zero. The President's plan requires a $51 annual premium increase. 
   I will repeat that. Seniors do not want to blow a hole in the national debt. They do not want to inflate the debt. Yet the President's proposal adds $168 billion that is going to come out of that trust fund, threatening its solvency. And seniors do not want more premiums. My plan has no increase in premiums; the President's plan, $51--just to start--annual premium 
   increase. 
   The guiding principles of this plan, which may come as a shock to some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, are the same principles as those of the President and the distinguished minority leader for any prescription drug plan. I want to repeat the six principles the minority leader has introduced on behalf of the President. I am going to add three more to those six and make it even better. I do not know why we cannot have almost unanimous support for this piece of legislation. 
   First of all, under the plan the Senate Democrats are committed to passing this year, there are six basic principles. I agree with them all. 
   No. 1, it is voluntary. Medicare beneficiaries who now have dependable, affordable prescription drug coverage should have the option of keeping that coverage. 
   No. 2, it is accessible to all beneficiaries. I agree with that. A hallmark of Medicare is that all beneficiaries, even those in rural or underserved communities, have access to dependable health care. It should be accessible to everybody. I agree with the second principle. 
   No. 3, it is designed to provide meaningful protection and bargaining power for seniors. A Medicare drug benefit should assist seniors with the high cost of drugs and protect them against excessive, out-of-pocket expenses. I agree with that. 
   No. 4, it should be affordable to all beneficiaries, and it should be affordable to the Medicare program itself. 
   Medicare should contribute enough toward the prescription drug premium to make it affordable and attractive for all beneficiaries and to ensure the viability of the benefit. I agree with that. 
   No. 5, administered using private-sector entities and competitive purchasing techniques. In other words, the program is administered by using private sector entities and competitive purchasing techniques. The management of the prescription drug benefit should mirror the practices employed by private insurers. Discounts should be achieved through competition, not through price controls or regulation. 
   I agree with that. 
   We are five for five. 
   No. 6, consistent with broader Medicare reform, the addition of a Medicare drug benefit should be consistent with an overall plan to strengthen and modernize Medicare. Medicare will face the same demographic strain as Social Security when the baby boomer generation retires. So it is consistent with broader Medicare reform. 
   I agree with that. 
   There are six principles I can support. 
   I would ask my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to join me now with three more principles I would add: 
   No. 1, that the plan be revenue neutral to preserve and protect the financial integrity of the Medicare trust fund. In other words, it does not cost the Government any more money. 
   No. 2, that the plan does not raise Medicare premiums. Their plan, $51 annually to seniors; my plan, zero. So no increase in premiums. 
   And No. 3, that full benefits be provided, not in 2009, as the administration plan proposes, but in 2001, 8 years sooner. 
   So my three principles--revenue neutral, do not raise the premiums, provide the benefits in 2001--those three principles enhance and strengthen the other six principles put forth by my colleagues on the other side of the aisle. 
   My plan accomplishes all three of the principles I have outlined. 
   Let me briefly explain how it works. 
   A senior already enrolled in Medicare Parts A and B--already enrolled in Part A, hospital, and Part B, doctor--will have the option of choosing my new voluntary prescription drug plan. It is their option. Nobody is mandated; they choose. It will cover 50 percent of their prescription drug costs toward the first $5,000 worth of prescription drugs. If they buy $4,000 worth of drugs--$2,000 for prescription drugs; $2,000 is covered. 
   How do we do this? How do we make it work? Medicare Part A--under the old system, the current system--has a $776 deductible. Medicare Part B has a $100 deductible. In other words, if you go to the doctor, the first $100 you pay for; if you go to the hospital, the first $776 you pay for; the rest, Medicare pays. That is a total of $876 you will have to pay. 
   My new plan would create one new deductible, combining those two deductibles of Part A and Part B into one deductible of $675, which would apply to all hospital costs, all doctor visits, and prescription drugs--50 cents on the dollar up to $5,000. And the prescription drug costs apply to the deductible, so every dollar you pay for a prescription moves you forward to meet the deductible. 
   Once the $675 deductible is met by the Medicare recipient, Medicare then will pay 50 percent of the cost toward the first $5,000 worth of drugs the senior purchases. 
   However, the senior could not purchase a Medigap plan that would pay for the $675 deductible. This must be paid for by the senior. But if you have a Medigap plan now as a senior, you will not need it. 
   As a result, seniors would save about $550 under Medigap plans if they traded their current Medigap plan for my new prescription drug plan. Again, it is their option. It is voluntary. Seniors could even use their $550 in savings to pay the $675 deductible. 
   If you are a senior out there, and you have Part A, Part B, and you are paying $675 toward the deductible, and you have Medigap insurance of $550, you now can put the $550 toward the $675 to meet your deductible. So you are going to have $550 in savings. You can put that toward the $675, and you are already two-thirds of the way there. 
   But how do you get the cost savings? 
   As my colleagues are aware, according to the National Bipartisan Commission on the Future of Medicare, the  Federal Government pays about $1,400 more per senior if the senior owns a Medigap plan that covers their Part A and Part B deductible. This, generally, is because of our overutilization of hospital and doctor visits by the senior. The savings result because Medicare will not have to pay this $1,400 per person per year out of the trust fund. 
   As I mentioned, all hospital, physician, and prescription drug costs would count toward this $675 deductible. Once it was met, the senior would receive regular, above-the-deductible Medicare coverage, just as you get now. Or if you worked out the numbers and decided against my plan, then you would not have to select it; it is your choice. 
   I believe the vast majority of seniors will benefit from this plan. In fact, every senior with a Medigap plan will definitely benefit. Any senior with a prescription drug expenditure of more than $15 a month will benefit. Today, the Medicare Part A and Part B deductible totals $876, which most seniors cover by an average $1,611 Medigap insurance premium. 
   These estimates, as well as the estimate that the bill is budget neutral, come from Mr. Guy King, formerly chief actuary for the Health Care Financing Administration under President Clinton. I received a letter just this morning from Mr. King, from which I would like to quote:

   Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, this is one of those issues that is very emotional. We have people on both sides who truly have the same goals. We believe alike--that those who burn the flag or desecrate the flag in any way are despicable people for whom we should have no sympathy. 
   I say up front, before I make my remarks, that I certainly have the deepest respect for all of my colleagues who believe that we do not need a constitutional amendment, especially Senator MCCONNELL for whom I have the greatest respect. 
   I think we need to look very carefully at this issue. The Constitution has been amended. Actually, it has been amended 27 times--not 17--once with the first 10 amendments, of course, and 17 times later. When it was amended, it was amended to clarify, to make clear. That is why we have an amendment process. That is why the founders put it in there. 
   I do not think the constitutional Republic will tremble, shake, and fall because we decide to deal with an issue such as flag desecration with an amendment. That seems to be the gist of what we are hearing, perhaps in an overly legalistic argument that somehow the constitutional Republic will have acted irresponsibly to pass an amendment to the Constitution which would stop the desecration of the flag. 
   I am an original cosponsor of the constitutional amendment introduced by Senator HATCH, S.J. Res. 14. I am proud to be a cosponsor of that amendment. 
   The act of the desecration of the U.S. flag is an aggressive and a provocative act. It is also an act of violence against a symbol of America, our flag. Even more disturbing, it is an act of violence against our country's values and principles. 
   The Constitution guarantees freedom. There is no question about it. It guarantees freedom of speech. But it also seeks to ensure, in the words of the Preamble, ``domestic tranquility.'' 
   Many Americans have given their lives to protect this country as symbolized by that flag. My own family, as thousands of other families, endured  the same thing. My dad died in World War II, and my family has that flag. It is a very important item in our home, as it is in Senator MCCONNELL's home when he mentioned his father. 
   I believe the flag deserves the constitutional protection because it is more than just a flag. It is more than just a symbol. 
   I use the example of a $5 bill which I happen to have in my hand. If this is merely a symbol and has no other meaning, then I suppose I could ask millions of Americans to send me $5 bills and I will be happy to send them back plain pieces of paper because it is just paper. This is paper, therefore it is a symbol, and it doesn't have any meaning. So I can take all these pieces of paper and send them back to you in return for $5 bills. 
   If anybody does choose to do this, I will be happy to provide it to some charity. I am not looking for $5 bills to be mailed to me. 
   There is something beyond the meaning of just this piece of paper on this $5 bill, and there is something beyond the meaning of just a piece of cloth with the flag of the United States. Some people believe outlawing the desecration, which this amendment would authorize Congress to do, will lead somehow to the destruction of freedom. I disagree. Our Constitution was carefully crafted to protect our freedoms, not to diminish them. It also was crafted to promote responsibility. We are stepping on very dangerous ground when we allow reckless behavior such as flag desecration, whether burning, trampling, or whatever the desecration may be. 
   This Constitution has served the test of time very well. It has been amended on 27 occasions. Interestingly enough, the first ten amendments, the Bill of Rights, passed shortly after the Constitution itself was passed. Why? Because they wanted to clarify. They didn't want anybody to misunderstand that we needed to have certain basic freedoms such as the freedom of speech, freedom of religion; the second amendment, the right to keep and bear arms, and so forth. 
   Oftentimes in the debates on the floor of the Senate many of my colleagues pick and choose which amendments they choose to support and which they choose to ignore. It is all the Constitution. 
   Under our discussion, I don't think the Supreme Court has more power than the people. If we were to vote today or tomorrow or the next day on this constitutional amendment on flag desecration, it goes to the people. It goes to the State legislatures. We are not making a final judgment. This is a constitutional process. It was very carefully laid out by the founders so that amendments would be very difficult to pass. If the American people support Congress if it passes, then we will have an amendment to the Constitution, No. 28. If they don't, it will not happen. All we are asking is the opportunity to let the people make the decision. 
   Amending the Constitution is serious, but a simple statute is not enough. We tried that and the Court struck down the statute. 
   A little bit of history on the legal history of flag burning is relevant. Over the years, Congress and the States have recognized the devotion our diverse people have for the flag and they have enacted statutes over the years that both promote respect for the flag and protect the flag from desecration. 
   In the Texas v. Johnson case in 1989, by 5-4 vote, referred to earlier in the debate, the Supreme Court overturned a 
   conviction of Gregory Lee Johnson who desecrated an American flag. Johnson burned an American flag at the 1984 Republican National Convention. A fellow protester had taken a flag from a flagpole and had given the flag to Johnson. At Dallas City Hall, Johnson unfurled the flag, poured kerosene on it and burned it. 
   That is not speech, I say in all humbleness, candor, and with respect to my colleagues. That is not speech. That is an action. That is a direct action of desecrating the symbol of America. While the flag burned, protesters chanted ``America, the red white and blue, we spit on you.'' 
   A few moments ago, my colleague from Utah, Senator BENNETT, was saying he didn't know whether we would be able to determine whether or not somebody who takes the flag with respect and disposes of it the way we are supposed to dispose of it under law --burning it in a respectful way--whether there would be any confusion. I do not think there is any confusion between that act and what I just referred to, ``America, the red white and blue, we spit on you,'' when the flag was torn down from a flagpole and kerosene was poured on it. I don't know why anybody would be confused by that. 
   Johnson was convicted of desecration of a venerated object, in violation of section 42.09 of the Texas Penal Code which, among other things, made illegal the intentional or knowing desecration of a national flag. The Court held the government's interest did not outweigh the interest of the flag burner. The act was not oral or written political speech; it was conduct. It was conduct, not speech. There is a difference. 
   Justice Rehnquist, for himself and Justices White and O'Connor, stated in dissent: For more than 200 years, the American flag has occupied a unique position as the symbol of our Nation, a uniqueness that justifies a governmental prohibition against flag burning in the way respondent Johnson did here. 
   The constitutional amendment would enable Congress to punish the next flag burner or the next flag desecrator. In 1989, Congress enacted a fairly neutral statute, the Flag Protection Act of 1989, with an exception for the disposal of worn or soiled flags as a response to the Johnson decision. Based on the new rule announced in Johnson, the Supreme Court struck down the statute by a 5-4 vote in United States v. Eichman in 1990. S.J. Res. 14 would restore the traditional balance to the Court's first amendment interpretation. 
   That is all it does. Only a constitutional amendment can restore the traditional balance between a society's interest and the actor's interest concerning the flag. The first amendment prohibits abridgement of freedom of speech. There is always a balancing of society's interest with the individual's interest in expression. 
   A few examples have been used many times on the floor in debate. Here is a good example: Can you yell ``fire'' in a crowded theater? 
   Could anyone yell something out now? You would be removed if you were in the galleries making a loud comment that disrupted the proceedings. You would be removed. 
   There are limits on speech. It is simply incorrect to say there are no limits to free speech. There are limits to free speech, and it has been held as being constitutional. ``Fire'' in a crowded theater was held to be unconstitutional in Schenk v. U.S. in 1919. 
   There is no constitutional right to disclose State secrets. Some have gotten away with it, but we don't have the constitutional right to go out to the media and announce all the national secrets that we have access to as Senators, along with many individuals who work for the U.S. Government who have access to U.S. secrets. They don't go out and hold press conferences, nor do they tell our enemies what those secrets are. There is not a constitutional right to disclose those secrets. 
   There is no constitutional right to defame or libel a person's character. That was upheld in Gertz v. Welch. There is no constitutional right to engage in partisan political activity in working for the Federal Government. 
   There is no constitutional right to commercially promote promiscuous activity by minors. 
   The American flag has not been given that protection by the Supreme Court. Congress has a compelling interest in protecting the flag. Congress needs to preserve the values embodied by the flag--liberty, equality, freedom, and justice for all. 
   The flag enhances national unity and our bond to one another in our aspiration for national unity. If we read history about the fall of the Roman Empire, it is when Rome lost the glue that held it together, when they became too big, they became so splintered and there was no unity, no cohesion, that they lost their symbol of what the Roman Empire meant. 
   When we lose the symbol of what we are about, we will lose this country. The flag enhances national unity. It enhances the bond. Even if we are wrong, even if we do not need the  amendment--and I do not make that case--even if perhaps Senator MCCONNELL and others are correct that we do not need this amendment, so what? We err on the side of caution. 
   We survived an amendment on prohibition, and we survived an amendment to repeal prohibition. The Constitution and the constitutional Republic did not fall and die as a result of those amendments which were controversial, to say the least. So good amendments and bad amendments occur, and the Constitution survives because that is the way it is supposed to be. 
   Let's err on the side of caution. Let's err on the side of caution. It sends a good message to everyone--to young and old, those who fought and died, those who survived, and those young people in first, second, and third grade classes, and all through our schools all across America, that the flag is more than just a symbol. It represents that cohesion, that bond, that special thing that makes us Americans. We can carry it into battle. We can have it standing behind the Presiding Officer. We salute it every morning, as Senator MCCONNELL said, before we start our proceedings. If we can salute it, we can protect it. What is wrong with that? 
   I repeat for emphasis, err on the side of caution. It is not going to cause the destruction of America because we reinforce something we believe in by amending the Constitution. 
   James Madison stated that desecration of the flag is ``a dire invasion of sovereignty.'' 
   Thomas Jefferson considered violation of the flag worthy of a ``systematic and severe course of punishment.'' 
   S.J. Res. 14 would remove the Government sanction of flag desecration and flag burning. The Judiciary Committee found in hearings that there have been between 40 and several hundred acts of flag desecration over the past decade. Our Supreme Court has granted the flag burner a sanction under the first amendment to engage in the conduct of burning an American flag. 
   Forty-nine State legislatures and most of the American people want an amendment to protect the American flag. All we are doing, if we can get the requisite number of votes, is to pass an amendment on to the people and the legislatures to make a final decision. 
   Our heritage, sovereignty, and values are uniquely represented by this flag. 
   The flag of the United States of America has long unified our countrymen during times of great strife, upheaval, and during the more common times of prosperity and pride. It inspired men and women to win our independence in the Revolutionary War. Over the years, it has represented to a people of all nations freedom and all the values that has made America the envy of the world. 
   I say to my colleagues, regardless of the technical/legal aspect of this, as to whether or not it is legal, whether or not it is constitutional, whether it is necessary or not, what is the message we send to the world? They will not understand that the Congress of the United States, the Senate, refused to pass an amendment to protect the flag. It will be misperceived, in my view. 
   It is an inspiration. It has been praised in song and in verse. It has been honored with a day of its own--Flag Day--and its own code of etiquette on how to store it, how to salute 
   it, and what to do with it. It has been given allegiance by our schoolchildren and given honor by the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court recognizes ``love both of common country and of State will diminish in proportion as respect for the flag is weakened.'' That was a Nebraska case in 1907. 
   How can one say it any better than that? Unfortunately, more recent court decisions have struck down State and Federal statutes banning the desecration of Old Glory. 
   So we debate again. We have done this before. We are going to do it again. We debate a constitutional amendment. We should remember the important relationship over the years the American flag has had with American history, with American freedoms and, indeed, the American conscience. 
   On June 14, 1777, the Marine Committee of the Second Continental Congress adopted a resolution that read:  
   Resolved, that the flag of the United States be 13 stripes, alternate red and white, that the union be 13 stars, white in a blue field representing a new constellation.  
   Red for hardiness and courage; white for purity and innocence; and blue for vigilance, perseverance, and justice. 
   George Washington described the flag in much the same way:  
   We take the stars from heaven and the red from our mother country, separating it by white stripes, thus showing that we have separated from her; and the white stripes shall go down to posterity representing liberty.  
   This new flag made one of its first appearances 2 months later at the Battle of Bennington. On August 16, 1777, the American soldiers faced the dreaded Hessian mercenaries. While the two forces clashed, American General John Stark rallied his troops by saying:  
   My men, yonder are the Hessians. They were bought for 7 pounds and 10 pence a man. Are you worth more? Prove it. Tonight the American flag floats from yonder hill or Molly Stark sleeps a widow.  
   The brave Americans triumphed under their new flag at the Battle of Bennington, and the new stars and stripes floated from the hill which the Hessians once possessed. 
   It was the first time that liberty and freedom was advanced under the flag and, as we all know, it was most certainly not the last. 
   I can go on and on. Of course, we all know the story of the ``Star-Spangled Banner.'' How in 1814, Francis Scott Key, a Washington attorney, boarded a British warship in the Chesapeake Bay to negotiate the release of a prisoner taken when British forces burned the Capitol in August. 
   While aboard the ship, the British fleet turned its attention to Baltimore, and that is where Key witnessed the bombardment of Fort McHenry on September 13, 1814. It continued most of the day and night, until the British abandoned their failed attack and withdrew. 
   Shortly after dawn on the 14th, the morning fog parted and Key saw the flag had survived its night of 1,800 13-inch bombshells and rockets. Its ``broad stripes and bright stars,'' he said, were still ``gallantly streaming.'' 
   Although the forces at Fort McHenry were like sitting ducks under the merciless British assault, they withstood the volleys and emerged victorious once again under the besieged but still-standing American flag. 
   Key was inspired by this. It was not a piece of canvas that inspired Key to write these things. It was not a piece of cloth. It was more than that. It was a flag. There is a difference. It is the same reason the $5 bill is not a piece of paper. It has meaning. The flag has meaning. 
   In 1931, Congress made the ``Star-Spangled Banner'' the official national anthem of the United States. We owe our flag, once again under siege, constitutional protection. In May 1861, just before the Civil War that would tear our Nation apart, Henry Ward Beecher gave a speech on ``The National Flag.'' It is worth mentioning a few of the things he said in that 1861 speech, bearing in mind that our Nation was about to be torn asunder in a war that almost destroyed us:  
   A thoughtful mind, when it sees a nation's flag, sees not the flag, but the nation itself....... 
   Wherever [our flag has] streamed abroad men saw day break bursting on their eyes. For the American flag has been a symbol of Liberty, and men rejoiced in it....... 
   If one, then, asks me the meaning of our flag, I say to him, it means just what Concord and Lexington meant, what Bunker Hill meant; it means the whole glorious Revolutionary War....... 
   ..... [it means] the right of men to their own selves and to their liberties....... 
   ..... our flag means, then, all that our fathers meant in the Revolutionary War; all that the Declaration of Independence meant; it means all that the Constitution of our people, organizing for justice, for liberty, and for happiness, meant.  
   Whatever that meant, that is what the flag meant.  
   ..... our flag carries American ideas, American history and American feelings.......  
   Again, my colleagues, err on the side of caution. If you think we do not need the amendment to protect it, we will not rock the Republic that much if we would just make that statement with the amendment. 
   Henry Ward said:  
   Every color [of our flag] means liberty; every thread means liberty; every form of star and beam or stripe of light means liberty; not lawlessness, not license; but organized institutional liberty--liberty through law, and laws for liberty!  
   I could not agree more. Because the highest court in the land will not preserve the liberty represented by our  flag from lawlessness and license, we must protect it with a constitutional amendment. 
   One of the most inspirational and emotional places to visit in Washington, DC, I say for those who are here who may be listening--you have all kinds of things out there that you can visit, from the Treasury Building, to the White House, to the Washington Monument, to the Lincoln Memorial, to the Jefferson Memorial. They are all wonderful. I have been to them all. Let me add one to the list you ought to see before you leave: The raising of the flag on Iwo Jima; the Iwo Jima Memorial right here in Washington--an image that signifies the steep price of freedom. 
   On February 19, just last month, we remembered the 55th anniversary of that bloody battle. Six thousand Americans gave their lives on Iwo Jima. What were they fighting for? Most of them probably did not know where Iwo Jima was when they went into the service. 
   After 4 days, some Marines finally made it to the top of Mount Suribachi. They tried twice to plug a wooden flag pole into the ground. Both times it broke. The third time, they wrapped the flag to a metal pole. Later during the battle, the second flag was ordered raised when commanders on the beach could not easily recognize the first one, which was considerably smaller. 
   A photographer captured the moment, which has become the U.S. Marine Memorial outside Arlington at the National Cemetery. 
   Marines later said they could see the flag from a quarter of a mile away, and it gave them the courage and inspiration to overcome their exhaustion and fear to keep fighting. 
   It is amazing. It is not just a flag; it is more than a piece of cloth. Ask those guys who were at Iwo Jima. Go see that memorial, and see how you feel about an amendment after you see that monument. 
   It goes on. We could talk all day--``Buzz'' Aldrin, when he planted the flag on the moon. The only good thing about it, I guess, is there is no oxygen on the moon so no one could burn it there. Maybe we ought to put a few more up there. 
   Obviously, there have been many treasured moments in American history intertwined with our flag. History shows our 
   laws have reflected the values represented by our flag and our Government's interest in preserving it. 
   In 1634, Massachusetts colonists prosecuted, tried, and convicted a person who defaced the Massachusetts State flag. The court concluded that defacing the flag was an act of rebellion. This case, called the ``Endicott's Case,'' reflects the traditional balance between the interests of society in preserving the flag and freedom of expression. 
   We have early examples of why we can make a strong and powerful case for a constitutional amendment. The colonists saw the need to punish the act, flag desecration, that violated Government sovereignty. 
   The framers of our Constitution, through their words and actions, clearly showed the importance of protecting the flag as essential to American sovereignty. 
   James Madison, in 1800, an expert certainly of the Constitution, if there ever was one--he wrote it--denounced the hauling down of the American flag from the ship the George Washington as a ``dire invasion of [American] sovereignty.'' 
   In 1802, Madison pronounced an act of flag defacement in the streets of Philadelphia to be a violation of law. 
   We sometimes overanalyze and overdebate what the founders meant. I am amazed by the people in the 20th, now in the 21st century, who know what the founders meant. They know all about what they meant. Even though they said something different, they still know what they meant, which is the exact opposite of what they said. It seems to me we should go back and look at what the founders said. 
   Madison wrote the Constitution. I think he had a little understanding about what he meant. If he said something, then it ought to be pretty good support to say: You know, he might have meant what he said. He said it. He said that an act of flag defacement in the streets of Philadelphia was a violation of law. 
   In 1807, when a British ship fired upon and ordered the lowering of an American ship's flag, Madison told the British Ambassador that ``the attack on the [ship] was a ..... flagrant insult to the flag and the sovereignty of the United States.'' 
   As the author of the first amendment, Madison knew what freedom of speech was. However, his repeated stands for the integrity of the flag show that he believed that there had been no intent to withdraw the traditional physical protection from the flag. 
   Thomas Jefferson also believed in the sovereignty and the integrity of the flag. While he was Washington's Secretary of State, there were many foreign wars and naval blockades. The American flag was a neutral flag during this time, and other countries wanted to fly it. Jefferson instructed American consuls to punish ``usurpation of our flag.'' 
   To prevent the invasion of the sovereignty of the flag, Jefferson did not think that the first amendment was an obstacle to a ``systematic and severe'' punishment for people who violated the flag. 
   Both Madison and Jefferson considered protecting the flag and punishing its abusers very important. 
   There are all kinds of examples in American history from our greatest founders, and all kinds of resources to draw from in support of this amendment. They believed that sovereign treatment for the flag was not inconsistent with protecting free speech. 
   They consistently demonstrated that they wanted to protect commerce, citizenship, and neutrality rights through the protection of the flag. They did not mean to suppress ideas or views or free speech. That was not what they were about. They just wanted to protect the Government's interests in protecting the sovereignty of the Nation as personified in the flag. Freedom of speech protects that, not conduct. There is a difference. 
   William Rehnquist said:  
   The uniquely deep awe and respect for our flag felt by virtually all of us are bundled off under the rubric of ``designated symbols'' that the First Amendment prohibits the government from ``establishing.'' But the government has not ``established'' this feeling; 200 years of history have done that. The government is simply recognizing as a fact the profound regard for the American flag created by that history when it enacts statutes prohibiting the disrespectful public burning of the flag.  
   We have seen the Supreme Court defy the ``deep awe and respect'' that the American people, through their elected representatives, have for that flag. 
   The Supreme Court further denied the American people any voice in protecting the integrity of the flag in the RAV v. City of St. Paul case in 1992. In that decision, the Court ruled it will no longer balance society's interest in protecting the flag against an individual's interest in desecrating it. 
   The Court's recent decisions have led us down this path. In order to preserve the values embodied by our flag, in order to enhance national unity, and in order to protect our national sovereignty, we, the people's representatives, have to take the first step here to amend the Constitution. It is going to be a slow and difficult process, as the Founding Fathers intended. They wanted it to be slow and difficult. It was not supposed to be easy. 
   We should have this debate. We should rise up and take each other on directly. We should have a vote, and we should be recorded. If it prevails with the 67 votes necessary, it will move forward for the people and the legislatures. It is a necessary process in order to remove the Government's seal of approval of flag burning and desecration. 
   Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum and ask unanimous consent that the time be equally deducted from both sides.

   Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. I thank the Chair and yield myself 15 minutes. 
   Turning to the substance of the McConnell amendment, I find that it fails to protect the flag or the people who revere it. This is a very narrow proposal. In order to be prosecuted under the statute Senator MCCONNELL has proposed, one must: No. 1, intentionally destroy or damage the flag with an intent to incite or produce imminent violence or breach of the peace; No. 2, one must steal and intentionally destroy a flag belonging to the United States; or, No. 3, one must steal or intentionally destroy someone else's flag on Federal property. 
   Now if you come to the conclusion that I have--and I think we all have on both sides--that flag desecration is wrong, why limit the desecration to those instances I just cited? Why make it legal to burn a flag in front of a crowd that loves flag desecration or on television or at some safe distance and yet make it illegal to burn a flag in front of people who would be upset? That is what is happening here. 
   Let me repeat that. Why make it legal to burn a flag in front of a crowd that loves flag desecration and yet make it illegal to burn a flag in front of people who would be upset? That is pretty much what we have here. Why make it illegal to burn a post office flag but not a flag belonging to the hospital across the street? Why make it illegal for a lone camper to burn a flag at a campfire in Yellowstone Park when it is legal to burn a flag before hundreds of children at a public school? To anybody who is interested in protecting the flag from desecration, how does this make sense? It is not common sense. 
   There are other problems with this statute as proposed. First, the Supreme Court is likely to hold that the amendment's attempt to prohibit flag burning that may breach the peace is unconstitutional. In Texas v. Johnson, the State of Texas defended its flag desecration statute on the ground that it was necessary to prevent breaches of the peace, and the Court rejected the argument because there was no showing that a disturbance of the peace was a likely response to Johnson's conduct regardless of Johnson's intent. So in order to qualify for the breach of the peace exception under Brandenberg v. Ohio, the Court said the flag burning must both be directed to 
   inciting or protecting imminent lawless action and is likely to incite or produce such action. 
   Since the McConnell amendment fails to require any showing that the destruction of a flag objectively is likely to incite or produce the breach of peace, the Court will strike it down as unconstitutional. This is a lot of legalese--legal gobbledygook, I might call it. This is what the lawyers like to do. But this is more than a legal issue. Your speech cannot be suppressed because it might breach the peace, even if you believe you are breaching the peace. You must have both intent and the objective likelihood that others nearby will be compelled to violent action because of your speech. 
   So in this regard, I note that the Court, in Johnson, found that the flag burning did not threaten to breach the peace, nor was there any finding that Johnson intended to breach the peace. The Court also found that no reasonable onlooker would have considered the flag burning to be an invitation to a fight. In other words, the Court held that flag burning did not constitute fighting words. As a result, the McConnell amendment would not even apply to the flag burning in Johnson. 
   Even if the McConnell statute satisfied the breach of peace exception to the first amendment, the other sections of the proposed statute wouldn't. The Johnson and Eichman cases seem to require that the same general analysis apply. Could the Government say that all racist fighting words are illegal on Government property but that others are not in some other location? Of course not. The Court has said that this amounts to impermissible content-based discrimination. But that is the effect of the amendment Senator MCCONNELL offers because it only criminalizes stealing and destroying a flag rather than all Government property and because it only criminalizes the burning of a flag stolen from another on Government property rather than all other property that could be stolen and destroyed. A lot of legal language, but it is important because this is what we would be dealing with if the statute Senator MCCONNELL proposes were to pass as opposed to the amendment. 
   Even if these portions of the McConnell amendment could survive constitutional scrutiny, which I doubt they could, they are no substitute for real flag protection. The McConnell statute would not have punished Gregory Johnson's notorious flag burning. When he took it down from that pole, burned it, and spat on it, he didn't steal the flag from the United States; so he wouldn't be punished. 
   It was stolen from a bank building; therefore the statute would not apply. Johnson didn't burn his stolen flag on Federal property; he burned it in front of city hall; therefore the bill would not apply. If the amendment would not punish Johnson, who would it punish? We need to be reasonable. We would look foolish to take this kind of legalistic approach rather than the substance of what Madison and Jefferson and Washington and so many others so eloquently put many years ago when they wrote this Constitution. 
   Now, some say it is better than an amendment because they want to preserve the first amendment rights. But if we are going to punish flag destruction on Federal property during a political rally, if we are going to say that is not an infringement of free speech when the flag is stolen, then why does the first amendment protect desecrating the flag under the same circumstance? 
   The ownership of the flag is not relevant to the first amendment analysis. It is not the ownership of the flag that matters, it is the flag. It is what it symbolizes. It is the act that matters. It seems to me that the statute by my friend from Kentucky is perfectly consistent without allowing flag desecration on city or State property regardless of whose flag it is. Once you make it a Federal crime to burn a flag, you are reaching communicative conduct the Supreme Court says is constitutionally protected. If you are prepared to punish flag desecration based on the theft of the flag and the location of the desecration as consistent with the first amendment, you cannot logically argue that punishing the desecration of one's own flag on that same property or other property is inconsistent with the first amendment. 
   I think any Senator who can vote for this statute, frankly, can vote for an amendment that authorizes broader protection of our flag. We need to stop splitting hairs here and understand what we are talking about, understand the incitive act that we are talking about in the desecration of that flag and what it means to the fabric and fiber of our Nation. While the Federal connection to property may give you jurisdiction for a Federal statute, it simply does not change the first amendment analysis. 
   Why would anyone vote for an ineffective statute? It is a weak way to say we don't want an amendment. It is not a good alternative. I would almost prefer that you voted no on the basis of it being unconstitutional in your mind than to offer this amendment. But adoption of the McConnell amendment will amount to the government's unintended declaration of open season on all American flags. It says: Do what you want to the flag--whatever you want--but don't start a riot, whatever you do. Don't steal it from the government; steal it from a bank, and whatever you do, don't burn it on government property. Otherwise, have a good time, burn away, desecrate away. Pick and choose where you want to burn, where you want to desecrate, and you will be fine. 
   Now, really, does that make sense as an alternative to the amendment? We can do better than that. The proposed constitutional amendment allows us to do better than that. By giving Congress the power to enact a sensible flag protection statute, the flag amendment will allow for meaningful flag protection that doesn't make silly, legalistic distinctions. So let's have the courage of our convictions to say, yes, we need the constitutional amendment because without it, the flag can be desecrated, and this will have a harmful affect on our country and on its fabric, if you will. Or say, no, we don't need the amendment, it will have no impact, it doesn't matter, and let it go at that. 
   I urge my colleagues who support protection for the flag to vote no on  the McConnell amendment and to vote yes on the constitutional amendment. 
   I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Madam President, opponents of the amendment like to say that America is not facing an epidemic, that we have a few acts of flag desecration. Depending on how you want to define them, they are usually by some crazy person or some nut, or whatever term you want to apply to it, or someone who is demented. But I think opponents try to downplay the number of desecration incidents that we have in this country. They not only use flawed statistics, but I think they also miss the point that numbers don't always tell the story, and who is doing it is another issue. I would like to give an example. 
   I am a former schoolteacher. You are never a former teacher. You are always a teacher; once a teacher, always a teacher. I used to try to instill in my students the patriotism and respect for the country. I taught civics. 
   I wonder if you will hear the opponents of our amendment talk about what happened a few weeks ago in a town called Somerset, MA. Two teenagers--just two--smashed several dozen Civil War-era gravestones, toppled several others, and burned and shredded 87 American flags that were placed on 60 gravestones in that cemetery--Civil War veterans. Sixty stones were toppled or vandalized. One hundred American flags marking the graves of war veterans were either stolen, ripped, or burned, according to the Boston Herald. 
   Opponents who argue that no great and extraordinary occasions justify the proposed amendment are simply off the mark, in my view. Eighty-seven burnt flags, particularly flags honoring heroes who made the supreme sacrifice defending the Union in the Civil War, is a great and extraordinary occasion. 
   Regardless of how we count the number of desecration incidents, the point of our discussion today is not statistics. It is not how many but rather the impact that this kind of incident has on our values, on our culture, and on our children. What do we say to those children who did that? What do we say to the children who didn't do it, the vast majority of children, I might add? What do our children learn by hearing that our Government is powerless to punish those vandals? What do we want to teach our children about that incident? We can remain silent. It didn't happen on Government property, unless it was a VA cemetery. Maybe it was. So we couldn't punish them under the statute being proposed. 
   If we don't have a constitutional amendment, maybe we can figure out some other way to punish them. But it is more than punishment of the vandals that is at stake. It is a message to the rest of America why this is wrong and why it is not right to go in there and desecrate those flags and those graves. 
   Many people today--I am not alone--believe we live in a culture that suffers profoundly from a lack of common values, ideals, morals, and patriotism. Further, many people believe if it continues, that, in and of itself, will destroy the constitutional Government that we have. 
   I will make this suggestion with all due respect. That kind of action and that kind of lack of statement or commitment to values will bring our country down a lot sooner than an amendment to the Constitution that prevents the desecration of our flag. 
   My colleagues, an amendment doesn't mean the end of our constitutional Republic. It reinforces. It says this Senate, this country, this Congress, the people of America, the legislatures, your parents, their parents, and people all across America say: You don't do that. It is wrong. It can mean that our country may not survive with this kind of disrespect. 
   The idea that everyone's viewpoint is just as good as anyone's can grow just a little bit too large. Is that free speech? Is that what we want to say in America, that it is free speech for two young people to go into a cemetery where Civil War veterans are buried, take the flags off their graves, desecrate the flags, and desecrate the tombstones, and say it is OK, free speech? I say that is conduct. I don't think it has one thing to do with speech. It is conduct, and it is conduct for which you should be held accountable. 
   The fact is, the founders of our country developed some ideas about government that all Americans believe are the best, that all Americans find some common ground upon the ideals for which this Nation was founded--common ground, cement, glue--to bring us together. This divides us in a way that goes right to the essence and to the heart of what our country stands for and what it is. Our flag, those flags, 87 of them on those graves, represent those ideals. 
   As much as our culture downplays our common beliefs--God knows we hear enough about it--everybody has a right to be a free spirit these days; don't have anything in common; do what you want; instant gratification; you want to go desecrate a cemetery, go ahead; it is just free speech. 
   As much as our culture downplays those beliefs, it is our duty as Americans--I am using the word ``duty''--to protect those beliefs and our duty to protect the one symbol that unites us. If you don't think desecration of that flag threatens us, then maybe you had better take another look. 
   It is our responsibility to ensure the integrity of our country and to say that there is at least one principle that unites our society. We divide on every issue. You name it; we divide on it. There is somebody for and somebody against everything we debate. 
   We need this amendment to say that our flag should be protected under the law. It is not enough to say if somebody walked up here now--a staff member, anyone--and took that flag, threw it on the floor and began to deface it, stomp on it, in the name of free speech that is OK. It is not speech. I will say again. It is not speech. It is conduct, and conduct you should be responsible for and responsible to someone for doing it. 
   If we can't say that, if it is a threat to our constitutional Republic to have an amendment that precludes that action, then I am not sure what we could have a constitution for that really matters. 
   We have survived amendments that weren't that great. The Constitution survived, the people survived, the American Government survived, because the Founders gave us the opportunity, provided that for us in the Constitution. 
   We see evidence of moral decay and a lack of standards all around. Our families are breaking down, our communities are divided, our leaders are not providing appropriate moral leadership for the American public. Everyone knows what I am talking about--moral leadership comes from the White House. You can shake it off, you can say it doesn't matter, there is no personal accountability, say whatever you want. The bottom line is, if you are going out for the weekend and you want to leave your 14-year-old daughter home, most of you say: I don't know if I want to leave her with the President of the United States. That is pretty sad. 
   I will make people angry saying that, but we are dividing ourselves. We have to stand for something. If we stand for something, we will stand up and be counted as a nation. If we don't stand for something, then we stand for nothing. 
   We can laugh it off. We do it all the time. It is a gun's fault that children are dying. No, it is not the gun's fault the children are dying. The culture of death in this country is not about guns. 
   The desecration of the flag and all of the other things happening is about us as a people. It is because we don't stand up often enough. If we are threatened because we want an amendment to the Constitution to stop that, then we have a problem. We have moral decay in this country. We are falling apart at the seams because people should be able to do what they want. There is no personal accountability.  Desecrate the graves, stomp the flag, disrespect the veteran. It is OK. Spit on the flag. That is OK, it is free speech. 
   Look at our culture. If you are a parent, look at movies to which your kids have access. Look the at video games, look at the music, look at the TV. Our children are bombarded every day with messages of violence, selfishness. The incidence of gun violence, particularly at our public schools, is a predictable result of a culture that is afraid to teach that certain ideas are right and certain ideas are wrong. 
   That is what this is about. It is wrong to desecrate the flag. Color it up any way you want, hide it any way you want, take another position and say the law is OK, I don't care. The point is, it is wrong to desecrate the flag for the same reason it is wrong to overturn gravestones, it is wrong to be disrespectful to veterans, and it is wrong to leave your children alone and give them access to this kind of violence. Frankly, it is wrong for some in society to give them access to that violence. 
   Why don't we do something about it? No, we have a right, they say, to be free spirits. 
   Blame somebody else. It is not our fault. It must be the Government's fault, the church's fault, our minister's fault, the Senator's fault; it has to be somebody else's fault, not mine. It couldn't possibly be my fault; I didn't do anything. 
   Do you see what is happening to this country? This is just a perfect example of it. It is one symbol of what is wrong with America. 
   From the 1800s and the 1900s, wave after wave after wave of immigrants came to this country; they built this country. It was the glue. They saw the Statue of Liberty. They became a part of the essence of America. That flag is the essence of America. We ought to pass a constitutional amendment so it not be desecrated. 
   I suggest the absence of a quorum.

    Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the brave men and women of the Rochester Fire Department, whose quick thinking and willingness to put their lives on the line for their fellow citizens helped save the lives of three families trapped inside their burning apartment building. 
   The fire that engulfed the apartment building on 19 Sumner Street the night of January 11th could have resulted in the loss of many lives. Instead, the families that lived there, including two very young children, are alive and recovering today because the men and women of the Rochester Fire Department risked their lives to save these families. We often forget just how much these courageous people risk in the service of others. As they go to work each and every day, firefighters are taking the ultimate risk so they can protect and serve their neighbors. 
   Despite their heroic deeds, the men and women of the Rochester Fire Department remain humble about their amazing rescue. Ask any of them and they will tell you they were merely ``doing their job'', and they would do it again if someone else's family needed help. Their unselfishness, professionalism, and dedication keep all of us safe.  
   I thank the men and women of the Rochester Fire Department for their bravery and hard work. It is truly an honor to serve them and all of the firefighters in our great state.

    Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to Cindy Taylor upon the occasion of her being recognized as the Merrimack Chamber of Commerce 1999 Business Person of the Year. Cindy has faithfully served the chamber and its members for the past two years, and she has become an example for other volunteers to follow. 
   Her position with the Public Service Company of New Hampshire inspired Cindy to become involved with the chamber in 1998. She was almost immediately nominated as the ambassador at various chamber events. In 1999, Cindy became vice president of membership for the chamber. With Cindy at the helm, the committee increased its numbers by 20%. During this period, Cindy also co-chaired the annual banquet committee. This position required an extensive amount of effort in planning and executing the celebration. Cindy's participation in any project guarantees organization, dedication and quality. She is one whose input is valued on all projects, and who desires to hear the opinions of others. She is truly a team-player, and was subsequently nominated as Chamber President for the year 2000. 
   Cindy, it is a pleasure to represent such a valuable woman from New Hampshire in the United States Senate. Mary Jo and I wish you the best of luck in your future endeavors. May you always continue to inspire those around you.

    Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, twenty years ago, President Ronald Reagan took office with daunting tasks before him. A year before, the Soviet Red Army had invaded Afghanistan, and Soviet proxy forces were challenging U.S. allies and interests in Central America, in Africa, and elsewhere. American hostages were still being held in Tehran, and the United States was suffering an acute crisis of confidence. Faced with an expansionistic Soviet Union that intimidated the Free World with nuclear weapons and a Communist ideology spread by Soviet-supported insurgencies and armed coups, President Reagan dedicated his Administration to resisting this global menace and toward winning the Cold War. 
   President Reagan rejected the notion that the Soviet Union would modify its belligerence if only allowed to match U.S. military strength. He rejected the idea that the Evil Empire was indivisible, by implementing the Reagan doctrine, which met the Soviet proxy challenge in the Third World in Afghanistan, Nicaragua and Angola, and by funding Solidarity in Poland. 
   On March 23, 1983, President Reagan set forth a broad vision of building a space-based defense, the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI), to free the American people from the threat of nuclear annihilation and to protect the public from an accidental nuclear  launch initiated by the Soviet Union or by a rogue state or actor. The critics labeled it ``Star Wars'' after the blockbuster hit by the same name and scoffed that it would never work. They publicly floated the notion that SDI was only a bargaining chip for arms control negotiations. America held its breath while President Reagan, remaining faithful to his vision, turned down President Gorbachev's offer at Reyjavik, because it would have meant the end of SDI. Reagan refused to give up his dreams of assured survival to replace assured destruction. 
   Yet only twenty years earlier, President John F. Kennedy, after the Soviet launching of Sputnik, promised to put a man on the moon, and the Apollo program was born. Today, as the technology to intercept incoming missiles is being tested, Reagan's vision, like that of John F. Kennedy, is being realized, and the irrational notion of mutual assured destruction (MAD) pushed by arms control zealots is being dealt a mortal blow. 
   Progress towards a national missile defense has not been impeded primarily by technical limitations, but rather by political obstruction, foot-dragging and by restraints of an imprudent treaty signed with a power that no longer exists. The ABM Treaty signed with the now-defunct USSR denies effective antimissile protections for the United States. As a result, the American people continue to remain undefended in the event of a missile attack. 
   Since the fall of the Berlin Wall more than 10 years ago, and the collapse of the Soviet empire, Russia continues to pursue programs and policies that place the U.S. in conflict with the Russian Government, especially in the area of weapons of mass destruction and nuclear war-fighting. There is also rapid proliferation of ballistic missile and nuclear technology world-wide. 
   In recognition of President Reagan's dedication to providing America with protection from her enemies, I ask my colleagues in the Senate to join with me in supporting the renaming of the Army Missile Testing Range in the Republic of the Marshall Islands as the Ronald Reagan Strategic Defense Initiative Test Site at Kwajalein Atoll. 
   I would like to point out that Kwajalein is a valuable national asset with a prime location for space surveillance, the ability to handle both long and short-range missions, and a suite of radars unsurpassed for assesssing missile intercepts. In 1986, President Reagan isssued Proclamation 5564, implementing the Compact of Free Association between the two nations, a key element of which granted the U.S. Department of Defense leasing rights to the Kwajalein Atoll for development of a national missile defense program, or the Strategic Defense Initiative. SDI was Ronald Reagan's greatest dream, and I believe that most of us look forward to its near-term fulfillment. 
   The Marshallese legislature in February of 1999 decided to commemorate President Reagan in this manner by enacting Resolution 85. Therefore, I think it only fitting that the Senate concur in this tribute to a great President, leader and patriot, and a man, who because of his courage in attacking the conventional wisdom of his era, and because of his extraordinary and courageous vision, has changed the course of history. 
   I am also including in the RECORD a fitting tribute to President Reagan by Winston Churchill which describes the impact that SDI had on the Soviet empire.

   Mr. President, this administration has launched an all-out assault on gun owners and gunmakers in an attempt to blame them for the crime problem that has resulted from the revolving-door criminal justice approach taken by liberal judges throughout this country. 
   I look forward to working with Chairman HATCH to move this bill expeditiously through the Judiciary Committee.

   Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, as a cosponsor of this important legislation, I believe the time has come for us to put an end to the Social Security earnings test. 
   Our seniors have worked hard to build a life for their families and have given up a great deal to provide a future for all of us. They have made sacrifices far beyond what has been required of most of us. 
   And yet, many in Washington and in the White House have sought to reward seniors by snatching more and more of their hard-earned dollars. 
   Unfortunately, staying in the work force is often not a choice, but a necessity. Many seniors are forced to work either for survival or because they must supplement their meager monthly Social Security check. 
   Seniors should not be punished for simply trying to make it to the end of the month. 
   This bill represents the first step in reversing many of the punitive taxes we have levied on both seniors and working families across America. 
   I ask my colleagues to vote in favor of this monumental legislation. 
   Every year, about 800,000 seniors suffer the affects of the Social Security earnings test--many of whom can barely afford the month's rent or proper meals. 
   Under the current law, recipients of Social Security between the ages of 65 and 69 can only earn up to $17,000 without penalty. 
   However, any income in excess of $17,000 would have the Federal Government taking $1 for every $3 they earn. 
   This means that the Federal Government is imposing a marginal tax rate  of 33 percent on the poorest segment of our society. But it does not stop there. 
   Andrew Quinlan, executive director of Capital Watch correctly states:  
   To further add insult to injury, workers must also pay a host of taxes on the original dollar, which may raise their marginal income tax rate to greater than that of sports stars and Wall Street high rollers.  
   Sandra Butler, president of United Seniors 
   Association echoes that thought:  
   The punitive nature of the Earnings Limit is obvious; By itself, the Earnings Limit imposes a 33 percent marginal tax rate on seniors.  
   Ms. Butler continues:  
   In combination with federal income and payroll taxes, the Earnings Limit forces seniors to pay higher marginal tax rates than millionaires. This is unconscionable.  
   I must agree. Some seniors could be looking at a marginal tax rate of 59 percent. This tax is unconscionable. But as Machiavellian as that may sound, it gets worse for seniors who are forced or choose to retire early. 
   Seniors who retire between the ages of 62-65 have $1 for every $2 they earn in excess of $10,080 confiscated from their check. Translation: Uncle Sam is taking half of every dollar earned from those who can least afford it. 
   Established during the depression of the 1930's, the earnings test was meant to discourage older workers from re-entering the labor force and taking jobs from younger workers. 
   However, with the extremely tight labor pool available to employers today, it makes sense to access the experienced, productive, and valuable work force seniors represent. 
   Gerald Howard, senior vice president with the National Association of Home Builders agrees. 
   He says:  
   Because the skills of decades ago are no longer taught in current education and training programs, home builders recognize the special need to keep and utilize the unique talents of retirees. 
   For our nation's home builders, retaining skilled retirees is important in meeting our workforce needs.  
   According to the Department of Labor, 240,000 new workers must be recruited and trained each year to meet the Nation's growing demands in the building industry alone. However, these requirements are not being met. 
   And it is not limited to the building industry. All sectors are feeling the pinch. 
   Dr. Charles Roadman, president and CEO of American Health Care Association has urged the President and the Vice President to ``take bold action to ease the shortage of skilled nursing professionals that has reached epidemic levels'' by supporting the Congress in their effort to eliminate the earning penalty. 
   If we wish to continue growing the economy, we must free up those with the experience and know-how to meet countries employment needs--our seniors. 
   Unfortunately, the Social Security earnings test serves as a disincentive for those who may wish to work. This disincentive effect is magnified when viewed on an after-tax basis. 
   Senior citizens who work stand to lose a substantial percentage of their Social Security benefits due to the Social Security earnings test. 
   In addition to the earning test tax, they must also continue to pay Social Security taxes, and, most likely, other Federal and State income taxes as well. 
   The Social Security earnings test forces senior citizens to avoid work, seek lower paying work, or get wages ``under the table,'' turning honest folks who are just trying to get by into common criminals. 
   The Social Security earnings test is unfair and inappropriate. It imposes a form of ``means test'' on retirement benefits. 
   Social Security benefits have been earned by a lifetime of contributions to the program. American workers have been led to regard Social Security as a government-run savings plan. 
   Indeed, their acceptance of the near 15-percent Social Security payroll tax has been predicated on the belief that they will get their money back at retirement. 
   Thus, most Americans do not accept the rationale that the return of their money should be decreased just because they continue to work. 
   Additionally, the Social Security earnings test discriminates against senior citizens who must work in order to supplement their benefits. 
   Clearly, the Social Security earnings test is inequitable to our Nation's senior citizens who are in the greatest need of extra income. 
   In addition to being complicated and difficult for folks to understand, the Social Security earnings test is complex and costly for the Government to administer. 
   For example, the test is responsible for more than one-half of retirement and survivor program overpayments. 
   Elimination of the earnings test would help minimize administration expenses, and recipients would be less confused and less tempted to cheat on reporting their earnings. 
   Finally, repealing the Social Security earnings test would greatly aid our country's economy. Our senior would be likely to work more and the American economy would benefit from their experience and skills. 
   The combined increase in the amounts that they would pay in Social Security and other taxes, as well as the additional contribution to our gross domestic product, would largely offset the increase in benefit payments. 
   For decades, our senior citizens have worked and dutifully. They have paid their share into the Social Security retirement account and it is only fair that they receive their Social Security benefits in full when they retire. 
   I ask my colleagues to join me in passing this legislation.

   Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, as we have gone through this debate, although my name was not attached to anything in terms of a filibuster, it is no secret that I have been the person who has filibustered these two nominees, Judge Berzon and Judge Paez. The issue is, why are we here? What is the role of the Senate in judicial nominations? 
   The Constitution gave the Senate the advise-and-consent role. We are supposed to advise the President and consent if we think the judge should be put on the court. We do not get very much opportunity to advise because the President just sends these nominations up here--he does not seek our advice--and then we are asked to consent. 
   Based on some of the comments that have been made to me privately and some of the things I have read publicly, it seems as if the Senate should be a rubber stamp, that we should just approve every judge who comes down the line and not do anything with the advise-and-consent role. That is not the way I read the Constitution. 
   I believe that is wrong. We have an obligation under the Constitution to review these judges very carefully. I have certainly voted for more than my share of judicial nominations this President has put forth. But I point out that the two nominees before us, in terms of their legal opinions--and that is all we are talking about; we are not talking about any personal matters other than their legal opinions--I believe are activist judges; they are out of the mainstream of American thought, and I do not think either one should be put on the court. The bottom line is they are controversial judges. 
   I was criticized by some for filibustering, that ``we are on a dangerous precedent'' of filibustering judges. The filibuster is over. We are now on the judges. The filibuster is a nonissue. 
   Filibuster in the Senate has a purpose. It is not simply to delay for the sake of delay. It is to get information. It is to take the time to debate and to find out about what a judge's thoughts are and how he or she might act once they are placed on the court. 
   I was told by some of my colleagues yesterday that we are going down ``a dangerous path'' to debate these judges and slow them down, whether it be through a filibuster or debate in this Chamber. My colleagues will find there will be very few people who will speak in the roughly 3 hours on our side under my control. That is sad. I believe we should air the concerns we have. 
   As far as the issue of going down a dangerous path and a dangerous precedent, that we somehow have never gone before, as I pointed out yesterday and I reiterate this morning, since 1968, 13 judges have been filibustered by both political parties appointed by Presidents of both political parties, starting in 1968 with Abe Fortas and coming all the way forth to these two judges today. 
   It is not a new path to argue and to discuss information about these judges. In fact, Mr. President, Chief Justice William Rehnquist sat in your chair about a year ago finishing up the impeachment trial of President William Jefferson Clinton. When William Rehnquist was nominated to the Court, he was filibustered twice. 
   Then after he was on the Court, he was filibustered again when asked to become the Chief Justice. In that filibuster, it is interesting to note, things that happened prior to him sitting on the Court were regurgitated and discussed. So I do not want to hear that I am going down some trail the Senate has never gone down before by talking about these judges and delaying. It is simply not true. I resent any argument to the contrary because it is simply not true. 
   I will talk a bit about the Ninth Circuit on which these two judges are about to go. Make no mistake about it, this is going to be a tough vote to win. I know that. But it does not mean the fight should not be made. We are all judged as Senators based on what we do, what we say, and how we act. History will judge us, as it has judged the great Senators such as Clay, Calhoun, and Webster who debated the great issues before and during the Civil War. We are judged on what positions we take. Maybe history will prove a Senator is right; maybe history will prove a Senator is wrong. When it comes time to make that vote, one does not have anyplace to hide. One has to make it and take the consequences one way or the other. I do what I do with the best information I have. 
   I can assure my colleagues that I have researched both of these judges very carefully. I have looked at the Ninth Circuit very carefully, and I have grave concerns about two very controversial judges being placed on a very controversial circuit court, the ninth. This is a renegade circuit court that is out of the mainstream of American jurisprudence. It has been reversed by the Supreme Court 90 percent of the time. It is important to let that sink in. Ninety percent of the decisions this Ninth Circuit has made have been overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court. 
   I want to repeat some of those statistics. From 1999 to now, 7 of 7, 100 percent of their cases, have been reversed. In 1998 to 1999, 13 of 18 were reversed, 72 percent. 
   From 1997 to 1998, 14 of 17, or 82 percent, were overturned. We can go on and on. From 1996 to 1997, 27 of 28 cases this court gave a decision on were overturned, 96 percent. From 1995 to 1996, 10 of 12 were overturned, 83 percent--and on and on and on. The average is: 90 percent of the cases were overturned in the past 6 years. There have been 84 reversals in the last 98 cases. That is an abysmal record, to put it mildly. 
   The Ninth Circuit is routinely issuing activist opinions. While the Supreme Court has been able to correct some of these abuses, the record is replete with antidemocratic, antibusiness, and procriminal decisions which distort the legitimate concerns and democratic participation of the residents of the Ninth Circuit. Some of the more outrageous opinions include striking down NEA decency standards, creating a ``right-to-die,'' blocking an abortion parental consent law, and a slew of obstructionist death penalty decisions. 
   I hope the American people and my colleagues understand that when you hear these terrible stories about prisoners getting out after 5 years, or people committing terrible crimes and never going to jail or getting pardoned or getting lenient sentences, this is not an accident. This happens because of the people we put on the court. 
   We are here as Senators to advise and consent, or not to consent, on the basis of these nominees. How many times do you read in the paper some judge let some criminal out, and the guy committed a crime again and again, and he got out again and did it again? It goes on and on--stalking, rape, murder, robbery, armed robbery, assault, over and over and over again. Time after time after time we hear about that happening. We sit around our living rooms at night, we watch television, we talk to each other, our families, and ask: Why did this happen? What in the world is the matter with the judges?  
   I say, with all due respect, when you have judges who are this far left out of the mainstream, surely out of the hundreds and hundreds of judges all over America, on the various district courts in this country, we can find somebody to serve on the circuit court who is not this controversial. 
   That is the bottom line. That is what this debate is about. That is why I am here on the floor. That is why, even though I know I am going to lose, I want this case made. That is why I have asked for the time to do it. 
   Again, the Senate, and particularly Republican Senators from Ninth Circuit States, are on record in favor of splitting this court; it is so controversial, making it into two circuits. 
   There was a commission called the White commission that recommended a substantial overhaul of the circuit's procedures, and that has not been implemented. It found that the circuit has so many judges that they are unable to monitor each other's decisions and they rarely have a chance to work together. That is what is going on. There are so many judges they cannot even monitor the decisions. 
   The Ninth Circuit covers 38 percent of the country, more than twice as much as any other circuit. It covers 50 million people, more than 20 million more than any other circuit. Not surprisingly, it has the most filings in the country. 
   President Clinton has already appointed 10 judges to the circuit. Democratic appointees compromise 15 of the 22 slots 
   currently occupied. There is no need to put more controversial nominees on the court from a lame duck President. 
   Paez and Berzon have attracted significant opposition both within and outside the Senate. Both were reported out of the Judiciary Committee by a 10-8 vote. That is a pretty narrow vote. Neither would move the circuit to the mainstream. In fact, they are activist judges. 
   In Paez' case, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce is officially opposed to the Paez nomination, principally due to his decision in the Unocal case in 1997 allowing U.S. companies to be sued for the human rights abuses of foreign governments. Think about that. How would you like to be a U.S. company and be sued for the human rights violations and abuses of a foreign government? That is the way Paez ruled. 
   The letter notes the chamber's serious concern about a judge pursuing a foreign policy agenda in this fashion and argues that it ``has the potential to cause significant disruption in the U.S. and world markets.'' 
   The Judicial Selection Monitoring Project at Free Congress Foundation circulated a letter signed by 300 grassroots organizations opposing this nomination. The letter highlights Paez's 1995 Boalt Hall inappropriate remarks regarding pending ballot initiatives, on the belief that he ``is an activist judge,'' and his lack of ``judicial temperament.'' 
   The ACLU of Southern California applauded his nomination as ``a welcome change after all the pro-law enforcement people we've seen appointed to the state and federal courts.'' Think about that statement by the ACLU. No matter what you think about the ACLU, let me repeat that statement. They stated, this nomination is ``a welcome change after all the pro-law enforcement people we've seen appointed to the state and federal courts.'' What does that tell you about this guy? I am telling you, my colleagues, I really wish we would stop and think about what we are doing. 
   Even the Washington Post, not exactly a bastion of conservatism, stated, in an October 29, 1999, editorial: ``Republican opposition to [Paez] is not entirely frivolous.'' It argued that his Boalt Hall speech was ``inappropriate'' and that a ``principled conservative could suspect, based on Judge Paez' comments, that he might be sympathetic to such [liberal activist] thinking and would be more generally a liberal activist on the bench.'' 
   That is the Washington Post's nice way of saying: This guy may not be that good after all. 
   There is a lot of evidence out here. You have to understand the framework: A liberal activist court that has been overturned 90 percent of the time--the Ninth Circuit--and now we put a judge on there who is being lauded as ``a welcome change'' after all the prolaw enforcement people we have seen on the court. 
   I say to the American people and my colleagues, when you hear stories about people getting out of jail or not going to jail or committing crimes over and over and over again--and you ask yourself: Oh, those liberal judges, what are we going to do about them?--ask your Senators what they did about liberal judges when they came before the Senate, before we put them on the court. That is a legitimate question: Do you support people who are lauded because they are antilaw enforcement? Maybe you ought to ask them that question because that is exactly what is happening. 
   In Berzon's case, the Berzon nomination was described by 
   the National Right to Work Committee as the ``worst judicial nomination President Clinton has ever made.'' She has been associate general counsel of the AFL-CIO since 1987 and has represented unions in the automobile, steel, electrical, garment, airline, Government, teachers, and other sectors both in a day-to-day capacity and in appellate practice. 
   Among the positions she has espoused which courts have rejected: One, State bars should be able to use compulsory dues of objecting members for lobbying. That is the way she ruled. You are forced, as a member of a union, to give dues. You are forced to allow those dues to be used for lobbying for something with which you disagree. The bottom line is: I want my job. I pay my union dues. And on top of that, they rub my nose in it further by saying: Now, in addition to that, we are going to spend money lobbying for something you disapprove of. She ruled yes; she would do that. 
   Secondly, unions should be able to prohibit members from resigning during a strike. So somebody goes on strike, they decide they want to perhaps do something else, resign, for whatever reason--how about if it is for their health?--she is prohibiting them from resigning during a strike. What does that mean? If somebody has a heart attack, they cannot quit? 
   What have we come to in this country? You should not be surprised when you hear about these outrageous decisions coming down through the courts because we are putting the people on the courts who give us these outrageous decisions. We do not deal with it in a forthright manner. 
   There are better judges than this. Bill Clinton can bring better judges than this before the Senate. Frankly, he has, and they have been approved. They may not believe everything to my way of thinking, but he is the President. But we do not want judges who are so far over to the left that they swing the pendulum way over there against what American people want. 
   Another opinion she has espoused which courts have rejected is: Unions should be able to use nonmembers to subsidize union litigation in organizing. That is the way she ruled. 
   She describes herself as a believer in the labor movement, 
   which is fine, but when you come on the court with an agenda, the Constitution should be your agenda, not labor, not a conservative or liberal or moderate cause. No, the Constitution should be your cause. If it is not constitutional, then you should not be for it. 
   The bottom line: The Senate should not confirm more judges to the Ninth Circuit unless and until its structure is reformed, and unless the nominee will help bring the circuit's jurisprudence back into the mainstream. This is clearly not the case with Judge Paez or Marsha Berzon. Neither nominee should be confirmed. It is that simple. 
   Now, let's look at some of the politics of the Ninth Circuit. In the Washington Times yesterday, Wednesday, March 8, was an article by Thomas Jipping:  
   Politics of the Ninth Circuit. Senators should reject judicial nominees.  
   I want to read one paragraph out of that op-ed piece:  
   The Senate this week will vote on two of the most controversial judicial nominations in recent memory. The result may well demonstrate whether Republicans deserve their majority status. 
   President Clinton has nominated U.S. District Judge Richard Paez and labor lawyer Marsha Berzon to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. Nearly twice as large as other circuits, it may also be the most influential, which is unfortunate because even the liberal New York Times calls it ``the country's most liberal appeals court.'' Two-  thirds of its judges are Democratic appointees. The Supreme Court has reversed its decision 90 percent of the time over the past 6 years--far more than any other circuit. And in 1996, Chief Justice Rehnquist wrote, ``Some panels of the Ninth Circuit have a hard time saying no to any litigant with a hard luck story.'' In its 1997-98 term, the Supreme Court reversed 27 of the 28 Ninth Circuit decisions it reviewed, 17 unanimously and 7 without either briefing or oral argument. Because this aggressive activism so grossly distorts the law, many Senators have long urged special scrutiny of Ninth Circuit nominees.

   Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I might say to my colleague, she knows we respect each other and like each other personally. 
   The points she makes about the families, when a nominee comes before the Senate and there is a long delay, we understand that. That is not easy for anybody. But I might also say, as far as I know--and I speak for myself, and I am pretty sure I speak for everyone else--I remember Clarence Thomas and people going in to find out what videos he purchased. He had a family. And Robert Bork had a family. And Doug Ginsburg had a family. I remember some very nasty things being said about those nominees. 
   We are looking at court cases of these nominees, and that is all we are looking at. I have not said, nor has anyone said on the Senate floor, one word about their personal lives. I have no desire to go there. This is about their court cases. In terms of Judge Paez in particular, his judicial philosophy, his activist philosophy, I will use his own words:  
   I appreciate the need for courts to act when they must. When the issue has been generated as a result of a failure of the political process to resolve a certain political question, there is no choice but for the courts to resolve the question that perhaps ideally and preferably should be resolved through the legislative process.  
   The legislative process is to write the laws. That is what we do here. It is not up to the courts to write the laws. It is up to the legislature to write the laws. You should not put your activist views, conservative or liberal, on the court. I want judges who will interpret the Constitution. 
   These are his own words. I also want to point out--and I am just now analyzing the case--I know it is not a criticism because I did not know it either until this morning, but apparently there was a criminal case of Judge Paez that was overturned yesterday. I am trying to analyze that now, or maybe Senator SESSIONS may get into it later. So there was at least one, in terms of a criminal overturn. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, in a moment I will yield to my colleague from Alabama. I want to respond to a couple of points that were made during the debate, in terms of  process, by the distinguished Senator from California, Mrs. BOXER, and Senator LEAHY of Vermont. 
   The criticism on the filibuster is a bit unwarranted. I could have come down here and thrown the Senate into quorum calls and delayed and delayed just for the sake of delay. None of us on our side, including me, did any such thing. We worked out an agreement with the majority leader for a limited amount of time, which on our side was 3 hours--it could have been 30, No. 1--after cloture. Secondly, I agreed to move the cloture time up, and the leader agreed with me. 
   The real purpose of that was to get facts out about these two judicial nominees, Berzon and Paez. I know in the case of Senator SESSIONS, who will speak for himself on this, he has new information about Judge Paez. I believe that when new information is there, in spite of the fact that this judge has been before the Senate for 4 years, it should be shared with the Senate. I think Senator SESSIONS has every right to share it. Frankly, I think Senators will want to hear it. So I hope they will listen when Senator SESSIONS speaks in detail about the new information he has because I think it is very important in the case of the nomination of Judge Paez. 
   I want to speak for just a moment on the issue of the random rule that my colleague from Vermont talked about. He indicated, to his credit, that he called and asked about the random rule, and he got a statement from the clerk that that was in fact random. Well, that is one statement, and it may well be true. I think we have a right to check that out to make sure it was random. If it were random, I ask my colleague, should this judge who is before the Senate to be confirmed for the circuit court, nominated by President Bill Clinton--is it the right thing to do, perception-wise, to sit on a case involving Maria Hsia, who has just been convicted for part of the fundraising scandal, along with John Huang who was also involved in that scandal? It seems to me, even if it did come out randomly, it would be good, common sense to say I will recuse myself from these cases because I don't think it looks good. 
   The random aspect has a problem, which Senator SESSIONS will address. The random aspect presents a problem for me because there are 34 judges there, and the fact that those 2 cases would be randomly assigned to this judge is pretty suspicious. But if you give them the benefit of the doubt, a bad judgment was made by Judge Paez in taking them. 
   Finally, much has been made here this morning as to comments about Hispanic judges. I think the implication is, 
   somehow there is bias here. I remind my colleagues and the American people that we had a vote of whatever it was--95-0--on Judge Fuentes the other day. I voted for that judge, as did all of my colleagues. I certainly didn't assign any racial bias when Judge Thomas was opposed by many on the other side of the aisle, who happened to be a conservative black, which was the first sin--and probably the only sin, as far as I know--he committed. For that, he went through a living hell for a long time. Had he been a liberal black judge, I don't think there would have been a problem at all. 
   So I don't think we need to get into name calling and give the insinuation that somehow because Paez happens to be Hispanic--that is uncalled for, and I hope we can get away from that kind of debate. I look at each person on the basis of their qualifications and their decisions. For all I know--OK, Paez, is that a Hispanic name? I don't even know. I could care less. So I hope we can get beyond that. 
   At this time, I yield to my colleague from Alabama, Senator SESSIONS, whatever time he may consume.

   Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. I thank the Chair. 
   As we continue this debate, I refer back to the Ninth Circuit chart behind me. This is a situation where we see, again, nearly 90 percent of the Ninth Circuit cases have been reversed by the Supreme Court. I have had this chart up all morning because I think that is a very significant number, to say the least. 
   Earlier in the debate, my colleague, Senator REID, made the argument that oftentimes we have higher numbers, as much as 100-percent reversal, with some of the circuit courts. He is correct. But what he did not say is that sometimes the reversals are one or two cases. For example, he said there were several times when the First and the Second Circuits were reversed 100 percent of the time. He is right. In the two cases he cited, one was when there was only one case, another was when there were six. Several of them were in the D.C. Circuit, the Federal Circuit, and others, a 100-percent overturn rate. The  100-percent overturn rate was based on one case. 
   What we are talking about here in the Ninth Circuit is, in 1996 and 1997, 27 of 28 cases overturned, a 96-percent overturn ratio. I think it is very important to understand what we are talking about. This is not 100 percent based on one case or two cases; this is based on 27 of 28 cases in 1996 and 1997. In the 1997-98 term of the Ninth Circuit, 13 of 17 were reversed, for a 76-percent rate. Then again, the Senator from Nevada referred to some other circuits that year. Of course, the Eleventh had two overturned out of two, for 100 percent. So it is pretty misleading to suggest that 90 percent is very common in overturning these circuit cases because there are higher percentages in other cases when, again, it is based on 1 or 2 
   cases, not on 27 or 28, as it was in 1996-97. It is based on 13 out of 17 in 1997-98. As of June 1999, it was 14 out of 18, for a total of 78 percent. 
   Yes, wherever you see a 100-percent overturn ratio, it is usually almost exclusively one or two cases at the most. Those are very dramatic and significant statistics. 
   I think what we have here is a situation where we have a rogue circuit that is basically way out of the mainstream of American political thought. Now we are putting two more judges on that court who--I think it is pretty obvious based on the information we have heard--are going to add to that out-of-the-mainstream majority. 
   Let us look at specifically each of these judges. Richard Paez is one of the nominees we are considering. It is no secret I am opposed to that nomination. In general, I oppose nominees who are judicial activists. I don't think judicial activism is what the Constitution or the Founding Fathers meant. I don't think they meant judicial activism on the right, and I don't think they meant judicial activism on the left. 
   I think what they meant is, interpret the Constitution, don't legislate from the bench, and uphold the Constitution as it was written. That is what they meant. That is not what we have gotten from many, certainly not from these two judges, and it is certainly not what we have gotten from several other judges who were put on the bench over the years. 
   In 1981, Richard Paez became Los Angeles Municipal Court judge, where he served until 1994. Since then, he has served as a U.S. district judge for the Central District of California. We can go back through a lot of cases; we have done a lot of research. If we go back to Prop. 187 and Prop. 209 in California, Proposition 187 was the California initiative to limit public assistance to illegal immigrants, and Proposition 209 was the California initiative to end State-run racial preference programs. 
   In 1995, Judge Paez spoke to the University of California at Berkeley Law School. This is what he said:  
   The Latino community has for some time now faced heightened discrimination and hostility which came to a head with prop 187. The proposed anti-civil rights initiative will inflame the issues all over again without contributing to any serious discussion of our differences and similarities or ways to ensure equal opportunity for all.  
   Here we have a sitting Federal judge. He has his right to his opinion. We all do. But he is a sitting Federal judge talking about a California ballot initiative that was likely the subject of litigation. Why is he taking that position publicly on that particular proposition? The answer is simple: Because he has an agenda. Those comments were inappropriate for a Federal judge because his agenda is that he didn't like Prop. 187. So, therefore, he said so. 
   I think we all know--I have heard judge after judge after judge after judge after judge come before the Judiciary Committee and, much to my consternation and frustration in trying to find out their philosophy, not answer questions about any case that might be pending or be before them. As frustrating as it is not to get an answer, that is correct. I don't think a sitting judge should be doing this. I think that issue alone on that one statement is enough to reject this nominee, just on that. 
   Again, Proposition 187 later became California Proposition 
   209, and it passed. And Proposition 209 ended affirmative action in California State programs. Paez should know that the Judicial Code of Conduct prohibits him from comments that cast any doubt on his capacity to decide this case or any case on an impartial basis. So he went over the line on an issue that he knew was going to come before him or certainly was reasonable to assume was going to come before him. 
   Is there any doubt about how Judge Paez would now rule on any California proposition that affects affirmative action? Regardless of how one feels about affirmative action, that is not the issue here. We now know how he feels. He has already told us. So I don't know how he gives us a fair decision when he has already said what his decision is. 
   He did say he was an activist judge in his own words, even though some on the floor have said he is not. I will repeat this again. He said:  
   I appreciate the need for courts to act when they must when the issue has been generated as a result of the failure of the political process to resolve a certain political question. There is no choice but for the courts to resolve a question that perhaps ideally and preferably should be resolved through the legislative process.  
   In the Constitution, it doesn't say ``ideally'' and ``preferably'' in terms of the legislative process. If you can find that in the Constitution somewhere, that it says ideally and preferably the legislature should pass the laws, ideally and preferably the executive branch should enforce the laws, or ideally and preferably the judicial branch should interpret the laws--it doesn't say any of that. There is a very clear distinction in the Constitution: Three separate but equal branches of the United States Government. 
   It is very clear who is supposed to legislate, who is supposed to write the laws. It is not the Supreme Court. It is not the circuit court. It is not the district court. It is not any Federal court. We have a Federal judge talking about a California ballot initiative that was likely the subject of litigation. I think that is inappropriate.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, let me briefly discuss the other nominee, Marsha Berzon. 
   I think we have made a pretty overwhelming and compelling case about the Ninth Circuit itself being out of touch in having almost 90 percent of its cases overturned, as the chart in the back shows. And we are adding two more judges to that court, if they are approved, who are basically going to also, obviously, have cases overturned if they follow along the lines we are talking about. 
   When I think of all the judges who are qualified, whatever their political philosophy, if they are qualified to be a circuit court judge, why do we pick a judge who opposes having somebody carry a Bible into the courtroom? Because he is afraid somehow that is going to ruin the whole judicial process and somehow threaten the Constitution or the liberties of the United States of America? It doesn't make sense. It really, in my view, says a lot about the nominee. 
   We have approved many Clinton nominees who have come through this Senate. I voted for a lot of them myself. Some of them went through even without a challenge. But I think when you start talking about people who are this extreme, this is a mistake. I believe it is a mistake we will regret. 
   I commend my colleague, Senator SESSIONS, for what he has done with the most recent information he brought forth regarding the Maria Hsia case and the John Huang case. 
   I am going to bring something up that may set a few people off. But I am being told, as I stand here now, that there is a possibility the Vice President of the United States may be called, or has been called, to come to the chair during the vote on the Sessions motion or perhaps on the vote on Paez. 
   I want you to think for a second about the implications of that. He could be the tie breaker. He could be, in theory, the tie breaker. 
   Here you have the Vice President of the United States who was a close personal friend of Maria Hsia who shook down Buddhist nuns for money, was prosecuted for it, and convicted. And the judge whom Bill Clinton is trying to put on the court was involved in at least one case--not that one, but one case involving Maria Hsia, which gave her a break, if you will, a lenient sentence, and then in the other case, John Huang, $1.5 million from the Chinese Communist Government into the coffers of this administration, of which Vice President GORE is a part, and he goes in before Judge Paez, supposedly randomly selected, and gives the guy a plea bargain for a $7,500 contribution in the mayoral race in L.A., as Senator SESSIONS has pointed out. 
   Now the Vice President of the United States is going to sit in the Chair and break a tie for that judge? How far will this administration go to cover up and to be blatant and in your face on what they have done? 
   If he sits in this Chair today and votes on this nomination, if it should come to a tie, that is an outrage. It is outrageous, and it is an in-your-face outrage that I think the American people are not going to tolerate. 
   As Senator SESSIONS has so ably pointed out, I don't know whether it was random or not--there were 34 judges who could have gotten those 2 cases, and he got both of them. That is point No. 1. 
   Point No. 2: If it were random, then perhaps he should have said: You know, Bill Clinton nominated me, and I am before the Senate for a circuit court nomination. Both of these cases involve scandals in the President's administration. I will take a walk on these. Assign them to somebody else. But he didn't do it. He gave lenient punishment after he took them. And we are going to tolerate that by allowing Judge Paez to come in? It is just outrageous. It is just outrageous. Yet it is probably going to happen here on the floor. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. I thank my colleague from Alaska for his comments in support of the opposition to these two nominees. 
   I yield myself 5 minutes to summarize. 
   We have a circuit court, the Ninth Circuit, widely considered by most objective observers a renegade circuit that is out of the mainstream of American jurisprudence, a circuit court that has had decisions overturned by the Supreme Court nearly 90 percent of the time in the past 6 years. That is a very high percentage of the number of cases they have. It is the largest circuit in the country. It includes the 7-7 overturn rate in 1999-2000 and 27-28 reversal rate in 1996-1997. In fact, 17 of the decisions in 1996-1997 out of the 27 were overturned unanimously, which means both the liberal and the conservative Justices on the Supreme Court agree that these decisions were so outrageous, they had to be overturned. 
   It is a court that routinely issues activist opinions, opinions that conflict with the basic American constitutional and legal principles. We have had a great debate on some of the outrageous decisions that have come down. 
   As I have said, these two new nominees will, if approved, add to that court in a way that is going to continue to have cases overturned. These two judges, Ms. Berzon as well as Mr. Paez, have both indicated by their own track records they will be making similar decisions. I think this is most disturbing. 
   In the case of Marsha Berzon, we are talking about a potential judicial activist on labor issues. As I said before, it doesn't matter what the issues are, what one believes in personally. The job as a judge is to interpret the Constitution in a way that does not put personal views on the court but, 
   rather, enforces the Constitution. 
   Ms. Berzon has described her practice: From the outset of my law practice, an important client has been the AFL-CIO. Since 1975, I have devoted a substantial part of my practice to aiding labor organizations affiliated with the AFL-CIO at the Supreme Court and other appellate litigation. 
   There is nothing wrong with that on the surface. She certainly has a right to represent anyone she chooses to represent if she is asked to do it in a court of law. 
   The question is, Why talk about that when she knows that cases involving labor could come before her? Imagine what would happen on this floor. We have heard a lot of people outraged by what we have done, getting a good, thorough debate on the two nominees. 
   Imagine if we had a nominee before the Senate, the outcry from the other side of the aisle if we had a guy or gal come before the Senate, a nominee of any President--say of President Bush in the future--and this person said, ``I have since 1975 devoted a substantial part of my practice to fighting gun control and have been affiliated with the National Rifle Association and gun owners of America in many cases before the courts of America.'' 
   Imagine what we would hear on the other side. They have a right to air that if they wish. I think it would be justified if a person were to say he was going to promote the interests of any particular group or industry. 
   It is not new to raise the debate on issues about a particular nominee. I get tired of hearing talk that we are wrong to raise these issues because these judges happen to be liberals. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, several comments have been made today, I think correctly so. I do not think the information was out. But it is interesting we now have a capital sentencing case, Arreguin v. Prunty, in which Judge Paez was reversed, as of yesterday. Several people had said no criminal case of his had been reversed. Those statements were correct. That has changed now since March 9. So here we have this judge being reversed, this judge we are now talking about putting on the circuit court. 
   In this case, the defendant was an accomplice to robbery and murder and he actively encouraged the murder of an innocent civilian. 
   Under California law, an accomplice can only be sentenced to life without parole or death if he was a ``major participant'' in the capital crime. 
   In Arreguin, an impartial jury unanimously convicted the defendant as an accomplice to robbery and murder. 
   The State trial judge instructed the jury on what a ``major participant'' was. The jury sentenced the defendant to life without parole.  
   The California appellate courts recognized that the State trial judge made a technical error in giving the ``major participant'' instruction, but held that the record clearly showed that the defendant was in fact a ``major participant'' in the robbery-murder and affirmed the sentence under the harmless error rule. 
   On habeas review, however, Judge Paez held that the Constitution somehow created a liberty interest in receiving a perfect jury instruction--even if he was clearly a major participant in the robbery-murder. 
   This is a classic example of the continued liberal activist interpretation of the Constitution by Judge Paez. 
   Yestreday, March 8, 2000, a unanimous panel of the Ninth Circuit reversed Judge Paez and reinstated the sentence of the defendant to life without parole. 
   The Ninth Circuit agreed with and quoted the California appellate court, stating:  
   ..... under any reasonable interpretation of the evidence, [Arreguin] was a major participant and the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.  
   The [California] court further stated:  
   Standing within arms's reach of an armed accomplice exhorting, ``Shoot 'im, shoot 'im'' about the victim, immediately after another accomplice forcibly broke the truck window, warrants no other reasonable conclusion than that appellant was a major participant. Appellant's testimony that he did not participate at all was necessarily rejected by the jury in its verdict. This harmless error analysis is sufficient. ..... Therefore, we reverse the grant of the writ.  
   Once again, this shows a continuing liberal, activist interpretation of the Constitution that even the Ninth Circuit could not agree with. Judge Paez will not move the Ninth Circuit into the mainstream, he will make the problem. Accordingly, I will vote against this nominee. 
   Judge Paez will not move the Ninth Circuit into the mainstream; he is going to make it the problem. 
   That is one of the major reasons why I am not going to vote for Judge Paez, and in my view, respectfully, I do not think others should either. 
   I also want to mention the Senate has received over 10,000 signatures on petitions opposing the Berzon nomination because of her extreme position on labor matters. Here are the 10,000 signatures. That is a lot of signatures. That is a lot of time people take to oppose a judge, and not even a Supreme Court Justice but an appellate court judge or circuit court judge. 
   There is a lot of opposition out there. Also, I might add, there is a lot of knowledge about these nominees. 
   They should be rejected.

   In response to what Senator SESSIONS said, his motion is very important in regards to Judge Paez. I ask my colleagues to consider one question: What if it was not random that Paez got the John Huang case? What if? Well, if you want to put the guy on the court and find out later, that is up to you. 
   Finally, this is an activist court. This is a court that has been overturned 209 percent of the time. We are putting two judges on it, one who says that a member of a union can't resign in a strike no matter what the reason, and, finally, Paez, who is opposed by the U.S. Chamber and who believes that a defendant cannot carry a Bible into a courtroom, much as that Bible sits here on the desk of the Presiding Officer right now. Those are the kinds of people we are putting on the bench. 
   I strongly urge that both of these nominees be rejected and that Senator SESSIONS' motion be supported. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate today has unanimously passed S. 1653, a bill to reauthorize and amend the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation. The Committee on Environment and Public Works, which I chair, reported this bill, again unanimously, last month. At that time, I noted how important it was to get the local communities and businesses involved in protecting the environment. 
   The Foundation was created in 1984 because Congress saw the need to create a private, nonprofit organization that could build public-private partnerships and consensus, where previously there had only been acrimony and, many times, contentious litigation. It was also envisioned that the Foundation would serve as an important tool in our effort to make a difference on the ground in communities throughout the United States. In its 16 years of existence the Foundation has more than lived up to our original expectations. 
   We have long known that the Federal government does not have all the financial resources necessary to solve the numerous environmental problems that exist in our country. We also know that local communities care and know more about their natural environment than the agencies in Washington, D.C. More often than not local communities recognize problems before they become environmental disasters that require significant amounts of money to resolve, if they can even be resolved. In order to ensure that the funds are available to local communities the Foundation has established something called ``challenge grants.'' 
   ``Challenge grants'' are a mixture of federal and non-federal funds directed to on-the-ground conservation projects. They are called ``challenge grants'' because any grant awarded is expected to be matched by non-federal dollars. During this time of fiscal constraint, it is important to use all available resources to help us protect the environment. Local communities, states, individuals, nonprofit organizations and  businesses can apply to the Foundation for a ``challenge grant'' for a specific project in one of five major areas: conservation education, wetlands and private lands, neotropical bird conservation, fisheries conservation and management, and wildlife and habitat management. 
   Since 1984, the Foundation has raised over $305 million in private donations using $135 million in Federal funds as leverage. Last year alone, they raised more than $50 million using $17 million of federal seed money. With these funds, the Foundation has financed more than 3,500 conservation projects throughout the United States and in 35 other countries. This is an extremely impressive record. Moreover, all of the Foundation's operating costs are covered by private donations, which means that federal and private dollars given for conservation are spent only on conservation. 
   The Foundation's 1999 annual report was just released, and I encourage all my colleagues to take a look at the number of partnerships that the Foundation has forged with, and the range of innovative projects that they have spearheaded. The organizations that the Foundation works with are a virtual who's who in the business world. Let me take a few minutes to discuss some of the projects they are currently working on. 
   The Foundation has pioneered some notable conservation programs, including implementing the North American Waterfowl Management plan, Partners in Flight for neotropical birds, Bring Back the Natives Program, the Exxon Save the Tiger Fund, and the establishment of the Conservation Plan for Sterling Forest in New York and New Jersey, to name a few. 
   The Shell Oil Company has pledged $5 million to the Foundation over the next five years to create the Shell Marine Habitat Program, a matching grant program. The Shell Marine Habitat Program supports problem-solving habitat restoration projects, practical research, education programs and innovative partnerships to preserve the Gulf of Mexico and Gulf coast marine environments. Funding is focused on efforts to reduce hypoxia and red and brown tides, and to protect barrier islands, coral reefs and other marine habitats. Last year alone $3.4 million were spent on these efforts, $3.15 million of which was from Shell and other private donors. More importantly, this project is receiving a significant amount of local support. A day-long effort last year to restore saltmarsh habitat had over 1,500 volunteers who planted 57,000 plants. It is these kinds of efforts that will make a significant difference to the health of the Gulf of Mexico. 
   Another fine example is the Budweiser Outdoor Programs. For six weeks last fall, a percentage of all bottles and cans of Budweiser sold was allocated for conservation purposes. The Foundation partnership with Budweiser resulted in more than a quarter of a million dollars that will help conserve vital elk and deer habitat, enhance wetlands and sustain healthy upland game bird populations in the Rocky Mountains. 
   In New Hampshire the Foundation worked closely with local organizations to purchase a 60-acre conservation easement along the entire shoreline of Clarksville Pond. Clarksville Pond is a beautiful area located in the heart of the Northern Forest. The owners of this land own a small campground that they needed to make some improvements which they could not afford. The sale of a permanent public access conservation easement was one way the property owners could raise the necessary funds without selling their land, and losing their livelihood. This is a win-win situation for everyone involved. The property owners were able to keep their land, the public was granted permanent access to the pond, and this beautiful area will remain undeveloped. 
   As I said, the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation has more than fulfilled the hopes of its original sponsors. It has helped to bring cooperative solutions to some difficult natural resource issues and is becoming widely recognized for its innovative approach to solving environmental problems. I strongly support the Foundation's work and want it to continue its important conservation efforts. 
   Mr. President, this legislation is quite simple. It makes three key changes to current law. First, the bill would expand the Foundation's governing Board of Directors from 15 members to 25 members. This will allow a greater number of individuals with a strong interest in conservation to actively participate in, and contribute to, the Foundation's activities. 
   The bill's second key feature would expand the Foundation's jurisdiction. Currently, the Foundation is only authorized to work with the Fish and Wildlife Service and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. S. 1653 would authorize them to work with all agencies within the Department of the Interior and the Department of Commerce. Mr. President, it is my view that the Foundation has an excellent track record, and all the agencies within the Departments of the Interior and Commerce should benefit from their knowledge and experience. 
   Finally, the bill would reauthorize appropriations to the Department of the Interior and the Department of Commerce through 2004. 
   Mr. President, last year this bill passed the Senate by unanimous consent, but unfortunately the House was unable to duplicate our efforts. I believe that this legislation will produce real conservation benefits and I thank my colleagues for once again giving the bill their support.

    Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the Womens Rural Entrepreneurial Network (WREN) of Bethlehem for receiving the Home Loan Bank of Boston's 1999 Community Development Award. The award recognizes the top project in the state undertaken by a nonprofit community group and a local bank. WREN's hard work has made a real difference in the lives of the women of Northern New Hampshire, and the accomplishments of its members are to be commended. 
   With the assistance of Passumpsic Bank, WREN developed a program to help women in Northern New Hampshire start their own businesses. The program initially offered training in areas such as business plan development, marketing, financial management and computer literacy, but quickly expanded to include other crucial skills such as networking and technology training. As a result of the success of those programs, WREN is currently developing a community center that will house a retail store to sell the products of the program's participants, a community art studio and an expanded meeting and teaching space. The sky is the limit for this program, and its future certainly looks bright. 
   The achievements of the program are remarkable, and they serve as a shining example of what can be accomplished when local banks and community-oriented groups work together. It is truly an honor to serve such a hardworking organization in the United States Senate.

    Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Mayor Raymond J. Wieczorek upon the occasion of his leaving office. Mayor Wieczorek faithfully served the City of Manchester, New Hampshire, and its citizens for the past 10 years. A truly gifted leader, he inspired those who were fortunate enough to work with him, and created a legacy that will triumphantly carry Manchester into the 21st century. 
   Mayor Wieczorek has played an important role in the economic development of the City of Manchester. Through his hard work and diligence, he has been able to develop a positive working relationship with many community leaders and guide them through the process of expansion and development in the city. He has been the driving force behind the Riverwalk project, restoring and bringing businesses to the Historic Mill District and bringing business leaders back to the inner city. He oversaw the expansion of  both the Mall of New Hampshire and the Manchester Airport, as well as the preliminary plans for the Manchester Civic Center. Thoroughout his many years as a dedicated public servant, Mayor Wieczorek has cultivated a vast knowledge of information and resources that has constantly been vital in the operation of my New Hampshire offices. 
   An individual who truly knew how to connect with those around him, Mayor Wieczorek's door was always open to the citizens of Manchester. Whether through a word of advice, a birthday greeting or negotiations on an expansion and development project, the Mayor treated each of the individuals who approached him with care and concern, and always remembered them with a smile and a quick anecdote upon a second meeting. 
   I wish Mayor Wieczorek much happiness as he embarks on this new journey in life. His leadership and perseverance will be sorely missed as his decade of public service comes to an end. I want to leave him with a poem by Robert Frost, as I know that he has many more miles to travel and endeavors to conquer.  
   The woods are lovely, dark and deep. 
   But I have promises to keep, 
   And miles to go before I sleep. 
   And miles to go before I sleep.  
   Mayor, it has been a pleasure to represent you in the United States Senate. I wish you the best of luck in your future endeavors. May you always continue to inspire those around you.

Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a newspaper that has provided the town of Merrimack, New Hampshire, with information and insight for the past twenty-one years. The Village Crier is a paper for which many of the town residents of Merrimack have waited in anticipation each week. It certainly has greatly impacted the community as a whole. 
   The Village Crier has been on the front lines of every political battle in Merrimack, and the opinions and advice that they brought to the tale will be greatly missed. Both Seth and Lucille have put countless hours into the production of the Crier, and have gained the respect and admiration of not only their staff, but of the entire community. 
   It is with sincere regret and deep sadness that I bid farewell to the Village Crier. I wish both Seth and Lucille the best as they continue with their future endeavors. The Village Crier will be greatly missed, and it is an honor to represent both Seth and Lucille Heywood in the United States Senate.

    Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Alex Giang for receiving the Merrimack Chamber of Commerce Presidential Award. A member of the chamber for several years, Alex has risen to prominence with his continuous displays of passion and perseverence. His personality endears him to all, and he is well known for his gregarious nature. Alex is a kind-hearted leader, and Mary Jo and I applaud him for his hard work and dedication to the Merrimack Chamber of Commerce. 
   Alex Giang inspires others to achieve the same ends by using the leadership qualities for which he has been honored. Alex has taken it upon himself to attempt to increase the membership of the chamber. He is a man determined to have others give of themselves as he has given. He has been a key figure in the creation of the chamber fund raiser, ``A Taste of Merrimack,'' where the time and effort that was spent on his part exemplified his dedication to the chamber. In addition to all of this, Alex is a purveyor of fine cuisine in the town of Merrimack. 
   Alex is a leader in the truest sense. He is a gregarious individual who puts forth enormous effort for worthy causes. His enthusiasm for both life and the Merrimack chamber is contagious. Alex, it is a pleasure to represent you in the United States Senate. I wish you the best of luck in the future. May you always continue to inspire those around you.

   Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I was very much intrigued by the remarks of my colleagues from New York and Vermont a few moments ago, talking about how we should move on in the process and that there does not seem to be much of a history of blocking nominees and that it is not good for the constitutional process. 
   I think the constitutional process is very clear that the Senate has the right and the responsibility, under the Constitution, to advise and consent. That is exactly what I intend to do in my role as a Senator as it pertains to these two nominees before us. 
   Let me summarize where I think we are on the issue of judicial nominees in general. 
   It is no secret that I am opposed to Judge Berzon and Judge Paez, as many of my colleagues on this side of the aisle are, I hope. At least that is what I am told. 
   The issue, though, is whether it is OK to block judicial nominees. We have heard from a couple of my colleagues in the last few moments that it isn't OK to block judicial nominees, as if there was something unconstitutional about it. There is thinking among some that we should not start down this path of blocking a judicial nominee whom we do not think is a good nominee for the court because it may come back to haunt us at some point when and if a Republican should be elected to the Presidency. 
   Let me say, with all due respect to my colleagues, I am not starting down any new path. The tradition of the Senate is one of blocking judicial nominees in the final year of an administration. I am going to be very specific and prove exactly my point that we are not starting down any new path. The path is well worn. We are following a path; we are not starting down any new path. 
   I am going to go back to 1992, since that is the most relevant year for this discussion, the final year of the Bush administration. 
   How did the Senate treat judicial nominees? Facts are sometimes pretty devilish things. 
   They do point out the truth. They are pretty hard to discredit. Let's look at the facts. 
   There was only one controversial judicial nominee considered the entire year in 1992--in fact, only one rollcall vote, period, on judicial nominees. Why is that? That is no big deal. They voted the only one that came up. That is the point. Why didn't they come up? With all due respect to my colleagues from Vermont and New York, it is called blocking the nomination. It is called bottling them up in committee. It is called not bringing them to the floor. Let's be specific. 
   In 1992, we had a nominee by the name of Edward Carnes. He was nominated to the Eleventh Circuit. There were no fewer than three full votes in the Senate on one nominee: A motion to proceed, followed by a filibuster, a 66-30 cloture vote, and finally, on September 9, 1992, approval--a long process for this one judge. But other than that one nominee who was, in fact, filibustered, there was nothing--no action, no debate, no nothing--on the floor of the Senate. All other controversial nominees were filibustered in committee under the Democrat leadership in the Senate. 
   Sure, the Senate approved nominees here or there. I admit that. But if we define ``controversial'' as having at least a rollcall vote, there weren't any. 
   What about the controversial ones? Let's take a look at a few. Let me stick with the appeals court since that is what we are dealing with today with Judges Berzon and Paez. In April of 1990, President George Bush nominated Kenneth J. Ryskamp to the Eleventh Circuit. Mr. Ryskamp was opposed by none other than civil rights activists, and the Judiciary Committee bottled up the nomination of Mr. Ryskamp for an entire year. At the end of the year, they sent the nomination back to President Bush, and Mr. Ryskamp was resubmitted but never made it. 
   Don't come here on the floor and tell me that if I want to block Judge Paez or Judge Berzon, somehow I am going down some new path. I am not going down any new path. I am following the tradition and precedent of this Senate. Those who did that in 1992 had every right to do it under Senate rules and under the Constitution, as I do today and as I intend to do on these nominations. 
   In September of 1991, President Bush nominated Franklin S. Van Antwerpen of Pennsylvania to the Third Circuit. The nomination was blocked in committee for the entire final year of the Bush Presidency. It never saw the light of day. In November of 1991, President Bush nominated Lillian R. BeVier, a conservative from Virginia who had testified for Robert Bork. That was her first mistake. Lord help us, she was a conservative, No. 1, in the Democrat  years here. No. 2, she testified on behalf of Robert Bork. She was nominated to the Fourth Circuit. Guess what happened to her. Her nomination languished for a whole year. Finally, the committee deep-sixed her at the end of the Bush Presidency--gone, didn't see the light of day. I guess that was unconstitutional. If it is unconstitutional now, surely it was unconstitutional then. 
   Of course, it is not unconstitutional. You have that right. On the same day, President Bush nominated Terrence W. Boyle to the Fourth Circuit. Again, the chairman put a hold on the nomination for an entire year. It languished in the darkness of Judiciary and never saw the light of day. 
   Here is an article from 1992. It says: ``North Carolina Judge One of 50 Bush Court Nominations that Won't be Approved.'' 
   It talks about the intentional strategy of Chairman BIDEN to delay and kill Bush nominees because of the likely Clinton victory. That speaks for itself. 
   Here are a few lines from the news service, September 28, 1992:  
   Men and women named by President Bush to 50 vacant judgeships will not be confirmed by the Senate this year, leaving Republicans and Democrats pointing fingers of blame at each other. The nominees who must be approved by the Senate Judiciary Committee include Terrence W. Boyle, 46, a U.S. District Court Judge in Elizabeth City who was proposed for a seat on the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. Last week, Senator Joe Biden, Democrat of Delaware, who chairs the panel, said no additional hearings on nominations will take place this year. With Congress expected to adjourn for the year next Monday and Democratic presidential candidate Bill Clinton ahead in the polls, many Republicans fear the nominees will never be approved and charged Biden with intentionally delaying the process. 
   South Carolina Senator Strom Thurmond, highest ranking Republican on the panel, said he had asked Biden earlier this year to increase the number of hearings and the number of nominees considered at each hearing. This was not done and we are now out of time, he said. ``It's got partisan written all over it,'' said Andy Wright, political director of the North Carolina Republican Party. Biden, Wright said, is ``taking advantage of an opportunity. He knows what power he has.'' But a Judiciary Committee aide rejected charges that the panel has initially stalled progress on the nominees, saying the committee had approved ``a record number of nominees in a presidential election year when the Senate and White House were controlled by different parties.''  
   Well, they are controlled by different parties. The thing is reversed. 
   They go on to explain that ``the Senate had approved 59 Bush nominees,'' so forth and so on. 
   The point is, this is not new ground; this is old ground we are walking. 
   In November of 1991, George Bush nominated Frank Keating of Oklahoma to the Tenth Circuit. It was blocked for the entire year. It died 2 years later at the end of the Bush Presidency. 
   Let me read an article from the Philadelphia Tribune entitled ``Shelving of Keating Nomination Pleases Rights Groups.'' The nomination wasn't defeated by the Senate. It was shelved by the committee. A group of liberal organizations opposed him, and the committee buried the nomination.  
   National civil rights groups like the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, National Fair Housing Alliance, Children's Legal Defense Fund, are still smiling as a result of the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee's decision not to vote on the nomination of Francis Keating for a judgeship on the Tenth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. 
   This means that Keating's nomination and the fate of 50 other judicial nominees still under consideration by the committee will have to wait until January when the Senate is scheduled to come back into session.  
   It goes on to discuss this nomination--again, a nomination killed in committee by the other party. Controversial, never saw the light of day. New ground? I don't think so. 
   In January of 1992, President George Bush nominated Sidney Fitzwater to the Fifth Circuit. Same old story: Nomination 
   languishes, a whole year goes by and the nomination dies. 
   Here is a story from the Texas Lawyer entitled ``Judiciary Panel Kills Texans' Nominations.'' This is American Lawyer Newspapers Group, October 1992:  
   Surprised? Hardly. ``It's an every four-year occurrence,'' said U.S. District Judge Lucius D. Bunton, III of Midland, Texas, chief of Texas' Western District. 
   As spring turns to summer in presidential election years, the party out of power at the White House traditionally throws up roadblocks to slow a process that in normal times confirms most candidates automatically. In addition to the expected slowdown, those close to the process from both parties say Governor Bill Clinton's lead in the polls has prompted Democrats to delay judicial confirmations in hopes of preserving the vacancies of the presidential candidate.  
   Again, they have the right to do that. They did do it, and they did it effectively. So when we come out here to do it now because of two very liberal activist judges, why should we be criticized for exercising our rights under the process? If you disagree with us on the basis of why we are objecting, fine. But don't pontificate on the floor of the Senate and tell me that somehow I am violating the Constitution of the United States of America by blocking a judge or filibustering a judge that I don't think deserves to be on the circuit court because I am going to continue to do it at every opportunity I believe a judge should not be on that court. That is my responsibility. That is my advise and consent role, and I intend to exercise it. I don't appreciate being told that somehow I am violating the Constitution of the United States. I swore to uphold that Constitution, and I am doing it now by standing up and saying what I am saying. 
   The same day in 1992, Bush nominated John G. Roberts of Maryland to the D.C. circuit. That was filed in the same old black hole with the rest of them. Congress adjourned; the nomination was blocked, end of story. Another nomination in January of 1992 was blocked in committee and killed at the end of the Presidency. Justin Wilson, nominated in May of 1992, was killed by committee. Here is an article, September of 1992: ``Outlook grim for Wilson nomination,'' from the Gannett News Service. 
   Byline by Lacrisha Butler, this article says:  
   Nashville lawyer Justin Wilson's nomination to fill a vacancy on the U.S. Sixth Circuit Court, which has been pending in the Senate committee for 6 months, is among more than 100 Federal judge nominations still awaiting action before Congress adjourns in early October. 
   And it appears unlikely that Wilson's nomination will see action before the session ends, because of snags in his background check and what is being called an attempt by Democrats to hold up nominations in anticipation of a change in administration.  
   Again, this is not new ground. This is a role the Senate has played for years, decades. It is an appropriate role if we believe a nomination, or the other side believes a nomination 
   might be too far to the left or right--depending on which side you are. 
   Mr. President, this is just one year of the Presidency I am talking about. I have only dealt with 1992 when circuit court nominees were blocked in committee. I could have gone back further into the Bush Presidency. I could have gone back into other Presidencies. I didn't do that, but these are filibusters. When you don't allow a nomination to get to the Senate floor--it may not be under the technical term ``filibuster,'' but when you block it, that is a filibuster. You are not getting it here and you can't talk about it if it isn't up here. If it is languishing in committee, then we are not going to be able to debate it, approve it, or reject it. No matter how you shake it, they were filibusters led by committee chairmen rather than the majority leader on the floor. 
   If you want precedent for floor filibusters--I have heard it said there is no history of filibusters on the Senate floor. OK, they have been in committee; we stopped them in committee. All right. Well, let me read this:  
   On July 2, 1999, Senate Judiciary Committee ranking member Patrick Leahy issued a statement claiming, ``I cannot recall a judicial nomination being filibustered ever.''  
   OK. Mr. President, I have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 volumes of the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD, Senate proceedings, and not every word is of the filibuster, but in each volume is a filibuster of 4 judicial nominations, both political parties, since 1968--4 out of 13. So out of 13 judges who have been filibustered on the floor of this Senate since 1968, these volumes here, 8 volumes, represents only 4 of the 13. Yet the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee says he can't ever recall a filibuster being offered. 
   As a challenge to my friend from Vermont, if he comes down and says it again, I am going to read every word of these filibusters on the floor of the Senate and filibuster these nominations by doing it. If he doesn't come  down or retract that statement, I won't. If he comes down and says he can't ever remember a filibuster taking place on the floor of this Senate, I am going to read every word of just these four. If he continues to aggravate me, I might read all 13 of them, if I can dig out the information. 
   Let's get real and understand what is happening. The names are Abe Fortas in 1968; William Rehnquist, who sat in that chair and was praised by all during the impeachment trial, was filibustered by Senator Birch Bayh. There are volumes and volumes, hundreds of pages here of that filibuster. I am prepared to read every word of it if he wants to say there have been no filibusters. 
   Stephen Breyer was filibustered; J. Harvie Wilkinson, Sidney Fitzwater, Daniel Manion in 1985, Edward Carnes, Rosemary Barkett, H. Lee Sarokin--there are 13 of them. 
   So don't tell me we haven't filibustered judges and that we don't have the right to filibuster judges on the floor of the Senate. Of course we do. That is our constitutional role. Some like it. And I have been on the other side. Listen, I wasn't in the Senate when it disapproved Robert Bork, but we lost one heck of a good judge. Clarence Thomas wasn't filibustered, but he sure was debated. I didn't like that either. But it is our right as Senators to do that. So don't criticize our right to do these things and don't say things didn't happen that did happen. 
   Now, let me move to the question at hand, which is the Ninth Circuit, where we have the nominations of Judges Paez and Berzon for the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. We need to understand this circuit is a very controversial circuit. Not only is it a controversial circuit, it is a renegade circuit. It basically is out of the mainstream of American jurisprudence. It is interesting that this circuit has been reversed by the Supreme Court--get this--in nearly 90 percent of the cases decided in the past 6 years. Let that sink in for a moment. Ninety percent of the decisions made by the circuit court in this Ninth Circuit have been reversed by the U.S. Supreme Court, the next highest court. What does that tell you about the judges on that court?

   Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, let me say to my colleague that I don't disagree with what he just said as far as the numbers are concerned. I point out that I am really referring here to controversial nominees. When a nominee has some controversy about him or her, if it gets to the floor, there are normally quite a few discussions; i.e., a filibuster. There were no votes. There was only one vote in the year 1992 on a controversial judge. That was filibustered. It eventually passed the nomination under the Bush Presidency. But it was filibustered and substantially debated. 
   That is the point I was making. Most of the nominees I listed and referred to languished for a whole year in the committee. I am not criticizing the Senator and his party for what they did then. They have a right to do that. I might not agree because I perhaps would have supported the judges. But I think you have the right to do it. I think we have a responsibility to the President of the United States duly elected by the American people. I think in our advice and consent role, we have an obligation to confirm some of those judges, especially those who are not controversial. But I think on those controversial judges, we should have the right to be able to air the concerns. 
   I don't want to speak at great length on this because I know one of my colleagues--perhaps Senator SESSIONS--wishes to do that. 
   But in the case of Paez, for example, I don't know that the American people are aware he has been involved in two decisions pertaining directly to the Clinton scandals. Why don't you get both of those decisions, the Marya Hsia case, for one, and the John Huang case? In both of those cases, the sentencing was lenient--perhaps as lenient as it could be. 
   I think those questions ought to be answered. I think we should know the answers to those questions about what happened before we put this person on the circuit court. 
   I tend to agree that to simply hold somebody up forever and never let them know how it is going to be resolved is very unfortunate for the individual. I tend to agree. But these are serious questions. When I say ``filibuster,'' I use the term in the sense of right now because the rule is pretty fairly restrictive. We have 48 hours after the motion is filed for cloture and, at the most, 30 hours after that. So we are not talking forever. But we are talking about just venting and airing concerns. That is what I am doing with both the Ninth Circuit as well as two individuals to which I will speak more directly in detail on Thursday.  
   It is not pleasant to stand here and criticize and air concerns you have about people who are wanting to move up to another level on the court. But I think we have an obligation to air our concerns. Certainly, concerns are aired about us when we run for our respective offices. 
   I think it is fair that as to judges who are appointed forever, who will be making decisions long after we are out of here, probably when our children are coming into voting age, or our grandchildren, whatever the case may be--these judges may still be here long after the President leaves--we have a responsibility to look very carefully at them. If they are active as judges and are making decisions that are being overturned almost 90 percent of the time in the case of the current court--I am not saying that would necessarily be the case of the two nominees, but the court itself has a very 
   undistinguished record, in my view.

   Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. I appreciate my colleague's remarks and will yield to him at any time. 
   I will respond briefly to my colleague because I think he is correct on the numbers. I think the numbers speak for themselves. I believe there were some 66 nominations brought through during the Bush years. This is not about the number of people. I think it is a fairly reasonable assessment to say if those nominations came through in 1992 or from 1989 through the end of the term in 1993, it is likely they were not very controversial. There was no debate, really. They were pretty much unanimously agreed to. 
   We are talking about two issues: One is the controversial nature of the judges involved; two, the controversial nature of the Ninth Circuit. Both the Ninth Circuit and the judges are in and of themselves controversial. In the case of the one vote the Democrats in 1992 brought forth, although it did win, it was a controversial nomination. I think Judge Paez, with all due respect, and Judge Berzon, are controversial nominations. Clearly, the Ninth Circuit is controversial. 
   I have agreed with the majority leader; if he chooses to accept, I have indicated I am willing to limit the debate on Thursday to about 5 hours total time on our side to discuss these nominations. I am not blocking for the sake of blocking. I am trying to make some points that I hope will result in the rejection of these nominees. 
   I will discuss this Ninth Circuit and the reversals. As I said, from 1994 to 2000, 85 of 99 decisions--86 percent--by the Ninth Circuit were reversed by the Supreme Court. 
   What kind of a record is that? What kind of knowledge of the law does this indicate when the Supreme Court could overturn 86 percent of the cases in the last 6 years and, as I said, 90 percent of the cases overall? 
   To be specific, in 1999 to 2000, 7 of 7--100 percent of the cases set down by this court--were overturned by the Supreme Court. There are four more pending now that are being challenged. I will not go into the details of each case, but U.S. v. Locke, Rice v. Cavetano, Roe v. Flores-Warden, U.S. v. Martinez-Salazar, Smith v. Robbins, Gutierrez v. Ada, Los Angeles Police Department v. United Recording Publication--all of those were overturned, all 7 of 7. 
   From 1998 to 1999, during that year, 13 of 18 of the decisions 
   of this court, 72 percent, were overturned by the Supreme Court--reversed. 
   From 1997 to 1998, 14 of 17 were overturned by the Supreme Court, 82 percent of the cases. 
   From 1996 to 1997, 27 of 28 cases were overturned, 96 percent of the cases overturned. 
   From 1995 to 1996, 10 of 12, 83 percent, were overturned. 
   And on and on and on. 
   I have the documentations of these cases. 
   The bottom line is the Ninth Circuit is notorious for its antilaw enforcement record, its frequent creation of new rights for criminals and defendants, often in the face of clearly established law. 
   These two judges we now are debating, I believe based on their own records and comments and paper trail, are going to be act the same. They will be making the same kinds of decisions. 
   It is an embarrassment to have 90 percent of the cases overturned. In my view, it shows, frankly, an ignorance of  the law, or certainly a disrespect for the Constitution in some way to get that many cases overturned by the Supreme Court. 
   The Ninth Circuit, as I said before, is a renegade circuit. It is out of the mainstream of American jurisprudence. It has been reversed by the Supreme Court 90 percent of the time, 84 of 98 cases. That is terrible. 
   It routinely issues activist opinions. While the Supreme Court has been able to correct some of the worst abuses, the record is replete with antidemocratic, antibusiness, procriminal decisions which distort the legitimate concerns and democratic participation of the residents of the Ninth Circuit. 
   To give a couple of examples of the more outrageous decisions: Striking down the NEA decency standard, creating a right to die, blocking abortion parental consent law, and a slew of obstructionist death penalty decisions. 
   The Senate, and particularly Republican Senators from the Ninth Circuit, are on record in favor of a split of the circuit they are so upset with this. In 1997, all Republicans voted against an amendment to strike a provision to split the circuit. That is how outrageous these decisions have been. Even the independent White commission recommended a substantial overhaul of the circuit's procedures; it still has not been implemented. We are adding two liberal, very activist judges to this circuit, without any of the reforms that have been called for by many. 
   The Ninth Circuit covers 38 percent of this country, more than twice as much as any other circuit. It covers 50 million people. President Clinton has already appointed 10 judges to this circuit. Democrat appointees comprise 15 of the 22 slots currently occupied. 
   I say to the American people who may be listening right now, judges impact our lives big time in the decisions they make. Citizens complain about the violence and the criminals getting out. We hear all the stories about somebody serving 5 years for murder and going out and killing somebody else; or somebody stalking, serving a little time, and stalking and killing the woman he stalked before because he didn't spend enough time in jail, over and over again. 
   This is not by accident. These are bad judges making bad decisions that cost Americans their liberties, cost them their lives sometimes. That is wrong. 
   We have an obligation in the Senate to take a good, hard look at a lifetime appointment to the circuit. The members are there forever, even when they get real old. It is pretty hard to get rid of them. This is a lifetime appointment. 
   We have a responsibility to make darn sure these judges are going to represent the views of the majority of the American people in terms of the law. I intend to do that as long as I can stand here to do it. 
   Let me briefly hit two points on the two judges in question and then make a couple of other points and wrap up. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce is officially opposed to the nomination of Paez. In Berzon's case, the nomination was described by the National Right to Work Committee as the worst judicial nomination President Clinton has ever made. 
   I am going to go into more detail on Thursday on the Ninth Circuit and its anti-law enforcement record, for its frequent creation of new rights for criminals and defendants, often in the face of clearly established law. For that reason alone, we should look very carefully and very cautiously at whom we put on that court. 
   For instance, in Morales v. California, 1996, the Ninth Circuit struck down the California State law governing when defendants could present claims during habeas corpus appeals which had not been made during the appeals in the State courts. According to the California-based Criminal Justice Legal Foundation, this holding ``opened the door to a flood of claims that would be barred anywhere else in the country.'' 
   In United States v. Watts in 1996, the Supreme Court issued summary reversals in two cases without even hearing arguments after the Ninth Circuit allowed past acquittals to be considered during sentencing. 
   This is just silliness in terms of the obvious intent of the law and the Constitution. 
   I will conclude, I say to my colleagues who may be prepared to speak, on this point. These judges are activist judges who are going to promote an agenda on the Ninth Circuit that has already been rejected 90 percent of the time by the U.S. Supreme Court. Let's not add insult to injury by putting two judges on this court, essentially fulfilling that promise of continuing that bad judicial policy. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise for the purpose of submitting a Senate concurrent resolution objecting to any efforts to expel or degrade the Holy See's current status as a nonmember permanent observer to the United Nations. It is hard to believe there are people in the world--indeed, in our own country--who wish to take away that status. 
   Throughout my tenure in the Senate and the House, I have worked to uphold the sovereignty of the United States, perhaps as much as anyone in the body. Recently, it has come to my attention that the sovereignty of the Holy See, the institution that represents the State of the Vatican City internationally, is being attacked by up to 400 nongovernmental organizations in a movement called ``See Change.'' That is S-e-e. 
   See Change is comprised of extremist groups, pro-choice groups, some extreme environmental organizations, and antireligious, atheist groups who want to take away this permanent status of the Holy See. 
   Specifically, the agenda of See Change is to pressure U.N. Secretary General Annan into revoking the Holy See's nonmember Permanent Observer status by attacking its status as the legal and diplomatic body that represents the sovereign country of the State of the Vatican City. 
   What an outrage. See Change believes it can use the smokescreen of the Holy See's unique sovereignty to silence its undisputed legal rights as a sovereign entity to voice its views on the sanctity of human life at the U.N. That is what this is about. It is about an attack on the sanctity of human life. It is an attack on the Pope for his views on the sanctity of human life. 
   Since the U.N. rules by the consensus of all members, See Change is attempting to pressure and intimidate the Holy See, the Secretary General, and other member countries of the U.N. to silence any opposition to what really is a pro-abortion agenda. 
   Currently, the Holy See is recognized by almost every nation in the world. Furthermore, the Holy See has sent and received diplomats since the 4th century and has possessed a permanent diplomatic mission since the 15th century. 
   As I stated before, a central argument that these nongovernmental organizations use is the issue of the Holy See's legally recognized authority to represent the citizens of Vatican City and the worldwide Catholic Church. 
   According to international law, sovereignty in its simplest form can be defined by a people, territorial entity, and a government with institutions that are recognized by the international community of nations. Without any doubt--since the 4th century--the Holy See acts as the legal and internationally recognized body that represents the people of Vatican City and Catholics around the world. The Holy See meets all those criteria. The Vatican State has a population of approximately 900 citizens, has a defined territory, and has institutions of government. 
   The sovereignty issue was irrefutably settled in 1929, when the Holy See and Italy signed and ratified the Lateran Treaty, which brought the Vatican City State into existence. Article 12 of this treaty states:  
   Diplomatic relations with the Holy See are governed by the rules of International Law.  
   All states have equal standing under international law. I believe the Senate needs to send a strong, positive message to reaffirm the concept of state sovereignty. If we cannot do that in this body, then I do not know what we can do. I would like to remind Secretary General Kofi Annan about his duty to uphold the principle the United Nations considers most important in its charter--the legal equality of nations, which is Article 2(1). 
   Furthermore, this legal principle says all states are not similar in their  characteristics. For example, China contains about one-quarter of the human race while the State of the Vatican City contains a little fewer than 1,000 citizens. 
   Moreover, this Nation, the United States, is exponentially larger in physical size and political stature than, say, Bangladesh; however, both nations have equal status under international law. 
   Frances Kissling, president of Catholics for a Free Choice, said the Holy See sitting at the U.N. was like ``Euro-Disney sitting on the Security Council.'' Can you imagine? Surely, any person, American or not, would recoil at the irreverence of this statement and the ignorance, frankly, of the invaluable work the Holy See has undertaken to foster peace between fellow nations. 
   Highly respected U.N. leaders, such as Dag Hammarskjold, have, in fact, recognized the unique sovereign status of the State of the Vatican City and insisted on the presence of the Holy See at the U.N. In addition, U.N. Secretary General U Thant attempted to establish an increased stability of relations between the Holy See and the U.N. 
   Catholics for a Free Choice--I use that term loosely--a leading organization in the movement to remove the Holy See from the U.N., has set forth the following statement in their own web site:  
   What place does a religious body--claiming to possess the universal ``objective truth'' and speak infallibly on moral matters--have in an intergovernmental institution like the United Nations?  
   I would like to point out that above the doors of the U.S. House Chamber are the reliefs of great lawmakers who had a profound impact on the moral and legal origins of this Nation. The most important lawmaker is Moses; his relief is placed higher, in the center of the Chamber, facing the Chair. 
   Why didn't anyone question the sovereignty of the Soviet Union and its Politburo, with the Communist ideology that it espoused, and the manner in which it imposed its will upon the satellite states of Eastern Europe under its control? I did not hear any criticism of them. 
   Should theocracies, such as Iran or even Israel, be threatened in the same manner if some extremist organization, opposed to their religious and social views, came forth? 
   The elected head of the Catholic Church, Pope John Paul II, has recently made trips to Cuba and Angola, where he was received by multitudes, millions of people, supporting his message of peace, the rule of law, and freedom represented by the Catholic Church and, indeed, by many other citizens, as well. 
   I am proud to say, in submitting this resolution, that as original cosponsors I have Senators COVERDELL, SANTORUM, LANDRIEU, HELMS, ASHCROFT, INHOFE, MCCAIN, STEVENS, and BROWNBACK. A bipartisan group has become original cosponsors. I urge my colleagues, in the name of what is right, to join with us in sponsoring this legislation.

    Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today in recognition of a gentleman who is known to many of us here in the Senate and in the House of Representatives, Mr. Jim Flanagan, who is now retiring after more than 35 years of representing electric utility interests here in Washington. 
   A graduate of St. Michael's College in Vermont, and an Army veteran who served as a guided missile instructor, Jim Flanagan worked for many years as the Washington Representative of New England Electric System, and later for Yankee Atomic Electric Company. It is in that capacity that many of us came to know Jim as a wise counselor on the intricacies of electricity and tax legislation. Jim always had a firm grasp on the issues, he often had an innovative approach to solving a problem, and he was unfailingly respectful of the political process and the difficult decisions that elected representatives face when supporting or opposing legislation. 
   I came to know Jim personally under just such circumstances. He was an advocate for licensing the Seabrook nuclear plant in my state of New Hampshire, arguably the most controversial construction project ever undertaken in this country. Throughout good times and bad, through the many legislative attempts to derail the project, Jim Flanagan stood his ground, he argued with facts not rhetoric, and he represented his company's interests with integrity and passion. We eventually licensed that plant, something I am personally proud of, and today Seabrook is one of the safest, best-performing nuclear plants in the world. Without the efforts of Jim Flanagan, that would not have happened. 
   Jim had another, equally important, side to him. Beyond the issues of the day, Jim Flanagan was a loyal friend, a gentleman who looked out for others and who would take that extra step to do someone a favor. He was a believer in young people, and took it upon himself to be a mentor to many here in Washington, including members of my staff. Many of us who know Jim know that he has a bad knee, but few of us realize that he got that bad knee teaching Little Leaguers how to slide into second base more than 40 years ago. From his hometown of Waltham, Massachusetts, to here in the Nation's Capital, Jim Flanagan cared about people. 
   In an industry that has gone through several sea changes, and in a town where people and ideas come and go, Jim Flanagan was a constant--you could always count on him. Jim will be sorely missed--some say the Edison Electric Institute will not survive without him--but he will certainly not be forgotten. Jim's wife Beth, and his two grown children Billy and Lisa, should be very proud of him.

   Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Wyoming for yielding me the time, and I thank him for his leadership in defense of the second amendment, as well as my colleague from the State of Idaho, who has been a long-time advocate of the second amendment. 
   I regret I have to stand up here again with my colleagues and defend the second amendment because we should not have to do that. I am honored to do it, but it is one of our amendments. It is No. 2 in the Constitution. 
   I find myself wondering why so many of our colleagues come here over and over again to try to take second amendment rights away. The right to keep and bear arms is one of the most fundamental rights we possess. You can't pick and choose which amendment you support in the Constitution, nor should you pick and choose what paragraph you support in the Constitution. If it is in the Constitution, we ought to abide by it and honor it. 
   The framers knew it, and that is why they placed the second amendment right up there at No. 2 in the Bill of Rights. They did not want the Federal Government to interfere with this basic right. It was part of the Bill of Rights for the people, and it was No. 2. 
   I get a kick out of listening to so many of our colleagues on the other side of the issue who, in their eloquence, can knock the second amendment down. It is interesting, though, when we hear from the folks who were actually on the scene when the second amendment was written, folks such as Samuel Adams, who said:  
   Among the natural rights of the colonists are these--first, the right to life; secondly to liberty; thirdly to property; together with the right to defend them in the best manner they can.  
   Basically talking about the right to bear arms. John Adams:  
   Arms in the hands of the citizens may be used at individual discretion for the defense of the country, the overthrow of tyranny or private self-defense.  
   These are the founders. Patrick Henry:  
   Guard with jealous attention the public liberty ..... The great object is that every man be armed. Everyone who is able may have a gun.  
   Thomas Jefferson:  
   The strongest reason for the people to retain the right to keep and bear arms is, as a last resort, to protect themselves against tyranny in government.  
   This is important business we are talking about. This was a basic right. Noah Webster:  
   Before a standing army can rule, the people must be disarmed, as they are in almost every kingdom of Europe. The Supreme power in America cannot enforce unjust by the sword because the whole of the people are armed, and constitute a force superior to any band of regular troops.  
   Richard Henry Lee:  
   To preserve liberty it is essential that the whole body of the people always possess arms.  
   With all due respect to my colleagues who speak on this issue in opposition to the second amendment, I don't think they are as eloquent or as knowledgeable, and I know they weren't there. These guys knew what they were talking about because they wrote it. So let's not talk about revisiting the Constitution and being politically correct and changing things we can't change. 
   These are the giants in history, the people who were there on the scene. Yet, in the past year or so on this floor, I and many of my colleagues hear over and over again: gun control, gun control, gun control. Some of it is enacted, which infringes on the second amendment of millions of law-abiding Americans. You cannot trample on the Constitution of the United States and stand up there and take that oath and say you are going to defend it. It is simply inconsistent. 
   Despite what history and the second amendment tell us, some keep trying to come up with new and inventive ways to subvert that Constitution. I don't hear any of these people coming down and saying we are going to eliminate the first amendment, but I do hear them saying we ought to eliminate the second amendment. 
   The gun control provisions in the juvenile justice bill that were spurred on by the tragedy at Columbine used that tragedy, frankly. There were already 20,000 existing gun laws when that happened, but the killings were not stopped. Do we think more gun laws are going to stop something such as that from happening? 
   There was a recent amendment to stop gun manufacturers from declaring bankruptcy. Down the line they come, time after time again, singling out one legal product for discrimination: guns. No other lawful industry is treated so unfairly. Fortunately, my colleagues voted overwhelmingly to reject that amendment.

   Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. They are basically saying they are going to throw these suits out. That is the gist of it. They are not constitutional. The courts recognize that. The judges said they were completely lacking any legal basis. 
   Now the President wants to license and register all guns, like automobiles, as my colleague from Idaho referred to.  The last time I checked, there wasn't a constitutional right to drive. Does anybody know about that? I don't think they knew what a car was when the Constitution was written. There is no comparison between the two issues. I never heard anything from the Founding Fathers about the right to wagons or horses during that time. I never heard Patrick Henry say: Give me mobility or give me death. He said: Give me liberty or give me death. That is because driving a car is a privilege, not a right. It is a privilege. Gun owners would love to have guns treated as cars, with no background checks, no waiting periods, no age limit; it might be a good thing. 
   Tyranny isn't always obvious. It isn't always about killing and communism and all that. Tyranny can be much more subtle, piecemeal, gradual--like violating our oath of office and voting against our constitutional rights. It happens all the time in this place. History will judge us for it; it will judge us on the basis of how many times we stood here after having taken the oath of office and then having ignored that oath. 
   The second amendment guarantees that the right to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed. If you are for gun control--and you have a right to be--then you are against the Constitution of the United States. Change the amendment if you think you can do it. But don't keep passing gun control legislation time after time after time. That is what we are doing in these proposals and laws. We are doing it quietly, without violence, and with an air of respectability, which is what troubles me--as if it is right to do it here because it is on the floor of the Senate. 
   We are violating the constitutional rights of millions of law-abiding American citizens across the country, and any way you slice it that is still tyranny. That is why I am proud to stand here, as I have done many times--and I will do it every day, if I have to, until the last day I am in the Senate--in defense of the second amendment. I am pleased and proud to support the second amendment. 
   At this point, I yield the floor.

   Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I would like to speak briefly  about two amendments that are before the Senate--the Schumer amendment on abortion and the Levin amendment dealing with the so-called gun carve-out. 
   When I took my oath of office on the floor of the Senate, I swore to support and defend the Constitution of the United States. I am amazed sometimes at the type of things we face in the Senate with amendments and bills that I find to be unconstitutional, at least the way I read it. 
   These two amendments I am referring to essentially harass Americans who are defending three of our most important constitutional rights--the right to life, which is guaranteed by the 5th and the 14th amendments, the right to free political speech, as guaranteed by the 1st amendment, and the right to keep and bear arms, as guaranteed by the 2nd amendment. 
   It is interesting, as one listens to the debate on these respective amendments, some take the position that it is OK to support the 2nd but not the 1st; it is OK to support the 1st but not the 2nd; some say it is OK to support the 1st and the 2nd but not the 5th and the 14th. But they are all part of the Constitution. Unless you are going to remove an amendment, as we did once with the 21st amendment repealing the 18th, then I do not think we have the right to stand here and say one thing is constitutional and something else is not. 
   The Schumer amendment tries to exempt abortion protesters from claiming bankruptcy. This is an amendment that unfairly targets a legitimate form of civil disobedience. I believe there are some acts for which people should not be allowed to file for bankruptcy--such willful acts that might lead to a personal injury or the destruction of property. That is not what we are talking about here. I believe most student loans, taxes, child support, and alimony payments also should not be dischargeable. 
   This amendment adding abortion protesters to the nondischargeable list under bankruptcy laws--let's call it what it is. It is nothing more than another attempt to financially bankrupt and silence free speech of those who peacefully--peacefully--want to speak out against something they believe in so strongly or oppose so strongly, and that is abortion, those who want to defend the constitutionally guaranteed right to life. 
   On a talk show yesterday, this issue came up, this supposedly Roe v. Wade rule that abortion is legal under the Constitution. If someone can find the word ``abortion'' in the Constitution, where it says abortion is legal, I will be happy to change my position. If somebody will come down to the floor and point out to me where the word ``abortion'' and the right to an abortion appears in the Constitution--of course, it does not, and if it is not in there, then any power not specifically outlined in the Constitution belong to the States and the people. 
   There is no right to an abortion under the Constitution. Roe v. Wade was a bad decision; it is an unconstitutional decision. Judges are fallible, they make mistakes, and they made a mistake when they passed that awful decision which has taken the lives of 40 million children--40 million children since Roe v. Wade passed in 1973, 40 million children who will never have the opportunity to live their dreams, never have the opportunity to be a Senator, to be a President, to be a doctor, to be a mom, a dad. Gone. We took them away, almost one-sixth of the entire U.S. population, under that decision, and it is an unconstitutional decision because a young child inside the womb or outside has a constitutional right to life. 
   Let's talk about what this amendment does. 
   Antiabortion protests, no matter how you feel about abortion, 
   is political speech, I say to my colleagues. This is political speech. They have a right to speak. I am not talking about protesters who commit violent acts or commit bodily harm to others. I am not in favor of that, nor should we tolerate that. I am talking about people standing outside a clinic holding a sign, praying, protesting peacefully. That is what this amendment is going after. People who do that are now going to be subjected to this provision on bankruptcy, an unfair provision. 
   It is political speech for somebody to peacefully protest abortion just as much as it is political speech for union organizers or urging other workers not to cross a picket line. What is the difference? Why don't we single them out? But we are not. 
   My colleague Senator SCHUMER singles out one type of protest, a protest on an issue with which he disagrees. It is not constitutional, and it is not fair. It is political speech just as much as when the NAACP enforced its boycott of southern businesses. The Supreme Court in NAACP v. Claiborne Hardware said so. We already have enough laws on the books harassing abortion protesters, including the Freedom to Access Clinic Entrances, so-called FACE, and the Racketeer-Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, known as RICO. The financial penalties under these laws are harsh, unusually harsh for one specific type of protest or protester--a peaceful protester. 
   This amendment proposes to give these protesters absolutely no way to deal with the treble damages against them under RICO. A recent RICO case against protesters who carried posters of aborted children resulted in $109 million against the pro-lifers; $109 million for peacefully protesting without harming anyone's person or property. It is outrageous. That ought to be enough to chill anyone's free speech. What is next? Free speech under the Constitution is protected. 
   Another one of the RICO cases currently pending involves a Catholic bishop and religious brother praying the rosary in their car in the driveway of an abortion clinic peacefully. 
   A pro-life gentleman in another case was standing on a walkway near an unused locked door of a clinic and was not blocking access to that clinic. 
   How much are they going to have to pay for standing up for what they believe in, such as the marchers did during the civil rights movement when they sat at the lunch counters and marched in the streets? $200 million? $1 billion? Where is it going to stop? 
   Can you imagine RICO, which was originally drafted to fight mobsters and organized crime, now being used against civil rights demonstrators or antiwar protesters, or abolitionists protesting slavery? What will we say then? We know what we would say. We would say it is wrong, and it is wrong to protest those who respectfully, quietly, peacefully protest what they believe in, which is the right to life. 
   It is a violation of the first amendment. This is a patently unfair discriminatory amendment, and it does not deserve even the dignity of being offered because it is so flagrantly unconstitutional. 
   I urge my colleagues, when the vote comes tomorrow, to vote no on the Schumer amendment. Get it off the floor of the Senate because it does not belong here. We should not be talking about unconstitutional bills on the floor of the Senate. 
   Another amendment which will be offered tomorrow is called the gun carve-out amendment, again, a discriminatory amendment against one group. The Levin amendment proposes to exempt gun manufacturers from bankruptcy laws. In other words, if you are a gun manufacturer, you cannot claim bankruptcy, you cannot be treated like everybody else. 
   Why? Because the author of the amendment doesn't like gun manufacturers. I guess he believes they shouldn't be allowed to manufacture guns. Under current law, businesses and corporations can discharge their debts through bankruptcy unless the debt is incurred through negligence or intentional misconduct. I agree businesses should be held accountable if they are so irresponsible or malicious to knowingly sell harmful products, but are we really at the point in America when we are going to say if we produce a gun, manufacture a gun, legitimately, as a manufacturer, and then if somebody gets ahold of that gun and commits a crime, that now the manufacturer is responsible? Is this where we have come in our society now, no personal accountability, no personal responsibility? 
   Why don't we do it with automobiles? Why not? You drive your 1999 Chevy down the road, you hit somebody and kill them, it must be the automobile manufacturer's fault, not you. You are behind the wheel. You can't have any accountability or responsibility. Name another product--a hamburger. There are people who say meat is bad for you.  Maybe we should hold all of the cattle growers responsible for producing hamburger. Maybe we should hold the people who work in the meat packing plants accountable. Where is the individual personal responsibility and accountability? 
   This is a discriminatory piece of legislation. Again, I regret it is here. The gun industry is selling a legitimate and lawful product. If it is banned, at least that is an honest amendment. I wouldn't agree with it, but at least it would be more honest than it is to say what we are saying, that we are going to exempt you from bankruptcy laws. It is, in fact, a product that is constitutionally protected and specifically mentioned in the second amendment. Everybody knows what it says. There is no secret. It is No. 2 on the amendment list, the Bill of Rights. The right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed, period. No qualifiers in there. It doesn't say what kind of gun; doesn't say how many guns; doesn't say manufacturer, no exceptions. It just simply says the right of the people--we are people--to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed. That is all it says. And if you have that right under the Constitution to have that weapon to protect yourself, as many do, then you ought to have the right to manufacture it. 
   This amendment encourages litigation against gun manufacturers and should be called the legislation through litigation amendment. This amendment will have the effect, as follows: If someone sues a gun manufacturer, the manufacturer's bankruptcy will not stop the lawsuit. Outrageous. Gunmakers are already being forced out of business by frivolous, illegitimate, and unconstitutional government-sponsored lawsuits against them. How much more do they have to take? This is a constitutional amendment that specifically says you have the right to keep and bear arms and that right would not be infringed. There is no gray area. It is not as if there is something we have to interpret. There is nothing to interpret. It is right there. When the founders put the ten amendments, the Bill of Rights, onto the Constitution, they made it No. 2. 
   This amendment singles out a legal industry for unfavorable treatment in bankruptcy proceedings. If successful, it is only going to hasten the demise of the gun industry. That is the purpose of it. That is what is behind this. It is the Bill Clinton agenda. It is being carried out in the Senate. Shut down gun shows. Shut down gun manufacturers. Stop the production of guns in America. Blame the gun manufacturers. Blame everybody except the person behind the gun who commits the crime. For goodness' sake, we wouldn't want to punish that person. Somebody else has to bear the blame. Maybe he had a bad childhood. It must be his father's fault, his mother's fault, the gun manufacturer's fault, the gun seller's fault--everybody but the fault of the person who uses the weapon. 
   This is what we have come to in America. It is not going to 
   stop here. If legislation such as this slips through, it will be a whole lot of things--hamburger, cars, cigarettes. How about a desk, a chair? You could hurt somebody with that chair if you hit them with it. Well, maybe we ought to sue the manufacturer of the chair. That is what it is coming to. That is how ridiculous it is. Right here in the Senate, we allow it to happen. We debate it day after day trying to stop this stuff as it comes at us in waves, unconstitutional laws. Somebody has to stand up--and some of us do--to stop it because it is outrageous. 
   Gun controllers cannot win legislatively so they litigate. That is the way to do it. They can't get the American people on their side so they get a few unelected judges on their side. There are many industries that can be considered dangerous, as I said: Carmakers, alcohol, tobacco, fast food, whatever--legal businesses. Are they being singled out in this bankruptcy bill? No, not this one, but maybe next year or next week. Who knows? Just wait. It is going to happen sooner or later. These government-sponsored lawsuits against gun manufacturers and tobacco companies are just the beginning because we have now opened the Pandora's box. We have said defendants should be held liable for damage caused by others even if the damage was totally beyond the defendant's control. 
   It goes against common sense, and that is what has served our Nation so well, common sense and individual responsibility. That is what America is about. It is not about this kind of nonsensical legislation that puts the blame and the burden on people who shouldn't have the blame and the burden. 
   I had a shotgun next to my bed as a young man, probably 7 or 8 years old. I used it. I shot it frequently. I didn't shoot at anybody. I didn't take it to school and kill anybody, nor did any of my friends who also had shotguns. Why is that? Why is it that suddenly now all this is a big issue? Because we are trying to pass the burden of responsibility on to somebody else other than ourselves. 
   We have a cultural problem in this country of the highest magnitude. It isn't about exempting the gun industry from bankruptcy laws. That is not going to get it right. Believe me, what is going to get it right is when we start exercising responsibility in this country again. 
   The Founding Fathers would turn over in their graves if they could hear this stuff. I can't imagine what Daniel Webster, who wasn't a founder, but he was sitting at the desk that I sit at right over there about 150 years ago, I can't imagine what he would think to be on this floor and debating, blaming the gun manufacturer for somebody else's crime, exempting them from bankruptcy laws. I can't imagine what he would think or Washington or Jefferson or Adams or Madison or Hamilton or any of the great founders who wrote that Constitution, what they would think. In many ways, I am glad they are not here to see it. 
   In October of 1999, an Ohio court dismissed a suit against the gun industry stating that the suit ``is an improper attempt to have this court substitute its judgment for that of the legislature, something which this court is neither inclined nor empowered to do.'' That was the City of Cincinnati versus Beretta USA Corporation. 
   In addition, court decisions in Connecticut and Florida this past December ruled that State lawsuits against gun manufacturers have no legal basis whatsoever. Yet here we are on the floor of the Senate trying to do it. The judges in those cases saw that the actions of criminals cannot be controlled by any industry. They were right. So why are we here? Because people are trying to make something happen that they know the American people don't support. So we try to do it this way. 
   I am heartened by recent polls which show that an overwhelming majority of Americans believe that gun manufacturers should not be blamed for crimes committed with guns. Even if you think there are 
   too many guns, even if you believe that, you better think very carefully before you vote on this as to what might be next. Should we be responsible for the actions of our adult children if they commit a crime? Where is it going to stop? 
   If there is even one single successful judgment against the gun industry, those who seek to destroy it, and along with it the second amendment, will have a ready means to do so. That is what will happen. So we have two amendments that propose to violate the constitutional rights of the American people, two politically motivated proposals that target politically incorrect targets for unfair treatment; dump on them while they are down. Let me again remind my colleagues of the oath we all took right there at the desk to defend and support the Constitution and abide by American standards of fairness and democracy that have served our Nation so well. Vote no on these two amendments. No matter how you feel about the two issues in question, vote no on these two amendments.

   Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, on the case of Elian Gonzalez, the young Cuban boy who is now in Miami, I support Senator MACK's private relief bill to give Elian Gonzalez U.S. citizenship. This is something I believe should be done. It is not necessarily going to stop him from being sent back to Cuba, but it is the right thing to do. 
   I met Elian Gonzalez personally and the great uncle in Little Havana in Miami on January 8. I took the time to go meet Elian. I wanted to talk with him myself. I wanted to look him in  the eye and find out how he felt about the ordeal he went through. Unfortunately, the Attorney General didn't take the time to do that. Elian wasn't important enough for the Attorney General or any of the Attorney General's representatives to meet with him. 
   On January 6, Attorney General Reno said:  
   If there is any information that we are not privy to--I never say I won't reverse myself. I try to be as open minded as I can. But based on all the information we have to date, I see no basis for reversing it.  
   ``It'' being the decision to send Elian back to Cuba. 
   On January 8, after meeting with Elian Gonzalez, I wrote Attorney General Reno to request a meeting to discuss new information I obtained regarding Elian Gonzalez. 
   In that meeting on January 8, at the request of the Gonzalez family, I sat with Lazaro Gonzalez, Elian's great-uncle, in a relaxed, informal, nonstressful setting. I spent 2 hours speaking with Elian and members of his family there at the home. Based on those discussions, I have concluded that there are four areas that are critical to this case I would like to briefly share with my colleagues before this vote. 
   One, and most important, Elian does not want to go back to Cuba. He does not want to go back to Cuba. You might say he is 6 years old and he doesn't know what he wants. If his mother had lived, we would not be talking about this case. He would have his right to be here. She died. She can't speak for him. But he spoke. He made it very clear to me. On several occasions, I looked Elian right in the eye and asked him directly, ``Do you want to go back to Cuba?'' He repeatedly and emotionally said, ``No, no, no.'' In Spanish, he said, ``Ayudame, por favor,'' meaning: Help me, please; I don't want to go back to Cuba. 
   The second point is very important. Ms. Reno was not interested in hearing it because she never responded to my request. She totally ignored a U.S. Senator's request for a phone conversation, even though I know for a fact she didn't have the information I had to share with her. Elian's father was aware of his son's planned departure from Cuba. Listen carefully to what I am saying. Elian's father is being held in Cuba today against his will. They are not reporting that frequently, but he is. He was aware of his son's departure. Elian's paternal grandfather, who lives in the same household with Elian's father, notified relatives in America that Elian and his mother departed Cuba and to be on the lookout for them. 
   Third, there is reason to believe that Elian's father intended to defect at a later date with his current wife and child. I was told by Elian's great-uncle that two cousins of Elian's father, now in America, were told directly by Elian's father 5 or 6 months ago that he intended to leave Cuba with his new wife and child. 
   Fourth, there is reason to believe that intimidation tactics are being used by the Castro government on Elian's father, Juan Gonzalez. Reports from family members say Juan has been removed from his home and is not speaking of his own free will and may even be under psychiatric care. 
   Let me just say that this is a close-knit family. I am not a family member or a personal friend of the family, but I took the time to sit down and talk with them. I didn't talk with the grandmothers. But the grandmothers, Juan Gonzalez, the uncle, and family members are a family. People say, ``Why are you politicians getting into this?'' Because the mistake was made by this administration by not insisting that the family come here from Cuba and sit down and talk about this as a family. They can't do it because Fidel Castro won't let Juan Gonzalez out. They won't let him out. Even the appointed nun, the go-between, arbitrator, the impartial person who was sent to set up the meeting between the grandmothers and Elian--she is a friend of Janet Reno's--she said the same thing: They are under pressure and Elian should not go back. 
   So the integrity of American immigration policy rests on due process and fairness. I was shocked to learn that INS Commissioner Doris Meissner never requested a meeting with Elian and never heard his voice. 
   Now, maybe some of you sitting out there who are going to vote on this and maybe some of my friends out in America across the land can be callous enough to say you don't care what that little boy thinks, he is 6 years old, what does he know. Let me tell you what he knows and what he has experienced. He sat in an inner tube. You know what that is; it is a small tube that is big enough to fit inside of a tire of an automobile. That is an inner tube. He floated around in that inner tube for 2 and a half days in the open sea--sometimes 30-foot seas--and bounced around out there, and 
   he survived. He was picked up by a fisherman. He lived, but he watched his mother die. The last words his mother said to the two other survivors were, ``Get Elian to America.'' That is what he went through. 
   As an adult, how would you like to go through that--to sit on a tube in 30- or 40-foot seas for 2 and a half days, floating from the north of Cuba to Fort Lauderdale, FL, and go through that when your mother tried to get you here for freedom, and you would send him back without so much as even giving him the opportunity to talk. If we do that, then what has this country come to? 
   The fisherman who picked him up out of the water gave an emotional comment about it. He said, ``I am an American. I was born here. I plucked this kid out of the ocean. If you send him back, you are doing the wrong thing and I don't know what happened to my country.'' The equivalent would be, during the Cold War a mother with a child in her arms races to the Berlin Wall, shots are fired, and she tosses her child over the Berlin Wall to freedom. Would we send him back? Apparently so, under this administration. 
   This isn't about father and son separation; this is about bringing the father and the grandparents and the rest of them here to America where they can decide without the pressure of Fidel Castro. Let's find out what they can say and do without Fidel Castro there. Had Elian's mother lived, right now Elian would be enjoying due process under the Cuban Adjustment Act. Elian Gonzalez, my colleagues, is being punished because his mother died. I don't want to punish Elian Gonzalez for his mother's death. I can't believe any of my colleagues would want to do it either. 
   This case is about one thing: the best interest of a little boy who sought freedom from Communist Cuba with his family. Sending Elian back to Cuba without due process and allowing Castro to exploit this brave, courageous kid who drifted helplessly at sea for 2 days on an inner tube in a desperate search for survival and freedom would not only be an outrage, it would be the grossest miscarriage of justice I can think of in my lifetime. Yet we have people in this very body who say we should do just that. 
   I met with the other two survivors, a young married couple. When the boat sank, Nivaldo Fernandez and Arriane Horta were with Elizabet when she was on the boat that made the trip to the Florida coast. She told them, ``Please make sure that my son makes America. Save my son. Please see that he gets to the United States.'' Nivaldo showed me his leg, which was scarred because he was bitten by fish while floating off the coast of Florida. You can still see the effect this had on him, and he is an adult. 
   Yet this little boy who was so brave--can you imagine, after enduring all of that, when people would come to his house --when I came, and I am a pretty big guy, he wanted to know: ``Hombre malo'' or ``hombre bueno''? Good man or bad man. He wanted to know whether I was a good guy who was going to be nice to him or bad guy coming to take him away. 
   Can you imagine this poor little boy sitting in that home, when somebody comes to the door, thinking the INS is going to take him out of his home in the dark of night and take him back to Cuba? That is what he is living through now after enduring 2 and a half days in the open sea. This is a child, and he doesn't have any rights? Baloney. Yes, he does have rights. We should be protecting them. 
   As I said, I met another brave individual, Donato Dalrymple, the fisherman. He was very touched. He asked me personally to help Elian because he told him the same thing: ``I don't want to go back to Cuba.'' 
   Based on this new information that Elian's father was planning to come,  and some other information, I asked the Attorney General to meet with me or take a phone call. She refused either. Not only did she refuse to do that, she put on an artificial deadline that caused the family more consternation and the Cuban American community more concern by having this arbitrary deadline that says: 
   OK, on January 14 you go back. Then they rolled that back. That is fine. It is very nice to say, OK, we have a deadline; but how would you like to be little Elian, knowing that and wondering what happens on midnight of January 14? Where is the concern for this brave little kid? 
   I support this private relief bill which grants Elian immediate U.S. citizenship, and I further support allowing the courts to make this decision with the family, without the pressure of Fidel Castro, and I hope the Senate will support me on that. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I too, would like to recognize Senator SPECTER, for his tremendous work and skillful leadership and sensitivity in bringing the Veterans Millennium Health Care bill (H.R. 2116) to the floor. As a veteran myself, I can assure you that this bill means a great deal in providing for the health and welfare of our veterans both in my state of New Hampshire as well as those veterans throughout the country. I congratulate Senator SPECTER's leadership on issues that are of particular importance to our veteran community. 
   If I may also ask the senator to clarify the transition clause of Section 207(c) of the bill. Does the Senator mean that provided that state home grant applicants covered by the transition clause follow all applicable laws and regulations in effect on November 10, 1999, that the Secretary of Veterans Affairs shall award grants to all applications remaining unfunded for fiscal year 1999 priority one projects first, then proceed to awarding grants to priority one projects as outlined and in the order in which they appeared in the Department of Veteran Affairs Fiscal Year 2000 priority list as covered by Section 207(c) of the bill, prior to awarding grants to any other applicants?

   Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I would like to recognize and thank Senator SHELBY and Senator KERREY for their leadership and support with regard to the POW/MIA sections of the Intelligence Authorization Act that originally passed the full Senate earlier this year. I am pleased that one of these sections has remained largely intact in the conference report we are now adopting. That provision (Section 308), will require a declassification review of two assessments of Vietnam's cooperation on the POW/MIA issue which were conducted in 1998. One of these assessments was prepared by my office and the other by the National Intelligence Council. Much of the information in both of these documents does not require continued classification, and I believe the interests of the POW/MIA families and our nation's veterans is best served by having as much information as possible in the public domain concerning Vietnam's performance on the POW/MIA question. As the Chairman will recall, there is a provision in Section 308 that allows the Director of Central Intelligence to withhold from declassification the names of living foreign individuals who have cooperated with U.S. efforts to account for missing personnel from the Vietnam War. I wish to make clear that the Congressional intent with respect to this provision was related to individuals identified in the National Intelligence Estimate as ``cooperative'' with U.S. officials in Hanoi. Indeed, this specific area of concern was cited by the Director of Central Intelligence in a letter to the Senate on August 3, 1998. However, this is not meant to include information pertaining to the two former Vietnamese officials who are alleged to have prepared the so-called ``1205'' and ``735'' documents which we received through the Russian government which were reviewed in both of the above-referenced assessments. Is that the Chairman's understanding as well?

   Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. I thank the Chairman for that clarification. 
   Mr. President, I also want to take this opportunity to express by profound disappointment that the other section concerning release of POW/MIA information to the Congress was not adopted by the Conference because of Member opposition from the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. This provision, previously adopted by the full Senate this summer with the support of the Chairman and Vice Chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, required our intelligence agencies to provide to Congress, within 120 days, a list of POW-MIA related documents that are still classified. This list would help the Congress exercise oversight on the POW/MIA issue on behalf of the families of missing personnel and our nation's veterans. I fail to see why such a reasonable provision could not have been adopted with the full support of the Conference. I plan to revisit this matter in the coming months, and would appreciate having the Chairman's views as to how we might proceed with respect to this important matter.

   Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, today, I rise in strong support of H.R. 1887, legislation that overwhelmingly passed the House to ban interstate commerce in videos depicting acts of cruelty against animals. Specifically, this legislation would ban the interstate shipment of videos that record women, often wearing stiletto heeled shoes, slowly crushing live animals to death. Animal victims include hamsters, kittens, puppies, and even monkeys. Viewers purchase these videos for $15 to $300 and apparently derive some sexual gratification from watching these horrifying act of animal cruelty. 
   The Humane Society of the United States, which brought this issue to the attention of law enforcement agencies, has discovered that there are more than 2,000 video titles that include crushing. One such business in California has labeled itself Steponit. 
   I really have never heard of more bizarre, more perverse, and more sickening acts that this. This goes way beyond the bounds of even of our most wild imaginations. 
   The people in this industry should face serious penalties for their sick acts of cruelty. Fines and jail time are appropriate societal responses. 
   State anti-cruelty statues are not adequate in addressing this problem. It has been difficult for enforcement agents to determine when the practice occurred, where it occurred, and who has been involved, since feet and the crushing of the animals are the only images on the video. 
   Here is a case where a restriction on interstate commerce in these products--in the age of the Internet, which facilitates this trade--is absolutely necessary. We have to stop the purveyors of this filth, indecency and cruelty. 
   This is not the harmless act of few people out of the mainstream. This is an extreme antisocial act, where innocent animals are harmed for the profits of producers and the mere sexual gratification of viewers. 
   In additon to the harm that the animals endure, there is an additional reason to crack down on this industry. There is a well-established link between acts of violence against animals and later acts of violence perpetrated against people. People sometimes rehearse their violence on animals before turning their violent intentions against people. The FBI and other law  enforcement agencies have long recognized this linkage. 
   What sort of message do we send to children to allow these videos to be commercially traded and then viewed? It has to be desensitizing for children and adults to see these destructive images. There surely is a major impact on society when people lose their empathy and express their violent impulses on a larger social stage. 
   Mr. President, H.R. 1887 passed the House by an overwhelming vote of 372 to 42. I understand that it is currently being held at the desk. It is my hope that Senate will stop this industry in its tracks by passing this legislation.

    Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Christine Russell, who last week left my staff after seven years as my legislative assistant and policy advisor on environmental, transportation and energy issues. She married Alex Wells on October 30th in South Carolina. She and her husband will be living in Harrisburg, PA. 
   As my primary staff member responsible for the Environment and Public Works Committee, which I now chair, she was one of my chief staff liaisons with New Hampshire municipalities in need of Federal assistance, and with the Federal and State agencies responsible for these important issues. Chris was always there for me, and for the people of New Hampshire. She will be terribly missed. 
   Christine came to my office from the National Association of Manufacturers a few years after I came to the Senate. She brought with her the skills to balance private sector and public sector concerns regarding environmental, energy and transportation issues. Skills which I found invaluable during her years in my office. 
   In addition to her outstanding policy skills, Chris provided a warm smile and enjoyable attitude to my Senate office. She was professional, intelligent, and articulate--but it was her enthusiasm and energy that was most infectious. Chris was dedicated to her job, the U.S. Senate, and the people of New Hampshire. Alex is a very fortunate man, indeed! 
   Chris, on behalf of the people of New Hampshire and my entire staff, best wishes in all of your future endeavors. You deserve the best that life has to offer.

    Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to honor Gary W. Puryear of the 94th Regional Support Command, for his leadership and vision in creating one of the most comprehensive development and land exchange projects in support of the soldiers, sailors, and marines in the United States Armed Services. 
   Mr. Puryear established himself as a leader while developing a state-of-the-art home and training center for twenty-one units of the United States Army, Navy, and Marine Corps Reserve in Manchester. He spearheaded this innovative program, assisting the Department of the Army in saving over $2.5 million dollars in repair and maintenance costs. His efforts also saved the Navy over $350,000 per year in lease costs, and fostered the expansion goals of both the Manchester Airport and Saint Anselm College. 
   Mr. Puryear also actively worked to publicize the Army Reserve's Modular Design System (MDS), highlighting its cost effectiveness and speed, and subsequently reaffirming the importance of pursuing a process of multiple and mutual success. 
   Mr. Puryear's efforts largely contributed to creating this state-of-the-art training center. As a result, 1,091 soldiers now occupy the center as a residence and a training site. The center itself indirectly helped expand the Manchester Airport as a vital shipping and transportation link by freeing up prime development space for airport related activities. 
   Gary Puryear has proven himself an innovative leader who is committed to the United States Armed Forces, and the community as a whole. He has assisted in saving the taxpayers thousands of dollars annually, enhancing the readiness of our armed forces, and solidifying a long-term military presence in Manchester and Londonderry. It is an honor to represent him in the United States Senate.

    Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Mark Aldrich on the occasion of his retirement, on November 30th, from the United States Senate after 20 years of service. 
   For the past nine years, Mark has served as my State Director, confidant and community leader. Mark also served my predecessor, Senator Gordon Humphrey, as a loyal and dedicated staff member for more than a decade. 
   Over the years, I have had the pleasure to travel thousands of miles with Mark, through the Great North Woods, the covered bridges of Orford and Cornish, and the scenic mountains of the Monadnock Region. Mark and I drove in his old Cadillac *.*.* sharing stories and helping the people of New Hampshire. 
   Together we worked to secure federal funding for the expansion of the Manchester Airport, the newly completed Reserve Center in Londonderry, the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard, the development of the Pease Air Force Base and so many other important projects that have helped to fuel the New Hampshire economy. Mark should take great pride in his many fine accomplishments, especially in promoting economic vitality in the North Country and throughout the state. I know that the many businesses and communities he helped will miss him, as I will. 
   Mark is the kind of leader that we all aspire to become. He mixed humor with guidance, making each of his fellow staff members feel comfortable while sharing his advice and expertise. He energized the office allowing for greater productivity and a fierce sense of loyalty.  
   As Mark embarks on this new journey, I wish he and Connie every happiness life has to offer. I know he will enjoy his leisure time with Jonathan exploring the trails of the White Mountains and I am sure his coaching skills will continue to flourish as he cheers on Molly and her teammates at Concord High. And the engagements with his band ``Souled Out'' will continue to experience success. I hope Mark will enjoy this poem by New Hampshire poet, Robert Frost. 
 The woods are lovely, dark and deep. But I have promises to keep, And miles to go before I sleep. And miles to go before I sleep.  
   Mark, it has truly been an honor to call you my friend. It is a pleasure to represent you in the United States Senate. 
   I wish you God speed and good luck in your future endeavors.

    Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to honor three individuals who define heroic action and the selflessness of many of the citizens of the State of New Hampshire. While only teenagers, these three individuals acted with maturity and grace in saving the life of Carol Black of Newton, Massachusetts. 
   Andy French, Eddie Wilson, and Libby O'Flaherty, all of Gilford, New Hampshire, were enjoying a quiet afternoon on the lake when they spotted Carol Black. Upon seeing the body of the unconscious woman in the water of Lake Winnepesaukee, the three youths selflessly came to her aid. They did not hesitate before saving her, a testament to their individual honor. 
   Mr. President, in a society where we too often hear stories of youth violence, it is refreshing to hear of heroic deeds such as this. Too often, the actions of a few that have wandered from the fold overshadow those who have acted with continual kindness. 
   It is one of the deepest pleasures for me to be able to rise today to honor these three individuals from my home area. Their kindness and dedication sets a precedent for other youth to follow. It is an honor to represent them in the United States Senate.

   Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Major Clinton E. Crosier, an Air Force Fellow on my staff, and commend his superior performance throughout this past year as a key member of my national security team. 
   Major Crosier has been on active duty since 1988. During his 11-year career he has served as an Executive Office and Operations Management Officer, during which time he deployed to Saudi Arabia during Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm. He has served as a Satellite Operations Flight Commander, overseeing the operations of part of the Air Force's multibillion dollar constellation of military communications satellites; and also as a Missile Operations Crew Commander and Flight Commander, supervising the training and certification of over 200 of the nuclear launch officers serving as the backbone of America's nuclear deterrent. 
   During his career, his outstanding performance and professionalism has been recognized by his selection as the 90th Missile Wing's Staff Officer of the Year; 28th Air Division's Company Grade Officer of the Year and Lance P. Sijan Leadership Award Winner; three-time selection as unit Company Grade Officer of the Year; Unit Evaluator of the Year; and Unit Flight Commander of the Year. Major Crosier is also a Distinguished Graduate of the Air Force's Operations Management Officer school and Squadron Officer School, and graduated first in his class during satellite operations training and missile operations training. 
   Upon arrival at the Pentagon just over a year ago, Major Crosier was tasked with building the Air Force's first ever Air Command and Staff College program for Congressional staff. This program, known as ACSC, is a 44-week graduate level program designed to provide mid-career officers with an in-depth understanding of the principles and application of air and space power. This was the first time in history this program had been offered to Congressional staff. In this capacity, Major Crosier was directly responsible for the graduation of 18 staff members from both the House and Senate in a ceremony last month over which the Secretary of the Air Force presided. During this ceremony, Secretary Peters heralded the Capitol Hill ACSC seminar Major Crosier built as a ``very important tool to cement the important partnership between the Air Force and the Congress ..... that will serve indefinitely as a bridge between our two great institutions.'' Additionally, Secretary Peters praised Major Crosier personally by describing his effort as an ``astronomical benefit'' to the Air Force. 
   Most recently, Major Crosier was one of only 10 officers in the entire Air Force selected for the prestigious Legislative Fellowship program, through which he came to work as a member of my personal staff. The Air Force's Legislative Fellowship program is designed to identify the Air Force's highest caliber performers through an extremely competitive selection process. These individuals are then provided an in-depth education in the legislative processes of Congress through a one-year assignment in a Member's office, to prepare them for future senior leadership positions in the Air Force. Throughout the past year, he has been an invaluable resource to me, and a credit to the United States Air Force. 
   Due to his vast experience in space and missile operations, Clint was able to provide me with expert assistance in my capacity as Chairman of the Strategic Force Subcommittee on Armed Services, providing technical expertise on a myriad of advanced space operations and missile defense programs. He quickly became an expert on dozens of programs critical to national security. Major Crosier also was responsible for performing topical research and preparing me for dozens of Armed Services Committee hearings, and provided a vital role on a number of wide ranging issues from the Department of Defense Authorization and Appropriations Bills to the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty and the Vieques Weapons Range. 
   Major Crosier has been an outstanding addition to my staff, and has served with the highest degree of integrity and distinction. His performance has earned my highest praise, and he has distinguished himself as one of the top military officers I have had the great privilege to know during 16 years in Congress. Major Crosier has demonstrated himself to be one of the Air Force's brightest future senior leaders. As Major Crosier departs the Senate to serve on the personal staff of the Secretary of the Air Force, I extend my sincerest appreciation for his valuable and professional service. I will not only miss Clint's knowledge and efficiency, I will also miss his enthusiasm. Clint is an honorable and dedicated individual. I wish he, his wife Shelle, and their children, all the best in future endeavors.

Mr. President, on behalf of Vice Chairman REID and other Members of the Ethics Committee, I am pleased to submit the ``Senate Ethics Procedure Reform Resolution of 1999'' for Senate consideration.

   Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. I appreciate the Vice Chairman's comments and, more importantly, acknowledge his assistance and support in bringing these Reform measures before the Senate. This Resolution is the product of a mutual and supportive effort on both sides of the aisle to improve the Ethics Committee's procedures. 
   Let us briefly describe the changes included in this Reform. First, as Members may recall, the 1993 Study Commission was charged with studying the Ethics Committee's procedures and recommending needed changes. Such a Commission arose, a large part, out of the universal observation by those who had participated in Ethics Committee proceedings that: (1) the procedures were unnecessarily confusing and complex; and (2) that this created the potential for unfairness to those affected and contributed to a lack of confidence by those observing the process. In its hearings, the 1993 Study Commission heard from three distinguished former chairs of the Ethics Committee, attorneys who have practiced before and with the Ethics Committee, and experts on ethics issues and procedures from academia and public organizations with interests in legislative ethics. The resulting Commission Report, issued in 1994, recommended several changes designed to enhance public confidence in the Senate's ability to fulfill its constitutional duty of self-discipline. 
   The Reform Resolution now before the Senate includes those Commission recommendations specifically designed to simplify and streamline the Senate Ethics process. These reforms are intended to expedite the handling of ethics complaints in a way which should make the process fairer and more understandable. By eliminating the current unnecessary, multi-stage process for fact gathering, and using a single phase ``preliminary inquiry'' for that purpose, the process will make a lot more sense, and should save some time. If, after the facts are in, there is substantial evidence with causes the Ethics Committee to conclude that a violation may have occurred, then changes would be issued, and an ``adjudicative review'' of the evidence would ensue. This simplified process will be the same, whether the complaint is sworn or unsworn, and there will continue to be no procedural formalities surrounding the filing of a complaint with the Committee.

   Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Beyond reprimand, and reserved for only the most serious cases, both the current and the reformed process contemplate that the Committee may make recommendations to the full Senate for Senate discipline. Under the current process, with respect to Members, the Committee has recommended or the full Senate has considered, either alone or in combination: financial restitution, disgorgement of funds, referral to a party conference for attention (regarding seniority or positions of responsibility), denouncement, censure, condemnation, and expulsion. The current system's use of a variety of terms, each of which has been considered by Senate historians to be censure, has resulted in some confusion about the Senate's intent in disciplining its Members. The proposed process would provide the Committee with a uniform set of recommendations for use either alone or in combination: financial restitution, referral to a party conference for attention (regarding seniority or positions of responsibility), censure, and expulsion. Absent  extraordinary circumstances, the intent would be to use uniform terminology in recommending discipline to the Senate, although the Committee would retain needed flexibility in this regard. The proposal would also add financial restitution to the possible recommendations respecting a Senate officer or employee; suspension and dismissal are currently included. 
   Finally, Mr. President the Reform Resolution would amend the Ethics Committee's enabling resolution to expressly provide for the Committee's educational function.

   Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, this bill would redesignate the Coastal Barrier Resources System as the ``John H. Chafee Coastal Barrier Resources System.'' 
   As you all know, my friend, the late Senator John Chafee, worked tirelessly to ensure that the natural resources of this nation are protected. I can think of no tribute that is more fitting than to rename the Coastal Resources System after him. Whenever we discussed the Coastal Barrier Resources Act it was not unusual for Senator Chafee to comment that ``There are times around here that we all do things right, and this is one of them.'' 
   Senator Chafee is considered the father of the Coastal Barrier Resources Act, and it epitomizes the common sense approach he took in protecting our environment. When Senator Chafee introduced this legislation in 1990 he recognized that the federal government didn't have the financial resources to buy this land, as well as recognizing the need for Congress to find a unique and different way to protect our sensitive coastal barriers. 
   The Coastal Barrier Resources Act does just that. The act prohibits the Federal government from subsidizing flood insurance, and restricts other federal expenditures and financial assistance, such as beach replenishment, that encourage the development of our coastal barriers. All to often taxpayers are asked to subsidize the rebuilding of homes in these sensitive storm and flood prone areas not just once, but two, three, even four times. Restricting funding for Federal programs will minimize loss of human life, reduce wasteful expenditure of Federal funds, and protect the natural resources associated with coastal barriers. 
   As I said last week on the floor, this act is vintage Chafee: balanced, fiscally prudent, and environmentally protective. 
   The Coastal Barrier Resources System protects approximately 3 million acres and 2,500 shoreline miles from development subsidized by the federal government. Development of coastal barrier land decreases their ability to absorb the force of storms, buffer the mainland, and provide critical habitat to numerous plant and animal species. The devastating floods of Hurricane Floyd are yet another reminder of the susceptibility of coastal development to the power of nature.  
   Senator Chafee was instrumental in reauthorizing the legislation in 1990 and had recently introduced a new reauthorization measure. By renaming the Coastal Barrier Resources Act after Senator Chafee, this legislation honors the invaluable contributions the Senator made to the environment during his tenure in the Senate.

   Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. In closing I would like to leave you with a quote from President Teddy Roosevelt that Senator Chafee used in 1990 when he introduced the bill:  
   The prosperity of our people depends on the energy and intelligence with which our natural resources are used. It is equally clear that these resources are the final basis of national power and perpetuity.  
   I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.

   Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, there have been a number of my colleagues who have spoken about a wonderful man and a good friend and colleague, Senator John Chafee. I will take a few moments to talk about John Chafee the friend, John Chafee the legislator, and the man who served as a role model for all in public service, regardless of the partisan affiliation, ideology, or views on any particular issues. 
   I happened to be in New Hampshire yesterday morning--ironically, discussing the possibilities of attending a function in New England honoring Senator Chafee--when I heard the tragic news of his passing. It was, indeed, a shock. I saw John in his wheelchair on the subway after the last vote on Friday. He was engaged in conversation with some constituents, visitors to the Capitol. I didn't interrupt him because I didn't want to interrupt that conversation. I wish I had. That would have been the last opportunity to say goodbye to him. 
   My thoughts and prayers are with his family, with Ginny and the children and the grandchildren, but also with Senator Chafee's very devoted staff, both on the Environment and Public Works Committee and in his personal office. 
   Others on the floor have reviewed Senator Chafee's record of achievements. It is an inspiring record. Others have dwelled on it extensively. It stands in stark contrast to what many Americans today think about politics, politicians, and political leaders. 
   I want to emphasize the qualities of public service and patriotism that motivated John Chafee. In the spirit of Jimmy Stewart, who believed that good leaders should occupy the offices here, John Chafee was in that tradition. As a young man of 20, John left college to enlist in the Marine Corps after the attack on Pearl Harbor. He fought at Guadalcanal, and after that he resumed his studies. After the war, he earned an undergraduate degree from Yale and a law degree from Harvard. He again served his country in the Korean conflict where he commanded Dog Company, a 200-man rifle unit in the first marine division. That is not easy duty. 
   After serving his country with honor in the military, he embarked on what would be another honorable career for John Chafee; 6 years in the Rhode Island House of Representatives, including the rise to the post of minority leader. He ran for the Governor of Rhode Island and was elected by a 398-vote margin in 1962. His constituents recognized John Chafee's leadership, integrity, and intelligence by rewarding him with two more terms as Governor--in both cases by the largest margins in the State's history. 
   In 1969, President Richard Nixon appointed John Chafee as Secretary of the Navy where he served with and was succeeded by our mutual friend, JOHN WARNER. John Chafee was elected to the Senate in the bicentennial year of 1976 as the first Republican to be elected Senator from Rhode Island in 46 years. His work as a Senator was rewarded with reelection in 1982, 1988, 1994, and he would have been reelected again in 2000 had that been in the cards. 
   He was looking forward to spending more time with Ginny and the grandchildren. I think that is the greatest tragedy of all, that they will miss a wonderful husband and a wonderful father and grandfather. 
   I first got to know John Chafee when I was elected to the 
   Senate in 1990. I served on the Environment and Public Works Committee where he was a ranking member and then chairman. We worked together on all of the environmental bills that come down the pike: Clean Air Act, Clean Water Act, the Safe Drinking Water Act and, most importantly, on Superfund, where we shared the frustrations of working and fighting the good fight, where we had differences on the other side of the aisle. But John was a patient legislator in spite of the frustrations, in spite of the times he could have been angry--politically angry--at those on the other side of the aisle. He never was. One couldn't get him to say one cross word about anybody on that committee no matter what. He wouldn't do it. 
   I was taking the subway and saw John talking to a person, perhaps posing for a picture. And sometimes the people were not sure who he was. One time a person asked: Do you know which Senator that was, sir? And I said: I do. That is Senator John Chafee. They said: What do you know about him? I said: He is the nicest man in the Senate, and don't forget it. 
   He was. He looked after his colleagues. 
   In 1996, when I ran for reelection, there were attacks on my environmental record that were not justified.  He came to my aid in New Hampshire and spent a day up there with me deflecting those attacks. Although he was criticized for doing it, he did it anyway. He was glad to do it. I will never forget it. 
   Both New Englanders, Chafee and SMITH, both veterans, both committed to protecting the environment, John a far greater leader than I in that regard, we did have a lot in common. We disagreed on issues, as well. If there was anyone who ever lived who perfected the art of disagreeing without being disagreeable, it was John Chafee. Many times I marveled at his ability to participate in a heated debate, in close quarters, sometimes without losing his composure and his good humor. One of the qualities I will always remember about John was his demeanor and good humor. 
   When I first came to the Senate--and Senator WARNER referred to this yesterday--one of his favorite expressions was, ``Oh, dear.'' Senator WARNER spoke eloquently about it yesterday. I had a personal experience with ``Oh, dear'' when I first came to the Senate in 1990 and we reorganized the Senate. 
   I didn't know people that well. I was getting pressure from some Senators on one quarter to vote for one person for leadership and others were suggesting I vote for Senator Chafee. As I went into the last moments before the vote in the Republican conference, I still had not made up my mind. 
   Finally I decided. My decision was to vote against Senator Chafee. So I said: I have to tell him this. My conscience would bother me too much if I didn't walk up and tell him before the vote because it was a secret ballot. I walked up and I said: John, I just want to let you know I decided to vote for the other guy, and he just said, ``Oh, dear.'' And he lost by one vote. 
   It really was the beginning of a long friendship which I will always cherish. There will be a lot of tributes to Senator Chafee over the next several months. None of them will do justice to the memory of his legacy. I would like to propose one myself today, as one small way to deal with that legacy. As we all know, throughout his career John fought for the protection of our natural resources. One initiative many Americans may not appreciate that was sponsored by Senator Chafee in 1982 was the Coastal Barrier Resources Act. I know enacting that into law was one of the proudest moments of Senator Chafee's tenure here. 
   For the benefit of my colleagues who are not familiar with this act, its primarily purpose is to restrict Federal expenditures and financial assistance that encouraged the development of undeveloped coastal barriers. Development in ecologically critical coastal barriers along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts not only damaged fish and other natural resources but often resulted in the loss of human life as well. 
   The act permitted Federal expenditures for energy resource development, military activities, channel improvements, conservation activities, emergencies, navigation aids, and scientific research projects. It permitted, but did not require, interested private landowners to enter the system on a voluntary basis. The Coastal Barrier Resources System comprises approximately 3 million acres and 2,500 shoreline miles. 
   This act was vintage Chafee. It was balanced. It was fiscally prudent. It was environmentally protective. I can think of no more fitting tribute to Senator John Chafee than to name the system created by that legislation the John H. Chafee Coastal Barrier Resources System. I intend to introduce legislation to that effect and look forward to its quick passage with the support of my colleagues. 
   In closing, I say to Ginny and to the children and grandchildren, our thoughts and prayers are with you. All of us are proud to have called your husband, your father, and your grandfather, a friend. He was a decent, wonderful man. I am proud to call him a friend.

   Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, it is my intention at some point later on in the proceedings of the debate on this partial-birth abortion ban bill to offer an amendment that would bring some sunshine and light into the abortion industry in terms of disclosure. 
   As I indicated last night in a rather lengthy presentation on the Senate floor, the sale of fetal body parts is illegal. Ironically, President Clinton himself signed the legislation banning that. Yet it is taking place in America. I think we need to look into this matter in great detail. 
   The purpose of my amendment is to provide that we have disclosure so we know who is selling, who is buying, what is being sold, and whether or not laws are being violated. 
   As many of you know, several years ago, in 1994 and 1995, I took to the floor of the Senate on this legislation. As a matter of fact, I wrote the original partial-birth abortion ban bill. I took a lot of heat for it. I received a lot of attacks from the media, a lot of attacks from some colleagues, and certainly from the abortion industry. 
   President Clinton came to my State and campaigned against me in my reelection efforts, as did Vice President GORE and Mrs. Clinton. They had a regular celebrity group up there making pretty much of a big deal out of the fact that I had been this ``extremist'' who stood on the Senate floor and exposed partial-birth abortion. I didn't even know it existed 6 years ago. 
   The interesting thing to me is, why is it that those of us who are opposed to this barbaric procedure are ``extremists'' and those who perform it are not? They are ``thoughtful liberals,'' I guess. It is amazing what we can do with semantics and, with a little disingenuous discussion, how we can change the debate in this country. 
   Senator SANTORUM and others have talked extensively on what happens in a partial-birth abortion. I am not going to go into all of that. But I will say this: It is infanticide. It is killing children in some cases outside of the womb. 
   We have a child who is 90-percent born but for the head, and under the so-called Roe v. Wade law, unfortunately, that child, because the head has not come through the birth canal, can be killed by using a barbaric means of needle and sucking the brains from the child. It is a horrible procedure which has been discussed here in great detail. It is amazing to me that we are ``extremists,'' we who are exposing it, and those who do it are not. But that is the way we are with semantics. 
   When I came down to the floor several years ago, I brought a little plastic medical doll. When the press was finished writing about it, it was a ``plastic fetus.'' I was accused of showing aborted children on the floor of the Senate when in fact I showed a picture of premature babies who had been born who had lived. But as many times as I corrected papers such as the New York Times, they still couldn't get it right. 
   This debate has been pretty harsh at times. Frankly, it is very graphic. My goal is not to try to revisit all of that but to try to get into your heart, if I cannot your face, on this issue. We all have very strong feelings about this. But I have to believe most Americans are appalled, sickened, angered, and 
   disgusted that such a brutal act would take place in this country to be carried out against a defenseless child. Yet we condone it. 
   As I said last night on the floor, if every SPCA in America announced tomorrow they were going to kill all of their dogs and cats, unwanted cats and dogs, puppies, kittens, by using this procedure with no anesthetic, putting a needle to the back of the head and sucking the brains from those animals, I guarantee there would be a firestorm. There would be people protesting in front of the SPCA. But we do it to our children. 
   Then we say we are surprised when our children go out and kill other children, when they get into trouble with drugs and all the other things that sometimes happen to our children in society. What are we telling them? What is the message we are giving them? We are telling them: You are worthless. We tell them: You go to school today, Johnny, be a good boy, and we will abort your sister with this horrible procedure while you are in school. That is what we are telling them. 
   I was told from a very early age that when you are around children and talk, they listen. They hear you. A lot of times, you ask a 3-year old. I can discuss this or that, and they don't care what I am saying. They are not paying any attention. They are playing with their toys. You would be surprised at what they hear. 
   I tell you what they are hearing when they hear this debate. They are hearing: We are worthless; nobody cares about us. We can just go ahead and abort you, kill you--you are just to be discarded in a trash can--and go right on about our business, keep working on our jobs, having a nice vacation and our 401(k)s; everything is fine. We just go ahead and kill babies. 
   The vast majority of partial-birth abortions are performed on healthy women with healthy babies. Dr. Martin Haskell, who is the leading practitioner of partial-birth abortions, said: I will be quite frank; most of my abortions are elective in that 20- to 24-week range, and, in my particular case, 20 percent are for genetic reasons and 80 percent are purely elective. 
   Mr. President, 24 weeks is 6 months. 
   I received a telephone call in one of my offices several weeks ago. A 9-year-old girl relayed to my staff this message: 
   I want to thank the Senator for being pro-life. I'm 9 years old and I would like him to tell America when he has the chance that my mother gave birth to me prematurely when she was 5 months pregnant. I'm here talking to you now. Please tell your fellow Americans not to kill children like me. 
   That is pretty powerful stuff. 
   When President Clinton held his press conference and said he had five women at the press conference who had all undergone health-saving partial-birth abortions, one of the women later  involved in that press conference admitted her abortion was not necessary at all. As far as her health was concerned, it was not medically necessary. She said on a radio show soon after the press conference:  
   This procedure was not performed in order to save my life. This procedure was elective. That is considered an elective procedure, as were the procedures of all the women who were at the White House veto ceremony.  
   The sad truth is we will pass this bill; that is the good news. The bad news is it will be vetoed again for the third time by this President because we need 67 votes to override it and we don't have them. That is sad because thousands more children are going to die in the next few years because President William Jefferson Clinton won't sign this bill--thousands--and they will die brutally. We are responsible for it in this Senate because we can't get 67 men and women with the guts. Does it really take guts to stand up, go down to the well and say, aye, to ban this horrible procedure? We don't have them. And Bill Clinton has the pen. That is the Constitution. 
   I want everybody to know, three votes, maybe four--probably three--will decide whether thousands of children live or die. Hopefully, we keep that in mind as the debate moves forward. 
   I don't enjoy talking about abortions and about killing children. Why are we on the Senate floor doing this? Let me state why. Roe v. Wade was passed in 1973 that said anyone can have an abortion any time they want for any reason. Over 4,000 babies, 4,100 to be exact, die every day from legalized abortion; not from partial-birth abortion, to be fair, but from abortions. Many of them are partial-birth abortions. 
   When I first took the floor on this issue several years ago, I was told it might be a dozen or two dozen at the most, in extreme cases--hydrocephalic babies and other horrible deformities were the only times they were aborting. I was knocked by some, certainly in the media, that I made a mountain out of a molehill, this was not prevalent in our society, and why was I doing all this. 
   Now we find from the admission of their own people who perform the abortions that partial-birth abortions are very frequent. I will point out in a few moments why they are frequent. I will point out some of the dirty little secrets of this industry. It will shock Members. It shocked me. 
   Mr. President, 40 million children have died since 1973, since Roe v. Wade, from abortion--not partial-birth abortion but all abortions. There are 260 million Americans. Roughly one-seventh, about 15 percent, of America's population has been executed through abortion; never to be a mom, never to be a dad, never to be a doctor. Who knows. Maybe one of those kids could have been a scientist who found a cure for cancer--never have 
   the chance to be happy, never have a chance to fulfill their dreams. In the Declaration of Independence, Thomas Jefferson said we have the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. Down the drain. They didn't have a choice. 
   I hear a lot about choice in this debate. What choice do they have? It would be interesting to have in the gallery some of the 40 million. They could be sitting up here today. I wonder how they would vote on this bill if they could vote. I think the vote would be different. I don't think there is any question about it. 
   Sometimes we make judgments about why a woman, mother, should have a right to have an abortion. I am reminded of a story I mentioned last night on the floor. I will mention it again because I know some missed it. I ask this question. Answer silently. If you knew a woman who had three children born blind, then she had two more children born deaf, a sixth child born mentally retarded, and she was pregnant again and she had syphilis, would you recommend she have an abortion? If you said yes, guess who you just killed. Beethoven. He made a pretty fair contribution to the world, as I recall, but we would have killed Beethoven. How many Beethovens have we killed in those 40 million? How many great baseball players such as my colleague presiding, have we killed? How many entertainers? We will never know. But we did it. We did it. 
   One of the things about America, people want to blame somebody else. My kid gets in trouble; it is not my fault; it is somebody else's fault. 
   We are responsible for this. We go to work; everything is fine. But don't worry about those 40 million kids--gone. Mr. President, 95 percent of those abortions are used for birth control. They were totally elective. One to two percent are done because the life of the mother was threatened or she was perhaps raped or some other horrible thing. That means that more than 38 million abortions are performed for reasons that boil down to one word: Convenience. It is convenient, isn't it? How convenient it is. Mom was too old; mom was too young; mom was in high school; mom was in college; mom needed to work. 
   Who knows. I want to speak directly to any woman out there now listening to me who may be pregnant with an unwanted pregnancy. There is help out there. One does not need to do this. Do not listen to those who say that is the only alternative. There is another alternative. If anyone wants help, there are professionals to help. Call my office or the office of any other pro-life Senator. We will steer anyone to the right people to get that help. I beg women to do it. They will be glad they did when they look back 10, 15, 20 years from now. They will be glad. 
   I had the privilege of helping to raise funds for a home for unwed mothers, a clinic in Baton Rouge, LA, from a woman who is a saint on Earth. Her name is Dorothy Wallace. She saved 10,000 women since 1973, advising them to choose life. 
   If you want something emotional, attend one of her meetings and see those 10-, 12-, 15-year-old boys and girls sitting there in the audience applauding Dorothy Wallace. You can have that experience too, I would say to any young woman out there; we can help you. There are professionals who will help you get through this. Choose life. 
   Let me say to the three or four Senators we need, who might change their votes--I am always an optimist; you never know--pick up your grandchild, or your child, if you are that young. Most of us are too old to have young children in here--not everybody. But pick up your own children, hold them in your arms, and ask yourself this question: How close is that little child in the birth canal that you are voting to kill, how close is that child to that little grandchild of yours you are now holding? Six months? Six years? I don't know. But look at that little grandchild. He or she has feet, has a face or body. So does that little child being executed in a partial-birth abortion. 
   I am going to talk for a few moments on the subject of my amendment, which is on the marketing and sale of fetal tissue from aborted babies. This is a gruesome story, but I want to tell you, it is happening. I say to my colleagues, this is happening in America, and it is disgusting. It is illegal, it is immoral, and it is unethical. If somebody says, What does that have to do with partial-birth abortion? in my amendment we will find out whether partial-birth abortions are being used, in fact, to sell babies' body parts. 
   Like partial-birth abortion, fetal tissue sales are morally and ethically reprehensible. It is a practice I hadn't heard of until recently. I couldn't believe we did it. But it does show how far this industry has gone beyond the ethical boundaries that even most pro-choice Americans believe is legitimate. Also, like partial-birth abortion, this industry has taken a practice, the selling of fetal body parts, which is illegal under Federal criminal law, and has created a loophole to allow them to do it. There is a loophole in partial-birth abortion, too. I coined the term ``head loophole'' because, you see, if the arms or the toes or the trunk or the leg or anything else exits the birth canal, it is not a baby yet. Somebody created a loophole, legal mumbo-jumbo. It makes lawyers rich and kills children. 
   Ironically, if you turn the baby around--and they have done that; the abortionists do turn the baby around, so it is a breach birth, so the head is last--by doing that, under the law of Roe v. Wade, they can kill the child. If it is the other way around and the head exits first, they cannot. Is the head less baby than the torso and the legs and the toes? You be the judge. 
   Stabbing a baby in the back of the head is murder, infanticide. Call it whatever you want; that is what it is. It is done for convenience. We are  going to pay a severe price for this one day. The bottom line is, they call it medicine. Are you kidding me? 
   Let's go back to the sale of body parts and how it relates here. Look at this chart. We see a woman walking into an abortion clinic. She is obviously pregnant. She is in distress. She is emotional. She is mixed up. ``What do I do? I don't want this child. I am in a mess.'' Let me tell you what happens when she comes in there. 
   In a room adjacent to where the abortion is to be performed 
   usually, or someplace on the premises, is a person called the wholesaler or the harvester of the child's organs. This is what is going on in this industry. That person or persons--represented here by two organizations, Opening Lines and Anatomic Gift Foundation--sit there. They have a work order in their hands. 
   Bear in mind the brutality and the gruesomeness of this. Here is this woman obviously pregnant, obviously in distress, sitting there. I don't know whether they have a one-way mirror or a one-way glass or what. Perhaps they just come in, cruise in, take a good look at her to see if she is healthy. But they have a work order. They have already done this. They did prep it up. You now find out this woman has a normal fetus; she is not sick; the baby is fine. That is what they find out. 
   While she is still pregnant with a living child, still going through the turmoil of an abortion decision, they have a work order on her blood type, on how pregnant she is, what body parts they want. I am going to prove all that to you in a moment. That is the brutality of it. Then they make some kind of deal. They say it is fee for service, but it is selling body parts--I will go into that for a moment--the buyer or buyers, universities, government agencies, pharmaceutical companies, NIH, private researchers. This is against the law, and I read the law last night. 
   There are four illegal and immoral things that happen with this issue. 
   The first is, the current law prohibits receiving any valuable consideration for the tissue of aborted children, but it is happening. 
   Second, live births are occurring at these clinics. Live births are occurring at these clinics. It is the law of every State, when a live birth occurs, to save the life of that child if possible. But this is not happening either. Our tax dollars are being used to fund Planned Parenthood and NIH. On the one hand, if you are pro-life, you are funding Planned Parenthood with your tax dollars, and on the other hand you are funding the research on aborted children. 
   We will go down and finish this chart. Let's go through the steps. The buyer orders the fetal body parts from the wholesaler; that is, the buyer, the university, and so forth. The clinic provides the space for the wholesaler to procure the body parts. The wholesaler faxes an order to the clinic while the baby is still alive inside the mother. The wholesaler technicians harvest the organs--skin, limbs, et cetera. The clinic donates fetal body parts to the wholesaler who, in turn, pays the clinic a ``site fee'' for access to the babies. Then the wholesaler donates the fetal body parts to the buyer, and then the buyer reimburses the wholesaler for the government retrieving the fetal body parts. 
   That is a bunch of gobbledygook that means nothing but one thing--the sale of little babies chopped into pieces. This whole process is being thought out and carefully calculated while this woman is sitting there in the clinic. 
   Tell me the abortionists care about the welfare of a woman. Some estimates say the market for this is in the $420 million range. Some say it is as high as $1 billion. 
   I know it is difficult for those in the galleries to see it, but on television you will be able to see. This is a price list for body parts. I want you to understand what is happening here. This clinic, where this young woman in trouble goes in an agonizing, gut-wrenching decision as to whether to have an abortion or not, has a price list they are going to provide to the marketer for her baby's body parts even before she gets there. 
   In addition, they have a work order prepared on her as to what it is that is her background, what parts we can provide. Then they tell us this is just fee for services. If it is fee for services, why is it $600 for an intact cadaver and $325 for a spinal cord? I am not a doctor, but I assume it takes a lot more time to extract a spinal cord from a 2- or 3-pound baby than it does to put a cadaver in a box and mail it somewhere. 
   We have a brochure. I will read directly from the brochure. The brochure is the Opening Lines. Those are the sellers. Here is what the brochure says:  
   We have simplified the process for procuring fetal tissue. We do not require a copy of your approval of summary or of your research, and you are not required to cite Opening Lines as the source of tissue when you publish your work.  
   I guess not; it is against the law.  
   If you like our service, you will tell your colleagues, word of mouth. We are very pleased to provide you with our services. Our goal is to offer you and your staff the highest quality, most affordable, and freshest tissue prepared to your specifications and delivered in the quantities you need when you need it. We are professionally staffed and directed. We have over 10 years experience in tissue harvesting and preservation. Our full-time medical director is active in all phases, and we look forward to serving you.  
   That is what is given to the wholesaler while this poor woman sits there deciding whether or not to have an abortion. It is a great country, isn't it? 
   Let me explain to you how this all works directly from the horse's mouth. I am going to quote from a woman we will call Kelly. She was a wholesaler. She was a buyer. She said:  
   We were never employees of the abortion clinic. We would have a contract with an abortion clinic that would allow us to go in and procure fetal tissue for research. We would get a generated list each day to tell us what tissue researchers, pharmaceuticals and universities were looking for. Then we would go and look at the patient charts.  
   Then we would go and look at the patient charts. 
   Kind of like going out and looking at a steer on the hoof, isn't it?  
   We had to screen out anyone who had ..... fetal anomalies. These had to be the most perfect specimens we could give these researchers for the best value that we could sell for. Probably only 10 percent of fetuses were ruled out for anomalies. The rest were healthy donors.  
   That is showing a lot of compassion for the woman, isn't it? 
   Let me talk a little bit more about what other things happen in this clinic. The abortionists are having problems. It is not fun to be an abortionist anymore. The pro-life advertising and, frankly, the wake-up call to doctors and physicians have shown that abortions are declining in this country. This $300 to $1,000 they are going to charge that woman who walks in is not enough. They cannot live on that anymore. They have to make money from the fetus, from the aborted child. 
   What happens? Here is what the abortionists are saying, their own observations:  
   Abortion has failed to escape its back-alley associations ..... [It is the] dark side of medicine ..... Even when abortion became legal, it was still considered dirty.  
   And on and on. 
   One abortionist said:  
   [Abortion is] a nasty, dirty, yukky thing and I always come home angry. 
   Organized medicine has been sympathetic to abortion--not abortionists.  
   What had to happen is they had to come up with another way 
   to make money, and they just did: selling body parts. 
   Warren Hern is the author of the most widely used textbook on abortion procedures. Dr. Hern says:  
   A number of practitioners attempt to ensure live fetuses after late abortions so that genetic tests can be conducted on them.  
   Hello? Are you listening? Live fetuses should be ensured. It is Dr. Hern's position that ``practitioners do this without offering a woman the option of fetal demise before abortion in a morally unacceptable manner since they place research before the good of their patients. 
   That is a dirty little secret you are not hearing about. 
   In talking about live births, I said last night on the Senate floor, I have worked this issue for 15 years. I have witnessed the birth of my three children. It was the most beautiful thing I will ever experience. But this brief paragraph I am going to read you now is the worst that I have encountered in my lifetime of working on this issue. How anybody can sit anywhere watching and hearing what I am going to say to you now and say it is all right to allow this to continue in this country is beyond me. But it happens, and it is  going to happen tomorrow and the next day and the day after that until we stop it. 
   Listen to this from a woman who witnessed this:  
   The doctor walked into the lab and set a steel pan on the table. ``Got you some good specimens,'' he said. ``Twins.'' The technician looked down at a pair of perfectly formed 24-week-old fetuses, moving and gasping for air. Except for a few nicks from the surgical tongs that had pulled them out--  
   That, my colleagues, could very well be a partial-birth abortion--  
   they seemed uninjured. The technician-- 
   The technician is the buyer of the body parts--  
   said, ``Wait a minute, there is something wrong here. They are moving. I don't do this. That's not in my contract.'' 
   She watched the doctor take a bottle of sterile water and fill the pan until the water ran up over the babies' mouths and noses. Then she left the room. ``I couldn't watch those fetuses moving, she recalls. That's when I decided it was wrong.''  
   If that is not murder, can somebody please tell me what it is? What is it? Do you realize what we are doing in this country? We are aborting and murdering our posterity. 
   Here is a headline from a transcript from a TV station in Columbus, OH, April 20, 1999:  
   Partial-birth Abortion Baby Survives 3 Hours. 
   A woman 5 months pregnant comes to Women's Medical Center in Dayton, Ohio, to get a partial-birth abortion. During the 3 days it takes to have the procedure, she began to have stomach pains and was rushed to a nearby hospital. Within minutes, she was giving birth. 
   Nurse Shelly Lowe in an emergency room at the hospital was shocked when the baby took a gasp of air. [Lowe said] ``I just held her and it really got to me that anybody could do that to a baby ..... I rocked her and talked to her because I felt that no one should die alone.'' The little girl survived 3 hours. 
   Mark Lally, Director of Ohio Right to Life believes this is why partial-birth abortions should be banned.  
   We have a chance to do it right now, today, ban it, stop it, and we are not going to do it because we are going to fail to get three or four people to say enough is enough. 
   How much more can we take? 
   Abortion isn't something that just happens early in pregnancy. It happens in all stages of pregnancy. And it is legal under Roe v. Wade. Some States have banned them. Give them credit for that. 
   But we have the chance right here. A vote means something for a change around here. This isn't about a budget. It is not about how much taxes you are going to pay. It is not about whether you are going to get your Social Security check. It is about life. It is about whether or not a baby is going to die tomorrow and another one and another one. We can stop it with three or four votes, if three or four people have the courage to say enough is enough. 
   My God, Jill Stanek, the nurse at Chicago's Christ Hospital, has openly admitted that live births occur at her hospital, live births from abortions. The hospital staff offers comfort care which amounts to holding the child until it dies. There is testimony after testimony of it, live birth after live birth. I am not going to go through it all. It is pretty bad. 
   One little quote here:  
   ``Once a fetus is born, it's no longer a fetus, it's a child,'' said George Annas, a professor of health law at the Boston University School of Public Health. ``And you have to treat it that way.'' 
   Aborting a viable fetus is against the law in most States unless the mother's life or health is in danger. ``If you're not sure, you can't do it,'' Annas said. 
   Nurses at Christ Hospital give ``comfort care'' to the aborted fetuses. 
   ``Their skin is so thin you can see the heart beating through their chest,'' said nurse Jill Stanek. ``It's not like they kick a lot and fight for air. They're weak.''  
   This is going on in this industry every day. As I speak, children are dying. And we can stop it right here with four of you changing your votes. What is the big deal? You are going to lose a couple of votes from the abortion industry? Hey, those votes are worth the sacrifice for these children. 
   The ``dreaded complication''--that is what they call it. The ``dreaded complication''--oh, my God, we have a live child. What are we going to do? 
   I tell you what they do. They drown them in pans. They leave them in linen closets, gasping for air hours at a time, and sometimes, if there is somebody with some compassion in the place, they will hold them in their arms until they die. 
   This is America--the ``dreaded complication.'' 
   You know what some of the abortionists say?  
   Reporting abortion live births is like turning yourself in to the IRS for an audit. What is the gain?  
   You know: Sure. Hey, we had a live birth here. My goodness, that is embarrassing. 
   Now we have come to this; not only do we have a live birth, if we let it die, we can sell its body parts, and we can make a fortune that we could not make off the woman because she could not afford to pay me. That is what we are doing. 
   I am going to expose this filthy, disgusting fraud as many times and as often as I can. I am going to get the sunshine into this industry. I am going to get to the bottom of it; and I am going to stop it, if it is the last thing I do. And it may be, but I am going to do it.  
   You have to have a feticidal dose of saline solution. It is almost a breach of contract not to. Otherwise what are you going to do? Hand her back a baby that's been aborted and has questionable damage?  
   Another one says:  
   If a baby is rejected in abortion and lives, then it's a person under the Constitution.  
   I witnessed it. Gianna Jessen was aborted. She is now 26, 27 years old. I saw her sing ``Amazing Grace'' before 1,000 people 4 or 5 years ago. She said: I forgive my mother. She made a mistake, and I forgive her. But please, help other mothers get through this so what happened to me doesn't have to happen to somebody else. 
   Change your votes, colleagues--four of you. Let's once--just one time--let's beat President Clinton on something. He has gotten away with everything--everything. He always wins. We never win against him. Just one time, let's override his veto. 
   This guy says:  
   I find late abortions pretty heavy weather both for myself and for my patients.  
   I guess it is heavy weather; it is real heavy weather. 
   I want to go back to these charts. This is an emotional experience. Anybody who can't be passionate on this issue when we are talking about the lives of children--and all we need is four or five votes on the floor of this Senate to stop this killing; that is all we need. 
   Look here. These are the charts. What does it say? NIH, that is where this stuff is going. It is illegal, but it is going there anyway; and we are paying for it. 
   Do you know what it says here? Ten minutes from the fetal cadaver, within 10 minutes they want it on ice. Nobody could get a cadaver on ice in 10 minutes--unless it is a live birth or a partial birth. And I will prove it to you. 
   One method of killing children is saline. That has to go into the amniotic sack and poison the baby. Another one is D&E, where you chop the child to pieces with an instrument in the womb so it comes out in so many pieces the nurse has to assemble them all in a towel to be sure all the pieces are there so there is nothing left inside the woman. The third method is one here called digoxin, DIG, where the needle goes into the heart of the baby and dissolves the organs. That is a nice way to die. 
   Let me ask you a question. Those of you, those three or four of you that I pray to God will get on this vote, let me ask you a question: If you are buying body parts, and you need one of those body parts to do research can you take a body part that has been hacked to pieces in the D&E method? No. You know it. 
   Can you take a body part from some baby who has been poisoned with saline or had their tissues dissolved from digoxin? No. 
   There are only two methods left: partial birth and live birth. That is where they are getting the tissue. Wake up, America. That is where they are getting the tissue. And here is the proof right here. Here is the work order: ``Please send list of current frozen tissues.'' ``No digoxin donors.'' They are telling them: Give us a live birth. Give us a partial birth. We don't want any babies like this. We can't use their organs. 
   This is happening in America, and I am sick of it. And I am sick of losing  every year. ``Prefer no DIG.'' Over and over again, the requests would mention the tissue must be fresh. It is over and over again. You see it everywhere. 
   Here is another one: Remove specimen and prepare within 15 minutes, 10 minutes. 
   Ladies and gentlemen, the truth is, you cannot get this kind of tissue the way they want it without a live birth or partial birth. 
   That is a fact: Dirty little secrets, in a dirty, disgusting industry that is profiting at the expense of women who are in a horrible situation, and then selling the body parts--the ultimate humiliation of this poor aborted child--and we cannot get 4 people, we cannot get 67 votes on the floor of the Senate to override this President. 
   What would Daniel Webster, at whose desk I sit, say? What would our founders say? What would Jefferson say, who said life first, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness? I could go on and on. 
   I am going to stop because I am mentally exhausted, to be candid about it. There is sexual abuse of these women. They are lying there on the table, and people are making mocking remarks about their genitalia. I could go on and on with stories about it. It is disgusting. 
   I am going to shine the light into this industry, and I am going to expose it. I am going to stop it. If I have to do it myself, I am going to stop it. If it is not an amendment, it will be a bill; whatever it takes, it is going to provide for full disclosure. It is going to put the light into those clinics, and we are going to find out about this stuff. We are going to stop it. 
   Everything else is regulated in this country. You can't do anything without the Government being on your back. Then let's put the Government on the backs of the abortion industry, for crying out loud: Any entity that receives human fetal tissue obtained as a result of an induced abortion shall file with the Secretary of HHS a disclosure statement. Let's find out who is buying, who is selling, and what is happening. 
   Oftentimes in these clinics, a young woman comes in; she is pregnant and needs an abortion. She is presented with a form, which she is asked to sign, that says that her baby can be chopped up and sold. 
   We get two stories out of the abortion industry. They say: Now, look, this woman is in a distraught emotional state. We are here for her health and safety and her good emotional state. We are not going to put this form in front of her. We will do it after she has the abortion. 
   I hate to give my colleagues the bad news, those of you who support this god-awful procedure, but they want the baby within 10 minutes. So unless they are going to wake her up out of whatever state she happens to be in, they don't have time to do that then. They do it before. That is what they do. They are going to tell you they don't, but they do. 
   Here is some proof for you. The name is changed to protect the innocent. 
   On July 1, 1993, Christy underwent an abortion by--fictitious name--John Roe. After the procedure, Roe looked up to find Christy pale with bluish lips and no pulse, no respiration. Christy's heart had stopped. There are no records that her vital signs were monitored during the procedure. Additionally, Roe was not trained in anesthesia and the clinic had no anesthesia emergency equipment or staff trained to handle an anesthesia complication. Paramedics were able to restore Christy's pulse and respiration, but she was left blind and in a permanent vegetative state. Today, she requires 24-hour-a-day care and is fed through a tube in her abdomen. She is not expected to recover and is being cared for by her family. Christy had an abortion on her 18th birthday. Happy birthday, Christy. 
   Any hospital in America would have had licensed anesthesiologists who were capable of stopping that from happening. But it didn't happen. For those of you who say, well, I guess she must have, she could have signed that card--really? In a vegetative state, you think she signed the permission slip? 
   I have her permission slip here. It was signed on June 29, 1993. Does anybody think she signed that in a vegetative state? She was brought in there, and she was told--the language was pretty gruesome in there--what we can do with your baby after you are finished with the abortion. She signed it. Not only that, she said: I understand I will receive no compensation for consenting to this study. Study? It is a study? It is chopping the baby up into God knows how many parts and sending it off to some research laboratory. She doesn't get a dime out of it, and they make probably $5,000, when added all up. That is what is happening. 
   I say bring a little sunshine in. I have two options on this proposal--one, to offer an amendment to this bill. I want to be honest about it. I don't want to do anything at this point to stop this bill from passing, nothing, not even this amendment, if that is what it takes. So it will either be an amendment, if we gain votes; if we can't gain and we lose votes as a result of it, I will prepare a bill. But I will not stop on this issue. I will not stop until the light shines in on this disgusting industry. 
   It is amazing. We go after the tobacco people. What bad guys they are. Somebody smokes a cigarette, and somehow everybody else is to blame but the guy who smokes it. So we go after the tobacco company, fine them billions. This is a heck of a lot worse than that. If they can go after the tobacco companies, then we can go after these guys. That is exactly what I am going to do. Be prepared out there because I am coming. I am not going to stop until the light shines in on this. 
   I will close with one final plea. Several times on my side of the aisle I have made a personal appeal to the five or six Republicans who refuse to support the ban on partial-birth abortions. I have asked privately, please change your vote, please change your vote and save lives. Two times we voted on this and the President vetoed it, and two times I couldn't switch those votes. I understand vote switching. I don't like it when I am asked to switch mine. But it is not about the budget and taxes and health care or anything else; it is about life. We are going to save lives if four Members change their votes. 
   I make another appeal that I hope, for once, will not fall on deaf ears: Please consider changing your vote on this bill. Let's pass this thing with over 67 votes, so President Clinton can have his little veto ceremony and we will override it. That is the day I am looking forward to in America. And then, whether it is on this bill or some separate bill, we are going to shine the light into these abortion clinics. We are going to find out what is going on, and the American people will know. 
   So be prepared. If you have any documents to hide, you had better hide them. We are coming after you. I have had enough of it. Live births and partial births, killing children coming into the world, drowning babies in a pan--I have had enough of it. You can defend it, if you want to, and go ahead and vote to defend it. Not me. I am coming after you. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, Senator BOXER and I made an attempt to come to accommodation on this amendment. We were not able to do that. 
   As you heard from my presentation on the floor, we know that fetal body parts are being sold in violation of law. Abortions may be induced in certain ways, such as possibly partial birth, or perhaps even live births in order to have good fetal body tissue to sell.  
   This is a serious problem. Clearly, it is a big industry. 
   This amendment requires disclosure of certain information prior to the transfer of any of this fetal body tissue or parts in induced abortions. That is what it does. It is against the law to sell fetal tissue for research. It is against Federal law. 
   This amendment allows HHS to track these transfers to enforce current law. You can donate tissue, but you can't sell it. It is being sold. We need the sun to shine in on this industry to find out what is happening. 
   It protects the privacy of all women undergoing abortions and the doctors providing them. 
   But this is something that is occurring within the industry. It is a very elaborate network of abortion providers getting those body parts to a wholesaler who then in turn is selling those body parts to universities and other research institutions. It simply let's the light in. That is all it does.

   Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. I ask the Senator if he is aware, during the time a few years ago when I stood on the floor and debated this issue, as well, that there were a number of people who said this was only happening a few times a year; some said as few as 15 or 20 times a year; some said, well, maybe it happened a couple hundred times a year, that it was the exception rather than the rule; it was usually when there was an anomaly? 
   Is the Senator also aware, we began to receive testimony from inside the abortion industry itself, which indicated--from those who had performed them--that this, indeed, was not the case, that we found that in about 80 percent of the cases, if not more, the child was perfectly healthy? So the idea that these were performed in only a few cases, when the child was in a so-called anomaly, if you will, is clearly untrue. 
   I would also ask the Senator from Pennsylvania, is he aware that there is numerous medical testimony, much medical testimony to the effect of how one partially delivers a child, and then restrains the child from exiting the birth canal? And how does that, in fact, help the safety, the health, or even to promote the life of the mother? Is the Senator also aware that on numerous occasions doctors have said, it doesn't? 
   As a matter of fact, I wondered if the Senator was aware that when President Clinton had several women down at the White House a short time ago after one of these override votes that he is so good at, he also indicated that these were people who had 
   ``needed'' these for their own health. Then we found one particular case of a woman by the name of Claudia Ades, who appeared by telephone on a radio show in which she said during the course of the show: ``This procedure was not performed in order to save my life. This procedure was totally elective. This is considered an elective procedure, as were the procedures of all the other women who were at the White House veto ceremony.'' 
   So I think the Senator would probably agree with me that this was orchestrated and used to promote this terrible procedure which, as the Senator has so eloquently described, is infanticide, is the killing of children. 
   And to think that somehow you are basically coming to the conclusion that this is OK, based on the part of the child that is outside of the birth  canal. I did not hear whether the Senator pointed this out, but is the Senator aware that if you were to turn the child around, and the head would exit first, that would be illegal under the law? That child could not be killed in this way. Yet 90 percent of the child is still inside the mother's body. 
   So it is an outrageous procedure. I want to compliment him for his leadership and look forward to joining him a little later on in the debate.

   Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues, the Senators from Ohio, Mr. DEWINE, and Alabama, Mr. SESSIONS, for their kind remarks. It has been a long, long struggle, and we are still not there yet. It is very frustrating to this Senator, who initially came to the floor in the mid-1990s, the early 1990s, in 1994 and 1995, where I found out these kinds of procedures were occurring, the so-called partial-birth abortions. I was shocked and I could not believe that in America we would be doing anything like this. This is America, I thought, we can't be killing children inches from birth. It makes no sense. 
   So I sought answers and talked to a number of people, including a nurse who had witnessed them. After getting all of that information together, I decided to write a bill banning partial-  birth abortions. Here we are. Each time we have passed it here, it has been vetoed by the President of the United States, regretfully. I think it has been two or three times now. There will be another veto coming if we pass it again. But initially, when we started, we only had 25 to 35 votes on the floor because we were told it was only four or five times a year. Then we were told it was maybe 15 times a year. As the years progressed, we found out this is on demand and is not strictly for abnormalities at all but, rather, on demand, for any reason, if a woman chooses to have such a procedure. 
   So it has been a long struggle. As I listened to the debate--and I have been on the floor all day listening to my friend, RICK SANTORUM, the Senator from Pennsylvania, who has done such an outstanding job on this issue. He is very passionate. You need to be passionate on this issue. I don't know how anybody can come down on the floor of the Senate and talk about this issue and not be passionate. We are killing unborn children who are in the process of exiting the birth canal. That is what needs to be understood. I ask my fellow Americans and my colleagues, don't we have better things to do than that here in America? 
   I am proud to say that I, to some extent, exposed this horrible procedure, establishing that it did take place. I am proud to say that I exposed it for what it is--infanticide, or murder. That is what it is. We are killing children as they exit the birth canal, and we are putting all kinds of labels on this process. We are saying all kinds of things to cover up what is happening. I remember--how well I remember--the incredible amount of flack I got for standing on the Senate floor with a plastic medical doll. The liberal press called it a plastic fetus. There is no such thing. It was a medical doll. And with a pair of scissors, I demonstrated how this process worked because I thought the American people needed to know what was happening. 
   I was terrorized, if you will, by the press, bashed, called a ``right-wing extremist,'' and ``out of the mainstream.'' Of course, those people who commit these acts of violence against these children are not extreme in the eyes of the media, which is fascinating. 
   President Bill Clinton personally came to my State, as did Vice President Gore, as did Mrs. Clinton, and campaigned against my reelection in 1996 on this issue. It was ugly; it was nasty; it was brutal. But, you know, for every one of those arrows that I took, I said to myself, it is all worth it because these children can't speak for themselves. 
   They do not have the opportunity to stand here on the Senate floor. They don't have a representative here unless we do it for them. They don't get a chance to say I would like to be born. They don't have that opportunity. 
   So I am proud to take every arrow they can throw, shoot, or whatever they want to do. I take it as a badge of honor. And I am glad to do it. 
   I got an incredible amount of flak from the media on this to the extent that they have distorted what I said. It is interesting to read ``mainstream'' respectable papers such as the New York Times and find that they cannot get it right. We called a number of times to correct these papers and reporters to tell them that the things they were saying I did I didn't do. 
   For example, they said, as I indicated earlier, that I waved a plastic fetus around on the floor of the Senate when it was a little medical doll. They did get the scissors right. They also then said I showed pictures of aborted children on the floor of the Senate, photographs, which was not true. I showed a photograph of a child who had been born prematurely and had lived. That, I did show. In fact, some of them went so far as to say that I actually showed photographs of an actual abortion, which, again, was not true. They had a heyday at my expense. I lived through it all. I am proud of it. 
   People said, well, you know you made a mistake, Senator, that almost cost you your election last time. You know you did all of this on the Senate floor. 
   I would do it again. I am going to do it again right now for whatever time it takes for me to make the point that I want to make tonight. 
   There are several points that I want to make. 
   One of them that I want to make is that this is a disgusting, dark, horrible game we are in, this abortion industry. And somebody needs to take a flashlight or, bigger than that, a searchlight and shine it into this industry so that we find out exactly what is going on in this abortion industry. It is not just partial-birth abortion. It is abortion in general. 
   It is a dirty business. It is a profitable business. There are people making money out there at the expense of young women, young mothers, who are in a terrible dilemma. They are making money on them. 
   We are going to find out, as I move through my presentation tonight, that we are going to be talking about some things in this industry that aren't too pleasant. It is not just that they are making money on the women. We will get into that a little bit further in a moment. 
   But I think most Americans, if they knew what was going on, would be disgusted, appalled, sickened, and angry that such a brutal act as killing a child with scissors to the back of the head, with no anesthesia, in the act of birth, would go on in this America--defenseless in America, a defenseless little unborn child. We do it at random. We do it 4,000 times a day, every day--not just partial birth but abortions in general, 4,000 of them every single day. We don't know how many partial births. It doesn't matter; it is still the killing of a child. 
   I ask my colleagues and those who may be watching out across America tonight: If you saw an article in your local paper tomorrow that said that all of the puppies and all of the kittens in your local SPCA that no one adopted were going to be killed tomorrow with no anesthetics, with a needle to the back of the head to suck out the brains of those animals, what would 
   be your reaction? I guarantee you there would be people marching down in front of the SPCA, and it wouldn't happen. But that is what we are doing to our children. 
   I know it is not pleasant to talk about. I don't like to talk about it. 
   I wish I didn't have to stand on the floor of the Senate as some of the great orators and great Senators of all time have stood and debated the issues of the day. Think about it, the issues of the Civil War, the issues of federalism, and civil rights, all of the great issues of the day that have been debated right here with some of the greatest people--John C. Calhoun, Daniel Webster, at whose desk I sit--the great debates that have taken place in here. Yet because this President refuses to stop this procedure, we are down here now again for the fifth or sixth time debating this again trying to stop this horrible, horrible procedure that kills unborn children. 
   Why are we surprised, my fellow Americans, when we pick up the newspaper and read somewhere that a mother flushes her child down the toilet or that somebody shoots somebody in school? Why should that surprise you? What message are we giving to our children? We are telling them every day: Children, you are expendable. You are not important. Go to school today, Johnny. You be a good boy. While you are in school doing your class work, and then you come home to do your homework, we are going to abort your sister. 
   Kids understand. They know what is going on. They are smarter than you think they are. They know what is going on. They read about this stuff. They hear it. Some of them are listening to this debate right now. They know what is happening. 
   Yet as horrible as this procedure is, and as many times as so many people have been down on this floor, as my two colleagues a moment ago did, eloquently discussing this issue and talking about how horrible it is, as I have done, as Senator SANTORUM has done in great detail over the years, as many times as we talk about it, we still can't get enough votes to override the veto of the President of the United States. 
   It is frustrating. I tried one time to meet with the President of the United States personally on this issue. I asked him for 15 minutes of his time. I said, I will go on the record, off the record, with staff, without staff, personally, with just you and me, whatever you want. Just give me 15 minutes. I couldn't get it. He wouldn't deal with me. He wouldn't talk with me about it.  
   This procedure that kills a child, as you have seen it described--I will not go through the description again--is legal in all 50 States of the United States of America. 
   In addressing the controversy over the partial-birth abortion method, the National Abortion Federation has written to its membership and said don't apologize for this process. Do not be on the defensive for killing children this way because it is a legal procedure. It is legal to do this. So don't apologize for it. When somebody says, oh, you know, you took scissors to the back of a head and you killed a little baby coming out of the birth canal, don't apologize for that, they say. It is right in their literature because it is legal. 
   This is America. America, America, we sure need help. If we ever needed God to shed his grace on this great country, it is now. We are killing the posterity that the Founding Fathers talked about--our posterity, our children. We are killing them every single day--not just with partial-birth abortion 
   but with all abortions--4,000 a day. Think of it: 4,000 abortions a day in this country; 4,000 children--children. Let's use the correct term. 
   Many of my opponents argue that this procedure is necessary to preserve the health of the mother. I am going to dispel that myth in great detail in a little while. I hope you are listening because it is a myth. It is not done for the health of the mother; it is done for the profit of the abortionist. 
   President Clinton twice vetoed this legislation with false and deceptive information and justification. 
   How does partially delivering a living child and then restraining it from exiting the birth canal so that only the head remains in the womb possibly enhance the health of a mother? 
   I have asked that question on the floor 100 times, and I can't get an answer. You have to understand now. The child is exiting the birth canal. The abortionist is holding the child--actually holding that child--in his or her hands and forcefully stopping the head from exiting the birth canal because once the head exits the birth canal, it is a birth. It is a birth. 
   What is he holding? Is that not a child? What is that part of the body? The feet, the legs, the torso, the shoulders, the hands, what is that? That is not supposed to be a child? If the baby turned around and exited headfirst, you couldn't do it because then it is born. 
   That is a pretty fine line. That is a pretty fine line. They do that in the name of the mother's health? You have got to be kidding me. 
   What is wrong with this country? Where are we going? We have to stand down here on the floor of this Senate and protect and fight to protect the lives of children, our children, killed in this way every day in America, every day. 
   We can't win because the President will veto what we pass with about 63 or 64 votes. He will veto it. We need 67 votes. 
   President Clinton's claim that partial-birth abortions are only undertaken to protect the mother from serious injury to her health has been conclusively proven to be false. When he says that--and he will when he vetoes it--he is not telling the truth. In fact, the vast majority of partial-birth abortions are performed on perfectly healthy women with perfectly healthy babies--that is the truth--80 to 90 percent, perfectly healthy women, mothers and babies. 
   The Nation's leading practitioner of partial-birth abortion, Dr. Martin Haskell of Ohio, has been quoted extensively today. He said in the American Medical Association's American Medical News:  
   I'll be quite frank. Most of my abortions are elective, in that 20 to 24 week range. In my particular case, probably 20 percent are for genetic reasons and the other 80 percent are purely elective.  
   That is the abortionist speaking. That is not me. It is not some pro-life organization. That is the abortionist. 
   He said 20 to 24 weeks; 24 weeks is a 6-month fetus. 
   I want to share with my colleagues a phone call I received in my office a few months ago from a 9-year-old girl. She said to me: Senator, I heard you were very much pro-life. I want to give a message that I would like you to share with your colleagues and with the American people as you travel around the country. 
   She said: I want them to know that I'm now 9 years old but my Mommy gave birth to me at 5 months; she was 5 months pregnant, and I lived and am here to tell you and tell America that babies at 5 or 6 months in the womb can survive. I'm glad my Mommy didn't pick that option. 
   When somebody says we are not taking the lives of unborn children, we are not taking the lives of people who have an opportunity to be productive members of our society, they are wrong. 
   At the White House veto ceremony Mr. Clinton hosted the last time he vetoed the partial-birth abortion ban, he presented five women at a press conference whom the President said ``had to make a lifesaving, certainly health saving but still tragic decision, to have the kind of procedure that would be banned by H.R. 1833.'' That is, the ban of partial-birth abortions. 
   The President around this town and around America doesn't have the greatest reputation for telling the truth, and he didn't tell the truth there either. Despite saying those five women had health-saving partial-birth abortions, one of the women involved in the press conference later publicly admitted neither her abortion nor those of any of the other four women was actually medically necessary. 
   Two days after the ceremony, one of the five women, Claudia Ades, appeared by telephone on a radio show in Mobile, AL, and quotations from the interview appear in the May-June 1996 edition of the newspaper Heterodoxy. During the course of the radio show, she told Mr. Malone, the MC: This procedure was not performed in order to save my life. This procedure was not performed in order to save my life. 
   This procedure was elective. That is considered an elective procedure, as were the procedures of all the other women who were at the White House veto ceremony. 
   Here again, President Bill Clinton is using people and not telling the truth. 
   The health-of-the-mother exception is so broadly defined, it would include the mother's emotional health, let alone physical health. 
   I don't enjoy talking about this stuff on the Senate floor. I don't enjoy standing here and talking about the fact we are killing our children. Who does? If we don't, it will keep on happening. Some in politics, some even in the Republican Party, the pro-life party in America supposedly, said we shouldn't talk about this issue; it is too controversial; let's sweep it under the rug and try to be less confrontational, be more together. 
   I don't believe we ever would have ended slavery or segregation or any of the other great issues we resolved in American history if we hadn't talked about it, if we hadn't faced it. Suppose Lincoln had said: I'm totally opposed to slavery, but my neighbor wants to own a couple of slaves; that is OK with me; I will not make a big deal out of it. 
   So we can take that approach on abortion and say, I'm personally opposed to abortion but my neighbor wants to have an abortion; that is OK with me. 
   Somebody has to stand up for 4,000 babies a day who are being killed in this country by all abortions. I don't mind being that person, I will be very honest. If that means I lose an election somewhere, that is fine with me. I am not here to compromise my views to win elections. I am here to lead, to stand up on principle. Otherwise, I don't want to be here. Anybody who stands here and says they are afraid to discuss this issue or won't come down here and discuss this issue because they are afraid they might leave ought to resign because they are not bringing dignity to this body. They 
   should stand up and passionately fight for what they believe. 
   I will review in a few moments some very dirty, disgusting little secrets about the abortion industry in this country. It doesn't apply strictly to any one type of abortion; it applies to abortions in general. It is not pleasant. It is not pretty. It is pretty graphic. But I am going to talk about it because the American people need to understand what is going on. These children don't have a voice. They can't ask for the opportunity to be born. 
   Imagine, since Roe v. Wade passed--and we will have a vote on that very shortly, tomorrow, this infamous Roe v. Wade decision in 1973--40 million babies have died in this country. I don't want anyone to misunderstand me lest  I be accused of misusing facts. All abortions, including partial-birth abortions--40 million babies. 
   Have you ever stopped to think what some of those babies might have grown up to be had they had the chance? I wonder if there is a President in that group. How about a doctor? How about a cure for cancer? Maybe there is a scientist who would cure breast cancer--wouldn't that be ironic--or cure any type of cancer, or perhaps discover some big secret in the universe, maybe even a Senator. Never to have a chance to live their dream, never to have a chance to grow up, have a family, to pursue their dreams--gone, down the drain. They didn't have a chance to talk about it, didn't have a chance to even ask for mercy; they were just eliminated. 
   Do the math. We have about 260 million Americans. We have killed 40 million of them in the years since Roe v. Wade, and we have people on this floor bragging about Roe v. Wade, what an important decision it is and has been in American history. You bet it is important; they are right about that. 
   We took the lives of 40 million of our fellow citizens, 40 million people who never get a chance to pay Social Security taxes or pay any taxes or build any bridges or buy any products or contribute any money to the U.S. Treasury, if you want to put it in those terms, never, never had a chance. Mr. President, 40 million children, one-seventh of the entire U.S. population, one-seventh, and we are killing them. 
   You do not think we have some cultural problems in America? Unbelievable. I would like to ask all of you listening to answer this question silently to yourself: If you knew a woman who had three children born blind, two children born deaf, and one child born retarded, she was pregnant again and she had syphilis, would you recommend she have an abortion? Answer to yourselves out there. I will give you a second. 
   Guess who you just killed? Beethoven. That was Beethoven's mother, a pretty fair contributor, I would say, to the arts of the world, and this country. Who are we, Roe v. Wade? Who are we to do that to the Beethovens, the potential Beethovens of the world? This is a sick society, for people to stand down here and defend that, and that is what we are doing. 
   Mr. President, 95 percent or more of all abortions are used for birth control, 1 or 2 percent of all abortions performed are done because the life of the mother was threatened or she was raped or sexually abused by a member of her family--a small minority. That means over 38 million abortions occurred for a variety of reasons that boil down to one word--convenience. It is convenient. That is what it is, convenience. The mother was too old, maybe too young, in high school, maybe in college, had to work, didn't have a husband, didn't have a boyfriend; it wasn't in her best interests to have the baby; she had her whole 
   life ahead of her. Pick any excuse, pick any reason. Pick the one you like, but that is the reason--convenience. It is a little inconvenient, isn't it? I have raised three children. Sure, it is inconvenient. But they are beautiful and I am sure glad I have them, and I am sure glad nobody made the decision to end their lives. 
   I know many of these desperate young mothers myself. I serve on the board of a home for unwed mothers. I have raised money for homes for unwed mothers. I have compassion for these mothers and for those who have gone through a horrible experience of having an abortion, or struggling in terms of whether to have the abortion or not, or whether to give the child up for adoption or to keep it. 
   I must say to any woman out there listening to me tonight, any mother, there are people out there who will help you. There are people out there who will help you. You do not have to have an abortion and you don't have to listen to one side of the argument. Ask. If you want help, call my office; I will put you in touch with people who will help you. It would be my honor and privilege to do that. Don't have an abortion; have your child like I did, my wife and I. You will be glad you did when you get down the road. You will be very glad you did. 
   You have other options available, options that will benefit you, that will benefit your child. Choose adoption or choose to keep your child. There are people out there who want to love that child. In either case, adoption or keep your baby, choose life. I beg you to do that, please. Do it for yourself; don't do it for me. Do it for yourself and for your baby. You will be glad you did. I promise you will. It will be tough for awhile but you will. 
   All across the fruited plains of America runs a river of abortion--blood. School shootings, we blame guns for that. After all, it could not possibly be our fault. Babies born alive left in trash cans: A young woman who goes into a restroom, gives birth to a child and throws it in the trash can can be prosecuted for murder. If she had a partial-birth abortion 5 minutes before that happened, it is all legal. Is there any difference in terms of the result, the child? It is still a child, isn't it? 
   Why are we here today? I just told you a few moments ago. It is to outlaw a cruel, inhuman procedure used for late-term abortions, a process so barbaric and so inhuman we would not even do it to animals. We wouldn't even think of it, I promise you. It is not being done to animals anywhere in the country. 
   We fell three votes short last time to override this President. I would give anything to have this President change his mind and not veto this. Do you realize how many children died since then? We don't really know. We know there are thousands who die from partial-birth abortions every year. If you multiply that by 4 or 5 years, we know it is probably in the vicinity of 15,000. I don't know what the number is. Whatever it is, it is too many. But hundreds, if not thousands, of young children are gone, just because the President of the United States refused to sign that bill; three votes short of an override. You talk about whether one vote means something or two votes mean something? You bet they do. If you are out there somewhere in America and you think I am right, you ought to take a look at who your Senators are and see how they are voting on this because those votes are going to cost lives. We are not talking about budgets. We are not talking about taxes. We are not talking about things such as that. We are not talking about anything other than lives, American lives, little babies. 
   Generically, without singling anybody out, let me speak to those Senators out there who might be wavering. I know some of you have been struggling with this vote for 4 years. You know in your heart it is wrong to kill unborn children this way. You know it, but you have connections to the abortion industry, the National Abortion Rights League, and others. I know they pressure you. I know I get pressured on the other side, too. I know what pressure is. We all do. But in your heart you know it is wrong. You can stop it. Three more votes or four more votes here can stop this. We can save thousands of lives down the road--thousands. 
   Imagine, if you could, all those children who have died from just partial-birth abortion in the last 25 years coming here today. If they had the opportunity to live, what do you think they would say? I don't think they would be with those who say, no, we ought to have this process. I don't think so. Maybe I am wrong. I have been wrong before. 
   Hold your grandchild in your arms, or your child, and ask yourself: How far removed is that grandchild or child from the process that you are voting to allow? A year? A month? Maybe you have a newborn. Think about it. I have. 
   According to the American Medical Association, the partial-birth abortion method is never medically necessary--never medically necessary. According to the Physicians' Ad Hoc Coalition for Truth, partial-birth abortion is likened to infanticide and is considered an extremely dangerous procedure. 
   Let me quote from these physicians:  
   The prolonged manipulation of the cervix introduces a serious risk of infection and excessive bleeding. Turning the child inside the womb using forceps risks rupture or puncture of the uterus, infection, and hemorrhage from displacing the placenta. Inserting the scissors--a blind procedure--risks cutting the cervix.  
   That is one doctor. 
   Another one says:  
   Beyond the immediate risks, partial-birth abortion can undermine a woman's future fertility and compromise future pregnancies.  
   Many pro-abortion advocates have publicly stated their opposition to the  partial-birth-abortion technique. Warren Hern, the author of the Nation's most widely used textbooks on late-term abortions, said:  
   You really can't defend it. I would dispute any statement that this is the safest procedure to use.  
   This leads me to another dirty little secret about the industry which is that abortion clinics are losing doctors who are willing to perform abortions. Do you know what happens when you lose the ability to perform abortions? You lose the ability to make money. 
   My colleagues on the left will assert that they are afraid they are going to get killed by a pro-life activist. That has happened seven times, and it is seven times too many, but it has happened. I have statements from the media, the abortion industry, and the doctors themselves that say the reason abortion clinics cannot find doctors is because they are considered losers in the medical field. 
   Those of us who have been pro-life who have been talking about this are making a difference in some of these abortions. Abortionists are losers. They are having such a tough time recruiting abortionists. They are actively lobbying right now to force medical students to perform abortions. What happened to choice? It is very interesting, isn't it? 
   Listen to these quotes from the abortion industry. I am making these points because I want to lead you into the next issue of what is happening in the industry and why these things are occurring and what you will see where I am leading you in terms of another ugly little secret, dirty little secret about what is happening in addition to the abortionists. Here is what Morris Wortman, abortionist, Democrat and Chronicle, 1992, said:  
   Abortion has failed to escape its back-alley associations ..... [it is the] dark side of medicine ..... Even when abortion became legal, it was still considered dirty.  
   That was the abortionist. 
   Joe Thompson, retired abortionist, South Bend Tribune, December 26, 1992:  
   In obstetrics and gynecology, the term abortionist is a dirty word.  
   Jean Hunt, former executive director, Elizabeth Blackwell Center, Philadelphia, PA, Westchester Daily Local News, November 26, 1992:  
   Doctors today see abortion as a mud puddle not worth jumping into.  
   David Zbaraz, abortionist, Washington Post, 1980:  
   [Abortion is] a nasty, dirty, yukky thing and I always come home angry.  
   Another:  
   ..... some residents are concerned about being stigmatized for performing abortions and feel they are likely to perform abortions once in practice.  
   Abortionist Trent MacKay and Andrea Phillips MacKay, Family Planning Perspectives, May and June, 1995.  
   Organized medicine has been sympathetic to abortion--not abortionists.  
   Carol Joffe, pro-abortion author, 1998. 
   A couple more:  
   [Abortion] is a difficult field from an emotional aspect. Some of us, and all of us, I suspect, to some degree or another, have emotional isolation and separation and distance from some of our social friends, certainly from the community and from our professional colleagues.  
   George Tiller, abortionist, St. Louis, MO. 
   On the status of abortionists, Warren Hern says.  
   ..... status of [abortionists] is somewhere well below the average garage mechanic ..... patients do not value what we do.  
   Richard Hausknecht, abortionist, January 1998:  
   It's true that abortion providers are perceived as not very good doctors--that they have no alternative so they do abortions, that they cannot earn a living any other way. 
   Is that the kind of person you want to send a woman to because you want to protect her health? 
   Another one. Merle Hoffman, president, Choices Women's Medical Center, Queens, NY, 1995:  
   The medical establishment has yet to welcome in abortion providers .....  
   Tom Kring, director, California Planning Clinic:  
   Abortion has a stigma attached to it that is increasingly scaring doctors and clinics.  
   I think, I say to my colleagues, one of the reasons clinics are closing is because of the doctors. You cannot get a good doctor. 
   Eileen Adams, former administrator for Park Medical Center in Illinois which closed after 13 years of operation:  
   You cannot get a good doctor.  
   Then she said:  
   I hate to have that in the paper so the anti-abortionists would say they've won--but they did.  
   That is what Eileen Adams said. 
   A 1993 Boston Globe article had this so say:  
   Opponents of abortion in New England may have lost the battle of public opinion, but they appear to be winning the war ..... there are no longer enough doctors and hospitals in some areas to provide abortions.  
   With all that testimony from within the industry--dirty, yucky, not protecting the health of the mothers--why is it still going on? Because there is another dirty little secret, and it is called fetal tissue marketing. We will take a look at this chart. 
   I want everybody to see what happens in this dirty little secret of the abortion industry. I want my colleagues to know this is the abortion industry in general, but abortion is abortion. There are different types of abortion. Partial-birth abortion is what is on the agenda today. But fetal body parts marketing is what I am talking about. 
   A woman comes into an abortion clinic. It could be Planned Parenthood. She goes into the clinic, and she is talked to, advised to have an abortion. But what she may or may not know is that inside that clinic in a little room somewhere or some office that is not necessarily visible to her, is the harvester, the wholesaler, the person who is going to take her baby, cut it into pieces and sell it. 
   They are going to say: Oh, no, no, no, nobody is selling any babies. Listen to what I have to say, and then you tell me. 
   The wholesaler and the harvester is in the clinic. This poor woman, this mother, this woman who has probably gone through unimaginable trauma, is now faced with this little secret because she has to sign a waiver that allows them to do it. 
   You have the harvester now who is in that building. Anatomic Gift Foundation, Opening Lines--those are the names of a couple of the wholesalers. 
   What happens? We will get into that in a few moments. 
   But here is the buyer over here. If you are pro-life, you will be pleased to know, I am sure, that maybe a university in your State, Government agencies to which you are paying taxes, pharmaceutical companies, private researchers, and research organizations are buying body parts. 
   How does this work? 
   Here is step 1. The buyer orders the fetal body parts from the wholesaler/harvester. The buyer says: We need a couple of eyes, or whatever. The abortion clinic provides space for the wholesaler and harvester in the clinic where that woman goes to procure fetal body parts. The wholesaler/harvester faxes an order to the abortion clinic, faxes an order to the clinic, and says: We need this, and we need this, and we need this. The wholesaler's technician harvests the organs: Skin, limbs, whatever, from aborted babies. 
   Now, bear in mind how gruesome this really is. This is the abortion industry, ladies and gentlemen. Here is a woman coming into that clinic, thinking she needs an abortion. She is advised to have it. And these people are sitting around the room, the harvesters. When they are looking at that woman, there is a living child there that has not been aborted yet, and they are placing orders for body parts--placing orders for body parts--before the child is even dead. 
   The wholesaler's technician harvests the organs. Then the clinic ``donates'' fetal body parts to the wholesaler/harvester, who in turn pays the clinic a ``site fee'' for access to the aborted babies. Then the wholesaler/harvester ``donates'' the fetal body parts to the buyer. The buyer then ``reimburses'' the wholesaler/harvester for the cost of retrieving the fetal body parts. We are going to get into a little more detail on this. 
   You might say: This is a debate about partial-birth abortion. What does the sale of fetal tissue have to do with partial-birth abortion? 
   First, like partial-birth abortions, the selling of fetal tissue is immoral and unethical. It is illegal. And it is a reprehensible, dirty practice that is  going on in the shadows of the industry. It is a practice I had never even heard of. Again, I could not believe this was going on. But it is. 
   Second, it is a practice that very graphically shows how this industry has gone far beyond the ethical boundaries that even most pro-choice Americans would find repugnant. 
   Third, like partial-birth abortion, the industry has taken the practice of selling fetal body parts, which is illegal under Federal criminal law, and created a loophole to allow them to do it. 
   In partial-birth abortion, they use the head loophole. In other words, what I mean by that is: Arms, feet, body, neck, heart, toes. That is not birth. That is not the baby--until the head comes into the world. Then it is a baby. Really? It is a legal mumbo jumbo, as Senator SANTORUM talked about. It is a bunch of garbage. It makes lawyers around the country very rich, and it allows these clinics to kill our children. 
   I am sure the legal team that came up with the head loophole is very proud of themselves, just as we have the fetal harvesting loophole. In a sense, we call it ``donations'' or ``reimbursements'' rather than selling parts. They 
   are both loopholes to hide the facts. 
   Stabbing a baby in the back of the head and sucking its brains out is illegal; it is murder; it is infanticide--whether that child is sitting in a play pen or whether that child is trying to exit the birth canal to become a member of this world. But its head is conveniently, under this stupid legal definition, ``stuck'' in the womb. And it is not stuck; it is held there. And they call it medicine. We have people standing down here saying: This is medicine. We're doing this for the health of the mother. Really? 
   Let's go back to the sale of fetal body parts. I have here the United States Code. Here is what the United States Code says:  
   Prohibitions Regarding Human Fetal Tissue.  
   That is the topic. That is the heading right here in the United States Code.  
   Purchase of tissue. It shall be unlawful for any person to knowingly acquire, receive, or otherwise transfer any fetal tissue for valuable consideration if the transfer affects interstate commerce. 
   Criminal penalties for such violations. 
   In general, any person who violates subsection--  
   The one I just referenced--  
   shall be fined in accordance with title 18, U.S. Code, subject to paragraph 2, or imprisoned for not more than 10 years, or both. 
   The term ``valuable consideration'' does not include reasonable payments associated with the transportation, implantation, processing, preservation, quality control, or storage of human fetal tissue.  
   It is against the law, ladies and gentlemen, my fellow Americans, and colleagues, it is against the law to do this. And they are doing it every day to our children--every day. So 10 years in jail if you sell human fetal tissue. That was signed into law, ironically, by President William Jefferson Clinton. It took effect on June 3, 1993. 
   But the lawyers went to work, as only lawyers can do. They found a loophole: How can we sell this tissue, make a profit at the expense of this poor woman victim, and get it to research, and hide it all by calling it research? How do we do that without getting caught and getting our tails thrown in jail? 
   That was the question. So they found it in section D(3) which:  
   . . . allows reasonable payments associated with the transportation, implantation, processing, preservation, quality control, or storage of human fetal tissue.  
   That is the loophole I just read out of the book. 
   But because there is no documentation, no disclosure, no government oversight, this section has become a gigantic loophole to allow this industry to engage in the illegal trafficking of body parts of fetal tissue without any prosecution. 
   Mr. President, we need a big beam of light to shine into this industry, 
   to get into the darkness and find out what is going on in this for-profit industry. We need some sunshine. We need it so badly. I am not looking to get into the medical records of individuals. That is not what I am about. But I believe if we are going to allow the use of fetal tissue from aborted fetuses --I mean aborted fetuses for research, which I believe we should not--if we are, we need at least a minimum of documentation to ensure this tissue is not being sold in violation of Federal criminal law. 
   Is partial-birth abortion used for this? I don't know. Why not find out? Let's shine the light in. Let's talk about a few things that might make you think, however, that there is a link here. Your call. You listen. You make your own determination. 
   Let us talk about dilation and evacuation, the so-called D&E, for a moment. This method, which is performed during months 4 to 6, 6 months, is particularly gruesome in that the doctor must tear out the baby parts with a pliers-like instrument. Literally disassembles it in the womb. It is horrible. No wonder they are angry when they get home and sick, sick before they start. Then the nurse gruesomely has to take all these body parts of this child who was torn apart in the womb and reassemble them in a pan to be sure they got it all. That is the first method. 
   I will just ask you to think, as we go through this, if you are in the business of selling body parts, how is that going to work with your buyer, if all the body parts are torn apart? I think you would say, well, probably it isn't going to be much good. There might be some tissue, but if you need intact organs, disassembling the organs ought to lead you to believe, reasonably, I think, they are probably not very good. If you need a liver and it is all chopped up in this procedure, it is probably not going to do you much good. So the D&E method is not real good for selling body parts. But that is one type of abortion. 
   The next is the saline abortion. This occurs after the first trimester. The abortionist injects a strong salt solution into the amniotic sac and, over a period of an hour, the baby is basically poisoned and burned to death in her mother's womb. That is the saline solution. So now I ask you again, if you are selling body parts, and the buyers want good body parts, good condition, that is not going to do a lot of good. That is not going to make your product very marketable. That is probably not a good method either. 
   The next one is a little more grotesque, if you can imagine that. This is called the dig method, or digoxin method. It is called harpooning the whale inside the industry. You see, even in the industry they can't even be respectful to the child or even the woman in some cases, the mother. They use terms such as that, ``harpooning the whale.'' The abortionist inserts a needle containing digoxin into the abdomen of the woman. In order to make sure the doctor hits the baby and not the woman, which would be lethal for her as well, he must watch to see the needle begin moving wildly. And when it does move wildly, he knows he has harpooned the whale and can push his needle all the way through and kill the baby. This abortion procedure is probably the least desired method for the body parts people because the baby's organs are, in essence, liquefied by this horrible poison. They are basically worthless to the body parts market. 
   Those are three types of abortions. They have nothing to do with partial-birth abortion. I use these examples of three types of abortions to show you they basically make the sale of body parts worthless for the most part. Some tissue I am sure they can use. 
   So where are they getting these things? Ask yourself, what have we been talking about all day? How can we get a good specimen, a baby whose organs are intact, a good cadaver? You can do it two ways. You could have a live birth and kill it, or you could have a partial-birth abortion, kill it that way, and damage only the brain so the rest of the body is good for research. 
   Now, is this happening? Shine the light in. There are going to be people who say that I have made this link. I will tell you right now, I haven't. I am asking you to shine the light into this industry. Bring in the sunshine. Let's look in the clinics. Let's find out what is going on. Are they being used? We will take a look in a few moments at some of the things going on here. I ask you whether or not you think they might be getting these parts from some other source of abortion other than partial-birth abortions. I don't know. I know one thing. It is a black market. It is illegal. It is unreported, and it is unregulated. If it is the last thing I do before I leave this body, I will change that. I am going to change that.  
   The good news is abortion rates are down. That is good. But the problem is, because they are down and because the doctors aren't doing them, they have to make it up somewhere. The industry has to make up the money. They have to make it up. Where do they do that? By selling body parts. That is where they make it up. It is really the dark side of the industry. 
   This is the testimony of a woman who calls herself Kelly, a fictitious name. Kelly was working and received a service fee from the Anatomic Gift Foundation, which is the wholesaler, the harvester, of these organs. 
   Listen to what Kelly had to say. Kelly fears for her life. That is why Kelly is a fictitious name and why Kelly is not being identified. 
   ``We were never employees of the abortion clinic,'' Kelly explains. 
   That is when they would sit in the clinic, in this room, and the lady comes in pregnant. 
   ``We would have a contract with the clinic ..... .'' 
   Listen very carefully to what I am saying. A woman comes in. I am sorry. I am confusing the stenographer. I will go through the quote first and then explain it.  
   We were never employees of the abortion clinic. We would have a contract with an abortion clinic that would allow us to go in to procure fetal tissue for research. We would get a generated list each day to tell us what tissue researchers, pharmaceuticals and universities were looking for. Then we would go and look at the particular patient charts. We had to screen out anyone who had STDs or fetal anomalies. These had to be the most perfect specimens we could give these researchers for the best value that we could sell for. Probably only 10 percent of fetuses were ruled out for anomalies. The rest were healthy donors.  
   To capsulate, a woman is in the abortion clinic, and basically they are eyeing up the source. It is like a hunter going out and seeing, I guess in this case, a trophy doe rather than a trophy buck, and saying, there is a good specimen there. I hope that baby is fairly normal so I can sell the body parts. And they looked at the patients' charts while this child was alive in the womb. This girl might change her mind on whether to have this abortion, and nobody is helping her change her mind or asking her if she would like to change her mind. 
   Oh, no, we have a contract here. We have a patient chart here. We have somebody looking at her, looking at the trophy and then saying: Hey, this chart looks real good, this gal has what we want; she has a normal baby there. My goodness, a perfect specimen, the most perfect specimen we could find. So give the researchers the best value we could sell for. Her words. Probably only 10 percent of fetuses were ruled out for anomalies; the rest were healthy donors. So said Kelly. 
   Let's look at a work order. This is a work order. Mailing address, shipping address, everything. OK. Tissue, fetal lung; one or both from the same donor, 12 to 16 weeks. Preservation: Fresh. Gestation: 12 to 16. Shipping: Wet ice. Constraints: No known abnormalities. We don't want any babies who have any problems. Obtain tissue under sterile or clean conditions. 
   Let me ask you a question, colleagues. In this filthy, dirty, disgusting business we are talking about, do you really think you can get a perfect lung, with no cuts and no abnormalities, by chopping up the child in the womb or putting all of this poison in the body, in the womb, in the embryonic sack? Or do you think it might be possible that the best way to get a normal lung is to bring a child through the birth canal in perfect condition, damaging only the brain, or perhaps even a live birth? Oh, you think that would not happen? Well, we will talk about that in a little while. Oh, yes, it happens. 
   Look here: ``Normal fetal liver.'' A normal fetal liver is not one filled with poison. It is not a liver that has been chopped up. It is a normal fetal liver. There aren't too many ways you can get a normal fetal liver in an abortion clinic. ``Dissect fetal liver and thymus and occasional lymph node from fetal cadaver within 10 minutes of the time it is extracted, and ship within 12 hours.'' ``No abnormal donors.'' 
   There is a whole lot of money in this business, folks. With abortions down, they will charge a woman anywhere from $300 to $1,000 for an abortion and make several thousand dollars on the parts of her child. But she doesn't get any of that money, you can bet on that. 
   Let's look at another work order. The National Institutes of Health gets the delivery here. If you are pro-life, you will be ``pleased'' to know they are getting some of this stuff. ``I would prefer tissues without identified anomalies; in particular, bone anomalies.'' 
   Let's look at another one. This is just the tip of the iceberg. I could give you hundreds of these work orders. I am picking a few of them. 
   Now, this one is particularly disturbing--as if the others weren't. Here is the donor criterion on this. We are talking about whole eyes. Now, the donor criterion is that the child be ``brain dead.'' Think about that for a minute. Why would you put that on there? Are we to assume this child is going to be delivered to them live? 
   I assume if a child has been aborted and it is being sold, or provided, or donated, or whatever it is, to some research center, we ought to assume it is dead. Well, they are not assuming it. They are not assuming it at all. They are directing it: Make sure it is ``brain dead.'' If anything else is moving, that is OK. Maybe the heart is beating, and that is OK. But make sure it is brain dead, noncadaver, and post 4 to 6 hours, any age. Again, no contagious diseases. ``Remove eye with as much nerve''--they go into that. Federal Express--send it out. That is against the law. 
   So let's say a girl walks into a clinic and sits down to wait. I want to try to paint you a picture of what happens. A girl walks into a clinic and sits down to wait. A fax comes in, and the fax contains a list of what body parts are needed for that day. So here she comes. She still hasn't had the abortion. But they now have this list--the abortionist perhaps, but I don't know; I have not seen this. Perhaps he looks through the glass window, and maybe there is a one-way glass. He looks out into the waiting room and stares at her stomach and knows this is the very same child who is very much alive now, perhaps even moving and kicking; he knows that child will be dead in a few moments, and they already have the work order. They have already checked the charts, already know it is normal; they already know what they need. They are already planning it all. 
   If that is not sick, if that doesn't bother you, then, man, there is something wrong with the people in this country--big-time wrong. 
   After her abortion, in a matter of 10 minutes, if it is done then, that baby can be shipped on wet ice to researchers across the country, just like going into a supermarket and buying a piece of meat. 
   There are four illegal and immoral things happening with this issue. First, as I said before, current law prohibits receiving any consideration, valuable consideration, from the tissue of aborted children for research purposes. This is happening. So that is wrong. Violation No. 1. 
   Secondly, it has been reported that, in fact, live births are occurring at these clinics. Oh, that is a dirty little secret we don't want anybody to talk about. Let's not talk 
   about that. It doesn't happen a lot, but in 100 abortions it could be as few as 5, 6, maybe 7, maybe 10 times--live births. Oh, boy, that is a real problem. What better way to get a good sample than a live birth? 
   It is the law of every State to make every medical effort to save the life of that child. I am going to show you proof that that isn't done. It is not happening in every case. 
   Thirdly, our tax dollars are being used to fund Planned Parenthood on the one end to kill the children, and NIH on the other end to do research on them. If you are pro-life, as I am, you won't like it; I don't like it. I am going to do something about it if it is humanly possible. 
   In 1996, Planned Parenthood received $158 million in taxpayer dollars. Who knows how much in addition is being funneled through the valuable consideration loophole from NIH research labs. The taxpayers and Congress deserve an answer. The chart shows Federal funds supporting Planned Parenthood Federation of America and its affiliates, in fiscal year 1994, $120 million; in 1995, $120 million; in 1996, $123 million. Add it all together. It is $158 million. 
   The fetal body parts industry is a big business, ladies and gentlemen, and it is not being honest. Mothers are not being given their consent forms sometimes. Sometimes they are. And the  wholesalers are not forthright about how they ship the babies, among other things. These people are in the business of selling dead humans, so I guess maybe we should not expect too much in terms of ethics. 
   There are two statutes that govern fetal tissue research, and both statutes were passed as part of S. 1 in 1993, the National Institutes of Health and Revitalization Act of 1993. I was one of four Senators who voted no, as usual, because I don't believe Government should be doing any research on induced abortions, aborted fetuses. Up until 1992, we had a President, George Bush, who agreed. But Bill Clinton changed all of that. But even President Clinton, who signed the fetal tissue research Executive order as one of the first acts of his Presidency, was unwilling to accept the sale of fetal tissues. 
   Prior to 1993, there was a moratorium prohibiting Federal funding of fetal tissue research. That was overturned by President Clinton by Executive order on January 22, 1993. And Senator KENNEDY introduced S. 1 to codify Clinton's Executive order. Part of that was because this ``statute permits the National Research Institutes to conduct support research on the transplantation of human fetal tissue for therapeutic purposes.'' The source of the tissue may be from an abortion where the informed consent of the donor is granted. This statute allows for Federal money to be used in fetal tissue research. And you will see that NIH is involved in this. 
   The second statute made it unlawful to transfer any human fetal tissue for valuable consideration. I talked about this statute. In other words, it is illegal to give monetary value to the various body parts being sold. And it is illegal to profit from the sale. The guilty receive fines and imprisonment for not more than 10 years. As long as the tissue is donated, it is OK. But large amounts of cash are changing hands. 
   Again, abortion clinics and the wholesalers are making a killing--that is a sick pun, a killing--literally with the abortion and with the sale of human baby parts. 
   Listen to what one of the leaders of fetal body parts marketing said in an interview with a pro-life publication: ``Nearly 75 percent of the women who chose abortion agree to donate the fetal tissue.'' 
   Granted, this organization claims to only operate out of 
   two abortion clinics. But if you apply their statistic nationwide, for theoretical purposes, you are talking about a lot of aborted babies being sold for cold, hard cash. 
   In addition, the consulting firm of Frost & Sullivan recently reported that the worldwide market for sale in tissue cultures brought in nearly $428 million in 1996, and they predict that market will continue to expand and will grow at an annual rate of 13.5 percent a year, and by 2002 will be worth nearly $1 billion. That is a whole lot of money at the expense of these unfortunate women. 
   In a taped conversation with the wholesaler, she says they do not buy the tissue. That is the way it works. That is really what happens. 
   In a taped conversation with another marketer of fetal body parts, they admit to try to get abortion clinics to alter procedures to get better tissue, which is a violation of Federal law. This person then offers discounts for being a ``high volume'' user, and that the buyer can save money by purchasing their cost-effective, lower-range product. 
   Let's look now at a chart offered by Opening Lines, and you tell me if this isn't a business transaction for profit. Bear in mind the sale of body parts is illegal. You are not supposed to receive any consideration. Well, then maybe you could tell me why--this is one of those wholesalers, Opening Lines. Maybe you could tell me why they have a price list. Has anybody ever done any marketing before? 
   Look. You can get a kidney for $125. You can get a spinal cord for $325. Then down at the bottom, it says prices in effect through December 31, 1999. That is a price list, ladies and gentlemen. I suppose there will be somebody who will come down here and say, ``Well, Senator, that is not a price list. That is fee-for-service.'' 
   That is what it says at the top. 
   What is the service? You say: Well, you know it is expensive. You have to take the brain out, or you have to take the spinal cord out. OK. We take the spinal cord out. I am not a doctor. I am not going to pretend to be. I am not going to make any reference to how difficult that might be. 
   But let's assume to remove a spinal cord from a child is a difficult operation. They are charging $325 for the spinal cord. I would think it would be safe to assume--I am not a doctor, but if you want to send an intact cadaver, that doesn't involve any research at all. Does it? They don't have to cut anything. We will just ship that along. But it cost $600. It doesn't have anything to do with what the service is in terms of finding the spinal cord and getting it out. It has nothing to do with it at all. 
   I will tell you why this is $600--the cadaver. Because when they get the cadaver; they can get the spinal cord; they can get the eyes; they can get the nose; they can get the ears; they can get the liver; they can get the thyroid, whatever they want. That is why it is $600. That is why the price list is there. You can even get a discount if you buy enough. 
   This is a dirty business. It is bad. It stinks. 
   The brochure boasts that it offers researchers ``the highest quality, most affordable and freshest tissue prepared to your specifications and delivered in the quantities you need when you need it.'' 
   Here is the copy of the brochure. I didn't make it up. This is their brochure, Opening Lines. This is what they said. 
   Think about it. ``We are professionally staffed and directed,'' it says. ``We have over 10 years of experience in harvesting tissue and preservation. Our full-time medical director is active in all phases of our operation. We are very pleased to provide you with our services. Our goal is to offer you and your staff the highest quality, most affordable, and freshest tissue prepared to your specifications.'' 
   Please tell me how you can do that if it is simply a matter of taking an aborted child and sending it off to a research laboratory somewhere. 
   My colleagues and American people, I don't know what is going to happen to this country. But I just want to recap for you what has happened here. 
   A woman comes into a clinic, an abortion clinic. She is pregnant. She is in trouble. She needs help. They already have somebody who has read her charts. They know her baby is normal. They know it has no abnormal functions. They know they need to get that baby out of there quickly. They know they can't do damage to the cadaver. They cannot do damage to the fetus. They can't poison it. They can't cut it because, to their specifications, they need perfect eyes, or they need perfect skin, or good lungs, even the gonads, the ultimate. The poor little child just has no privacy here. Limbs, brains, spinal, spleen, liver, all of it, price list, all the way down--they have it all figured out. 
   And they have the gall to stand out here and tell you these clinics care for the women. They care for the profit. They cannot make it because abortions are going down. They can't charge these women any more because they are too poor to pay. 
   So they take it from their bodies, from the children. It is a filthy, disgusting, dirty business, and it needs to be exposed and eliminated. 
   How much more should we tolerate in this country? How much more degradation must these children absorb and endure? 
   Look at that list. Look at it and tell me that is fee-for-service--to your specifications, your specifications. You give us the order, and we will make sure you get perfect eyes that weren't hurt by any abortionist's knife, or they weren't poisoned by digoxin, or saline. Oh, we will make sure. We will get you a live birth, if we have to, or a partial birth, if we have to. We will get it for you because there is a lot of money in it. That is why we will get it. 
   This is a filthy, disgusting, dirty business. 
   People say: Oh, you are antiresearch. I am not antiresearch. If a woman has a miscarriage and wishes to donate that miscarried child to research, she has every right to do that. I am proresearch. 
   The Department of Health and Human Services under President Bush determined there was plenty of tissue available through spontaneous abortions and ectopic pregnancies to satisfy  research needs--plenty. But oh, no, we have to get into this. We have to make up for the loss of revenue because, thank God, abortions are starting to go down in this country. We have to make it up. Doctors don't want to do them anymore. It is a dirty business, they say. I'm sick when I go home. We are going down a slippery slope, my fellow Americans. 
   I used to teach history. I used to tell my kids in those classes: If you forget everything else I said, I want you to remember you have a responsibility to pass on America to your children, hopefully in better shape than we gave her to you. If you do that, America will always be here; if you fail, we could lose it. 
   What message are we giving to our children when we tolerate this--an order form before the woman even has the abortion. 
   Henry Hyde said: I deplore any medical procedure that treats human beings as chattel, personal property, as a subject fit for harvesting. The humanity of every fetus should be respected and treated with dignity and not like some laboratory animal. 
   Is that dignity? Is that respect? 
   Let me tell a story about a girl name Christy. This is not a pleasant story. These are the abortion clinics, there to protect the mother and make her healthy again. She went in to have her safe, healthy, legal abortion. Something went wrong. On July 1, 1993, Christy--fictitious name--underwent an abortion by John Roe, abortionist. After the procedure, Roe looked up to find Christy pale with bluish lips and no pulse or respiration. Christy's heart had stopped and there were no records that her vital signs were monitored during the procedure. Additionally, Roe was not trained in anesthesia and the clinic had no anesthesia emergency equipment or staff trained to handle a complication. Paramedics were able to restore Christy's pulse and respiration, but she was left blind and in a permanent vegetative state. Today, she requires 24-hour-a-day care and is fed through a tube in her abdomen. She is not expected to recover and is being cared for by her family. Christy had a legal abortion on her 18th birthday. 
   They took good care of her, didn't they? I have in my hand a consent form that Christy signed. Do you know what they tell you in the industry? Ask them; don't believe me. Ask them. They say: We know the woman is in a terrible emotional condition when she comes in, so we don't always ask her to sign these forms. We wait until after the procedure. 
   Is that so? Well, you have to do it within 10 minutes if you want to get some of these buyers for organs because they say they need them in 10 or 15 minutes from the time they exit the birth canal; otherwise, they are no good in some cases. They have to do it quickly. So the poor girl is just coming out of the anesthetic. I know she is not coming out in 10 minutes. ``Here, Christy, want to sign this? We want to send your 6-month old boy to be chopped up for medical research. Would you sign this?'' 
   They say we don't bother the women before. OK, can a woman who is in a 24-hour-a-day coma sign a consent form? Can she? Here is the form. It is signed and she didn't sign it after the procedure. She signed it before the procedure and she signed it because they needed the body parts of her fetus and they wanted to make doggone sure they got them. They didn't want anything to get in the way of that. They didn't want anything to interrupt that little profit they had coming, so they just said we will get this signed by Christy. 
   Maybe they should have taken a little time to counsel her. ``Would you like to have some other discussion perhaps about adoption?" 
   We gave her that. OK, fine. 
   How about the anesthesiologist. Did someone know what in the hell they were doing when they put this poor woman under? 
   Oh, no, we have to get this, because this is money. 
   Here is what Christy signed:  
   I grant permission to one of these agencies and each of its authorized agents and representatives to distribute and dispense tissue from the surgery. I release all my property and financial interests therein and any product or process which may result therefrom. I read and I understand this document and I have been given the opportunity to ask questions. I am aware I may refuse to participate. I understand I will receive no compensation for consenting to this study.  
   As I said, if anybody thinks she signed it after the surgery, I will sell you some ocean-front property in Colorado. They say they don't bother them beforehand because they are too distraught, they are too emotional, or they don't want to bring all this up. 
   That is Christy. 
   I saw a bumper sticker once that said:  
   Abortion: One dead; one wounded.  
   Can't sum it up any better than that. One dead and one wounded. And the people who were in charge of the health and safety of the mother in these cases are more interested in the dead than the wounded because they are going to make a big profit. 
   Let's talk about the dirtiest most disgusting secret of all. This is not pleasant. I had somebody from the National Right to Life tell me today, believe it or not--I won't mention names-- that we don't have any evidence of any link here. Fine. I am not asking anyone to tell me whether they think this is evidence or not. I am asking everyone to make their own decisions. I am not making any links. I am giving facts. Make your own links. 
   There is a little complication called ``live birth.'' Uh-oh. Live birth. It happens. When it does, what happens? 
   I was at an award dinner several years ago when a young woman who is known by many in the right-to-life movement by the name of Gianna Jessen, who then was about 21, so she is probably 25, 26, maybe a little older now. She had been aborted. She was a beautiful girl. She was aborted. There were 1,000 people at this event. She stood up and sang ``Amazing Grace.'' There wasn't a dry eye in the place, including mine. When it was all over she said: I want all of you to know something. My mother made a terrible mistake because I wanted to live. If I had had my choice, if I could have said, spare me, I would have said that. I didn't, but I survived, and I am meaningful. I just sang to you. And she said: I love my mother and I forgive her. 
   There is a lot more power in that than these people that run these clinics that do this. 
   Why can't we bring this debate to that level? There is no way to know how many live births actually occur. It happens in partial-birth abortions because they are alive until they are executed as they come through the birth canal. Feet first, they are executed; headfirst, they are born. Any difference? Maybe somebody can explain it. 
   Many of you may have heard of a gentleman by the name of Eric Harrah. About 10 years ago he left the abortion business. One night Eric and his staff were called to the clinic-- remember, he was an abortionist then--because a pregnant girl had given birth in a motel room. The baby was wrapped in a towel. She had been given medication to begin the process of dilation. So it was wrapped in a towel and they thought it was dead, so she came from the motel room carrying this little child in the towel. 
   Eric, the abortionist, saw the baby's arm fly up and he screamed, ``My God, that baby is alive.'' 
   The doctors sent Rick and the nurse out of the room. When he came back in the baby was dead. A live birth? You might ask yourself, did they take any means to save the child? Or did they kill the child? Who knows? In either case, they let it die. 
   I have been in this business of doing research on this issue since 1984. I have been involved in the pro-life movement. I have read, I don't know how many thousands of pages. What I am going to read to you now is the worst I have ever come across in everything and anything that I have read. I have never seen anything to equal it. I do not understand how we can tolerate this in this country, but it shows you how sick we really are. We are sick. Oh, we are sick, collectively, believe me. This is a story from Kelly. A short paragraph, 
   what she said. It is very difficult for me even to read it, but you need to hear it. 
   The doctor walked into the lab. This is in an abortion clinic. Kelly is the wholesaler for the fetal tissue. She is the person who has to take this fetus and do what has to be done to it to get it to the supplier.  
   The doctor walked into the lab and set a steel pan on the table. ``Got you some good  specimens,'' he said. ``Twins.'' The technician looked down at a pair of perfectly formed 24-week-old fetuses, moving and gasping for air. Except for a few nicks from the surgical tongs that had pulled them out, they seemed uninjured.  
   This is pretty difficult. I have witnessed the birth of my three children, so forgive me if I have a little trouble.  
   The wholesaler, Kelly, said, ``There is something wrong here. They are moving. I don't do this. That's not in my contract.'' 
   She watched the doctor take a bottle of sterile water and fill the pan until the water ran up over the babies' mouths and noses. Then she left the room. ``I couldn't watch those fetuses moving. That's when I decided it was wrong.''  
   So the abortionist, twin live births, 6 months--the little girl I spoke to you about earlier who wrote to me was born prematurely at 5 months. Two little twins drowned in a pan so their body parts could be sold because they had an order for the body parts. America. 
   Many of you may have heard about Jill Stanek, the nurse at Chicago's Christ Hospital who has openly admitted that live births occur at her hospital. We are going to have some testimony from Jill. She will be up here on the Hill very soon so you do not have to believe me; you can listen to her. The hospital staff, when it happens, offer comfort care, which amounts to holding the child until it dies. If they are lucky, they get a little love on the way out. Perhaps it is better than being drowned in a dish. 
   Jill Stanek says:  
   What do you call an abortion procedure in which the fetus is born alive, then is left to die without medical care? Infanticide? Murder? 
   Most people would recoil at just the thought of such a gruesome, uncaring procedure, but it is practiced at least one Chicago suburban hospital. When I called Christ Hospital, the Medical Center at Oak Lawn, I frankly expected a denial that it uses the procedure, but instead the spokeswoman explained it is used for ``a variety of second-trimester'' abortions when the fetus has not yet reached viability. That's up to 23 weeks of life, when a fetus is considered not yet developed enough to survive on its own. 
   Instead of medical care, the child is provided ``comfort care,'' wrapped in a blanket and held when possible.  
   This is very interesting.  
   The procedure is chosen by parents and doctors instead of another method in which the fetus is terminated within the womb by, for example, injection with a chemical that stops the heart.  
   She says further: One day there was a newborn who survived the abortion with no one around to hold it. It was left to die in a soiled-linen closet. 
   The hospital denies it. She says it happened. Interesting, the hospital says abortions are elective, but they are done only to protect the life or health of the mother or when the fetus is nonviable due to extreme prematurity or lethal abnormalities. 
   The nurse, Jill Stanek, said she has seen some elective abortions done on newborns whose physical or mental defects are deemed incompatible only with the ``quality of life.'' 
   That is pretty heavy stuff. This is going on in America. People come down here on this floor, year after year, and defend it. That is what they are doing, defending it: A woman's right to choose. The bassinet or the hospital sterile bucket, which is it? Right--right to choose. Put the child in the bassinet or throw it in the garbage or send it off to some research lab. 
   Here is a headline, a transcript from the WTVN-TV in Columbus, OH, 20 April, 1999:  
   Partial-Birth Abortion Baby Survives 3 Hours. 
   A woman 5 months pregnant came to Women's Medical Center in Dayton, Ohio, to get a partial-birth abortion. During the 3 days it takes to have the procedure she began to have stomach pains and was rushed to a nearby hospital. Within minutes she was giving birth. 
   Nurse Shelly Lowe in an emergency room at the hospital was shocked when the baby took a gasp of air. [Lowe] ``I just held her and it really got to me that anybody could do that to a baby.....I rocked her and talked to her because I felt that no one should die alone.'' The little girl survived 3 hours. 
   Mark Lally, Director of Ohio Right to Life, believes this is why partial birth abortions should be banned. [Lally] ``This shows what we've have been trying to make clear to people. Abortion isn't something that happens just early in pregnancy, it happens in all stages of pregnancy. It's legal in this state any time.''  
   Like it is in any State. 
   Warren Hern is the author of the most widely used textbook on abortion procedures. Dr. Hern says, in this article:  
   A number of practitioners attempt to ensure live fetuses after late abortions so that genetic tests can be conducted on them.  
   There is a link. They say there is no link? There is one.  
   It is his position that practitioners do this without offering a woman the option of fetal demise before abortion in a morally unacceptable manner since they place research before the good of their patients.

   Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. I thank the Chair. 
   Mr. President, the Senate now has acquired two documents which are very revealing in this debate, new information. I have a memorandum here which makes clear that neither the Department of Defense nor the Joint Chiefs of Staff were privy to the Department of Energy's lobbying effort vis-a-vis the White House to forgo all nuclear testing under the CTBT. This was never--in the words of a senior DOD official--coordinated with the Defense Department or the military. 
   These documents make it very clear that the Clinton administration ignored national security concerns expressed directly to the President of the United States in negotiating the CTBT and a further reason that the treaty should be rejected.

   Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, in the summary of the document to the President of the United States from Hazel O'Leary, the Energy Secretary, she said:  
   After careful and extended debate within the executive agencies, you are to be presented with a decision memorandum on whether the United States should conduct hydronuclear experiments at the Nevada test site (NTS) under the moratorium on nuclear testing. Although the views of the Department of Energy on this matter are reflected in that decision memorandum, I want to take this opportunity to strongly urge you to decide that the U.S. should not conduct, nor prepare to conduct, hydronuclear experiments during the existing moratorium.  
   In other words, the Secretary of Energy is asking the President of the United States to ignore the recommendations of the experts. 
   She states further in this memorandum to the President:  
   It is not technically essential to conduct hydronuclear experiments at this time. The Department of Energy has determined that the existing nuclear stockpile of the United States is safe and reliable and that technical means other than hydronuclear testing can maintain the stockpile in this robust condition for the near term.  
   She concludes in the memo to the President:  
   As a member of your cabinet with responsibility, with others, for carrying out your nonproliferation and national security agenda, I believe strongly that a decision to conduct, or to prepare to conduct, hydronuclear experiments under a nuclear testing moratorium is technically unwise and substantively unnecessary at this time. I urge you to decide not to authorize preparations for these experiments in the fiscal year 1996 .......  
   That is a very interesting memorandum from the Secretary of Energy to the President of the United States. 
   Now let us hear what the experts had to say. This is very interesting. In a memorandum from Dr. Harold Smith to John Deutch, Nuclear Weapons Council: Background, letter dated September 8 from Secretary O'Leary to the President was received in my office today by fax as a bootleg copy from the Los Alamos National Laboratory. Copies not distributed to OSD, DOD, Joint Staff, NSC or the Deputies, not distributed and not copied. 
   Then the subject, and it begins to analyze the O'Leary memo. Let me quote a couple of items. In the memo from O'Leary to the President, she says: Strongly urge you to not conduct or prepare to conduct hydronuclear experiments. They say: This circumvents the IWG deputies forum established by the NSC to decide this issue in an interagency process.

   Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. The second point in the O'Leary memo says: not technically essential to conduct hydronuclear experiments at this time. Hydronuclear experiments must be conducted while the stockpile is safe and reliable to acquire baseline data, otherwise HN, or hydronuclear, testing, as a diagnostic for stockpile problems, is of limited value. 
   These are the experts saying this in response. 
   Finally: Hydronuclear tests provide direct experimental testing of an unaltered real pit. No other technique provides that capability. This is what the experts in the Clinton administration believed. They were end run by the Secretary of Energy on a political decision, which basically said, don't worry about the science, just move forward with the policy. 
   This is outrageous. It flies in the face of every single point the President has made in saying we should pass this treaty.

   Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Madam President, it was interesting to hear my colleague from Delaware. He is correct. I remember those signs, ``One hydrogen bomb could ruin your day.'' I think the reason we are here today is a second hydrogen bomb that ruined their day. I think we need to make sure they understand we have the capability to respond in kind with weapons that will work. I think that is really the subject of the debate.

   Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Right. 
   The Senator from Delaware also said that if you can't verify the reliability or certify the reliability, you can always get out of the treaty. That is true. But my concern is, will it be too late to catch up at that point? How much time will have elapsed? 
   I wonder sometimes how the results of the cold war might have come out had we yielded to all of the arms control pressures and adopted every arms control agreement exactly as it was pushed upon us, not only in the Senate but also in the House over the years. I look at arms control agreements in the 1960s and 1970s and 1980s. In spite of the fact we had a full-scale Soviet expansion throughout the world and full-scale nuclear buildup and absolutely no verification for the most part and cheating year after year, time after time we still pushed hard for these arms control agreements.

   Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. They work if you want to accept the fact that they violated it. We got lucky. That is the bottom line. As to the violations that President Reagan said trust but verify, in this particular case, I am not prepared to trust the North Koreans or the Libyans or the Iranians or the Iraqis or the Red Chinese, No. 1; and, No. 2, we cannot verify anything they are doing. That has been testified to over and over and over again. 
   I rise in very strong opposition to this Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty and, in doing so, know full well that we have one of the greatest communicators and spinners in American history in the White House. The idea will be that this will become a political debate in that how could anyone not be in favor of or how could anybody be opposed to a comprehensive test ban where we would ban the testing of nuclear weapons. That is the way it will be spun. 
   The answer is very simple. Because if you can't verify what the other side is doing, then you are at a disadvantage because we have the superiority of the arsenal. So if we don't verify that they are not testing, and we don't keep our stockpile up to speed because of that, and we don't know it is reliable and they do, then we are gradually losing that advantage. That is the issue. 
   In spite of all the spin we will hear over the next day or two after this treaty is voted on, that is the crux of the 
   issue. Let us separate the spin. Let us take the politics out of this. Let us take the spin out of it and go right to the heart of it. We can't verify what they do, and if our stockpile is not reliable because we don't test, they gain on us. 
   The other point is, some of these nations, such as North Korea, might decide to test it on us and think nothing of it. Does anybody feel confident that the Iranians or the Iraqis would feel they had to test a nuclear weapon before they tried it on us? I don't feel that confident. I certainly don't think many in America do either. This treaty is wrong for our nuclear weapons program. It is wrong for America. It is wrong for the international community. It cannot be verified. It does not help us in maintaining our own stockpile. 
   Time after time the past several weeks, I have heard members of the administration try to spin this issue and claim that every President since Eisenhower has sought a comprehensive test ban. Basically, that is an attempt to hide the truth, to fool the American people into thinking this treaty would have had unanimous support from all of those Presidents. It wouldn't have had the unanimous support of those Presidents. To make those of us who oppose this treaty look as if we are standing out on the fringes is simply wrong. Yet that is the way it is reported. That is the way it is written. That is the way it will be spun tonight, tomorrow, and the next day by members of the administration as they  move out on to the talk shows--at taxpayers' expense, I might add--and criticize those of us in the Senate who in good conscience vote against this treaty. 
   What they haven't told the American people about these Presidents is that not one single President--not Eisenhower, not Kennedy, Johnson, Nixon, Carter, no one, not Reagan--no one until Bill Clinton ever proposed a test ban of zero yield and unlimited duration--zero yield, unlimited duration. 
   In the past few days, the spin machines have been working overtime telling the American people this issue is far too critical to national security for the Senate to make such a rash decision on its ratification. The administration now wants to pull the treaty, saying we haven't had enough time to study it. For up until a week or two ago, they were pushing us for a vote on it. 
   My colleague from Delaware mentioned the coup in Pakistan, did that bother me. No, frankly. I don't think it has a heck of a lot to do with this decision. I don't like to see coups anywhere. They contribute to the instability in the world. But it has nothing to do, in my view, with the issue before us. 
   I would like to remind my colleagues, this treaty was signed by President Bill Clinton in 1996 and transmitted to the Senate in 1997. Over 2 years, we have had this treaty before us. One of the problems I have in the Senate is that it doesn't matter how much time you spend on something or how long something is before this body; the only time we try to get really involved in it is when we are about to vote on something. Then those who haven't done their homework want to come out here and say we need more time. 
   We have had plenty of time. I have had 5 years of hearings on this issue. I chaired them myself and have listened to people testify for the past 5 years on this issue. I remind my colleagues, just a few months ago the minority threatened to hold up every single piece of legislation that came to the Senate floor until we agreed to have a vote on the test ban treaty. 
   Now they are criticizing us because we are having one. It was President Clinton and the minority who demanded the treaty be brought before the Senate; it was President Clinton and the minority who urged consideration; and it was President Clinton and the minority who scolded the majority for failing to act on this issue. That was 2, 3 weeks ago. 
   So when things go sour on the President, he has a unique way--and a very good way, frankly--of twisting things around to his benefit. We found that out here on the floor in a very important impeachment vote a few months ago. The President has been demanding a vote on this treaty for 2 years. Now he has it. But now it is our fault because he is not going to get the vote he wants. The President said in remarks on the 50th anniversary of the Chairmen of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, in August, 1999--not too many months ago--``I ask the Senate to vote for ratification as soon as possible.'' That was 2 months ago. He asked the Senate, ``to give its advice and consent to the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty this year.'' 
   The problem with the President is, he wants us to give consent, but he doesn't like our advice. That is the problem. The Constitution requires both advice and consent. This President needs to learn that the Senate is here to advise, and if you want the consent, then you need to advise and discuss. That is part of the process. It is part of the process in treaties, and it is part of the process in judicial nominations, and it is part of the process in other appointments in his administration. After 7 years, almost, he still hasn't learned that. 
   In his State of the Union, in 1998, President Clinton said, ``Approve the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty this year.'' That was last year. The Vice President, Mr. GORE, said, ``The U.S. Congress should act now to ratify the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.'' That now was July 23, 1998. 
   Now, because the votes are going against him, he is now saying we need more time, don't vote now. It is just spin at its best, and he is good at it; there is no question about it. That was pure partisan politics because when the majority leader finally consented and offered to bring the treaty to the floor, it was objected to. Let's remind the American people of that. You can bet the President is not going to remind them of that. This treaty was objected to when the majority leader asked to bring it to the floor. Then he offered a second time to bring the treaty to the floor and this body agreed by unanimous consent to a debate and a vote. 
   Let me say again: Unanimously, we agreed to a debate and a vote. 
   The minority party had ample opportunity at that time to object on the grounds that we haven't had enough time to study the treaty. Why didn't they say so then? Because the answer is, that is not the issue. We have had plenty of time to study the treaty. ``We haven't had enough time to have hearings,'' they said. The minority leader objected. Once the President sensed he was going to lose the vote, the spin machine began and he tried to figure out a way not to vote on what the President urged us so desperately to schedule in the first place--to avoid the vote he asked us to have. 
   I agreed with the President then that this treaty deserved consideration by the Senate. I wish we had more chance to advise, but he didn't choose that. So he asked for our consent. As it turns out, we are not going to give it to him. That is 
   our constitutional right. It should not be spun and changed. It should be truthfully debated. We are all accountable. Some have said they don't want to vote on this treaty. I am not one of those people. We are here to be held accountable; we are here to vote. That is why we are here. If we disagree, we can vote against it. If we agree, we can vote for it. 
   My objection to this treaty is not based on partisan politics; it is based on careful, thoughtful study of the treaty and its implications both here in the United States and around the world. I believe the world will be more unstable--contrary to the feelings of my colleague from Delaware--not a more stable place, and America's nuclear deterrent capability will become more unreliable than at any time in the history of America if this treaty were to be ratified. 
   There are three points that would support that argument: 
   One, the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty is not verifiable. 
   Two, the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty will not stop proliferation. 
   Three--and perhaps most important--the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty puts our nuclear arsenal at risk. 
   My job as chairman of the Strategic Subcommittee is to oversee that arsenal. I have been out to the labs, and I have had 5 or 6 years of hearings on these issues. Others will discuss the first two points in more depth than I will, and some have already. Let me focus on the third concern, which is that the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty is not verifiable. 
   Last week, we saw reports in the media that the CIA admitted they were unable to verify key tests that may even be taking place today. We can't base our national security on an ability --which arguably may not exist--to detect an adversary's covert activity, and that the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty will not stop proliferation. We already have a treaty in place to do that, the Non-Proliferation Treaty. This treaty has been violated repeatedly, over and over, year after year, by rogue nations that don't respect international law. 
   Do you think, with this kind of treaty, that every nation is going to have this great respect for international law and they are going to allow us total access to their country to verify this? When are we ever going to learn? Some have mentioned how futile the treaty would be in asking rogue nations not to test the same nuclear weapons they promised not to develop in the first place under the Non-Proliferation Treaty. And it is false hope that our adversaries will abide by international law if we just promise to do this treaty. 
   As I mentioned, the safety and reliability of the nuclear arsenal is my most serious concern. Rather than relying solely on the good intentions of other countries--and they may be good or they may not be--or on our ability to detect violations by other countries, my concern is ensuring that we remain capable of providing the safeguard and nuclear deterrent that won the cold war. That is what won the cold war--  the fact that other nations knew what would happen. They knew what would happen if they messed with us; we had the arsenal. 
   The linchpin of this treaty, as I see it, is whether or not you believe the United States can maintain a safe, credible, and reliable nuclear arsenal, given a zero-yield ban in perpetuity. The Stockpile Stewardship Program is really at the heart of this matter. If you think that we can have a reliable nuclear arsenal, with a zero-yield ban, in perpetuity, you should be for this treaty. Even the Secretary of Defense, William Cohen, has 
   illustrated this point. This was 2 days ago. I want this to be listened to carefully. During testimony before the Armed Services Committee.  
   Senator SNOWE. Would you support ratification of this treaty without the Stockpile Stewardship Program? 
   Secretary COHEN. No. 
   Senator SNOWE. No? So then, obviously, you are placing a great deal of confidence in this program. 
   Secretary COHEN. I oppose a unilateral moratorium, without some method of testing for the safety and security and reliability of our nuclear force. The question right now is, does the Stockpile Stewardship Program give us that assurance? If there is doubt about it, then, obviously, you would say we cannot rely upon it and we should go back to testing.  
   Let me repeat that last line:  
   If there is doubt about it, then, obviously, you would say we cannot rely upon it and we should go back to testing.  
   Well, that is a critical point. Which of us would knowingly ratify a treaty that was advertised to put the safety, reliability, and credibility of the United States nuclear deterrent stockpile at risk and place the lives of the American people at risk? None of us would do that. Certainly not us, not the Secretary, not anybody. But that is the linchpin. If you believe in the Stockpile Stewardship Program, a series of computer simulations and laser experiments--that is what the program is, that we don't need to test, and that we do these computer tests and laser experiments--if you think that can sufficiently guarantee the safety and reliability of our nuclear weapons program, without testing of any kind forever--forever--then you should vote for the treaty because that is what this is about. As the Senator from Delaware said, you can get out of the treaty, but if you don't like what is going on, then it is too late. 
   If, however, you do not believe that the Stockpile Stewardship Program can sufficiently guarantee the safety and reliability of our nuclear weapons programs, then you should vote against the treaty. 
   Well--as Chairman of the Strategic Forces Subcommittee, I have oversight of all three of the Nation's nuclear laboratories--Los Alamos, Lawrence Livermore, and Sandia. I have been to the labs, I have seen the computer simulations, I have talked with the physicists and programmers. Just last February Senator LANDRIEU and I traveled to Lawrence Livermore Lab for a field hearing and a very productive set of tours and briefings. 
   Based on my experience--based on what I've seen, I don't have the confidence that the Stockpile Stewardship Program can sufficiently guarantee the safety and reliability of our nuclear weapons arsenal--forever--without any testing of any kind. 
   But don't just take my word for it--after all I'm not a physicist--I'm not a nuclear lab director. To settle the question about whether this Stockpile Stewardship Program can guarantee the safety and reliability of our nuclear weapons, we must turn to those lab directors, the men directly responsible for administering, executing, and overseeing the Stockpile Program. 
   Those three gentlemen testified before the Armed Services Committee just last week, and I think it is absolutely critical to share that testimony with my colleagues as we debate this treaty. 
   Dr. John Browne, Director of Los Alamos National Laboratory, had this to say about the condition and reliability of the Stockpile Stewardship Program:  
   Maintaining the safety and reliability of our nuclear weapons without nuclear testing is an unprecedented technical challenge. 
   The Stockpile Stewardship Program is working successfully toward this goal, but it is a work in progress. 
   There are simply too many processes in a nuclear explosion involving too much physics detail to perform a complete calculation. At present, with the most powerful supercomputers on Earth, we know that we are not doing calculations with sufficient accuracy and with sufficient detail to provide maximum confidence in the stockpile. 
   We know that we do not adequately understand instabilities that occur during the implosion process and we are concerned about the aging of high explosives and plutonium that could necessitate remanufacture of the stockpile. 
   We do not know the details of how this complex, artificially produced metal (plutonium) ages, including whether pits fail gradually, giving us time to replace them with newly manufactured ones, or whether they fail catastrophically in a short time interval that would render many of our weapons unreliable at once. 
   It is important to note that even with a complete set of tools we will not be able to confirm all aspects of weapons safety and performance. Nuclear explosions produce pressures and temperatures that cannot be duplicated in any current or anticipated laboratory facility. Some processes simply cannot be experimentally studied on a small scale because they depend on the specific configuration of material at the time of the explosion. 
   On the basis of our experience in the last 4 years, we continue to be optimistic that we can maintain our nuclear weapons without testing. However, we have identified many issues that increase risk and lower our level of confidence.  
   Dr. Bruce Tarter, Director of Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory testified:  
   We have not been able to meet the deadlines of the program as we thought we could. 
   It (the stockpile stewardship program) hasn't been perfect--the challenge lies in the longer term. 
   The stockpile stewardship program is an excellent bet--but it's not a sure thing.  
   Dr. Paul Robinson, director of Los Alamos National Laboratory, which is responsible for the engineering of more than 90 percent of the component parts of all U.S. nuclear warheads, provided an even more ominous testimony.  
   There is no question from a technical point of view, actual testing of designs to confirm their performance is the desired regimen for any high-technology device. 
   For a device as highly consequential as a nuclear weapon, testing of the complete system both when it is first developed and periodically throughout its lifetime to ensure that aging effects do not invalidate its performance, is also the preferred methodology. 
   I could not offer a proof, nor can anyone, that such an alternative means of certifying the adequacy of the U.S. stockpile will be successful. I believe then as I do now that it may be possible to develop the stockpile stewardship approach as a substitute for nuclear testing for keeping previously tested nuclear weapon designs safe and reliable. However, this undertaking is an enormous challenge which no one should underestimate, and will carry a higher level of risk than at any time in the past. 
   The difficulty we face is that we cannot today guarantee that stockpile stewardship will be ultimately successful; nor can we guarantee that it will be possible to prove that it is successful. 
   Confidence in the reliability and safety of the U.S. nuclear weapons stockpile will eventually decline without nuclear testing. 
   The stockpile stewardship program--though essential for continual certification of the stockpile--does not provide a guarantee of perpetual certifiability. 
   I have always said actual testing is preferred method--to do otherwise is acceptable risk. 
   I cannot ensure the program will mature in time to ensure safety and reliability of our nuclear weapons stockpile in the future. 
   I have always felt if you are betting your country--you better be conservative.  
   I find this testimony absolutely chilling. I am not willing to ``Bet my country'' on the stockpile stewardship program. America's lab directors who are directly responsible for the execution of the stockpile stewardship program testified before Congress that this program cannot guarantee the future security or stability or our nuclear weapons. I am not willing to accept any risk. I will not risk the lies of the American people on a program who's director--empowered by the President with the responsibility for running that program--are so very uncertain about its reliability. 
   On the basis of the expert testimony of these three lab Directors alone, if any Senators had any doubt about how they would vote on this treaty--it should now be gone! 
   And I cannot for the life of me understand why the President would ask the Senate to ratify a treaty that 
   lives or dies based on the stockpile stewardship program--a program that our lab Directors are telling us they cannot guarantee! 
   If we ratify this treaty, there is a very high probability we will have to start looking for a way out of it within 10-15 years--maybe even sooner. I don't  understand entering into a treaty you know full well you may have to pull out of almost as soon as it goes into effect. 
   Now, supporters of the treaty will point out that if in fact the lab Directors, and the Secretary of Energy all agree in 10 years that the stockpile stewardship isn't working, the President, in consultation with Congress, can just pull us out of the treaty. 
   Well, treaties tend to take on a life of their own, and I do not believe it would be that easy. Just look at the ABM Treaty of 1972. Our co-signer, the U.S.S.R. doesn't even exist anymore, and although there is overwhelming agreement between the defense and intelligence communities, and the American public, that our national interests are at stake, the President still opposes pulling out of the ABM Treaty! 
   The Nuclear Test Ban Treaty of 1963 and the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty of 1968 are two more examples. These treaties have both been violated. But have we pulled out of either one despite the legal right to do so--absolutely not! 
   My friends and colleagues, it makes no sense to ratify a treaty that our own nuclear experts tell us we may have to negotiate a way out of within a decade. 
   This treaty is dangerous and ill-advised. It places our nuclear stockpile, and hence our nuclear deterrent capability, at considerable risk. This treaty is bad for America, and it is bad for the international community, and I will vote against it. 
   That is if I'm given the opportunity to vote against it. While Senate Democrats and the White House are back pedaling furiously, some in the Senate are anxious to rescue them from their miscalculation and deliver them from a major legislative defeat. It might be tempting to view this as a ``win-win'' situation for those who oppose the treaty. The reasoning goes like this: If we effectively kill this flawed treaty without a vote, we will have forced the White House to back down, and have won without letting the White House accuse us of killing the treaty. This is superficially appealing. But it is a strategy for, at best, a half-victory, and at worst, a partial defeat. 
   Postponing a vote on the CTBT will allow the White House to claim victory in saving the treaty, and will allow the White House to continue to spin the American people by blaming opponents for not ratifying the treaty. There is no conservative victory in that. 
   Every single Senator knows today how he or she will vote on this treaty. More debate and more hearings won't change that. It's time to put partisan politics aside and stand firm on our beliefs. The die is cast, and Republicans and Democrats alike have staked out their positions. It's time for Senators to stand by those positions and vote their conscience. Mr. President, I oppose postponing the vote on this treaty, and I urge my colleagues to do the same. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, this is a very simple, straightforward amendment that would prohibit enforcing Davis-Bacon prevailing wage requirements in areas designated by the President as natural disaster areas. Section 6 of the Federal Davis-Bacon Act allows the President to suspend this act in the event of a national emergency. 
   I think all of us would agree, especially those Senators in North Carolina and in Virginia as well, that we did have a national emergency with Hurricane Floyd. 
   Pursuant to this authority, President Bush suspended Davis-Bacon in 1992 to help speed up and lower the cost of rebuilding the communities ravaged by Hurricanes Andrew and Iniki. 
   So Hurricane Floyd has dealt this tremendous blow to the residents of the eastern seaboard, from Florida to North Carolina, even as far as New York. FEMA has called this one of the biggest multistate disasters in U.S. history. Many States believe cleanup costs from Hurricane Floyd will far exceed the costs of either Hurricanes Fran or Hugo. So relaxing the Davis-Bacon provisions in these hard-hit States will lower tremendously the cost of rebuilding these communities and help create job opportunities for those in need of work. 
   Many people come to these communities and volunteer their time to help their friends and relatives and neighbors in need, and others cut their costs of services to help these unfortunate  victims of the hurricanes. Davis-Bacon's prevailing wage requirements will increase the cost of construction, forcing the taxpayers to pay more and receive less in return. Not only that, it will cost the victims more. So that is why there is a provision, a waiver provision, the President may exercise to bring these costs down in times of disasters. 
   Government estimates, economic studies, and those involved in the construction industry believe Davis-Bacon actually inflates the cost of a construction project by an estimated 5 to 38 percent. For people who are the victims of these hurricanes--where there is Federal help--to have to pay more in these construction projects and for it to cost the taxpayers that much more money is outrageous. CBO estimates that Davis-Bacon adds $9.6 billion over 10 years to the cost of all Federal construction projects. 
   The historic floodwaters of Floyd have resulted in hundreds of millions of dollars in property damage and created a huge swath of human misery that will last for months. The Davis-Bacon Act should be suspended to aid disaster relief in the areas designated as natural disasters. It is reasonable. That is why there is a provision for a waiver. It is unfortunate President Clinton has decided not to waive it, or at least has not waived it to this point. 
   On September 21, 1999, the Wall Street Journal, in an editorial entitled ``Hurricane Davis-Bacon,'' stated:  
   Folks whose electricity shorted out when floodwaters hit their circuit box or shopkeepers sweeping the mud and debris out from once-vibrant businesses need no reminders about the costs imposed by Hurricane Floyd. But as they go about their repairs they may find that the destructive powers of Mother Nature are nothing compared with those of Washington.  
   Continuing to quote:  
   Start with the Davis-Bacon Act, which effectively requires that workers on federally subsidized construction projects receive union wages--even though only about a quarter of the construction industry is unionized. Davis-Bacon looms large in the wake of Floyd because so much disaster relief comes from the federal government. It was for precisely this reason in 1992 that President George Bush ordered the relaxation of Davis-Bacon rules to hasten repairs in Florida, Louisiana and Hawaii after hurricanes devastated those states.  
   Continuing to quote from the Wall Street Journal:  
   The happy result was twofold: Not only did the work get done faster, between 5,000 and 11,000 new construction jobs, mostly to semi-skilled minority workers, were created. Alas, the jobs didn't last long. Within days of becoming President in 1993, Bill Clinton revoked the Bush waivers on Davis-Bacon as a payback for organized labor's support. Mr. Clinton's continued defense is particularly galling to many minority workers, conscious of the law's origins in the Jim Crow attitudes of the 1930s. ``People can't see the jobs and buildings that aren't created because of Davis-Bacon, but it is a major factor in the low-income housing crisis,'' says Elzie Higginbottom, a low-income housing builder from Chicago's South Side.  
   Clearly the priority after any natural disaster must be getting help to the people who need it. But as we help the victims of Floyd pump water out of their basements and get their lives back on track, let's be careful not to contribute to the structural damage with ..... Davis-Bacon that only raise costs and make it that much harder to do the work that needs to be done.  
   I think that editorial sums it up about as well as it can be summed up. The bottom line is, this act, which, ironically, discriminated against minorities--and that was the purpose of the act when it was first originated--will cost taxpayers millions of dollars and take advantage of an unfortunate situation where people have suffered through a disaster. 
   I ask, what would be the problem of the President granting a waiver of Davis-Bacon? As I said before--and I think the Wall Street Journal said it better than I--the answer is, because the President owes a lot to organized labor, he is not about to do it. I think it is outrageous because the intent was clear. 
   I will read from a letter from 80 organizations in support of my amendment. The list includes a number of outstanding national organizations. It also includes several State organizations representing some of the States that have been hit hardest by Hurricane Floyd and other disasters. It is the Coalition to Repeal the Davis-Bacon Act.  
   It is unfair to further burden the local communities devastated by Hurricane Floyd and other disasters with the inflated costs of Davis-Bacon.  
   Mr. President, I think Senators will recognize some of the organizations--I will not read them all; there are 80--the American Society of Civil Engineers, the American Trucking Association, Associated Builders and Contractors, Citizens Against Government Waste, Citizens for a Sound Economy, Free Enterprise Institute, National Association of Home Builders, National Association of Manufacturers, National Center for Neighborhood Enterprise, National Federation of Independent Business, National League of Cities, National School Boards Association, National Tax Limitation Committee, National Taxpayers Union, U.S. Chamber of Commerce, to name a few of the 80.

   Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I find some of the remarks of my colleagues very interesting. To say this is a partisan attack against working people is so outrageous and so untrue that it barely deserves a response. People who don't belong to unions also have families. They also need to feed those families. Let's understand what is happening, if we can tone down the rhetoric a little bit. Nonunion workers who want to stand side by side with the volunteers, who perhaps are putting sandbags up to stop the floodwaters from coming into somebody's home, are asking to work at a lesser wage than the union worker to help these people out. And they can't do it under the Davis-Bacon provision. 
   That is what we are talking about. There is no concern expressed on the other side about the nonunion worker's family; it is only the union worker's family. We have people who are volunteering for no money, no pay, to stand and help these victims of floods and other disasters, and then we have nonunion people who are saying, look, maybe I am off from school, or maybe I am taking off a few days from my own job to help my friends, and I am willing to work for $5, $6, or $7 an hour, something less than the prevailing union wage. They can't do it. That is what we are talking about. This is the issue. 
   This is nothing more than a payback for the huge contributions that come in from the labor unions, pure and simple. That is all it is. There is no excuse for this. The provisions in the law are very clear. The President could easily waive Davis-Bacon under the law, if he wished, but he doesn't want to do that. That is what we are hearing from the other side--lack of concern for the working man, unless he is a union man. If he is a union man, we have to protect him. If he is a nonunion man, who cares, we don't care about his family.

   Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, it is interesting that in those 36 disasters that the Senator from Nevada spoke of, the President has not decided to waive Davis-Bacon. 
   The history on it is remarkable. We have had bipartisan votes on this floor on Davis-Bacon in the past in terms of some disasters. Presidents Roosevelt and Nixon also suspended Davis-Bacon to alleviate administrative confusion and delay, and to control inflation. 
   There is a long--as I mentioned earlier, President Bush--history of bipartisan waivers and relaxation of the Davis-Bacon provisions.

   Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I will read a brief excerpt from that editorial, called ``End of Payoff.'' It says:  
   Here in Michigan, former deputy state treasurer and Hillsdale College economics professor Gary Wolfram has estimated that the prevailing wage law costs State taxpayers $70 million to $100 million more than they would necessarily have to pay each year for State and local public works projects.  
   I am having a hard time understanding how it helps working men and women to increase their taxes to pay to clean up disaster areas. If somebody could explain that to me, I might exchange my position. 
   For the life of me, I don't understand how it makes sense to charge the taxpayers more money to clean up in unfortunate situations where we have disasters. It makes no sense to me. 
   I conclude by saying that the Davis-Bacon Act is a Depression-era wage subsidy law. Its intent was demonstrated in the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD, which was to preserve northern construction jobs for white union men, and to prevent them from being taken by less expensive southern black labor. 
   That was the original intent of that law, and its impact on taxpayers wastes valuable Federal tax dollars. It is a discriminatory law that limits equal access to work opportunities. 
   Finally, no one should take unfair advantage of people who are the victims of disasters. 
   As I said to you earlier, volunteers give their time, and nonunion people would like to come and help. They are going to be denied the right. They are not going to be able to work for the taxpayers or the Federal Government at a wage less than the prevailing union wage. It is going to cost the taxpayers. 
   Those people who would like to help and who also have families to feed are going to be denied work. They are going to be told: Go home. You can't work because we have to pay a wage higher than for which you are willing to work. 
   That is un-American. In America, it is an agreement between the employer and the employee. If an employee wants to work for less, then the employee has the right to do it. 
   I urge support of my amendment and oppose the motion to table.

   Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, a couple of days ago on the Senate floor, one of my colleagues, Senator LEAHY from Vermont, made some remarks regarding the possible motives of some of us who made a vote on a particular nominee, Ronnie White of Missouri to the Federal court. I want to read from the Senate manual what we all know as rule XVIIII. I want to indicate before reading that I do not believe Senator LEAHY violated that rule. That is not the purpose of bringing this up. 
   The rule says:  
   No Senator in debate shall, directly or indirectly, by any form of words impute to another Senator or to other Senators--  
   Plural--  
   any conduct or motive unworthy or unbecoming of a Senator.  
   That rule is very clear, and it is not very often throughout the history of the Senate that rule has been violated. 
   I want to quote what Senator LEAHY said on October 5 on the Senate floor after the vote on Ronnie White. He said:  
   Mr. President, I have to say this with my colleagues present. When the full history of Senate treatment of the nomination of Justice Ronnie White is understood, when the switches and politics that drove the Republican side of the aisle are known, the people of Missouri and the people of the United States will have to judge whether the Senate was unfair to this fine man and whether their votes served the interests of justice and the Federal courts.  
   Then the Senator from Vermont concluded by saying:  
   I am hoping--and every Senator will have to ask himself or herself this question--the United States has not reverted to a time in its history when there was a color test on nominations.  
   The reason why I say rule XVIIII was not violated in that case, I believe, although the Senator from Vermont may have walked up to the line--he did not cross it--is because he said ``I am hoping.'' I, therefore, will not make any contest at this point on that. 
   It concerned me deeply that those comments were made. I want to say for the record, and it is interesting because I spoke to at least a dozen colleagues who voted the same way I did, in opposition to this nominee--not that it matters--who did not even know what race Mr. White was. I didn't know. I had no idea, and I had numerous conversations about this nominee over the course of several weeks and months, as his nomination was pending. I never knew what his race was nor would I care because I wouldn't want to look, frankly. What difference does it make? It doesn't make any difference to me. 
   This went further than the Senate floor, which is quite disturbing. In the Washington Post today is in an article, ``Deepening Rift Over Judge Vote, Minorities Confirmed At a Lower Rate.'' That was the Washington Post story. Very prominently pictured in the article is a picture of Ronnie White, and in addition, Senators ASHCROFT and BOND. There is an implication there that I don't like.  
   In the article, we have Governor Mel Carnahan, who happens to be the opponent of Senator ASHCROFT in the election in Missouri for the Senate, who said:  
   ``Judge White is a highly qualified lawyer and judge and the [death penalty] figures were manipulated by Senator Ashcroft to undermine him,'' Carnahan said.  
   Then it got a little worse from the Chief Executive of the United States of America. I want to point out, if President Bill Clinton were Senator Bill Clinton, and he said what I am about to read, in my view, he would have violated rule XVIIII. That is why I bring it up. Here is what the President said about all of us who voted against Mr. White's nomination: 
   Yesterday's defeat of Ronnie White's nomination for the federal district court judgeship in Missouri was a disgraceful act of partisan politics. The Republican-controlled Senate is adding credence to the perception that they treat minority and women judicial nominees unfairly and unequally.  
   That basically is a direct attack on all of us and our motives, basically accusing us of being--the implication is that we are racists, that we do not treat minorities fairly, and that we discriminate against women as well. 
   That came from the President of the United States. 
   I will also quote from an article in the Washington Times today in relation to J.C. Watts, the most prominent African American Republican in the Congress of the United States, who was also deeply offended, as he should have been, by these remarks. It is interesting what Chairman Watts of the House Republican Conference said. This is J.C. Watts talking:  
   ``It is fascinating to me that racism often is defined, not by your skin color, but by your ideology,'' said Mr. Watts, the lone black Republican in the House, in a luncheon with editors and reporters at The Washington Times.  
   He said further:  
   Unless you're a Democrat. It's OK to do it to black Republicans, black conservatives. But don't do it to a black Democrat.  
   Then it is racial. 
   It really is troublesome to me that we create these barriers between us. 
   President Clinton said:  
   [By voting down] the first African American judge to serve on the Missouri State Supreme Court, the Republican-controlled Senate is adding credence to the perceptions that they treat minority and women judicial nominees unfairly and unequally.  
   But anyway, it is troubling to me that these kinds of things happen. I voted against the nominee because of his views on some issues. I spoke to this on the Senate floor on the same day. I am quoting myself now:  
   In the case of Justice White, who now serves on the Supreme Court in Missouri, he has demonstrated that he is an activist, and has a political slant to his opinions in favor of criminal defendants and against prosecutors. It is my belief that judges should interpret the law, and not impose their own political viewpoints.  
   That is why I voted against Ronnie White. 
   Prominent law enforcement people in Missouri were also opposed to him, and said so, as Senator ASHCROFT made very clear. 
   It is troubling to me that this issue raises its ugly head when somebody happens to be African American. I thought really we would get beyond this. It would have been nice if the President of the United States had said: Ninety-two percent of the minority nominations that have come through this Senate have been confirmed, most of them unanimously without even a recorded vote. It would have been nice if the President said that was pretty good on the part of this Senate, instead of singling out one who had not been confirmed for, I believe, good reason. 
   One of the things you find out in the Senate, if you stay here long enough, is that you probably have said something somewhere along the line you would like to take back. I am going to say up front regarding my colleague from Vermont, I do not impugn his motives, but it is interesting that Senator LEAHY did not vote to confirm Clarence Thomas. He voted against Clarence Thomas, a very prominent member of the Supreme Court who happens to be African American--a man I was proud to support. I did not hear the President mention any of us who voted for Clarence Thomas, an African American. The reason is very simple: Clarence Thomas is a conservative. That is the reason. 
   I would never impugn my colleague's motives for voting against Clarence Thomas. I assume he voted against Clarence Thomas because he was a conservative, he did not like his politics, did not like his views on abortion and other issues. I believe that. 
   I say, without any hesitation, if my colleague were here on the floor now, I would look at him and say: Absolutely, I believe you, that that is your motive, and no other motive. 
   There was also another vote in 1989 in committee, for a gentleman by the name of William Lucas. Lucas was President Bush's pick for Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights. He happens to be African American. Lucas's nomination never got to the Senate floor. The vote in Judiciary was 7-7. The Senator from Vermont voted no. Again, I would never use the issue of race to say that was the reason for his vote. I would not even imply it. 
   So I think it is important that we move beyond this, stop this divisiveness, and give people the benefit of the doubt, and particularly Senator HATCH who so many times has brought nominees whom you and I--I would say to the Senator in the Chair, I myself have often disagreed with Senator HATCH on some 
   of the nominations he has brought, but he has brought them forth I think probably more fairly than he should have in terms of the nominations he brings forth. 
   So to throw that blanket over 54 individuals who voted the way they did, or even to imply it, is unfortunate. 
   So I say, to set the record straight, I am going to vote against a person who I think is an activist, who does not represent the views that I believe should be on the court, no matter what the color, and, most frankly, without knowing the color if I can help it because I do not think it matters. It is unfortunate in this case that we came to that. 
   Mr. President, I want to touch on one other issue before we close up the Senate.

   Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. A few days ago, on October 4, I indicated that there were 88 days until the Panama Canal would be turned over to the Chinese--to the Panamanians and ultimately into the hands of the Chinese Communists. That was October 4. 
   Today is the 7th, so we have 87, 86, 85--we are down to 85 days before the canal is closed, will be turned over to the Chinese. I have a chart here on which I will put some stickers to cross those days off. The days go fast. I point out that we are going to see this canal in the hands of a nation that does not have positive feelings toward the United States--to put it as nicely as I can. So this is the flag of Communist China. So now 3 more days have gone by. 
   I recently addressed this issue of Panama and the impending turnover on October 4, a few days ago. Again, 3 more days have passed. The countdown continues. On December 31, this canal leaves the control of the United States and will come into the hands of the Chinese Communists. 
   In his book, ``The Path Between the Seas,'' David McCullough's history of the canal reminds us of its historic importance:  
   The creation of the Panama Canal was far more than a vast, unprecedented feat of engineering. It was a profoundly important historic event and a sweeping human drama not unlike that of war. ..... 
   Great reputations were made and destroyed. For numbers of men and women, it was the venture of a lifetime. ..... Because of it, one nation, France, was rocked to its foundations. Another, Colombia, lost its most prized possession, the Isthmus of Panama. .....The Republic of Panama was born. The United States was embarked on a role of global involvement.  
   So while the United States has no assurances it may remain in Panama after December 31, despite overwhelming public opinion in Panama in support of a continued U.S. presence-- 
   we are going to be leaving--the Chinese firm of Hutchison Whampoa will be there in the ports of Cristobal and Balboa on both sides of the canal, having won, through what was widely regarded as a corrupt bidding practice, the right to lease the ports for 25 years and beyond. Both sides of the canal will now be in the control of the Chinese. 
   After the United States withdraws from Panama, December 31, there is no doubt that a security vacuum will be  created. Who is going to fill it? We have less than 3 months, 85 days, a very short window of time to try to work out a solution that is mutually acceptable to us and to the Panamanians. 
   Let us look at the status of the transition. What bothers me is that this administration is doing nothing to try to renegotiate those leases or to somehow talk with the Panamanians to try to get us to remain there. To date, we have transferred to the Government of Panama 57,000 acres--remember, we spent $32 billion building that canal--57,000 acres and 3,000 buildings controlled by our military, including schools, hospitals, houses, airports, seaports, roads, and bridges. It represents about 62 percent of the total property. 
   As of July 1 of this year, U.S. troop strength was down from 10,000 in February 1994 to a little over 1,200, so we are just about finished. All U.S. presence on the Atlantic side was terminated on 30 June with the transfer of Fort Sherman and Pina Range. The remaining 36,000 acres and 1,900 facilities will be transferred to the Government of Panama as follows: On the 28th of July, the Empire Range for the Army and the Balboa West Range for the Air Force will go. On the 13th of August, the U.S. Army mortuary--these are what has already happened--on the 17th of August, the Curundu Middle School; on the 1st of November, Fort Kobbe, Howard Air Force base, Farfan housing and radio site will go; Curundu Laundry; Fort Clayton, West and East Corozal; Building 1501, Balboa, and Ancon Hill communications site; and on December 31, the grand enchilada, the big prize, the Panama Canal itself, gone, without a whimper. 
   It troubles me this issue has not even entered the Presidential debate in this country. There is no one at the State Department or in the Defense Department or in the White House talking to the Panamanians about reopening the bidding process or renegotiating leases to try to get in there ahead of the Chinese company. As if to rub it in, to rub salt in the wound even more, the actual turnover is going to take place on December 10. Perhaps they advanced the date so it wouldn't interfere with our Christmas or New Year's Eve parties or maybe they were afraid of Y2K. Maybe they were afraid we would get stuck there. 
   The bottom line is, on December 10 we will turn it over, which is about 21 days earlier than we should. So I want to elaborate, again, on the significance of the canal to seapower, to our Navy, and to the importance of preserving both the spirit and the letter of the neutrality treaty. 
   I will now discuss the background of a controversial law in Panama known as Law 5. 
   President Teddy Roosevelt was a reader and admirer of Alfred Thayer Mahan, a gentleman regarded by many as the father of the modern American Navy. Mahan's book, ``The Influence of Sea Power,'' had a profound impact on Theodore Roosevelt. Mahan traced the rise and decline of past maritime powers and concluded that supremacy at sea translated into national greatness and commercial success. We are essentially an island or, more specifically, a peninsula nation. The Navy is very important to us. 
   Roosevelt, whose first published work was ``The Naval War of 1812,'' had read Mahan's book and understood its importance. It prompted him to be a strong advocate of constructing the canal, to be sure the United States would have easy access through the isthmus of Panama and into the Pacific from the Atlantic and vice versa. 
   In World War II, damage to the canal could have and would have delayed the buildup of our war efforts in the Pacific big time. I can't imagine what it would be like to not have been able to use the canal. It would have delayed the flow of supplies to Great Britain, the Soviet Union, the dispatch of essential war materials from South America to the United States, and on and on. 
   I am concerned that some officials in Panama might be somewhat naive about the canal's security and about world history. In June, the then Panamanian Foreign Minister disagreed sharply with General Wilhelm, head of SOUTHCOM, who had testified before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that Panamanian security forces were undermanned and ill equipped to deal with growing threats from Colombian guerrilla incursions and drug traffickers. Panama's Foreign Minister at that time, Jorge Ritter, said the general's statements were inadmissible and argued that ``never have the U.S. military forces been here to guard our borders, and they have even less to do with the security of Panama, nor do they have anything to do with the security of the canal.'' 
   Even more surprisingly, the Foreign Minister alleged that the growth of drugs in Panama did not begin with withdrawal of U.S. troops but, instead, grew while there were military bases 
   in Panama. 
   Perhaps this gentleman, with all due respect, has forgotten what happened in 1989. During questioning before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Adm. Thomas Moorer, former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, was asked if the 1977 treaty had been more helpful or more harmful to U.S. interests. Moorer's immediate response was that 26 soldiers had died in Operation Just Cause in 1989. Among the reasons for the military intervention--to thwart drug trafficking, to preserve democracy in Panama, and to defend the canal--26 Americans gave their lives. To have Mr. Ritter make those kinds of statements is outrageous. 
   Part of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing testimony includes some interesting commentary on the background of Mr. Ritter. He was the president of the Panama Canal Authority. He was also the chief Panamanian negotiator who reportedly torpedoed the base talks in Panama. He was tied by the Panamanian press and outside press to the highest levels of drug cartels and served as Panama's ambassador to Colombia during the time that Manuel Noriega was doing business with the drug cartels in Colombia. He was Noriega's point man, bottom line. 
   It was also reported to the press that Ritter had issued a Panamanian ID card for Jorge Escobar, which was found on him when he died in Colombia in a shoot-out with law enforcement. I am not surprised that Mr. Ritter downplayed the importance of the canal and U.S. military base rights. It doesn't surprise me at all. 
   Hopefully, with the recent inauguration of President Moscoso, that attitude, as expressed by the former Foreign Minister, has changed. I hope it has. I am told that the new Panamanian President was planning to visit but, for whatever reason, I am not sure, canceled her trip. I had hoped to have the opportunity to meet with her. Hopefully, we will be able to do that at some point in the future. 
   I have been informed that, unlike her predecessor, President Moscoso would like to do business with the United States and would like to be above board with the negotiations. I wish her much success. I hope she realizes how important her actions are. It would be nice if some in the State Department and the administration would talk with her and encourage her in the next few weeks and months. 
   I also hope that it is not too late for her to weigh in on the decision about the leases at Cristobal and Balboa. I realize that would take a lot of political courage for her, but I hope she will give a thorough review of the bidding process, its known irregularities, and its compliance with both the spirit and the letter of the canal and neutrality treaty. 
   In conclusion, this Law 5 reportedly does the following: It gives responsibility for hiring new pilots for the canal who control the ships passing through the canal. It gives Hutchison Whampoa, the Chinese company, the right to possess Rodman Naval Station when it reverts to Panama this year. It gives the authority to control the order of ships utilizing the entrance to the canal and to deny ships access to the ports and entrances of the canal, if they are deemed to be interfering with Hutchinson's business operations. Contrast this with the explicit grant of expeditious passage in the 1977 treaty, which the Panama Canal treaty gave to the U.S. Navy. 
   Now we are seeing the Chinese Communists--and there are thousands of Chinese now in Panama. People say: Well, it is private business. There is no private business in China. It is all controlled by the government, whatever they do. So this is government business in China. It is Chinese Communist government in Panama by the Chinese. Law 5 gives the right to transfer unilaterally its rights to a third party to  any company or any country they select. This ought to be troublesome, and yet it is not even on the radar screen in the political debates around our country today. 
   Certain public roads could become private in a hurry, which could impact canal access. 
   This Hutchison Whampoa deal includes U.S. Naval Station Rodman, as mentioned previously; U.S. Air Station Albrook; Diablo; Balboa, a Pacific U.S.-built port; Cristobal, an Atlantic U.S.-built port; the island of Telfers, strategically located adjacent to Galeto Island, a critical communications center. 
   Telfers Island is said to be the future home of a Chinese work in progress, an export zone, called the ``Great Wall of China'' project. 
   I cannot understand how we can ignore this presence into the Western Hemisphere. Monroe would turn over in his grave. The Monroe Doctrine said that foreign European nations, and other nations around the world, should stay out of the Western Hemisphere. Yet, here they are. 
   Law 5 is subservient to the 1977 treaty. But if we fail to notice the discrepancies and fail to act upon those discrepancies, or to point out there are potential compliance problems, then we lose the opportunity to respond. 
   As I said before, I don't have the easel here now, but it's 84 more days. We will come back next week, and I will come back with the chart and it will be 79 days, or whatever it happens to be. But as each day ticks off, another day goes by--another day we haven't talked to President Moscoso and we haven't tried to reopen the negotiations, and we are another day closer to turning the Panama Canal not over to the Panamanians, but to the Chinese Communists--and not a whimper from anybody in the State Department, or the President, the Defense Department, Presidential campaigns, or anywhere. So the days are getting short. I think that I have an obligation to tell the American people, on a day-to-day basis--remind them--about what is going on.

   Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, the foreign operations conference report includes a major concession to the Clinton administration--it strikes language which attempted to stop U.S. taxpayer dollars from being used to promote abortion abroad, imposing an imperialistic, left-wing, pro-death agenda on the nearly 100 countries who have, for deeply-held religious reasons, upheld the sanctity of human life and who believe that life, including lives of the innocent and unborn, are sacred in God's eyes. 
   Regrettably, the House-passed language, the Smith-Barcia Foreign Families Protection amendment, while not cutting funding for the international population assistance, would have at least restored the prohibition on using these funds to support foreign organizations that lobby to repeal or undermine the laws of foreign governments against abortion. Since the Senate refused to negotiate with the House on a proposed compromise on the issue, as a result, the conference report on foreign operations has no pro-life safeguards. The Senate conferees did not accept the House's proposal to reinstate last year's ban on funding for the U.N. Population Fund in exchange for dropping the Foreign Families Protection Act Amendment. 
   The UNFPA has cooperated with the Peoples Republic of China in implementing coercive population control including forced abortion and sterilization. There are examples of poor people around the world being coerced into sterilization and fertility experimentation, sometimes, as was reported in Peru, by the threat of withholding food aid. 
   More recently, in Kosovo, Concerned Women for America reported that while refugees sought water, clothing and other basic necessities, the UNFPA and Planned Parenthood delivered what they considered ``life-saving supplies''--working with the UNHCR, whey dispatched ``emergency reproductive health kits'' for about 350,000 people for a period of 3 to 6 months. 
   These kits included oral and indictable contraception kits, sexually transmitted disease kits, intrauterine device (IUDs) kits, complications of abortion kits, vacuum extraction equipment and, condoms (UNFPA press release, 4/8/99).

   Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I am opposed to the nominations of Raymond Fisher to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit and Ronnie White to the Eastern District of Missouri. 
   Our judicial system is supposed to protect the innocent and ensure justice, which is what it has done for the most part for over 200 years. However, there have been glaring exceptions: the Dred Scott decision, which ruled that blacks were not citizens and had no rights which anyone was bound to respect, and Roe versus Wade, which similarly ruled that an entire class of people, the unborn, are not human beings and therefore are undeserving of any legal protection. 
   Both decisions, made by our Nation's highest court, violated two key constitutional provisions for huge segments of the population. Dred Scott, which legally legitimized slavery, deprived nearly the entire black population of the right to liberty, while Roe has taken away the right to life of 35 million unborn children since 1973. Both created rights, the right to own slaves and the right to an abortion, that were not in the Constitution. Of course, both are morally and legally wrong. Sadly, only Dred has been overturned, by the 13th and 14th amendments. Congress and the courts have yet to reverse Roe. 
   The only requirement, the only standard that I have for any judicial nominees is that they not view ``justice'' as the majorities did in Dred Scott and Roe, and that they uphold the standards and timeless principles so clearly stated in our Constitution. 
   Unfortunately, I do not believe that Mr. White and Mr. Fisher meet those critical standards. During the committee hearings, Mr. Fisher fully indicated to me that he would uphold the constitutional and moral travesties of Roe and Planned Parenthood versus Casey. Mr. White has also given answers which strongly suggest that he believes Roe was correctly decided by the Supreme Court. In addition, Mr. White's dubious actions as chairman of a Missouri House committee when a pro-life bill was before it further proves that he would enthusiastically enforce the pro-abortion judicial decree of Roe versus Wade. 
   The Framers of our Constitution believed we are endowed by our Creator with certain unalienable rights. Roe not only violates the 5th and 14th amendments, it violates the first and most fundamental right that we have as human beings and no court, liberal or conservative, can take away that right. 
   As a U.S. Senator, I recognize the awesome responsibility that we have to confirm, or deny, judicial nominees. I recognize the solemn obligation that we have to make sure that our Federal courts are filled only with judges who uphold and abide by the transcendent ideals explicitly stated in our Constitution and the Bill of Rights. The judges we confirm or deny will be among the greatest and far-reaching of our legacies, and I for one do not ever want my legacy to be that I confirmed pro-abortion judges to our Nation's courts. 
   This is why I will not support the nominations of Mr. White and Mr. Fisher. I will not support any judges who deny the undeniable connection that must exist, in a free and just civilization, between humanity and personhood. Our judges should be the very embodiment of justice. How can we then approve of those who will deny justice to most defenseless and innocent of us all? 
   But, further, I would add that these nominees propose a more general concern in that they are liberal activists. In the case of Justice White, who now serves on the Supreme Court in Missouri, he has demonstrated that he is an activist, and has a political slant to his opinions in favor of criminal defendants and against prosecutors. It is my belief that judges should interpret the law, and not impose their own political viewpoints. 
   He is strongly opposed by the law enforcement community in Missouri, and was directly opposed by the Missouri Association of Police Chiefs due to his activist record. 
   Senator ASHCROFT spoke in more detail about Justice White's activist record. Coming from the same State, Senator ASHCROFT is in an even better position to comment on Justice White's record. But, he laid out a very disturbing record of judicial activism in Justice White's career, particularly on law and order matters, and I simply do not think that this is the kind of person we need on the U.S. District Court. 
   With regard to Mr. Fisher, this is a critical slot because of the nature of the Ninth Circuit. This circuit has gained such a bad reputation for its liberal opinions that it has been referred to as a ``rogue'' circuit. It is controlled by an extreme liberal element and it is important that our appointments to this circuit be people who can restore at least some level of constitutional scrutiny. 
   In the case of Mr. Fisher, this clearly will not be the case. He is not a judge, and therefore, there is not the kind of judicial paper trail that we have with Justice White. However, he has a long record of liberal political activism for causes that run contrary to the Constitution. If he is willing to thwart the Constitution in his political activism, what makes us think he will uphold it in his judicial opinions. He took an active role in supporting the passage of proposition 15 in California regarding registration of handguns. This kind of hostility to the second amendment will not make matters any better on the Ninth Circuit. He very actively supported employment benefits for homosexual partners, and I found him to be very evasive in his responses to questions during the Committee hearings. Given the importance of this circuit and its demonstrated bias toward the left, this nominee, who himself is a liberal activist, is not the right person to help restore some constitutionality to this circuit. 
   So, I would urge my colleagues to vote against these two judges. We have sworn duty to support and defend the Constitution. This is never more critical than when we exercise our advise and consent role for judicial nominees.

   Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, there are a lot of things going on in the world. Sometimes there is so much going on that we forget some of the more important things. What I would like to do is to remind my colleagues and the American people that, as of today, there are 88 more days before the United States of America loses its right to the Panama Canal. 
   It is also interesting to point out that these little flags on this chart--in case someone may not know what they are--are Communist Chinese flags. So I am going to place another one over October 4 and note that in 88 days the Chinese Communists are going to have control over both ends of the Panama Canal. 
   It is amazing to me that in the Presidential debates--not formal debates but in the discussions of Presidential politics--we did not even hear anything about this. Yet here we are, the nation that is probably the largest threat to the United States of America is now going to control the Panama Canal and not a whimper comes from this administration. 
   So I am going to be on the floor of the Senate almost every day I can--at least every day that is a business day--to remind the American people and the administration that we are now going to allow the Communist Chinese flag to be hoisted over that canal, which we once controlled, which we, unfortunately, gave away during the Carter administration. 
   The Panama Canal Treaty requires the U.S., by the date of December 31, 1999, to relinquish its bases in Panama. 
   The Panama Canal--a monument to American engineering, American construction, American ingenuity--is among the world's most strategic waterways and remains critical to U.S. trade and national security. 
   In case anybody is interested, the United States has invested $32 billion of taxpayer dollars in that canal since its inception. It remains a critical artery for our Navy and Merchant Marine, with an estimated 200 Navy passages a year going through that canal. 
   On December 31, the Communist Chinese flag will control both ends of that canal. 
   Mr. President, 15 to 20 percent of total U.S. exports and imports transit  the canal, including approximately 40 percent of all grain exports. 
   Before the canal was constructed, the voyage around Cape Horn required 4 or 5 months. The Colombian Government was assessing differential duties which made transisthmian travel prohibitive, even under ordinary circumstances. 
   Traveling the United States from coast to coast took 8 or 9 months and sometimes fighting Indians. That was how long ago. Today, that canal saves 8,000 miles and 2 weeks over the Cape Horn route. 
   Public opinion in the United States towards construction of a canal was galvanized by the voyage of the battleship U.S.S. Oregon from the Pacific around Cape Horn, joining Admiral Sampson's fleet in battle against the Spanish fleet of Cuba in 1898. The Oregon arrived just in time to engage in the last naval battle of the Spanish-American War, the Battle of Santiago. 
   In Teddy Roosevelt's first message to Congress, he described the canal as the path to a global destiny for the United States and said:  
   No single great work which remains to be undertaken on this continent is of such consequence to the American people [as the Panama Canal].  
   In 1918, Teddy Roosevelt warned against internationalism of the canal:  
   ..... we will protect it, and we will not permit our enemies to use it in war. In time of peace, all nations shall use it alike, but in time of war our interest at once becomes dominant.  
   There has been lots of talk about the potential perils of Y2K, which is also going to take place on January 1 or at the end of this year. For me, the complete transfer of the Panama Canal by December 31 is the biggest Y2K challenge facing America, and the clock is ticking. There is the countdown--88 days until we lose not only the canal but the access, coming in and out of that canal. 
   This August, President Clinton awarded former President Jimmy Carter the Presidential Medal of Freedom. Now the Carter foreign policy legacy, the giveaway of the Panama Canal and normalized relations with the Communist People's Republic of China, has come full circle with ominous consequences. 
   Panama City's deputy mayor, Augusto Diaz, states:  
   If Red China gets control of the canal, it will get control of the government....... The Panama Canal is essential to China ..... if they control the Panama Canal, they control at least one-third of world shipping.  
   Already the PRC is the largest goods provider into Panama's free zone, at $2 billion a year. The People's Republic of China is the largest user of the canal, after the United States and Japan, with more than 200 COSCO ships alone transiting the waterway annually. 
   The United States has already shut down its strategic Howard Air Force Base. Howard Air Force Base has also served as the hub of counternarcotics operations with 2,000 drug interdiction flights a year. By the approaching deadline, we will also have given up in Panama Rodman Naval Station, the Fort Sherman Jungle Operations Training Center, and other important facilities. 
   The Clinton administration was supposed to be working towards negotiating an arrangement with Panama that would have allowed for a counterdrug center, but even that option has fallen apart. In September, the administration announced the collapse of 2 years of talks on a multinational counternarcotics center. 
   More than 2 decades ago, then-Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Admiral Thomas Moorer warned the Senate Foreign 
   Relations Committee that the U.S. withdrawal from Panama would occasion a dangerous vacuum that could be filled by hostile interests. His comments were very prophetic. 
   In 1996, while China was illegally secreting millions of dollars through conduits into the Clinton reelection coffers, it is alleged that it was simultaneously funneling cash to the Panamanian politicians to ensure that Chinese front companies would control the Panama Canal. 
   When is America going to wake up? When are the American people going to wake up? 
   Hutchison Whampoa, a Hong Kong company controlled by Chinese operatives, will lease the U.S.-built port facilities at Balboa, which handle ocean commerce on the Pacific side, and Cristobal, which handle commerce on the Atlantic side. A Hong Kong company will control--remember, Hong Kong is now part of the PRC. Its chairman is Li Ka-shing, who has close ties to the Chinese Communist leaders and a de facto working relationship with the People's Liberation Army. Li is a board member of the Chinese Government's primary investment entity, CITIC, China International Trust & Investment Corporation, run by PLA arms trafficker and smuggler Wang Jun. That is the Hong Kong company that will control this canal in 88 days. 
   Insight magazine published an article maintaining that Li serves as a middleman for PLA business operations, including financing some of the controversial Hughes and Loral deals which transferred weapons technology to the PRC. He has also been an ally of Indonesia's Riady family and the Lippo Group, so deeply implicated in the illegal Chinese/Clinton fundraising scandal. 
   Hutchison Whampoa's subsidiary runs the Panama Ports Company which is 10-percent owned by Chinese Resources Enterprise. CRE was identified by the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee as a vehicle for espionage--economic, political, and military--for China. Does anybody care? One of the favorite expressions among preachers is: Hello. Does anybody care? Is anybody listening? This is Communist China in the Panama Canal that we built, that we maintained, for $32 billion. Not a whimper. Nobody is talking about it, let alone doing anything about it. Nobody cares. Where is the administration? 
   In addition to concerns about Chinese objectives in securing Balboa and Cristobal ports, Panama is in the front lines of the U.S. fight against narcoterrorism principally exported by the FARC, revolutionary armed forces of Colombia, in Colombia. A week after closure of Howard Air Force Base, heavily armed FARC members were interviewed in full combat regalia on Panamanian television, operating in Panamanian territory. 
   U.S. Southern Command Chief, General Charles Wilhelm, testifying before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in June, said Panamanian security forces were undermanned and ill equipped to deal with growing threats from Colombian guerrilla incursions and drug traffickers. Colombia is the source of an estimated 80 percent of the world's supply of cocaine and the source of 75 percent of heroin seized in the United States. The FARC is known to have ties to the Russian mafia. That canal will be a great opportunity for them. 
   Public opinion polls in Panama indicate that between 70 and 80 percent of the Panamanian people support an ongoing U.S. security presence in their country. Alternative sites for 
   counterdrug operations, the so-called FOLs, or forward operating locations, are expected to cost hundreds of millions of dollars for infrastructure building and fees. We have no assurance that even if we build the infrastructure, we can stay in the designated FOLs for any extended time. 
   Another issue that must be raised is that of the corrupt and unfair bidding process surrounding the 25-year-plus leasing arrangement, with an option for another 25 years, with Hutchison Whampoa. The then-U.S. Ambassador to Panama, William Hughes, protested this corrupt bidding process, and American and Japanese firms lost out because of the stacked deck. No help from the administration. 
   Ambassador Hughes came close to being declared persona non grata for protesting the rigged deal 3 years ago. It should be noted that Hughes is now parroting the administration's line on Panama and the PRC. President Clinton then appointed Robert Pastor, architect of the 1977 canal surrender. He appointed him, and Pastor's nomination was blocked by Foreign Relations Committee Chairman JESSE HELMS. 
   Six U.S. Senators, in May 1997, charged in a letter to the Federal Maritime Commission that there were irregularities in the bidding process, which denied U.S. firms an equal right to develop and operate terminals in Panama. The Commission acknowledged that the port award process was unorthodox and irregular by U.S. standards. 
   In 1996, Panama asked a Seattle-based company to withdraw a successful bid for Cristobal--a successful bid--  on the grounds that it would give the U.S. firm a monopoly because of its existing business in Balboa. In 1997, Panama gave the leasing deal to Hutchison Whampoa for both ports. With the introduction of Hutchison Whampoa, there follows real concern that Chinese organized criminal organizations involved in drug trafficking, guns, and smuggling of illegal aliens will ensue. COSCO, mentioned earlier--another Chinese-run firm that tried to lease the Long Beach Naval Shipyard--owned the ship which entered Oakland containing smuggled AK-47s intended for the street gangs of Los Angeles. 
   And we almost had that firm in control of the Long Beach Naval Shipyard. Two firms with ties to the PLA and the Chinese Government were under Federal investigation for the smuggling attempt. While the U.S. Government is equipped to deal with this type of threat, Panama, with no standing army, is not. 
   The United States and Panama have security provisions in existing treaties under which we could negotiate joint security initiatives to address our common interests. 
   Eighty-eight days, Mr. President. Eighty-eight days. That is what we have left to get it done. 
   The major obstacle appears to be an unwillingness of this administration to preserve a presence in Panama and a tendency to downplay the significance of Chinese acquisition of the twin ports. 
   The 1977 treaty gives the United States the right to defend the Panama Canal with military force. The United States attached a condition, known as the DeConcini condition, which stated that if the canal were closed, or its operations interfered with, the United States and Panama would have the right to take steps necessary, including use of military force, to reopen the canal or restore operations in the canal. This modification was never ratified in Panama and met with protest by the Torrijos regime. Panama's version of the treaty denies unilateral defense rights to the United States. Some believe that Panama and the United States cloaked the differences in order to avoid a Senate vote on the issue and a plebiscite in Panama. In fact, the Senate turned back a series of amendments that would have required the treaties to be renegotiated and resubmitted to the Panamanians for another referendum. 
   The DeConcini condition, because it was attached to the Neutrality Treaty, remains in force permanently. But as former Admiral and Joint Chiefs Chairman Thomas Moorer noted, how does the ``right'' to go into the canal with force compare to the advantage of defensive bases that could prevent the takeover of the canal by an enemy? 
   A new Panamanian law gives this company, Hutchison Whampoa, the ``first option'' to take over the U.S. Naval Station Rodman and other sites. Panamanian law also gives the Chinese company the right to pilot all vessels transiting the canal. Admiral Moorer warned the Senate last year that our Navy vessels could be put at risk since Hutchison Whampoa has the right to deny passage to any ship interfering with its business, including U.S. Navy ships. 
   It is of interest to note a 25-percent leap in immigration to Panama from the PRC over the past few years--a 25-percent increase in immigration to Panama from the PRC. Beijing has used large-scale emigration as the basis for future intelligence recruits, with Panama a key target. Stanislav Lunev, a defector and former Soviet military intelligence colonel, claimed Chinese intelligence succeeded because of their ability to exploit the vast emigration of Chinese to communities across the world. 
   Eighty-eight more days, Mr. President. Eighty-eight more days. 
   The Congressional Research Service's August 1999 Issue Brief on China addresses a Chinese immigrant scandal. Panamanian visas were sold for as much as $15,000 to Chinese citizens who would fly from Hong Kong to Costa Rica, where smugglers would guide them through Central America and Mexico into the United States. Then President Balladares fired his head of intelligence as a result of the scandal--another issue 
   which causes consternation among Americans with regard to Panama's ability to deal with its China problem. 
   If I could put it bluntly, this administration has dropped the ball big time. The House Subcommittee on the Western Hemisphere stated in March 1995 that over 80 percent of Panamanians favor some sort of U.S. military presence in their country. A September 1997 poll found that 70 percent believe that some U.S. bases should remain after the end of this year. 
   Eighty-eight more days. 
   More recently, a May 1998 poll showed that 65 percent of Panamanians support the concept of a multinational counterdrug center. 
   Despite public support--as high as three-fourths of the people in Panama wishing for the United States to stay in some capacity--this administration appears wedded to an unconditional pullout, an unconditional surrender toward a ``cooling off'' period that could allow the PRC to consolidate a new strategic toehold in Panama. 
   The Panama Canal Treaty was negotiated between President Carter and Panamanian dictator Omar Torrijos. It doesn't reflect public opinion in Panama. It did not, arguably, reflect public opinion in the United States. 
   When Operation Just Cause was launched in 1989, following the deaths of American soldiers and civilians in Panama, the United States intervened to safeguard American lives, to defend democracy in Panama, to combat drug trafficking, and to protect the integrity of the Panama Canal Treaty. It would be a shame if, because we fail now to protect Panama and the common security interests of the United States, to risk military intervention in the future. 
   Finally, a Pentagon spokesman has dismissed the notion that the United States should even worry about Chinese encroachment in Panama. Don't worry about it. According to an AP story, Admiral CRAIG Quigley said:  
   We have nothing to indicate that the Chinese have the slightest desire to somehow control the Panama Canal....... And we don't consider this a security issue at all. It is a business issue.  
   Hello. Is anybody listening out there in the administration? What are we saying? Eighty-eight more days and they will control both ends of it. But, according to Quigley:  
   We have nothing to indicate that the Chinese have the slightest desire to somehow control the Panama Canal....... And we don't consider this a security issue at all. It is a business issue.  
   That is what he says: ``It is a business issue.'' Yes, it is a business issue all right--between the Chinese Government and Panama, to our detriment. There isn't any private business in China. It is all done by the Government. That is business as usual in the Clinton White House. This is a serious mistake that will in the future cost us dearly in terms of our national security. 
   This is the same Red China that has labeled us their ``No. 1 enemy;'' the same China that has sought to steal all of our nuclear weapons secrets from our DOE labs; the same China that sought to buy the 1996 Presidential election, and massacred students at Tiananmen Square; the same China which has committed genocide in Tibet and which is supplying state sponsors of terrorism in Iran, Libya, Syria, and North Korea; the same China that has provided missiles and other weapons of mass destruction and technology to be sent around the world; the same China that threatened a nuclear attack on California and which has implied it would use the neutron bomb against Taiwan. 
   Here is the flag right here. Eighty-eight more days. In 88 more days, it will be hanging on a mast over that canal. That is the flag. That is also the flag of a country to which, right here in this Senate, a majority of my colleagues, I regret to say, said we should provide most-favored-nation status. 
   In conclusion, the United States should re-engage the new government of Moscoso on the issue of a continued U.S. presence. General McCaffrey, the drug czar, has shown a renewed interest on what he now calls an emergency situation in Colombia, albeit several years after the State Department and the Clinton administration stalled, thwarted, and blocked congressional efforts to assist Colombia's antinarcotics police in its fight against the FARC. 
   Despite these differences over tactics in the drug war, McCaffrey stands out in the Clinton administration as someone who cares about the drug problem.  But this is bigger than drugs. This is drugs--there is no question about it--but it is also the national security of the United States. 
   We could also urge the new Panamanian Government to conduct a referendum on maintaining a U.S. presence. 
   No one is talking to them about that. We could urge reopening of the bidding process to be more fair and equitable, and to ensure that no hostile powers are permitted to bid. We are not doing that either. 
   The canal was built at a tremendous expense--$32 billion--and at the sacrifice of thousands of American lives. What a pity, the good working relationship that has developed between Panama and the United States to be lost because of the ineptitude and indifference of people in the State Department and the Defense Department of this administration. If this administration remains blind to the threat facing Panama, it is incumbent upon this Congress to make the case to the American people, to the new government in Panama, and to the Panamanian people. 
   That is exactly what I intend to do on this floor every day that I can get the time and the floor to do it between now and December 31. I am going to be posting another flag each day to remind the American people that we are getting closer and closer and closer to the People's Republic of China--Communist China--controlling both ends of the Panama Canal--the country that has trampled the rights of Tibetans, that threatened to run over its peaceful protesters with tanks, that has stolen our nuclear secrets, that funneled money into our Presidential campaigns, and purchased or stolen other targeting devices to target our cities, and, frankly, threatened the country of Taiwan, and even threatened California if we step in. What do we do on the Senate floor? Not only do we let them take the canal, but we also give them most-favored-nation status. 
   At some point, the American people are going to have to wake up. I don't know when it is going to be. But I hope it is not too late. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, first, I thank my colleague, the manager, Senator SPECTER, and the Democratic side for agreeing to my amendment. It is my understanding there is no opposition. I will be very brief in my remarks. 
   The amendment is very simple, as was read by the clerk. It says that unless the Brooklyn Museum of Art, about which we have been reading, cancels the exhibit Sensation, it will no longer receive Federal funds through the National Endowment of the Arts. An article in today's Washington Times describes this exhibit ``called art''--I use that term loosely--as including a picture of the Virgin Mary decorated with elephant feces and pornographic pictures. It also contains a picture, a photograph of the Last Supper with a naked woman presiding, presumably, as Christ. It also depicts a sculpture of a man's head filled with the artist's frozen blood. 
   As I say, I use the term ``artist'' loosely. I am reading from the article. This is called ``art.'' 
   Mr. President, we do live in troubled times. You would think with the constant barrage of violence and sex and death and blasphemy that maybe somehow everybody would get to the point where enough is enough. I think that is where I am with this particular piece of art, so-called. Yet this painting of the Virgin Mary covered in feces and surrounded by pornographic pictures is particularly shocking. It is irreverent; it is sacrilegious; and it is disgusting; but it is not art, for goodness' sake. People can do what they want to do. We do have the first amendment. They can draw what they want to draw. 
   But I will say one thing: The taxpayers of the United States shouldn't fund this garbage. Everyone here knows how I feel about the funding for the National Endowment for the Arts. I had an amendment recently that lost overwhelmingly to defund the National Endowment for the Arts. 
   At that time, we were told all of these things were in the past. There were no more Mapplethorpes. And as someone spoke to me on the way in, we went from Christ on the crucifix immersed in urine to the Virgin Mary now with animal feces. That is where we have gone with the National Endowment for the Arts. 
   I think it is time we dismantled the National Endowment for the Arts because I am sick and tired of hearing about these so-called art projects. How many times do we have to hear the NEA has cleaned up its act, and how many times do we have to hear that it has not? That is the bottom line. 
   This amendment doesn't defund the National Endowment for the Arts. It says, very simply and very clearly, it is the sense of the Senate that the conferees on the Department of the Interior, where NEA is funded, shall include language prohibiting funds from being used for the Brooklyn Museum of Art, unless the museum immediately cancels the exhibit Sensation, which contains obscene and pornographic pictures, a picture of the Virgin Mary desecrated with animal feces, and other examples of religious bigotry. 
   Basically, Mayor Giuliani has said the same thing, that he doesn't want any of these funds going to the museum for it either. I think if we are going to fund the arts, we owe it to the taxpayers to exercise discretion. The Brooklyn Museum of Art is upset that Mayor Giuliani is threatening to withdraw the $7 million subsidy the museum gets from the city, but the mayor is right. 
   The people of New York City shouldn't have to spend their hard-earned tax dollars to pay for this trash, nor should the people of New Hampshire, or California, or Iowa, or Idaho, or any place else. Defenders of the NEA always say this is creativity. According to the promotions for this exhibit in New York, they have a warning poster outside the display in the museum that says: This exhibit causes ``shock, vomiting, confusion, panic, and anxiety.'' 
   The Brooklyn Museum of Art has received just over the last 3 years at least $500,000 worth of taxpayer dollars--at least. You could employ a lot of homeless veterans for $500,000. You could take a lot of them off the streets for $500,000. 
   If we are going to give money to museums, we ought not to include those that are this irresponsible. Give me that $500,000, and I will find homeless veterans in San Francisco, in Los Angeles, and Washington. Every day when I come to work, I see homeless veterans on grates in this city. Let me have that money, and I will get them off the grates. But I will be doggone if I am going to give it to the Brooklyn Museum of Art or any other museum with this kind of trash called ``art.'' It is wrong. 
   Every time I take the floor and talk about it--and others before me, and Senator HELMS who is a leader on this--we always hear that they have cleaned up their act, it is not going to happen anymore, and we are not going to hear any more about these horror stories. But here we are with this money. We just passed it--$99 million worth for the National Endowment for the Arts. I lost my amendment, and here goes some of that money right smack into the Museum of Art in Brooklyn. 
   If a student wants to say a prayer over his lunch or if a teacher holds a moment of silence, it is Government sponsorship of religion. Judge Roy Moore of Alabama could go to jail for putting the Ten Commandants on his wall because somehow we are afraid of the separation of church and state. But this kind of stuff can go on, and nobody stops it. 
   The ACLU liberals are all too willing to persecute people for legitimate religious expression if it takes place in a public building. Then they defend the desecration of the Virgin Mary and Jesus Christ and call it art? What is happening to this world? Can somebody figure this out? 
   We have a public museum, receiving hundreds of thousands of dollars of Federal taxpayer dollars, spending these dollars on religious bigotry. So the American taxpayer has to pay for art that degrades and blasphemes against their own religion. But if their child wants to say a prayer over lunch, we have to get the lawyers out. Welcome to America. It seems that anti-Catholic bigotry is coming back into vogue. Not only that, it is celebrated as art, and it gets Federal dollars to do it. 
   This guy needs a psychiatrist for putting this thing together. He doesn't need Federal money. You get publicity-craving artists who go to any length to create controversy. And he has it. I am giving him plenty of publicity. He is probably very happy. I will give him the publicity, but let's not give him the money. I imagine those who created this monstrosity are watching right now on C-SPAN and are cheering away: ``There is SMITH out there giving us all this attention.'' Give him the attention, but let's take the money away. 
   It is not the so-called ``artists'' who are responsible. They are doing their job as they see fit. They should not do it at taxpayer expense. Those who run public museums ought to know better. We shouldn't have to hang parental warning signs on public art museums  saying that children under 17 shouldn't come in. 
   Mayor Giuliani gave the museum an opportunity to end this controversy by removing certain exhibits, and the museum rejected his offer. Let's reject the money. As far as I am concerned, this was a statement by the Brooklyn Museum that this 
   is the kind of art they think is appropriate to fund with taxpayer dollars. Until they change their mind, I think the taxpayers' money would be better spent elsewhere. I would be happy to pick homeless veterans if somebody wants to give me the $500,000 to do it. 
   Mr. President, I believe it is appropriate to ask for the yeas and nays. 
   We have an agreement on the amendment. So we don't need the yeas and nays. Is that correct?

   Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I call the Senate's attention to a program that the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has initiated that I believe is ill-conceived, wasteful and lacking of public input. The EPA, at the direction of Vice President GORE, has launched a ``voluntary'' initiative with the chemical industry to test some 2,800 high production volume (HPV) chemicals and substances. The chemicals included in this list are currently manufactured or imported in volumes in excess of one million pounds, many of which have already gone through substantial testing and known to be either hazardous or safe. As chairman of the subcommittee with jurisdiction over the testing and handling of toxic chemicals, I am particularly concerned about how this program will be administered and funded. 
   This major initiative was launched in October 1998 during a press conference by EPA, the Chemical Manufacturers Association and the Environmental Defense Fund. This initiative calls on industry to voluntarily provide test plans for these 2,800 HPV chemicals by December 1999, after which EPA will mandate tests of the remaining chemicals. Although the first phase of this initiative is voluntary, I'm concerned that there was not adequate public and congressional involvement in the development of this massive undertaking. Only after much urging by concerned Members of Congress, including myself, and other affected interest groups, EPA decided to hold a number of ``stakeholder'' meetings to share views and information about the HPV program. 
   The lack of public and congressional input is just one concern that I have with this initiative. There are several other important issues of which the Senate should be aware. A major concern deals with the large amount of unnecessary animal testing that could occur as a result of this program. While obtaining better data on hazardous chemicals is certainly a worthy goal, I am concerned about the extent to which animal testing would be used in lieu of alternative testing methods. I understand that there have been many advances in toxicology, risk assessment and alternative testing strategies that minimize the use of animals, that could be applied. 
   As I stated earlier, the HPV program calls for testing of many substances that clearly need no further testing. These include chemicals well documented and regulated as dangerous, as well as substances recognized as safe by the Food and Drug Administration. Chemicals with existing data should be purged from the list by EPA. There have been numerous assertions by Administration officials that they have no intention of ordering duplicative testing and remain interested in pursuing alternative testing methods where appropriate. I hope this is true. However, I still have serious concerns about the expedited schedule of the program and how EPA is directing its resources. Therefore, as the subcommittee chairman with oversight responsibility over toxic substances and testing, I plan to closely monitor EPA's implementation of this program.

   Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I want to say that I support the efforts of the committee in increasing by some $600 million the money for the benefits to veterans that was not in the bill. I commend them for their leadership in doing it. I agree with my colleague from Minnesota that this is simply not enough. 
   I think my colleague is correct. I want to say to my colleague from Minnesota that not only do I appreciate his efforts on the floor in behalf of our Nation's veterans, but I support those efforts. 
   I am proud to be a cosponsor of this amendment because I believe we have heard horror story after horror story after horror story in all of our offices year after year after year. It seems as if we always have money for everything. Lord knows I have been down here many times opposing that ``money for everything.'' Indeed, I have an amendment that I will offer very shortly. My colleague from Minnesota might disagree with me, but it increases money for veterans but takes it out of the AmeriCorps Program, which he probably will oppose me on. 
   But on this amendment, I want to say that we agree. The veterans of this country need more help. They shouldn't have to beg for it. They deserve it; they earned it. We have heard it time and time again--whether it is the American Legion, the VFW, DAV--whomever you spoke to. In meeting after meeting in my office, we hear the same thing. 
   I think my colleague from Minnesota will agree with me on this. We drive to work into Washington, especially in the winter, and nothing is more painful than seeing a veteran lying on a grate in this city. This happens all over America. I have seen this now for 15 years. I have fought for 15 years to try to correct it. 
   I am just determined now that I am going to do whatever I have to do on this floor to see that it stops. 
   There is no way this country, as great as it is and as rich as it is, should tolerate that. Enough is enough. It has happened in Democratic administrations. It has happened in 
   Republican administrations. Enough is enough. 
   Whatever we have to do to help these veterans get off those grates, whatever we have to do to help veterans get the health care and shelter and things they need, then I am prepared to do it. I am prepared to sacrifice somewhere else in the budget to do it--whatever it takes, whatever we have to do. 
   I say to my colleague from Minnesota that I appreciate his leadership on this. I am proud to support him on it. I will continue to support any efforts that he should author, or perhaps he may support some that I may author, in terms of helping to get this mess straightened out so that we don't have to continually hear these horror stories of veterans being denied care. 
   I know the Senator from Minnesota has, as I have, gone to veterans homes. You see some of the conditions they have to endure. It is outrageous. 
   We give them the best. We try to give them the best when they go to serve, wherever that may be. We ask them to go all over the world--too much in my view. Then when they come back, they deserve the best, as well, in terms of care. I think with good intentions we try to do that, but we have failed. We have come up short in a lot of areas. I think the Senator's amendment will help to address that. 
   I think everybody on the floor supports our Nation's veterans. I don't in any way insinuate that any of my colleagues who are offering another amendment of a lesser amount don't support veterans. But we clearly have not addressed this problem. The Senator from Minnesota pointed out that there was a 99-0 vote on exactly what the Senator is proposing. I see no reason why we can't step forward. It is a shame that we have to have another vote. I think it ought to be in the legislation. It ought to be in the bill. 
   But I am going to stand here no matter how many times it takes, as often as possible, and as long as possible to make these points. 
   I am more than happy to join my colleague in doing this to help our Nation's veterans. 
   Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry? Are we on the Wellstone amendment at this point?

   Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, the amendment I am proposing will increase funding for our veterans by transferring funds from the Corporation for National and Community Service, also known as AmeriCorps. So what we have here, in addition to the amendment that passed, the increase of $600 million and the other proposed by Senator WELLSTONE, is an additional sum of money beyond that to be taken from the AmeriCorps program and placed in veterans programs. 
   I think, here again, it is a question of priorities. We will need to decide  whether we are going to pay volunteers--a little interesting; pay volunteers--or whether we are going to pay our Nation's veterans. That is the crux of the matter. 
   It is going to be a test of our priorities. It is going to enable Members of this body, who are concerned about our veterans, to basically put their money where their mouth is. That is the bottom line. This vote will be a test of our seriousness about whether we are going to provide our veterans with the care they need or not. It is a clear-cut choice. 
   There is nothing complicated about this amendment. It is AmeriCorps and paid volunteers versus veterans. That is it, pure and simple. It is between a big Government program that is paying volunteers--I will talk about that in a minute, whether there is such a thing as a paid volunteer--and our sacred responsibility to care for those who have sacrificed so much for our Nation. 
   My colleagues know we have debated the question of AmeriCorps funding before. They know I have always opposed this program. That is no secret. I opposed it in principle when it was proposed, and my concerns only grew when I saw how it worked or did not work in practice. I think the time has come to face the fact that this is money that could be better spent caring for those who fought for our liberty and in many cases were wounded for our liberty. 
   The rhetoric of AmeriCorps supporters is certainly stirring. The goals they profess are goals with which no one would disagree. But the rationale for using Federal taxpayer dollars --hard-earned taxpayer dollars--to fund this program always breaks down when we come back to the fundamental oxymoron it is based on. And it is an oxymoron. Some say perhaps more ``moron" than ``oxy''--my view--but it is an oxymoron because it says ``paid volunteers.'' 
   Where I grew up, if you volunteered, you did not get paid. So I do not know what a ``paid volunteer'' is. But in this city of Washington, now we have come up with this new definition of a paid volunteer--only in Washington. It is like here in Washington we also have floors below the basement in the elevators, here in the Senate. Those people who come and visit know what I am talking about. You can take an elevator to the basement, and then you can go to the subbasement if you want to, or G, one below the basement. It is just too complicated to have the basement be the bottom floor, I guess. 
   Now we have come up with this paid volunteer, and it is being sold to the American people. 
   I checked, before I came to the floor today, in my American Heritage College Dictionary. I must confess, I probably did not look at it enough when I was in college and do not look at it an awful lot now. But I was puzzled by this term, so I looked up the term ``volunteer.'' The American Heritage College Dictionary defines a ``volunteer'' as a person who performs or offers to 
   perform a service of his or her own free will, or to do charitable or helpful work without pay. 
   This is the definition I always grew up with. It is the definition I always understood. And I believe it is the definition that most Americans would also say is correct. 
   But now the President of the United States is rewriting the definitions in the American Heritage College Dictionary. He is rewriting the rules for federalism with his executive orders. He has awesome powers. Now he is redefining the word ``volunteer.'' These are the volunteers whom Americans see in their communities every day. For the past few years, the AmeriCorps bureaucracy has sprinkled thousands of so-called volunteers across America's 50 States--so-called volunteers. 
   But meanwhile, 90 million Americans truly volunteer in some capacity each year. These are the real volunteers. These are the Americans our speeches should be honoring. 
   We do not need a Government program to honor volunteers because volunteers do not get paid. When true volunteers offer their time and energy, they expect and receive nothing but the satisfaction of serving their neighbors. 
   What can AmeriCorps' so-called volunteers expect? Here is what they can expect. They can expect a salary supplemented by a grant for education expenses, and they can expect health and child care benefits. 
   I might just ask anybody out there in America listening right now, if you went down and volunteered, perhaps somewhere in North Carolina where the hurricane hit, and you were throwing sandbags up there, most likely you did it because you wanted to help your neighbors; I do not think you would be asking whether or not you got health care benefits or child care or a salary. 
   If you received a hot meal and a thank-you, I think you would be very appreciative of that and no more, and you would be glad to do it. That is what voluntarism is. Now we have changed the definition. We are now paying volunteers under this President. Work compensated by a salary and benefits isn't volunteer work; it is a job. Look up the word ``job'' in the dictionary. I think you will find that is what it says. 
   There is a difference between being a volunteer and having a job. They are both worthwhile, but let us not try to blend together something that is quite different. 
   In a past year's oversight hearing on this program, a very prominent and distinguished Member of this body claimed that the traditional notion of voluntarism has changed. Now voluntarism is no longer voluntarism; it is the notion of voluntarism. The implication is that volunteer work, the type performed by the 90 million Americans who are putting sandbags up and protecting their neighbors' homes in the midst of a hurricane, is obsolete. That it is gone. Now the wave of the future is the AmeriCorps volunteer, the paid volunteer, the person who gets health care, child care. That is what this President has said, and that is what this bill is sanctioning, about $225 million worth of sanctions, I might add, of paid volunteers. 
   I hope it is not the case, after all the Executive orders this President has signed and all the things we have seen him do in redefining--he redefined NATO to be an offensive rather than a defensive organization; he redefined our military to be a 911 response team rather than a military; he has taken Executive orders and redefined federalism--that we are going to allow this President to continue moving us 
   toward a society in which volunteer service can be offered only by professional volunteers and only with the assistance and permission of a Washington bureaucracy. 
   My goodness, have we really come to that? Only in Washington, only in some government budget or in some government bill could we possibly ever come up with anything as stupid as this. But we have done it. Boy, are we good at it. 
   I hope we are not going to send our children a message that anyone who volunteers should expect a salary and benefits in exchange for serving his or her community. Is that what we are saying? 
   Honestly, that is what we are saying. I have to wonder if we are serious when we say the era of big government is over. I have heard our Vice President say that. Maybe he should take over Jay Leno's slot because that is about the funniest thing I have ever heard, to say that the era of big government is over and then talk about having $225 million placed in a bill to pay volunteers. The era of big government is over? Somebody needs to explain that to me. 
   If we allow this program to become a permanent fixture of the Federal Government, we are going to send a message that the era of big government is just getting started, not over. For when we allow government to intrude on the voluntary sector, we guarantee the further erosion of civil society, the area of community life that falls outside the purview of government. Frankly, we insult the millions, the 90 million or so Americans who do volunteer in charity after charity after charity--cancer, Humane Society, helping friends in times of earthquakes and floods; they volunteer and do it willingly, and they don't get paid. There is no such thing as a paid volunteer. Very bluntly and very frankly, I don't care if you are a Republican or a Democrat or Independent or what you are, male or female. You should not sanction it by funding paid volunteers. It is wrong. We ought to eliminate it, and we ought to take this money out. We ought to  take it out, period. But I am not even asking Members to do that. I am asking them to take it out of there and give it to our Nation's veterans. 
   I know opponents of my amendment are going to claim they simply want to use big government to help the volunteer sector. We are going to help the volunteer sector. How many times do we have to go down this road? We let the Federal Government set up a program to help in an area of American life that has survived without government help, but we are going to put up a program now to help volunteers and pay them. The government program always starts small and always gets bigger. 
   Remember the Department of Education. That started in the mid-1970s at about $3 billion. It is getting up there close to $60 billion now--not bad in 20 or 25 years. Soon the government funding is supplemented with government mandates, and then we find that something that used to be a function of civil society is now a function of big government in everything but name. When we try to slow its growth, we are told that the loss of government funds will be fatal. You will destroy the arts. You will destroy the humanities. You will destroy the charities that serve the poor. These are areas that once functioned without government aid. Now we have set up government monies to help them. If we take it away, we are accused of not wanting to help the humanities or the arts or help with charities. 
   Now the people who work in these areas will tell us government is indispensable. We have to keep it here. We have 
   to have it. We can't have volunteers now unless we have them paid. 
   The question is--and this is all my amendment is about--Do we want to have the volunteer sector dependent on Big Brother or not? I say we should not. Even in the short lifetime of the Corporation for National and Community Service, otherwise known as AmeriCorps, we have seen the influence of big government corroding the ethic of service that animates our voluntary sector. We have seen massive administrative costs. We have seen large numbers of AmeriCorps' so-called volunteers deployed in Federal agencies to staff big government, and in some cases, to lobby for its continued expansion. That is right, paid volunteers to lobby us for the continued expansion of what they are doing. We have seen the promise that private sector sources would match Federal funds fall by the wayside. 
   Let me make one thing clear: Good work has been done under the auspices of this program. I don't doubt it. If you pay somebody, you hopefully can get work out of them, and maybe something beneficial will come of it. A lot of this has been done in my own State of New Hampshire. I have met with some people of AmeriCorps. I salute their desire to offer service to their communities. No one is disputing that. 
   But I am concerned that by cultivating direct links between voluntary service organizations and big government, we risk sending some of our most selfless young people the message that public employment is the only avenue available for serving their communities. That is not true. The American people know it is not true, but that is what we are doing. 
   We risk sending true volunteers a message that their efforts are no longer necessary. That is not going to be the case with people who have volunteered all their lives, but look at young people today. Do you want to go down and help Ms. Brown mow her lawn and not get paid? Do you want to go collect money for the charity of your choice, perhaps the Cancer Society, and not get paid? Or do you want to go work for the Federal Government as a paid volunteer and get paid and get benefits? What message are we sending to our young people? We have just redefined the word ``volunteer.'' 
   We just redefined the whole word ``voluntarism.'' This amendment I am suggesting is far more than $225 million. It is far more than providing money from AmeriCorps to veterans. Both of those are admirable, in my view, but it is more important than that. We are sending a cultural, moral message to the young people in our country by supporting this amendment, and that is: You volunteer; you don't get paid. You volunteer because you want to. That is the message I want to send. 
   Now, you cannot compare AmeriCorps and the veterans. There is no comparison. On the one hand, we have the health and well-being of brave men and women whose sacrifices have ensured our continued freedom. And you talk about volunteers. Many, if not most, of the people who have made those sacrifices did so as volunteers. They volunteered for their country to serve in time of war. Some were drafted, but many would have gone whether drafted or not. 
   When we called upon these Americans to serve their country, we took on certain obligations. This is a sacred obligation, one that we can't shirk and should not shirk. On the other hand, with AmeriCorps we take on another new obligation. 
   As I have made clear, the task of manning the voluntary sector will be performed whether or not we appropriate Federal taxpayer funds for the Corporation for National and Community Service. On the other hand, the job of addressing the pressing medical needs of America's heroic veterans is one that only we in the Federal Government can do. 
   Now, Senator BOB SMITH does not stand down here at any time and promote additional Government funds where it is not constitutional to do so. I don't support unconstitutional spending, and I have cited example after example on the floor of 
   this Senate over a number of years. It is constitutional, it is right, it is just, and it is our obligation to support our Nation's veterans with whatever it is they need. This amendment says those needs are more important than paid volunteers. 
   This amendment will add funding to critical resources in the VA budget. The funding would go toward three areas: long-term care, medical care, and combating homelessness. I propose increasing funding for State veterans nursing homes out of this $225 million to allow our veterans to age with dignity and with the care they deserve. We know how desperately the VA health care system needs additional funding just to stay afloat. I also propose increasing funding to the Homeless Providers Program and Per Diem Program. This would help to build programs that would get veterans off the grates, if they are homeless, and help get them back on their feet. 
   Even the amounts I am proposing to be transferred here only scratch the surface of what we need. But we have to start somewhere, and this is where we need to draw the line. 
   So let me summarize and conclude by saying this: It is a simple amendment; $225 million is in the bill for AmeriCorps, paid volunteers, young people who are good young people. We are telling them we are going to pay you and call you a ``volunteer'' to do X, Y, or Z. We can do that or we can send another message, which is that homeless veterans on grates and inadequate care facilities is wrong, and we are going to fund those entities. Maybe it would even be a more powerful message if we would ask those AmeriCorps volunteers--paid volunteers--to suspend the payments and say: No, thank you, Mr. President, I am not interested in your benefits or your salary. Just tell me where the nearest veterans home is or the nearest VA hospital, and I will go there and give my time to those veterans who did so much. 
   Isn't that a better message to send to America? What is wrong with this country? What is happening to this country? That is what I want to know. Day after day, we fund this stuff, and half of the time we don't talk about it. It just slips in there and goes by--with good intentions, not always bad, but it is wrong. We are sending the wrong message to our people. 
   I taught school. Once you are a schoolteacher, you are always a schoolteacher. You are never a former teacher. We are sending the wrong message to our kids. We have sent wrong messages for the last several years. 
   Starting in February, we said right here on the floor that the President of the United States can commit crimes and not have to be held accountable for them. We said that. That is what we told our young people. We have told our young people that it is OK to do whatever you want. Do your thing. Shoot your friends and colleagues in school, and then blame somebody else. Blame innocent gun owners who have done nothing except exercise their constitutional right to own a firearm. But  blame somebody else; don't blame ourselves. We abort our young children every day, and we say: Johnny, go off to school, and, Mary, go off to school, be a good little girl and boy, and we will abort your brother or sister while you are going to school being a good kid. That is the message we are sending. We do it every day. 
   So, you see, that is what is wrong with America. It is the greatest country in the world, but we need to change it. The structure is there. We just need to change a few people and a few places, get reality back, and bring this country back to 
   what it should be and what it can be and what it must be, what our Founders wanted. 
   Do you think for one minute that Thomas Jefferson, if he could stand here today or James Madison or George Washington or Sam Adams or Patrick Henry--do you think for one minute they would stand up here and defend paid volunteers? These are the people who picked up the weapons, put on the militia uniform, and went to Concord Bridge in Lexington and fought the British, sometimes never getting paid, not knowing whether they were going to be paid, nor caring whether they would get paid. These are the people who brought us our liberty. We disgrace what they did for us by standing on the Senate floor and even proposing to pay somebody to be a volunteer. 
   It is the wrong message, folks. It is the wrong message. I hope somebody out there might be listening. It doesn't happen often around here that we listen to each other's speeches, but I hope somebody listens because we need to change the culture of this country, the attitude. All we can do on the Senate floor is single out things which are wrong and point them out--not to attack anybody. I am not attacking the motives of anybody. But I am saying it is wrong. Let's accept that it is wrong and change it so that we don't tell America's young people that paid volunteers are more important than our Nation's veterans, more important than the people who sacrifice for their country, more important than those who are, today, barely able to move or speak --some not able to move or speak--in veterans homes across America, who are being neglected. By the way, they are taken care of by nonpaid volunteers, in many cases, who come and visit. 
   This is what is wrong with America. This is why America will perish, if we don't stop. I don't want to see that happen. I want my kids or grandkids someday to say: I read old grandpa's speeches when he had the time to serve on the Senate floor. He stood up and said paid volunteers were wrong, and I am glad he did because we changed it. We don't have paid volunteers anymore and we don't have veterans lying helpless on grates freezing to death. We don't have veterans who are no longer able to get the help they need and the care and the shelter they need. We don't have that anymore because old grandpa stood up on the Senate floor and said it was wrong, and we changed it. That is what I would like. 
   ``Do you want to leave a legacy?'' People ask you that all the time. If they write that about me, I will be happy. Nothing else. That is all. This is Daniel Webster's desk right here, one of the greatest Senators of all time. This desk belongs to the senior Senator from New Hampshire, and I am not going to give it up. 
   I think all the time about the fact that he stood here and that we are just temporary stewards. We are just here for a blip on the radar screen of history, trying to do our job. As great as Webster was, he is off the stage, as the founders are and as are so many great orators and Senators who have spoken in this great body. But you try to make a difference. You try to make a difference. You have to speak up and try to make a difference. 
   I urge my colleagues, ask yourself, are volunteers whom you are paying more important than veterans who gave their limbs, and their lives in some cases, not to mention the suffering of the families--more important than those veterans? I don't think so. I am asking you to vote to take $225 million from paid volunteers and give it to our Nation's veterans. There is the offset. It is not adding any more money anywhere. It is not costing the taxpayers another dime. That is all I am asking you to do. 
   Let me conclude on a couple of points about veterans because I think we need to personalize this a little bit so we understand it. 
   I mentioned earlier in the debate with Senator WELLSTONE that driving to work in the morning, especially in the winter, and seeing those veterans on the grates--they are not all veterans. There are about 750,000 homeless people, they tell me, in America. But they say a third of them are probably veterans. What happened? How did that happen? Why are they there? It is pretty disgraceful, really, when you stop and think about it, because somewhere at some point they reached out and asked for help, and they didn't get it or they wouldn't be homeless. 
   I can't help but think of something that Johnny Cash immortalized so very well with ``The Ballad of Ira Hayes,'' the Indian, one of the people who raised the flag at Iwo Jima Hill. He was an Indian who was discriminated against when he came back but hung out around the reservation and became an alcoholic and died in a ditch. He was one of the ones who held that flag up at Iwo Jima Hill. Why did that happen? Because something slipped through the cracks. 
   There are thousands of Ira Hayeses out there in America right now, lying on those grates, looking for hope. This is one of the most affluent cities in the world. You can't go around the block without running into some function where they serve caviar, shrimp, steak, or something, day in and day out. And yet, homeless veterans have no place to live, nothing to eat, and are lying on grates, freezing to death. Let's take $220 million, help them, take it away from paid volunteers, and send the right message to America. 
   Homeless veterans start showing up 10 years after they are discharged. Ten years after they have served this country, many times in combat, they start showing up. That is why, within the past 10 years, the veterans homeless problem has increased. They don't give the veterans a fair share of the money that is designated for the homeless because somehow when they move out of the service and back into society, they slip through the net. Who knows what it is? Posttraumatic stress? I don't know. But they are slipping through the net. 
   This is not meant as a criticism of anybody or any agency or anybody else. But let's tighten the net. Let's rethread the net. We can do a lot of rethreading of the net with that $220 million. 
   In my State, a veteran from northern New Hampshire who needs an MRI has to take at least two van trips to have this simple test done. That is why we need to change that. The median age of homeless veterans is 45. It is not a way to treat our heroes. 
   This is just one small way to try to make a difference, one moral lesson to send to the people of America, and to the children of America, that we are not going to fund paid volunteers until we fund our Nation's veterans. Then if you want to talk about paid volunteers, fine. But at least be honest; let's just call them paid workers instead of paid volunteers. 
   That is all I am asking for with this amendment. That is all I am asking. 
   Mr. President, at this point for the sake of the RECORD, I ask for the yeas and nays on my amendment.

   Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President I rise today to signal my strong support for the fiscal year 2000 Defense Authorization Act and conference report. I would also like to publicly thank Chairman WARNER for his leadership, wisdom, and commitment to doing what is right for America as chairman of the Armed Services Committee. 
   As a member of the Armed Services Committee, and chairman of the Strategic Forces Subcommittee, I have a strong interest in the state of our Armed Forces, and the needs of its people. 
   Under the present administration, the Defense budget has declined by 40 percent since the end of the cold war, and total personnel strength has been cut by 30 percent. At this same time, this administration has also increased the military's deployment rate by 300 percent. 
   There are very few businesses in this country who could survive a 40 percent budget cut, and 30 percent personnel cut while still meeting a 300 percent increase in production. But that's what we have asked of our men and women in uniform--and they have delivered every single time. The time is long overdue for us to give something back--to stop the hemmorrhaging--to give them the money the need, the equipment they need, the resources  they need, and most importantly the people they need. We still have a long way to go, but this authorization bill is the first step in the right direction--the first of many I will continue to fight for. 
   I am extremely proud of the pay package contained in this bill. It contains the largest pay raise since 1982 and will stop the erosion of a double-digit pay gap that's been growing for 20 years. Restoring previously reduced retirement benefits to their original levels shows a commitment to our veteran's long-term security and the value of a career of honorable service. These two provisions are critical to solving our recruiting and retention crisis. 
   As chairman of the Strategic Forces Subcommittee, I am also extremely proud of the strategic provisions in this bill. 
   In written testimony before the Armed Services Committee in February of this year, the Director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, Lt. Gen. Hughes, testified in his written statement,  
   Weapons of mass destruction and theater missile delivery means has become the greatest direct threat to US forces deployed and engaged worldwide.  
   With that critical focus I am proud to announce that this bill includes an increase of $212 million over the President's budget request for the patriot PAC-3 theater missile defense system, and an increase of $90 million over the President's budget for the Navy theater wide missile defense program. 
   Gen. Dick Myers, Commander of U.S. Space Command, testified before my subcommittee in March that the space-based infrared system [SBIRS] was Space Command's No. 1 priority due to its critical role in missile warning and national missile defense. This bill contains an increase of $92 million to speed the deployment of the SBIRS constellation and directly increase the security of our Nation. 
   As the next decade unfolds, the United States is becoming increasingly reliant on space to meet our national security needs, as well as our daily economic needs. This bill also provides for an increase of $25 million to develop the space maneuver vehicle which will significantly reduce the cost and increase the speed at which we can launch payloads into space. And an increase of $15 million for the Air Force and Army's space control technology programs which will be critical to ensuring our freedom of access to space in the next decade. 
   This bill also includes a provision establishing a commission to assess U.S. national security space organization and management, to address the critical need to truly focus on spacepower and its role in national security. 
   In response to a thorough review and examination of security problems at the Department of Energy's nuclear labs, this conference report also includes legislation to consolidate all national security functions under a single, semi-autonomous agency known as the National Nuclear Security Administration. As demonstrated by the Cox Commission report, and the President's own Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board, this reorganization is crucial to our national security and safeguarding our nuclear labs, and has my strongest support. 
   There are many other provisions in this bill that are imperative for our troops, and our nation, but I don't have time to discuss them all. But the bottom line is this: our troops deserve the best, and the American people deserve the best. 
   This bill represents a huge victory for our troops, but it's only the first step on a tough road to correcting our long-term readiness problems. The Clinton administration has cut military spending every year since he took office--and turned a deaf ear to the critical problems it has caused. Year after year the administration denied there were any problems and refused to increase spending. Only now that we're starting to come apart at the seams have they admitted there's a problem, and the Joint Chiefs told us in testimony that the administration's plan for fixing it was still $40 billion short. We have added an extra $8 billion in this budget, the first increase in defense spending in more than a decade, but there's still a long way to go. I am committed to our troops and to halting this erosion, and this bill is the start. 
   Mr. President, I strongly support this bill, and I encourage my colleagues to do the same. 
   I would like to thank Chairman WARNER again for his leadership on this critical issue, and I yield the floor.

    Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise to join with Senator SHELBY in supporting the repeal of the provisions in Federal law creating a National ID card. I am pleased that the managers have decided to accept this amendment. 
   Mr. President, the American people strongly oppose the institution of a national identification card. 
   And, I share their opposition. 
   The establishment of a national system of identification seriously threatens our personal liberties. It would allow Federal bureaucrats to monitor movements and transactions of every citizen. 
   It's Big Brother on an immense scale. It's even possible, perhaps more probable, that Federal officials could even punish innocent citizens for failure to produce the proper papers. 
   The authority was given for a national I.D. card in Section 656 of the Immigration Reform Act of 1996. That section sets the stage for the establishment of Federal standards for drivers' licenses, thus transforming drivers' licenses into a de facto national ID card. 
   Let me go through what Section 656 does. 
   It expands the use and dissemination of the Social Security Account number. 
   It requires Federal agencies to accept only documents that meet the standards laid out in the section, thus creating a de facto national identification card. 
   It preempts the traditional state function of issuing driver's licenses and places it in the hands of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. 
   In a time when we are trying to give control back to the states, the establishment of Federal standards for drivers' licenses usurps the states constitutionally-protected authority to set their own standards for drivers' licenses. 
   Only 7 states require the social security account number to be displayed on driver's licenses. 9 states have repealed their requirement that drivers license display the number since 1992. 
   The National Conference of State Legislatures is very concerned about the Federalizing of State drivers' licenses and has written letters to Congress calling for the repeal of Section 656. They rightly understand that, although the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration is not proceeding with any rulemaking at this time, the law is still on the books, the potential is still there. 
   Mr. President, in 1998, the Omnibus Consolidated and Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act, 1999, contained a provision that prohibits the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration from issuing a final rule on National identification cards as required under section 656. 
   Today we have an opportunity, with my amendment, to prohibit the establishment of a national identification card by denying funding for Section 656.  
   Mr. President, let me read from a letter that was written by 13 groups in opposition to Section 656 and this national ID system. 
   This letter is from: The National Conference of State Legislators, the National Association of Counties, the American Civil Liberties Union, the American Immigration Lawyers Association, Concerned Women for America, Eagle Forum, Electronic Frontier Foundation, Free Congress Foundation, National Asian Pacific American Legal Consortium, National Council of La Raza, National Immigration law Center, Traditional Values Coalition, and the U.S. Catholic Conference. 
   It is addressed to Speaker HASTERT.

   Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I also have a letter from the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons:  
   I am writing today to express the support of the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons, a group of thousands of private physicians in the United States concerned about patient/physician confidentiality for repealing Section 656 of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996. 
   In our system of government, not everything that people do or think is presumed to be within the government's right to know. By repealing the law establishing a national ID scheme, you help protect the threatened liberty of all Americans from a dangerous precedent, which allows bureaucrats the ability to inappropriately monitor private details. 
   As a doctor, I cannot allow the privacy of my patients to be at risk. 
   Sincerely, JANE ORIENT, MD.  
   Mr. President, the Republican Party Platform, states clearly and unequivocally, ``We oppose the creation of any national ID card.'' 
   Mr. President, let me read from a paper compiled by a group called Privacy International, entitled, ``ID Cards: Some Personal Views from around the world.''

   Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, when my colleagues come down here to vote, I want you to look around at some of the statues and portraits in this building. 
   What would some of these great men, Washington, Jefferson, Adams--our founding fathers--what would they think about the government they created setting up a system requiring every law-abiding citizen to carry a national ID card. 
   Is this what the Constitution intended? 
   Does the Tenth Amendment allow the Federal Government to dictate what information state governments must put on their drivers' licenses? 
   For the sake of nabbing a few illegal aliens--which a national ID card will not do--is it worth inconveniencing tens of millions of law-abiding American citizens and costing Federal, state, and local governments millions of dollars? 
   Mr. President, I again thank the managers for accepting this amendment to protect the rights of all Americans by opposing this misguided section in the law creating a National ID Card.

   Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, earlier today, there was quite a bit of colorful rhetoric and blustering on the floor by the Democratic Party about reports in the Washington Post today that Republicans were going to create a ``13th month'' to allow more spending on education and other programs. 
   Lest I be accused of partisanship, I think many of you know I am an Independent. So those who say I am going to speak on behalf of Republicans, I guess, would technically be wrong. I don't pretend to speak for the Republicans, and I am not privy to what was said in any meetings with the Republicans regarding the so-called 13th month. But let me speak for myself as an Independent and say I don't support a 13th month for any fiscal year. 
   But in their effort to be partisan and embarrass Republicans over what was probably a mischaracterization, in my view, in a liberal newspaper, my Democrat colleagues failed to address the key issue, which is, where do you come up with the money to fund all of these programs? 
   In their zeal to make partisan points and poke fun--and they did have a good time--they failed to offer any constructive solution. If you are going to poke fun and make jokes about the 13th month headline, what are your alternatives? My guess is they would prefer to use the same budget tactics they have been using for about 50 years. The result of those budget tactics over the past 50 years has been to run up the national debt to where it is almost $6 trillion, raid the Social Security trust fund, and in order to do it all raise taxes. 
   Every year, we do this. Every year, the train comes down the track and usually has a wreck. We spend, spend, spend, spend, and then we get to the  end of the year and we act as though there is some magic budgetary goblin running around eating up money and we invent these tricks to try to figure out how to break the budget, while we still tell constituents we balance it. It is pretty outrageous. We use every budgetary gimmick we can find: forward funding, emergency designation, baseline budgeting. You name it, you have heard it. Now we have ``13th month.'' 
   For those of you who may be listening or watching right now, when you hear those terms, my advice would be to hang on tightly to your wallet because the story is, if a Democrat has a vision, it is probably focused right on your wallet, and that is what is happening now. They are having fun with this 13th month, but they have that luxury because they are in the minority. I suppose you can say, technically, so am I, but on this point I am siding with the Republicans. They didn't invent budgetary gimmickry. 
   Insofar as this Congress intends to use smoke and mirrors to secretly fund more rather than less unconstitutional programs, I don't intend to be a part of it. Our Founding Fathers would be ashamed of this whole debate for several reasons: 
   No. 1, they didn't intend for us to balance our budget using accounting tricks and elongated fiscal years. 
   No. 2, they didn't intend for us to burden our children with trillions of dollars in debt--trillions. 
   No. 3, they didn't intend for us to spend billions of dollars on education programs that should be handled at the State and local level. 
   My colleague, Senator GORTON, has been very instrumental on initiatives to try to bring that spending back to the State and local level where it belongs. So as perhaps the only nonpartisan person in the Senate right now, let me offer a solution. It is pretty simple. I have a way that we can support the Constitution, balance the budget, and not use any budgetary tricks at all. It is very simple: Don't spend the money. 
   The Department of Education is billions of dollars worth of unconstitutional infringements on State and local authority. Don't spend the money, if the Democrats don't want the Republicans using budgetary tricks, the Republicans don't want to break the budget caps, and the founders don't want us funding unconstitutional programs. So let's abolish the Department of Education. Then we can go back home to our school districts and say: You now have the constitutional authority you had in the first place to educate your children the way you choose--home school, private school, public school, whatever. By the way, you have more money to spend and the budget is balanced. 
   Very simple. Nothing complicated. So let me say the best way to end all the budgetary gimmickry is don't spend the money. 
   Mr. President, I yield the remainder of my time. 
   I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, my amendment to the Interior appropriations bill is a very simple one. It eliminates all funding for the National Endowment for the Arts. This amendment has been considered by the Senate in the past, unfortunately unsuccessfully. I know where the votes are, but I believe it is important we make a statement about this because I do not believe the Federal Government should be spending money for this. 
   This amendment does not try to reform the agency. This amendment does not try to restructure the agency. It simply shuts it down in fiscal year 2000. 
   I want to take a little different tack on this. Many who have spoken in the past on the National Endowment for the Arts, as far as elimination of funding, have focused heavily on some of the reprehensible and repulsive, frankly, types of material that has been displayed and called ``art.'' I am not going to do that this morning. Most Members are fully aware of the kinds of things that have been funded by this agency. 
   I remind every Member that we took an oath to support the Constitution. All of us at one point stood right where the pages are now sitting and said that we would bear true faith and allegiance to the Constitution of the United States of America. I certainly believe that every Member took that oath seriously. That is why I am hopeful I might be able to persuade my colleagues to support this amendment because, frankly, whatever opinion you may have of it, is unconstitutional to have the National Endowment for the Arts funded by the Federal Government. I can prove that. 
   A constituent challenged me on this one time and wrote:  
   Where in the Constitution of the United States does it say that the Federal Government is authorized to fund art?  
   Let me repeat:  
   Where in the Constitution of the United States does it say that the Federal Government is authorized to fund art?  
   I challenge any of my colleagues to show me that in the Constitution, and I will reconsider my amendment. 
   I offer this amendment because I have not been able to find this in the Constitution. The authors of our Constitution envisioned a government of limited powers, and if it does not say you do it in the Constitution, then it is reserved to the people and the States. If the State or the people want to fund a State endowment for the arts, I would not have a problem with that. That is entirely within their parameters. 
   The framers made it clear--very clear--that unless the Constitution explicitly granted a power to the Federal Government, that power would be reserved to the States, to the localities, to civil society, or to the people. 
   I know there are many--and this is the frustrating part for me--too many in this body who reject that vision. I have been here going on 9 years, and it is very frustrating for me to watch the Constitution of the United States being trampled time after time. Just a week or so ago, we passed more gun controls and sent it to conference. Gun control, however you may feel about the need for gun control, is unconstitutional because we have a second amendment that says we have the right to keep and bear arms. Whatever you may feel about that issue, we did not come here to pass laws about our personal beliefs. We came here to pass laws that support the Constitution of the United States of America. 
   When we swear to uphold that document, we agree to live by 
   that vision whether we like it or not. Whether we disagree or agree, we should live with that vision. Regretfully, we do not always do that here. 
   This amendment is my effort--just a small effort--to move a little closer to the founders, move a little closer to that vision of limited constitutional government. It is interesting that I have to say move a little closer. Why do we have to move closer to the vision of the founders when we are supposed to uphold the Constitution and enforce that vision, not move a little closer to it. We should be there. 
   It is a bad idea. Whether it is constitutional or unconstitutional, it is a bad idea to use taxpayers' funds to subsidize art. But it is unconstitutional. Whether it is a good idea or bad idea, it is unconstitutional, and that is the point I am making. 
   Most of my colleagues will recall the controversies in which this agency has been embroiled. I referenced them briefly in the beginning of my remarks. I am not going to get into all of it because we have heard it before. But funding the exhibition of sadomasochistic photographs, funding the exhibition of a photograph of a crucifix submerged in human waste, funding the exhibition of a performance ``artist'' who smeared chocolate across her naked torso, or how about the other NEA funding artist who exposed his audience to HIV-infected blood--all of these things were funded by the taxpayers of the United States in the name of art. 
   Let me repeat that. Funding of sadomasochistic photographs, funding of a photograph of a crucifix submerged in human waste, funding of a so-called performance artist who smeared chocolate across her naked torso, and a man who exposed his audience to HIV-infected blood, all funded by the taxpayers of the United States of America. 
   I ask you to reflect, if you are a taxpayer, on the fact that you work pretty hard for those dollars, and when you pay those taxes every April 15 to Uncle Sam, you probably hope it is used to preserve and protect and defend the United States of America, perhaps to promote education or some positive thing. But do you really want your money to go to this kind of so-called art? 
   The question is, some people may say this is art, but there are people out there who will disagree. There are people who will say: If I want to put a crucifix in urine and call that art, I have a right to do that; it is a free country. You do. I will fight to my death to say you have a right to do that. I may not agree it is art, but that is your position and you have a right to it. 
   But the question is, Is it constitutional to fund art? Even more so, Is it constitutional to fund this kind of stuff? Do you want your taxpayer dollars being spent for this? The sad part about this--we have seen this in debate after debate, in amendment after amendment, year after year, as we tried to stop this. Senator HELMS has been involved in this many times, to his credit, as a leader in trying to expose this agency. Senator ASHCROFT, who is my original cosponsor, has also been involved in this and has been a leader on this. 
   But the defenders of the NEA, the National Endowment of the Arts, always tell you--you will hear it after the vote on this amendment, I am sure, if not before--that they believe these outrages are a thing of the past, that all of the things I just cited about the crucifix in human waste, and so forth, are all in the past: We have cleaned up the agency. It is not happening anymore. It is old news. We heard you. We listened, and we made the changes.  
   I am sorry to tell you, that is not true. I will prove that in a few moments. Once you really understand the NEA, you will not be surprised to learn that the outrages continue, and not only do they continue, they are all too common in this agency. 
   Let me illustrate the point about a grant that made news earlier this year. The events surrounding this grant were described in an article in the New York Times.

   Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. This grant had to do with a grant to a publisher for a children's book. Listen carefully, a children's book. This was a grant to a publisher for a children's book, paid for by the taxpayers under the National Endowment of the Arts, at a time--recently--when we had been told that the agency had cleaned up its act and that this was no longer prevalent; no longer do they do these terrible things I just mentioned. 
   The grant that I am referring to for this children's book had been approved at every level of the NEA's review process. It was canceled at the last minute by the agency's chairman. 
   Somebody might say: Well, there you go. It worked. They stopped this grant for a children's book; it wasn't appropriate for children. So what is your argument, Senator? 
   Let me finish. Why did they cancel at the last minute? Because the Chairman of the NEA found out that the book's author was a Mexican guerrilla leader. The chairman was afraid that the royalties would benefit the Mexican guerrillas. So the reason for the grant cancellation was because of the Mexican guerrilla group, not because of the content. 
   Let's take a look at the content. The New York Times reported that this children's book contained sexually explicit illustrations and text; in other words, this children's book, with sexual content, would have received the NEA support this year--not 10 years ago; this year--if there had not been the other issue about royalties going to Mexican guerrillas. 
   I submit there is an inherent flaw in the peer review process that led to this circumstance, and all the other outrages over the years. The peer review process does not reflect the values of the decent, hard-working, tax-paying Americans who fund this agency. 
   Let me just find the article from the New York Times, which I have entered into the RECORD. 
   I want to remind you, again, that this grant was canceled because the money would go to a Mexican guerrilla group, and there was no reference whatsoever to the content. 
   This is a children's book. I would ask my colleagues and the American people to ask yourselves whether you want your tax dollars to go for this kind of stuff for a children's book:  
   The illustrations are bright, broad-stroked paintings of gods with horns and bug-eyes  done by [a man by the name of] Domitila Dominguez, a Mexican Indian artist. 
   Spun in the sensuous tradition of Latin storytelling, the tale includes elements that might be controversial in the mainstream American children's book market. As the story opens, the text reads, ``The men and women were sleeping or they were making love, which is a nice way to become tired and then go to sleep.'' 
   The double-page illustration shows a reclining naked woman in a sexual embrace with [a] figure that appears to be a male god.  
   We could go on and on and on. 
   This is a children's book. It was canceled because the money went to Mexican guerrillas, not because of the content. So you see, the agency has not cleaned up its act. They have been getting away with this year after year after year. And why do they get away with it? They get away with it very simply because we won't stop the funding. We don't have the courage to stop the funding. 
   Again, the business about censorship--this is about the Constitution of the United States of America, which we are sworn to uphold and defend. Show me in the Constitution where the National Endowment of the Arts should be funded and why it should be funded. Show me. 
   When we try to say anything about it, we are always accused of censorship. The Smith amendment solves that problem by allowing the public to support the art works they wish voluntarily. You want to support a children's book that shows a naked woman and a naked man in a sexually explicit embrace? Go ahead. You want to show that to your children? Be my guest. You want to raise your children and teach them to read and show them the pictures? Be my guest. But it is not constitutional. And it ought not to happen in the Senate by funding this kind of stuff. We should not be funding art at all, let alone this kind of art. 
   So that is how it was done in America for the first 189 years of our history: Voluntarily you support the arts. Voluntarily you look at what you want to look at. You show your children what you want to show them. But you do not fund it by taking money from the rest of us to do it. 
   Let me just pause here for a moment to make a point. We could go through a litany of items that are unconstitutional that we pass on this floor almost literally every day--certainly every week. 
   I just ask the rhetorical question to the people of America: When are we going to wake up? We saw it time after time. We saw it with the Clinton impeachment: As long as my 401(k) and my retirement account is doing well, and as long as I am making money, as long as I have a job and 3 or 4 weeks of vacation, and everything is going fine, I don't care about the morality of this country. I don't care that the Commander in Chief did what he did. It is OK with me. Poll after poll after poll said just that. 
   Let me tell you. That is the same thing. Time after time after time, year after year after year, we vote to fund the National Endowment of the Arts. We are told every year that all this stuff that I just referred to has been cleaned up and it does not happen anymore. It does. 
   Yet why does it happen? Don't blame the National Endowment of the Arts. I don't blame them. I don't blame the Chairman. I don't blame the board. I don't blame any of them for this. 
   I blame the Senate, the House, and the President of the United States because we pass it and he signs it. We have been doing it year after year after year. They are going to keep right on spending your money as long as you keep giving it to them. 
   So don't blame them; don't direct your anger at them. You should direct it right here to the people who vote that money. Sooner or later, as the frog in the pot boils slowly and then is cooked before he realizes it, the Constitution of the United States is going to slip through the fingers of all of us. 
   It is happening. We are going to continue to let it happen by these kinds of votes. If we want to take seriously what we stood there and took the oath to do, to protect and defend the Constitution of the United States of America, we ought to vote against funding the National Endowment for the Arts. 
   So that everybody understands, there are essentially two major political parties in the United States right now, some smaller parties. Here is the Democratic Party on the NEA. This is a quote right out of their platform:  
   We believe in public support for the arts, including the National Endowment for the Arts.......  
   That is the 1996 Democrat platform; ``Responsible Entertainment.'' It is an honest statement. They have made it very clear they support this. It doesn't necessarily mean they are implying that they support the kinds of things I have said, but it does mean that as long as you continue to fund it and you don't stop it, those kinds of things are going to continue to be funded. 
   What we have in the Democratic platform is a statement that is unconstitutional. It is totally unconstitutional. To support the arts, including the National Endowment for the Arts, with taxpayer dollars is unconstitutional. But I think Members will find, when they see the votes taken on my amendment in a few minutes, that most of the members of the Democratic Party will support their platform. They will vote, I think, probably 
   overwhelmingly, probably 90-95 percent--maybe 100 percent, I am not sure--in favor of the National Endowment for the Arts and against my amendment. They will live up to their platform. I personally believe they are taking an unconstitutional vote, but that is their right. They can do it. They were elected just as I was, and they can vote any way they want to. I respect that right. 
   Let us look at the Republican Party platform. The Republican Party platform on the NEA, same issue:  
   As a first step in reforming government, we support ..... defunding or privatization of agencies which are obsolete, redundant, of limited value, or too regional in focus ..... [one of the] agencies we seek to defund or to privatize [is] the National Endowment for the Arts.  
   That is the 1996 Republican platform: ``Changing Washington from the Ground Up.'' We are going to change Washington from the ground up. I support that statement because it is unconstitutional not to support it. The Government should not be funding, under the Constitution, the National Endowment for the Arts. If one sees that statement and realizes that is the position of the party, then one could logically conclude that 90-95 percent of Republicans will vote to support their platform and vote to eliminate the National Endowment for the Arts. We will see. Don't bet on it. 
   That is the platform. So when the votes come, it will be interesting for the public to look to see who supports their platform. Will the Democrats support their platform, albeit unconstitutional in my view, on this issue, or will the Republicans support their platform? Let us see where the votes fall. 
   Let me issue a challenge to anyone listening: Take a look at the votes after it is all over. See who the Republicans are, see who the Democrats are, and see who supports the Republican platform and see who supports the Democrat platform. 
   This amendment takes out the entire funding, which is about $99 million. People will say that is not a lot of money. I guess around Washington it is not. But it sure was a lot of money around a little town called Allentown, NJ, where I grew up before I moved to New Hampshire. That was a whole lot of money. I know a whole lot of people who worked real hard--farmers, merchants, teachers--for those dollars. For this kind of money to be spent from them, I think it is wrong. It is wrong morally, philosophically, and, as I said before, it is unconstitutional. 
   Mr. President, seeing no other speaker on my behalf at this time, I ask for the yeas and nays on the amendment.

   Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I have just a few brief responses to my colleague.  
   I believe it would be a fallacy to equate Government funding, its own activities, legitimate functions of the Government, to fund those activities such as the Library of Congress and the Smithsonian, which obviously are document preservation, artifacts, and historical matters--that is legitimate, in my view; but to equate that with the Government funding of private activities is where I have my differences. I think that is the difference--the Government funding its own activities versus the Government funding private activities. 
   I believe that art, in terms of the examples I gave, is and should be funded privately because there is a matter of what is art and what is not art, which is a matter of personal opinion. I don't believe taxpayers should fund somebody else's view of what art is or is not. I also think it is wrong for us to act without explicit constitutional authority, whether it is in the arts, or education, or anything else. 
   The Senator from Washington is correct. I misspoke when I said education. I should not have used that term because, also, the Federal Government, in my view, does not have a legitimate role in determining the education of our children. I believe that is a local matter that ought to be done by the States, the local communities, and parents. 
   Finally, to say it is a good thing for a Federal agency to provide a ``seal of approval'' for the arts so that the private sector will know what to support, that is a threat to art. 
   I think that threatens the legitimate issue of art in that government has no business telling people what good art is or what bad art is. I don't think there is any room for the government in art. 
   Frankly, it is very interesting when you pick out the platform of the Republican Party and read it. Some don't believe we should read our platforms. But I happen to believe we should. 
   In the 1996 Republican Platform, there is a quote of Senator Bob Dole of March 10, 1995, in which he said:  
   On November 8, 1994, the American people sent a message to Washington. Their message is my mandate to rein in government, reconnect it to the values of the American people, and that means making government a whole lot smaller, a lot less arrogant and getting it out of matters best left to the States, cities, and families across America.  
   That is all I am trying to do. What I am trying to say is if there is some family out there--I can't believe there would be, but there may be--who would like to have a children's book shown to their children showing a naked man and naked woman embracing in the act of sex, if they want to show that to their children, as I said before, I guess that is up to them, but I don't think we ought to be funding it. 
   Furthermore, finally, what the Republican Platform said at that time was:  
   As a first step in reforming government, we support the elimination of the departments of Commerce, Housing and Urban Development, Education, Energy, and the elimination, defunding, or privatization of agencies which are obsolete, redundant, of limited value, or too regional in focus. Examples of agencies that we seek to defund or to privatize are the National Endowment for the Arts, the National Endowment for the Humanities, the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, and the Legal Services Corporation.  
   I am quoting out of the platform. Finally:  
   In addition, we support Republican sponsored legislation that would require the original sponsor of proposed Federalization to cite specific constitutional authority for the measure.  
   If you are going to offer something as an amendment or a bill which ultimately may become law, then cite constitutional authority for it because, after all, we are here to protect and defend the Constitution. 
   That is the only point I am trying to make. I understand that the votes have never been here to eliminate this agency. I don't expect them to be here this time. 
   I don't mean to argue, other than to say that I ask my colleagues to try to move back to the constitutionality issue because I believe that is what this is all about. If you make an exception, even if this was art that was pleasing to me, if it was art that I liked, that I approved of, it would be the same argument--that it has no business being funded. It is not constitutional. I don't believe that we should be funding it. 
   I see my colleague from Missouri. I know he is an original sponsor of this amendment. 
   Mr. President, at this time I yield the floor.

   Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I am pleased to join the distinguished chairman of the Committee on Environment and Public Works in introducing the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1999 (SARA). This bill is the result of several months of negotiations in the Committee, and reflects input we received from Senators on both sides of the aisle, state and local officials, the Administration, environmental groups, and the regulated community. 
   My colleagues who are familiar with our original bill, S. 1090, will notice several changes made in this new legislation. 
   Perhaps most significantly, we have added new titles on remedy selection and natural resource damages. These new provisions are similar to those contained in S. 8, the Superfund Cleanup Acceleration Act in the 105th Congress. Some may remember that the Environment and Public Works Committee reported S. 8 in May of 1998, but we never were able to debate the bill on the Senate floor. 
   Our remedy selection provisions are fairly straightforward. We would codify EPA's policy on the preference for treatment of principal threats, with an exception for sites, such as mining sites, at which such a preference would be inappropriate. We require remedies to achieve a degree of cleanup that complies with applicable Federal and State standards. We also set forth requirements for site specific risk assessments. 
   On natural resource damages (NRD), we deal with the major issues that have been debated over the last 10 years or more. SARA's NRD provisions: 
   Provide a clear definition of the objective of restoration; require costs assessed against responsible parties to be reasonable, based on the restoration measure's technical feasibility, cost effectiveness, timeliness, and consideration of natural recovery as a restoration alternative; prohibit recoveries for so-called ``nonuser'' damages and appropriately limit lost use damages; provide for the expedited or enhanced restoration of substitute resources where a unique resource that cannot be replaced has been destroyed, lost or damaged; provide responsible parties with the right to de novo review--or a full trial on all aspects of the claims against them; and, preclude double recovery against responsible parties. 
   In addition to these new titles, we have also made several changes to S. 1090 as introduced. 
   First, we have increased authorized funding levels in the first two years of the five-year period covered by the bill and made the ramp-down in funding less severe in the final three years. 
   Second, we deleted the cap on new NPL listings and revised the requirement for removing clean contiguous property parcels from NPL listings. 
   Third, we made extensive changes to the allocation system to provide additional flexibility. We added authorization for early settlements without an allocation, as well as an expedited allocation based only on an estimate of the orphan share. 
   Fourth, we expressly preserve strict, joint and several liability for those parties who choose not to participate in a settlement. We also ensure that EPA's existing authority to issue orders and engage in removal actions is not unduly limited.  
   Mr. President, these modifications have, in my view, improved the bill substantially. We are introducing this new bill for the information of our colleagues, and in an effort to generate more support for this legislation. 
   Unfortunately, these revisions to our Superfund bill were not sufficient to garner support 
   from a majority of the Members on the Committee. That is disappointing to me, and I would urge my colleagues to take a good look at the bill we introduce today. It represents strong reform of the troubled Superfund program. It will accelerate cleanup by injecting greater fairness into the system, providing more resources for state and local cleanup efforts, and providing finality for decisions made under those state programs. 
   Our legislation continues to make major reforms in six areas. Specifically, SARA: 
   Directs EPA to finish the job that was started nearly two decades ago by completing the evaluation of the 3,000 remaining sites on the CERLA Information System (CERCLIS). 
   Clearly allocates responsibility between states and EPA for future cleanups. 
   Protects municipalities, small businesses, recyclers, and other parties from unfair liability--while making the system fairer for everyone else. 
   Provides states $100 million per year and full authority for their own cleanup programs. 
   Revitalizes communities with $100 million in annual brownfields redevelopment grants. 
   Requires fiscal responsibility by EPA and saves taxpayers money. 
   Our legislation will result in more hazardous waste sites being cleaned up--and in fewer dollars being wasted on litigation. It will give much-needed and much-deserved liability relief to innocent landowners, contiguous property owners, prospective purchasers, municipalities, small businesses, and recyclers. Unlike EPA's administrative reforms, this bill does not shift costs from politically popular parties to those left holding the bag. Instead, it requires payment of a statutory orphan share and authorizes the use of the Superfund Trust Fund for those shares. 
   For those left trapped in the Superfund liability scheme, SARA requires an allocation process to determine a party's fair share in an expedited settlement--instead of fighting it out for years in court. 
   In addition to increasing fairness, SARA provides much needed guidance and direction to a sometimes wayward EPA. It recognizes and builds upon the growth and strength of State hazardous waste cleanup programs. It provides new resources to States and localities for their cleanup and redevelopment efforts. As many of my colleagues know, the fear of Superfund liability has resulted in an estimated 450,000 abandoned or underutilized properties, or ``Brownfields,'' that lay fallow because private developers and municipalities don't want to be dragged into Superfund's litigation quagmire. With new resources and appropriate liability protections, our bill will allow the cleanup of those sites, spurring economic redevelopment in cities, towns, and rural areas across America. 
   We take a different approach to the brownfields redevelopment issue than the Administration seeks. Along with many of my colleagues, I believe that economic redevelopment is primarily a State and local issue. Our approach provides the resources and freedom States need to make progress on this front, rather than giving EPA new authority to get into the commercial real estate and redevelopment business. That is not EPA's role, nor should it be. 
   Where EPA does have a role is in identifying and addressing risks at uncontrolled hazardous waste sites. Our legislation ensures that EPA regains its focus on that mission. 
   Earlier this year, the General Accounting Office (GAO) reported that ``completion of construction at existing sites'' and reducing new entries into the program was the Environmental Protection Agency's top Superfund priority. Unfortunately, EPA's narrow focus on generating construction completion statistics appear to have divested resources from EPA's fundamental mission--protecting human health and the environment from releases of hazardous waste. 
   GAO reported last year that 3,000 sites still await a National Priorities List decision by EPA. Most of those sites have been in the CERCLIS inventory for more than a decade. According to the report, however, more than 1,200 of them are actually ineligible for listing on the NPL, for a variety of reasons. Some of the sites were classified erroneously, while others either do not require cleanup, have already been cleaned up, or have final cleanup underway. EPA's failure to remove the specter of an NPL listing at these sites has likely caused significant economic and social harm to the surrounding communities. EPA needs to focus on that task. 
   In addition, far too many of the sites that are still potentially eligible for listing have received little or no attention from EPA. EPA admitted taking no cleanup action at all at 336 sites and provided no information for another 48 sites. The only action taken at 719 sites was an initial site assessment. EPA's inattention may be due to the fact that EPA and state officials together identified only 232 of the sites as worthy of being added to NPL. In that case, however, the appropriate response is to archive the sites while ensuring that any necessary cleanup occurs under some other Federal or State program. EPA needs to focus on that task as well. 
   Unfortunately, there is also disagreement between EPA and state officials about even those 232 sites. EPA identified 132 that may be listed on the NPL in the future, but state officials agreed on only 26 of those. Conversely, state officials identified a different group of 100 sites as worthy of an NPL listing in the future. 
   EPA agreed with GAO's recommendation that it ``develop a joint strategy'' with the States for addressing these sites. After nearly 20 years and $20 billion in taxpayer funded EPA appropriations, it is disturbing that the agency only now is developing such strategy. Nonetheless, Congress has an obligation to provide direction and assistance to EPA in this effort. The Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act provides that direction by: 
   Requiring EPA to finish evaluating and/or archiving old sites stuck in the CERCLIS inventory, thus correcting the current imbalance between evaluating uncontrolled sites and amassing construction completed statistics. 
   Providing EPA with a schedule of 30 NPL listings per year, to ensure that it and the States appropriately allocate sites for cleanup under Superfund, RCRA, or State response programs. 
   Increasing current law limits on EPA removal actions to provide greater flexibility in responding to sites that, at least initially, should be the responsibility of the Federal government, but ultimately do not require an NPL listing. 
   These provisions will ensure that the limited universe of sites remaining in the Superfund pipeline are dealt with quickly and safely. 
   In addition to keeping EPA focused on the task at hand, our bill provides increased resources and authority to the States, in recognition of the progress made by State cleanup programs in the last decade. 
   Superfund is notable among the major Federal environmental statutes not only for its abysmal track record, but also for its heavy reliance on EPA action rather that state implementation. In other environmental programs--RCRA, the Clean Water Act, the Safe Drinking Water Act--EPA typically sets general program direction and provides technical support while leaving implementation and enforcement to the states. In the Superfund program, however, EPA takes a direct role in both enforcement and cleanup. This leadership role was originally justified by a perceived inability or alleged unwillingness on the part of states to perform or oversee cleanups. The situation today is far different. 
   The Environmental Law Institute reported last year that States have now completed 41,000 cleanups, with another 13,700 in progress. The Association of State and Territorial Solid Waste Management Officials (ASTSWMO) reports that ``States are not only addressing more sites at any given time, but are also completing more sites through streamlined State programs. State programs have matured and increased in their infrastructure capacity.'' 
   Most now recognize that states have made great strides in their programs,  and even EPA in May of 1998 released a ``Plan to Enhance the Role of States and Tribes in the Superfund Program.'' Not surprisingly, while that plan appears to provide some increased opportunities for state leadership, it also envisions a significant, on-going role for EPA. 
   The Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act, on the other hand, assists, recognizes, and builds on the growth of state cleanup programs. SARA also responds to pleas from ASTSWMO, the National Governors Association, and others to remove the ever-present threat of EPA over-filing and third party lawsuits under Superfund when a site is being cleaned up under a State program. SARA recognizes the fact that States should be the leaders in cleaning up hazardous waste sites by: 
   Providing $100 million annually for State core and voluntary response programs to allow States to build on their impressive record of accomplishment in this area. 
   Providing finality, except in cases of emergency or at a State's request, for cleanups conducted under State law. 
   Requiring EPA to work with the States so that sites listed on the NPL are those the Governor of the State agrees warrant an NPL listing. 
   Mr. President, the legislation we introduce today has the strong support of the nation's small businesses, Governors, Mayors, and state cleanup officials. I urge my colleagues to support it as well.

    Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the town of Newton, New Hampshire on its two hundred and fiftieth anniversary. The town's residents will celebrate this historic occasion on August 15, 1999 with a number of festivities including a parade and an ``Olde Fashioned Fireman's Muster''. 
   Newton's rich and fruitful history dates back to 1639 when families first settled in the area granted by England known as New Salisbury (Amesbury). Newton's actual township was incorporated in 1749, allowing the people to elect their own officials and to hold town meetings. 
   Much of the frontier region was wild country inhabited by the Naumkeag Indians. The settlers and the Naumkeaks had generally peaceful relations, relying on one another for trading purposes. The greatest danger facing the settlers came from the war parties of the Mic Macs, who originated from the area now known as Maine and New Brunswick, Canada. These hostile groups conducted violent raids as far south as Connecticut, killing large numbers of local populations. With a combination of the settlers' admirable fortitude and the recurring epidemics of disease, these native populations were nearly wiped out. 
   Newton residents have persevered in other ways throughout the years, courageously serving and defending America. They have participated in the French and Indian Wars, Revolutionary War, War of 1812, Civil War, World War I, World War II, the Korean War and the Vietnam Conflict. Newton's citizens are always willing to serve our Nation when called upon. 
   I congratulate the town of Newton, and it's dedicated and patriotic citizens. I am proud to serve the residents of Newton in the United States Senate.

    Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the Bedford Presbyterian Church which is celebrating its 250th Anniversary on August 15, 1999. The church first organized on August 15, 1749 and has been serving the people of Bedford ever since. 
   The church was founded under the rules of Massachusetts Colony who deeded the land to the New Hampshire and also mandated that in order to organize a town there must be land for a church, a minister, and an orthodox ministry. The church was thus formed in 1749 and the town charter was signed the next year. 
   As a person of strong religious convictions, I applaud the services and strong sense of family and community that the church has provided to its community. Furthermore, I applaud their monthly celebrations of this historic event. 
   I commend the Bedford Presbyterian Church and wish them luck in the next 250 years. It is an honor to represent the members of Bedford Presbyterian Church in the United States Senate.

    Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Robert Stephen of Manchester, New Hampshire for his appointment to Director of Community Development Services at New Hampshire's Department of Resources and Economic Development. 
   After ten years of service as a New Hampshire State Senator, Democratic Leader from 1984 to 1990, Robert was appointed Deputy Executive Director of the New Hampshire Job Training Council. In this capacity Robert was responsible for providing New Hampshire businesses with the skilled labor needed to grow and be successful and New Hampshire citizens with the skills they need to become self-sufficient. He has also been a driving force in workforce development by overseeing the state's Rapid Response effort and convening the Statewide Business Relations Team. 
   Not only has Robert taken on the task of improving the New Hampshire workforce, but he has been an asset to his community. He has won numerous Multiple Sclerosis Fund-Raising Awards, was a former member of the New Hampshire State Athletic Commission, has received the Easter Seal VIP Award and has been a business owner in downtown Manchester. On top of all this service, Robert was also able to become a three-time New Hampshire Golden Gloves Boxing Champion. 
   Robert's new responsibility as Director of Community Development Services will give him the opportunity to cultivate a stronger and more job ready workforce, meeting the needs and specifications of New Hampshire companies. His presence at the New Hampshire Job Training Council will surely be missed. 
   I want to commend Robert Stephen for his hard work on behalf of New Hampshire citizens and wish him luck in his new endeavor. It is an honor to represent Robert in the United States Senate.

    Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to honor Richard Tortorelli of Milford, New Hampshire, who has retired from the Milford Fire Department after 41 years of service. 
   Richard began his career with the Milford Fire Department while in high school. At the age of 21, he joined the fire department as an on-call fire fighter. In 1986, he became the first full-rime Fire Chief in Milford's history. Under his leadership, the fire department has seen many changes: a move from Town Hall in 1974 into the current station, a change from a one-town dispatch center to the regional Milford Area Communication Center, and equipment updates along with specialized training. 
   Even though Richard works in one of the most dangerous professions in the country, he has never lost a member of his department. One of the most rewarding aspects of his career is that the number of fire calls in Milford has decreased over the years. He acknowledges that teaching fire prevention is not as thrilling as fighting a fire, however it is very important. 
   I would like to thank Chief Tortorelli for his service to the Town of Milford, and his dedication and leadership to the Milford Fire Department. I commend Richard for his exemplary career and tireless efforts. I wish him luck in his future endeavors. It is an honor to represent him in the United States Senate.

   Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I want to make a point on the legislation before the cloture vote we are going to have shortly because, according to the rules, I am not going to be able to debate this until after the vote, which is really not the best process in the world. But I want my colleagues to know what we will be voting cloture on in a very few moments is the Senate substitute for the underlying House bill. So when we go to cloture on that, what we are doing is substituting gun control for the House bill. 
   I want all of my colleagues to understand that H.R. 1501 is a return to traditional values. 
   This bill brings morals back into the school. It brings values back into the school. It focuses on the cultural problems that are facing us. It allows a display of the Ten Commandments. It allows individual religious expression. It allows prayer at school memorial services. It allows faith-based groups to compete for Government juvenile justice grants. That is the underlying provision. That is what I wanted to vote on, and that is what I did not have the opportunity to vote on. 
   What is being substituted is gun control. It imposes strict limits on gun shows. It requires the sale of trigger locks with guns, and it puts new limits on juvenile gun possession, even juveniles who are law-abiding citizens who might like to have hunting licenses. 
   The bottom line is, the bill passed by the Senate is a good cultural bill. Gun control is being substituted. If my colleagues vote for cloture, they are voting to substitute gun control for a very good bill that focuses on the cultural and moral problems in our schools. 
   I will close on this point. There is a fictitious story being circulated on the Internet where a Columbine High School student writes a letter to God and says:  
   Dear God: I'm very angry with you. I don't understand why you allowed 13 of my fellow students to be killed by two of my fellow students. Please answer me as soon as possible. Columbine High School student.  
   A letter comes back from God:  
   Dear student: Let me remind you, I'm not allowed in your high school.  
   We need to think seriously because this is a major decision we are making. If my colleagues vote for cloture, they are substituting gun control for values, prayer in school, the Ten Commandments, religious expression, and prayers at memorial services. That is what they are substituting, one for the other. 
   Let's make it clear: If you are for gun control, vote for cloture. If you are for values and prayer and the Ten Commandments in school, vote against cloture. 
   I yield back the remainder of my time. I thank the minority leader for his courtesy.

   Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Idaho for his remarks. 
   I say for the RECORD that I agree with everything he said. 
   Mr. President, we have had a very unusual set of circumstances this morning. 
   We had a vote on an issue involving gun control, yet we don't get to speak until after the vote. Knowing what the result is, it does take out a little bit of the steam. 
   As most of my colleagues know, and I think most American people know, I have filibustered this bill now for about a week by asking for this cloture vote. As Senator CRAIG said, to simply have dilatory motions between now and the time this goes to conference makes no sense because the result of this bill going to conference has already been decided by the vote of the Senate. 
   Under this rule, each Senator, myself now being the one on the floor, has an hour to discuss the reason for their vote on this issue. I think it is important to discuss it, even though the vote has occurred, because the American people need to understand what we did. I tried in a very few brief minutes, thanks to the consideration of the minority leader who was kind enough to allow me 3 minutes of his time to do this prior to 9:45 when we had the vote, to point out what we were about to do. Apparently not too many people were listening. I will point out again what we did. 
   The House passed H.R. 1501 and sent it here. That is a cultural bill that allows the display of the Ten Commandments in schools. It allows individual religious expression. It allows prayer in school memorial services. It allows faith-based groups to compete for Government juvenile justice grants. A good bill. 
   The purpose of that bill was to make a statement about juveniles that perhaps the issue is not guns but, rather, a cultural problem in our schools that we need to address. It was a well-thought-out bill. When that bill came to the Senate, I tried to get a vote up or down on it. Because of procedures by those who felt the bill should not be passed, I could not do it. I was shut out by the so-called legislative tree, a parliamentary tree, so I could not offer the bill and get a vote on it. 
   Next comes gun control, the Senate provisions. We have a House bill and a Senate bill. The Senate bill imposes strict limits on gun shows. It requires the sale of trigger locks with guns. It puts new limits on juvenile gun possession, the kinds of juveniles that Senator CRAIG spoke about, young teenagers who perhaps might go hunting or sports shooting. These are needless restrictions on law-abiding American citizens, young and old. 
   I think it is important to understand what has happened. This was substituted for this as a result of the vote we just had. This bill will go to conference. Someone said quite some time ago: If you saw how laws and sausage were made, you would probably get sick and wouldn't want a part of either. 
   There is a lot of truth to that. I have never had a lot of confidence in those who say: We will clean this up in conference, or we will get a good bill out of conference, or let the conferees work their will. 
   We will see what kind of will is worked when this comes back. This is gun control, a violation of the second amendment. We voted by 77-22 to put more gun control on the American people. Call it what it is. When this comes out of conference, it will have gun control. 
   During the Senate's consideration of S. 254, I was very upset that the gun control lobby in this country took advantage of a terrible tragedy. They did a good job of it. This was a very emotional time, a horrible tragedy, and the gun control people used it to the hilt and scared off a lot of people. 
   What happened at Littleton was a terrible tragedy. People used this on the Senate floor and mounted an unprecedented assault on the second amendment rights of law-abiding American gun owners. Not one law-abiding American citizen had anything to do with Columbine, not one. Not one law-abiding American citizen, not one gun owner or juvenile who is a law-abiding citizen had anything to do with Columbine. They were law breakers who did that at Columbine. They cast the blame, though, on the law-abiding gun owner, while leaving the movie moguls and video gamemakers who promote violence to children unscathed, with no mention. The problem is guns, they said, not the culture. 
   It is interesting that we take prayer and values out of the schools. What comes in? Violence, drugs, condoms. Hello, America, wake up. 
   It was well done; it was well orchestrated. It scared off enough people. It  scared off the 19 or so votes we needed to block cloture on this bill. The House did the right thing; we did the wrong thing. 
   We need to take a hard, introspective look at our Nation's culture. That bill did that. This bill does not do that. We see video games designed for young people that glorify violence. I say to the American people taking a few moments to listen, look at those video games your kids are watching. Take a look at what they are watching on the Internet. Take a look at some of the movies they are bringing home from Erol's and watching after you go to bed. Parents might want to take a look and see what is going on in their children's lives. 
   They glorify violence. They invite children to engage in fantasy killings. They never show the opposite. When somebody is shot in one of the video games, they don't mention the fact that the person who was killed may have a family. They don't talk about that. The only thing shown is the glorification of violence. 
   We see unconscionably violent movies such as ``The Basketball Diaries'' in which killings bear a striking resemblance to the Littleton massacre. It doesn't mean every kid who watches that kind of a movie would do that. Of course it doesn't. Some kids can handle it, but some can't. Why expose children to this? 
   We see music such as that of the so-called Marilyn Manson character that glorifies murder, suicide, sodomy. As a matter of fact, Platinum Records has big sales on those records glorifying murder, suicide, and sodomy. Our kids are listening to this in America and we blame guns. We blame guns with this vote. 
   We see the marketing of violence in many forms over the Internet. As I said, every child is not going to go to school and murder his classmates or his teacher because he watches or plays some video game or listens to violent music. Some will be influenced by that culture. 
   I had a shotgun next to my bed for as long as I can remember. At 8 or 9 years old, I knew how to use it. I was trained to use it in the proper way. I never thought about going to school and using it on anybody, and neither did my classmates who also had shotguns. I remember hearing it said when I grew up that if you read good books, good things might happen. By the same token, if a young person watches a bad film or plays an evil video game, bad things may happen. Why take a chance? But it is easier to blame the gun. Blame the gun; blame somebody else. Don't look at what is going on in America. Wake up, America, before it is too late. 
   This is the second amendment to the Constitution that we just violated. It is not guns that caused this violence. 
   The first gun came over on a ship probably in 1607. Most likely somebody had a gun coming into Jamestown. For 375 years we had no school shootings, not one. Now we have gun control. In America, we have 40,000 laws, according to Senator CRAIG, and now we have school shootings. Hello. Anybody listening? What is going on here? Is it guns? If it is, how come we didn't have school shootings for 375 years when everybody had a gun? 
   I believe we should take a look at the news media. The news media has a distressing tendency to engage in sensationalism, the mindless pursuit of greater ratings. On April 20 this year when the children came tumbling out of Columbine High School with blood on their clothes, some children wounded and crying, what happened? With microphones in their face, they were asked: What was it like to witness your classmate's death? Did he say anything as he died? 
   What they needed when they came out of that high school, my fellow Americans, was a hug. 
   Do you know what would have really made me feel good? If one of those in the news media had laid down the microphone and laid down the camera and walked up to one of those kids and put his arms around them or her arms around them and said, ``I'm sorry. We love you.'' 
   But, oh, no, we cannot do that. We have to get right in the face with the microphone and the camera and sensationalize this kind of violence. And then we blame guns. 
   When are we going to wake up, America, before it is too late? This bill addressed this--tried to. You cannot address these kinds of things with laws, but you can at least make an attempt. You take these things out of the schools and the kids don't have any choice. They can't pray; they can't talk about values. If somebody gets killed and the teachers try to comfort their kids by saying a prayer, the teacher gets fired. And we take away guns and blame guns. 
   H.R. 1301 declares that State and local governments have the power to display the Ten Commandments on public property. This would allow the public schools to post those Ten Commandments. Does anyone seriously argue that the display of the Ten Commandments in a public school wouldn't help kids at least think a little bit? They do represent the moral foundation of our entire civilization. Does anybody have a problem with, ``Thou shall not kill?'' Does anybody have a problem with, ``Thou shalt not steal?'' ``Thou shalt not bear false witness?'' ``Honor thy father and mother?'' Does anybody have a problem with those? Is that going to threaten Western civilization, to put those up on the wall of the school? Really? Come on. 
   H.R. 1501, this bill, declares that the expression of religious faith by individual persons is protected by the Constitution of the United States. This provision would allow greater freedom for individual students to express their religious faith, whatever it is, as well as to organize and participate in student-led religious activities in public school. 
   Does anyone seriously believe that greater religious freedom in the public schools would not improve the cultural environment in these schools? We spend more time trying to deny religion and values in our schools than we spend with our own kids. Think about it. If we spent as much time with our kids, loving our kids, as we do trying to deny them these kinds of things, we might have a better America. But let's go back and blame guns. That is what we did here; we just blamed guns. We put in gun control and substituted it for this. 
   Faith-based organizations can compete for Government grants under this bill. Does anyone doubt that involving faith-based organizations in juvenile justice would improve our Nation's juvenile justice system? These cultural approaches to solving the problem of youth violence offer great promise. This bill offers great promise. This bill offers gun control. This is the coward's way out. This is the ostrich vote. Put your head in the sand. Blame the gun. Don't deal with this issue. We wouldn't want to have to do anything as controversial as perhaps posting the Ten Commandments in a school. 
   I was disappointed during the Senate's consideration of this bill. I was disappointed, frankly, in some of my conservative colleagues in the Senate, some of my pro-gun conservative colleagues in the Senate. I am disappointed. We had a chance to stop this. I spent a great deal of time over 
   the past 2 weeks as we debated S. 254, arguing privately with these colleagues, trying to persuade them to hold the line against this onslaught of more gun control. 
   Gun shows, do you know what the goal is here? It is not instant background checks. It is the elimination of gun shows--eliminate the shows, don't allow any gun shows. After all, punish the law-abiding American who comes to a gun show, as millions do all across America every year. Punish them. That is the easy thing to do. Do not deal with this. Do not deal with the criminal. Punish the people who go to gun shows, the law-abiding American citizens. 
   You say, what if somebody, a bad person, gets a gun? Bad people are not going to come and get a gun there; they can get it easier somewhere else. Even if they do, if they commit a crime with it, we put them in jail and put them away as we do anybody else who commits a crime. 
   I am very disappointed about what the Senate did with respect to these gun shows. It seems evident to me, the practical effect of the Lautenberg amendment, adopted when Vice President GORE sat in the chair and proudly cast the tie-breaking vote: This will ruin the gun shows, put them out of business. That is the aim of the amendment, and that is the aim of this legislation that we just substituted in order  to send it to conference. Everybody says we will get it out in conference. We will see about that. Don't hold your breath. 
   I am very concerned about the effects of this so-called trigger lock amendment. Even though the amendment appears only to require trigger locks to be sold with guns, the legal effect may well do great damage to the second amendment rights of law-abiding gun owners because courts may construe the amendment as creating a new civil negligence standard under which gun owners will be seen as having a legal obligation to use their trigger locks or face legal liability if their gun is misused by some third party. What are we going to create now, a trigger lock inspector? ``Knock, knock, knock. Hello, I'm the Government trigger lock inspector. I want to see if you have your trigger lock on your weapon.'' 
   Some people say, no, it doesn't require they put it on their weapon; it just requires they buy it. Where is individual and personal accountability and responsibility? If you are dumb enough to leave a weapon without a trigger lock lying around where a kid can reach it, then you ought not own the gun. But that is personal responsibility and accountability. It is not the Government's responsibility. It is certainly not even workable. But maybe it will come to that. We have Government bureaucrats who do just about everything in America. We might as well have 400,000 or 500,000 trigger lock inspectors, and they can knock on the door, ``Mr. SMITH, do you have a gun?'' ``Yes, but I'm not going to give it to you.'' ``Well, I wanted to see whether you have a trigger lock on your gun.'' It may come to that. Don't laugh. 
   If the law develops such that gun owners have a legal obligation to use these trigger locks, they may be forced to put their safety and that of their families at risk. It is not unreasonable to imagine a single mother of a small child, depending on her gun for safety, panic stricken, struggling unsuccessfully with her trigger lock, at night, after hearing a burglar in the house. If she has no trigger lock, and she has that thing up on a 10-foot shelf, that is her choice. The 
   Government tells her she has to use a trigger lock--or buy a trigger lock she doesn't even need. 
   What in the world is happening to this country, to the second amendment, to the Constitution? It is amazing how we pick some amendments, such as the first amendment, and say we must protect that amendment at all costs, but when it comes to the second amendment, no, we can skip that one. 
   These are two examples of the grave harm gun control amendments adopted by the Senate would do to second amendment rights. When the heat of the moment is gone and the passions so shamelessly stirred up by the gun control lobby have subsided, many of those who have supported these amendments will realize they have done the second amendment serious and lasting harm. But I don't want to see any tears; I don't want to hear any whining; I don't want to hear any, ``I'm sorry''; I don't want to hear any, ``My gosh, why did I do that? What happened? Where was I when they took the second amendment rights away? Where was I when they took the Constitution?'' I don't want to hear it. It is too late. 
   Great experts have repeatedly shown that criminals do not go to gun stores, complete the necessary forms, and leave with legally purchased weapons. ``Hello, I'm a criminal. I am going to use my gun tonight in an armed robbery. I would like to purchase it, please. Where do I fill out the forms?'' Criminals are going to buy their guns on the black market or they are going to steal them. I have had people tell me flat out: I might as well buy the guns on the black market. It is a lot safer to me. The Government doesn't know I have it. 
   That is pretty scary. Gun control has not been shown to reduce crime. Washington, DC, where we are now, has the most crime in all America. The only people who own guns in Washington are the criminals. They have them. You cannot have one. You are an honest citizen. But they have them. Crime has really gone down dramatically in Washington, hasn't it? Gun control has really worked here. Gun control attacks a serious problem from the wrong angle. Sixty million Americans own 200 million firearms. That is a very interesting statistic. Sixty million Americans own 200 million firearms, including 60 million handguns. 
   Yet four-tenths of 1 percent of those handguns will be used to commit a crime. So 99.6 percent of all handguns are used legally; 99.6 percent, the good folks; four-tenths of 1 percent, the bad guys. We substituted S. 254 for H.R. 1501, right here on the floor of the Senate. 
   Some argue the crime problem is the result of too much personal freedom. It is not personal freedom that is the problem. It is moral decadence. This bill tries to at least help us deal with it. It is moral decadence. It is a cultural, moral problem and it is getting worse by the day. 
   We look, in this body, for any excuse--guns, whatever--to look the other way. Maybe we will have a bill tomorrow to ban knives and then baseball bats, maybe cars. They kill about 45 million people a year. Maybe we ought to ban them. 
   It is a revolving door criminal system. That is what the problem is, moral decadence and a revolving door criminal justice system that puts the average murderer on the street in 7 years. That is right. The average murderer walks out of prison, if he goes to prison--some like Mr. Simpson never go to prison when they should. Yes, that is right, some like Mr. Simpson never go to prison when they should. But the average murderer in this country, if he goes to jail, serves 7 years for murder. But it is the gun's fault, isn't it? We cannot blame the judges, cannot blame the prosecutors, cannot blame the court system. We have to blame guns; blame the peaceful citizen who has the right to own a gun to protect himself. 
   I am proud I voted the way I did against cloture. I am proud I voted for H.R. 1501 and against S. 254. I am proud to stand up for the second amendment in the Chamber of the Senate, and I will stand up here again and again, year after year, month after month, whatever it takes to make this case because I know I am right, and I am going to continue to do it. 
   When this bill comes out of conference, I am going to filibuster it again for as long as I can. I am going to do everything I can to kill it, whatever I can do. I am only one person. 
   In the movie ``Mr. Smith Goes to Washington,'' another Mr. Smith, Jimmy Stewart, dropped on the floor of the Senate after several hours, 23 I think. I think he even beat STROM THURMOND, if I am not mistaken, in the filibuster. He dropped on the floor of the Senate amongst a pile of newspapers. Maybe that is what I have to do. Maybe I will do that. I don't know. 
   I know one thing, S. 254 is wrong and H.R. 1501 is right. I am going to fight to preserve, protect, and defend the constitutional right, all of the Constitution and all of the constitutional rights of Americans, including the right to keep and bear arms. Many of us who are veterans in the fight to protect the second amendment know the bold and clear words of the second amendment by heart. We cannot say them often enough if we are to educate our fellow citizens about the unmistakable meaning and intent behind those words of that most besieged provision of the Bill of Rights. 
   It is pretty clear:  
   A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.  
   Tell me where there is anything in that amendment that allows us to do this under the Constitution of the United States of America? I stood right there where the pages are sitting and took the oath twice when I came to the Senate to protect and 
   defend the Constitution of the United States, and that is what I am doing now, and that is what I will continue to do. 
   There is nothing in those words about background checks. There is nothing in there about the people having a right to keep and bear certain kinds of arms. There is nothing in there that says handguns can be kept or not kept where shotguns can. Nothing. I sure do not see anything in there that gives Congress any leeway whatsoever to infringe second amendment rights whenever some group of anti-gun zealots think what they like to call the ``public interest'' requires it. The public interest is to preserve and protect the Constitution of the United  States of America. That is what the public interest is and nothing else. You trample on the Constitution; you trample on the public interest. 
   Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?

   Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. I thank the Chair. Mr. President, these solemn words that all of us revere in the second amendment could not be more clear. There is no discussion about what those words mean. I am fascinated as the days go by, the more I am in politics, the more I read about constitutional scholars making unconstitutional arguments. Frankly, I am sick of it. The more recognition these constitutional scholars get, the more unconstitutional their arguments get. 
   How can anybody read the second amendment to the Constitution of the United States and come up with gun control? It is just simply not possible to do in any rational way. Yet many of the self-appointed leading lights of constitutional law continue to try to throw the second amendment into oblivion, to throw it on the trash heap. Boy, they are doing a good job. 
   There are 40,000 gun laws already. We can pass a few more and stop law-abiding Americans from going to gun shows. Let's just keep sitting back, America, keep sitting back on your hands--I might use another word if I were not on the Senate floor--and let it happen. Don't do anything. Don't stand up. 
   You need to start voting, my fellow Americans. You need to start looking at who is doing this to you and to the Constitution of the United States of America, and you need to start throwing those people out of here. That is what you need to do. I do not care with what party they are. It is irrelevant. 
   These are the same legal scholars who find a constitutional right to abortion, to solicitation, to contributions, to expression, to travel, to privacy, and to a wall of separation between church and state, none of which are mentioned anywhere in the text of that hallowed document. Nowhere. But, oh, they find it. Abortion, where is that in the Constitution? 
   I do not know if the scholars have read what our founders have said, but somehow I think it is reasonable to accept the premise that those who wrote the Constitution might have known what they were talking about; maybe they knew what they intended; maybe they knew what they intended since they wrote the document. 
   It is interesting to read some of their words on the second amendment. I am not sure the scholars have read them. If they have, they are not listening. I have read them. Let me quote a few. 
   The father of the Constitution, James Madison, made absolutely clear what the second amendment means. Mr. Madison declared that the Constitution preserves ``the advantage of being armed[,] which Americans possess over the people of almost every other Nation.......'' 
   Thomas Jefferson, who wrote the Declaration of Independence, put it this way. Because of the second amendment, Jefferson proclaimed: ``No free man shall ever be debarred the use of arms.'' 
   Another Founding Father, George Mason of Virginia, upon whose Virginia Bill of Rights the Federal Bill of Rights was based, explained that the second amendment means that the militia shall ``consist now of the whole people, except a few public officials.'' 
   The whole people will now have the right in the case of tyranny to go to their homes and pick up their arms and protect themselves. That is the purpose of the second amendment. It is not about sport shooting. It is not about hunting. It is about protection, the right of a person to protect himself or herself from tyranny, from enemies. 
   Sadly, the modern day enemies of the second amendment choose to ignore what the founders said. I do not think they chose to ignore it. 
   I think they deliberately ignored it. They knew exactly what they were doing. 
   They are trampling on the Constitution--it is a design--and the American people are going to sit back until it is too late--not if I have anything to do about it; not as long as I have a voice; and as long as I can stand on the Senate floor I am going to stop it. 
   Today they are unrelenting in their attacks on the second amendment, and they have a big advantage. They have a huge advantage because they have the major news media solidly on their side. 
   I am not much on polls, but it would be interesting to take a little poll to find out how many of the news media pack a little sidearm somewhere to protect themselves in their homes. Do you want to take any bets? 
   More than 6 years ago, I was driving to work, coming in here to Washington. I did not have a gun on my person because I am traveling in Washington, DC, where by law I am not allowed to have one. I did not think it would look good for a Senator to break the law. I do not like that law. I witnessed two people murdered in front of my eyes before the CIA. 
   When I got back to Washington, the press found out I had witnessed the murder, and the first question was not: Is your son OK? I just dropped him off at school 2 minutes before down the road. Not: How is your son? Is he OK? Is he handling it all right? Not: How are you? Are you OK? No. That was not the first question. That was not the second, either. 
   The first question was: Have you now changed your position on gun control? I witnessed a murder 20 minutes, 30 minutes before. That was the first question: Well, Senator, you're a conservative Republican, pro-gun. Have you now changed your position on the second amendment? I said: No, I have not. I wish I had had a gun. I might have saved two people from being killed by an individual standing in the middle of a highway with an AK-47 weapon, shooting innocent people in their cars. 
   Time and time again, the media has asked me the same question about that very incident. The obsessive focus of those questions on gun control demonstrates how much the media is in the back pockets of the anti-gun zealots. And they are. They are working together. Frankly, they are winning, if you want my honest opinion. They won here today. They won again. Time and time again--again and again and again--we trample on the Constitution of the United States of America. 
   You know what I said to the media? We ought to stop worrying about the terrorist's gun and start worrying about tracking him down, trying him, convicting him, and getting rid of him so he can never do it again. Finally, after several years, he was tracked down. He was convicted. He is now on death row. 
   The man who committed those murders outside the CIA was an alien terrorist who fled overseas. In thinking about the right to keep and bar arms in international terms, I find a certain irony. We live in a time in which nearly all of the totalitarian communist regimes, which kept all of the guns in the hands of the government and out of the hands of the people they tyrannized, have collapsed--almost all but not all. Yet their utterly discredited philosophy of gun control still finds a great number of sympathizers and supporters in the world's oldest democracy. 
   Two of my close friends escaped Castro's Cuba in the late 
   1950s, early 1960s. The first thing Castro did when he took over was go door to door, house to house, literally, confiscating every weapon he could get. Because once he did that, his people were defenseless, and he knew it. 
   It is interesting: Tyrannical governments taking our guns; Members of the Senate and the media taking our guns. A bitter irony, isn't it? 
   Seen in the light of the second amendment's wording, and the meaning of that provision of the Constitution, as illuminated by the comments of our Nation's founders, it is clear to me that the gun control amendments to S. 254 that were adopted by the Senate are a serious attack on the second amendment rights of all Americans. 
   The cloture vote we just took bringing debate on this bill to a close--which is what cloture is--shows where the votes are in the Senate. The Senate has sided with gun control, and they went against the cultural approach. 
   You are not going to cut down a big tree by snipping the leaves off of it. We are not going to solve this problem with gun control. We are going to solve this problem when we understand here in America that we have some severe cultural and moral problems. 
   We need to put values back in schools. We need to put God back in  schools. We need to allow kids to have the right to pray and the right to talk about these things with their teachers so their teachers do not have to worry about being fired for giving comfort. 
   A teacher in, I believe, New York was fired. When her children were agonizing over the fact that one of their classmates had died, and she offered to have them say a little prayer to comfort them, she was fired. The same people who advocated her firing support gun control. 
   I sought an opportunity to offer an amendment. I wanted to have a vote on H.R. 1501. I was not allowed to get it. All I wanted was a vote. I wanted the House bill. I wanted the Senate to be on record as to whether or not they supported this alternative, H.R. 1501, or this alternative, S. 254. 
   I stand right here at the desk of Daniel Webster. Webster was in many debates at this desk in the Old Senate Chamber. He was born in New Hampshire and represented New Hampshire in the Congress; and in a moment, I guess, when he wasn't thinking properly he moved to Massachusetts, and he represented Massachusetts in the Senate. But this desk now for evermore belongs to the senior Senator from New Hampshire. 
   I can imagine what Webster would think and say in the great eloquence that he was able to deliver so many times on the floor of the Senate at this desk. I think about it often. But I can imagine what he might have thought had he been here in this debate this morning, after a vote, with a bunch of rules that nobody put in the Constitution, with us getting a chance to say why it was a bad vote. I wonder what Webster would have said. Those are the rules. 
   I wonder also what he would have said if he knew we took away part of the second amendment rights of law-abiding American citizens--probably the same thing he would have said if we tried to take the first amendment rights away or any other rights away under the Constitution. He would be appalled. 
   I am devastated by this vote personally because I have traveled all over America these past 2 years, and I know what is in the hearts of most of the American people out there because I have talked to them one-on-one, literally one-on-one, from California to Maine, to Florida, to Alabama. You name it, I have probably been in the State. And they are disgusted with what we do here. 
   I am a Member of this body. I am not criticizing colleagues, but they get so sick and tired of it, watching the Constitution get trampled on, watching their taxes go up, watching their rights being taken away, watching 35 million of their fellow citizens aborted and murdered. 
   When we talk about culture, what do we tell the shooters in Columbine and the kids who do these terrible things? We say, go to school today, be good kids, and while you are gone, we will abort your brothers and your sisters--35 million of them since 1973. We just can't continue to do this. It will be business as usual. We will kill another 30 million over the next 25 years. It won't stop. 
   It is not going to stop, and this isn't going to stop, until the American people understand fully what is happening. When they do, hopefully, they are going to change the Government and get us back to the Constitution of the United States. That is what we swore to uphold, that is what we took the oath to defend, and that is what we ought to do: Defend it and support it. Anything less than that, I don't care if it is the 2nd amendment, the 4th amendment, the 16th amendment, the 22nd amendment, or the body of the Constitution itself, we should defend it all, because that is what we are here for. 
   It is with great sadness and regret that I have to say to the American people, you lost today. The second amendment today took another hit, and it will continue to take more until we finally realize that enough is enough and we are going to change the people who do this to us time and time again. I hope it happens before it is too late because once we lose the Constitution and respect for it, we lose America. 
   I had a citizen tell me--I will not mention the name, for obvious reasons--just recently, about a week ago, that he talked to a high-ranking Member in the House of Representatives. I will leave it at that. That high-ranking Member said, in a discussion with that individual: ``The Constitution is nothing but a piece of paper.'' 
   If that is true, there is not much hope. The last hope for America is the American people. It is not the Senate; it is not the House; it is not the White House; it is the American people. 
   Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time.

    Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to honor Nackey Scripps Loeb, a remarkable person who has retired as president and publisher of the Union Leader and New Hampshire Sunday News newspapers. 
   I have been blessed with Mrs. Loeb's friendship since I began my career in politics more than 15 years ago. She, and her late husband Bill, were an inspiration to me in the late 1970's and early 1980's, as well as helped fight in the conservative revolution. After Bill's death, Nackey took over the Union Leader Corporation in 1981. She had some big shoes to fill--Bill was an outspoken and controversial leader in both the newspaper industry and the world of politics. But Mrs. Loeb took over with dedication, drive, determination and distinction. She proved that the knack for hard-hitting journalism does run in the family! Her editorials have been the cause of many political aspirants' success or failure in their bid for public office. 
   Mr. President, I owe Mrs. Loeb a great deal of thanks for her guidance and continuous support during the years that I have held public office. She supported my philosophy in times when many turned their backs. I respect and commend her commitment to doing what is right, even during the days when being a conservative was not ``in.'' Her husband once told me, ``stand for something or you stand for nothing.'' Nackey Loeb has always fought for the principles on which the Union Leader, and the State of New Hampshire, were founded. 
   Nackey Loeb has guided the Union Leader into the twenty first century in several ways. She oversaw the move of production into a larger building and the purchasing of more advanced press equipment. She has also driven the Union Leader's involvement on the Internet. ``The Paper,'' as it is known, is nationally recognized and respected largely because of the efforts of Nackey Loeb. 
   Mrs. Loeb has been a powerful force in New Hampshire during her 18 years as president and publisher of the Union Leader. Her vision, forthrightness and principled views are admired by all who know her and will be sorely missed. 
   I would like to extend my best wishes to Nackey as she enjoys a peaceful time with her family. People like Mrs. Loeb help to maintain the quality of life we enjoy in New Hampshire and make it a special and unique place to live. It is an honor to represent Nackey Loeb in the United States Senate.

Mr. President, pursuant to the Trade Act of 1974, and the rules of the Senate, I make a privileged motion that the Senate Committee on Finance be discharged from further consideration of Senate Joint Resolution 28, a resolution disapproving the President's June 3, 1999, waiver of freedom of emigration requirements for Vietnam as a condition for expanded U.S. trade benefits. 
   Before going into that, Mr. President, on behalf of the leader, I ask unanimous consent that the time accorded to the majority leader on the two motions--the one on China and the one on Vietnam--be allocated to the Senator from New Hampshire, Mr. SMITH.

   Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I thank Senator HELMS for his support of both the motion to discharge on the Vietnam issue, as well as the China issue. 
   Mr. President, I yield myself 15 minutes. In response to my colleague from Delaware regarding what has happened in the past on the differences between the House and the Senate on such resolutions, I state for the record that the Trade Act of 1974, which is the item in question, on procedures in the Senate regarding discharges, says:  
   If the Senate passes a resolution before receiving from the House of Representatives a joint resolution that contains the identical matter, the joint resolution shall be held at the desk pending receipt of the joint resolution from the House.  
   So there is absolutely no problem whatsoever in having the Senate deal with this. In the past, the Senate has deferred action on the Jackson-Vanik waivers, according to Senator ROTH, and the House has acted first. But we don't have to wait for the House to pass anything to act on it. It is clearly within the act of 1974. And so, with all due respect, I am not trying to assume any powers that aren't in the act itself. 
   I also want to respond to the point that Chairman ROTH made in which he said: Until the House acts, there is no need to defer action on the critical matters currently before the Senate. Indeed, House action may moot the need to take up these resolutions at all. 
   Let me also point out that should the discharge motion prevail, there is no attempt by me to bring this up immediately and get into the Senate's time. If the majority leader and minority leader determine they want to take this up at another time other than today or tomorrow or even this week, that is perfectly all right with me. I am not in any way trying to interrupt the Senate schedule. There is simply an hour equally divided on these motions. So it will take 2 hours of the Senate's time and that is it, as far as I am concerned today. Unless the leaders decide they want to take it up now, that would be OK. 
   Also, regarding critical matters before the Senate, China has been in the news a lot lately, to say the least, and if the situation in China in terms of the human rights violations, the spy scandal, and all the other things that have gone on--if that is not a critical matter to bring before the Senate, I guess I am not sure what critical is. I believe it is critical, and I think it should be discussed. 
   In spite of that, should the leaders determine this should not be discussed today, tomorrow, or next week, I am amenable to whatever schedule the majority leader would like to work out to bring this matter to the floor for the 20 hours of debate, which would follow if the discharge resolution prevails. 
   For the information of my colleagues, the discharge motion I have made as a sponsor of S.J. Res. 28 is a privileged matter and in accordance with the Trade Act of 1974. I am very pleased to have the distinguished chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, Senator HELMS, as a cosponsor of this resolution. 
   The discharge motion now before the Senate is in order under the 1974 Trade Act simply because more than 30 days have expired since I introduced it on June 7, 1999. And to date, the resolution has not been reported by the Finance Committee. I am sure it is not being reported because, respectfully, the chairman disagrees with me on this. He has every right to not report it, and I respect that. But I also have the right to discharge it. 
   What is S.J. Res. 128 in layman's terms, and why do I want my colleagues on both sides to allow this bill to be discharged and placed on the Senate calendar? It is a fair question and I want to answer directly. 
   Under section 402 of the Trade Act of 1974, Communist countries--in this case the Socialist Republic of Vietnam--are not eligible to participate, either directly or indirectly, in U.S. Government programs that extend credit or investment guarantees if the country denies its citizens the right or opportunity to emigrate, if it denies its citizens the right to emigrate, if it imposes more than a nominal tax on emigration and visa papers, and more than a nominal tax, levies a fine, fee, or other charge on any citizen as a consequence of that citizen's desire to emigrate or leave their country. In other words, if a citizen is taxed to leave, or denied the right to leave, then this is what the Trade Act is all about. 
   Simply put--and this would not surprise many colleagues, I hope--Vietnam severely restricts the rights of its citizens to have the opportunity to emigrate. It has done so since the fall of Saigon, and it continues to do so. Corruption and bribery by Vietnamese officials is rampant with respect to those desperately trying to get out through the application process. Many of these people bring their life savings, some of them borrowing money to get out, and then after the money is confiscated they are still denied. 
   That is why Vietnam has historically not been eligible to take advantage of American taxpayer-funded programs which subsidize business deals between American companies and the Communist Government agencies in Hanoi; that is, until last year. It is very important. 
   When President Clinton decided to use the section of this same Trade Act of 1974 which allows him to grant a waiver of Jackson-Vanik, the freedom of immigration requirement, if he determines that such a waiver will ``substantially promote the objections of this section,'' which, as I said, is to ensure that countries do not impose more than a nominal tax fee or fee to immigrate and they don't hinder the human rights--if the President determines that there are no human rights violations, or no fees beyond nominal fees to get out processing, then we grant this waiver. 
   But the question is: Is that true? I don't think it is. 
   I would like to have the opportunity--which is all I am asking for in this discharge motion--to prove that on the floor of the Senate. I know there are 20 hours equally divided. I don't need 10 hours, but I would like to have a little time to prove it. I hope my colleagues will respect me on that. 
   The President cannot use the waiver unless he has received assurances that the immigration practices of that country will henceforth lead substantially to the achievement of the objectives I just outlined before, such as stopping bribery and corruption by Communist officials. But the President's use of this waiver authority with regard to Vietnam has been in effect now for a little over a year. 
   My colleagues should understand that we now have the opportunity to go back and look over the past several months and make an informed judgment about whether the President's waiver of the freedom of immigration requirement during this period has actually resulted in ``substantial promotion'' in Vietnam's human rights records on immigration matters. 
   If you believe it has, then you should not be afraid to come to the floor and debate me on it whenever the leader  decides to bring it here. You will have the opportunity to vote against a disapproval resolution I have introduced with Senator HELMS to nullify the President's waiver. But why would you? Why would you be afraid to stand up and defend it? If you think that everything is fine and that all of these policies have not been violated, then come to the Senate floor and debate me, and we will see who wins on that point. 
   If you think President Clinton should not abuse this waiver based on Vietnam's performance, if you think President Clinton should have instead insisted that Vietnam actually comply with the freedom of immigration standards, then you would vote for this discharge. You would vote for S.J. Res. 28, and ultimately you would vote against granting the waiver. 
   However--this is important--in order to have the debate on the resolution, in order to carry out our constitutional duty under article I, section 8, to regulate trade matters with foreign nations, we need to discharge the bill and bring it to the floor. 
   I want to point out, because sometimes we forget we took an oath to the Constitution of the United States, it says in article I, section 8, that ``Congress shall have Power to.......regulate Commerce with Foreign Nations...... '' It is pretty clear. 
   If there is some difference of opinion as to a particular law regarding commerce with foreign nations, then we ought to 
   have the opportunity to debate it on the floor. That is all I am asking in this resolution. It is that simple. As I said in my ``Dear Colleague,'' whether you support or whether you oppose the actual underlying resolution, you should at least be willing to support having a debate on the measure. 
   That is all I am asking: Could we have a debate on it, instead of leaving the bill bottled up in the Finance Committee where it automatically becomes effective. Come down, make your arguments, and allow me to make mine. That is what the American people expect us to do. Then we will have a vote after a few hours of debate. 
   I have studied it. People say there are so many other important things. I am not too sure about that. In the case of Vietnam, we still have MIA matters unresolved. We have foreign businesses that are going to make huge profits if we allow all of these things to go on. We have Vietnamese citizens in this country who escaped and who have had a lot of their earnings confiscated. They sent them over there to try to get their families out. What happened? The Vietnamese Government confiscated the money, and then they did not let the family members out. 
   I have been going over this a lot over the past several months. I have heard from countless Vietnamese Americans all across this country in all 50 of our States. They have family members and friends in Vietnam, many of whom fought alongside the United States during the Vietnam war. I want to tell you their stories. I want to share the stories of these people who have tried so hard to get their loved ones out after they themselves have been able to escape. But I can't do it in half an hour. I can't do it in 30 minutes. I need the time to do it so we can make an intelligent decision on this waiver that the President has granted. 
   Every Member of the Senate needs to hear these accounts of persecution and corruption that many Vietnamese continue to experience at the hands of Communist Government officials throughout that nation. Some of them have been forced to pay bribes into the thousands of dollars, and even after they paid the bribes, they have been denied the right to emigrate. I want to tell you those stories. 
   I have also heard from our staff who are assisting refugees in Southeast Asia who are trying to help these Vietnamese. I want to share with you all of what they have been telling me. But I am not going to be able to get into any serious level of detail on these matters if 51 of my colleagues prevent me from debating this on the Senate floor. 
   Mr. President, how much time have I used?

   Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. I thank the Chair. 
   Let me say up front that I am a Vietnam veteran who feels very strongly about this issue. Some of my colleagues neglect to mention that when they are talking about Vietnam veterans. But I am one in the Senate. However, there are others, such as the junior Senator from Massachusetts, who is here today, and the senior Senator from Arizona, who disagree with me. That is fine. I asked them, and the four other Vietnam vets in the Senate--indeed, every Member in the Senate--not to duck the debate, to come down and debate me, to have a good debate, and then let the Senate decide based on what they hear. But let's not bottle this up in the 
   Senate Finance Committee. Vote to let this debate take place. Come down and participate. I look forward to debating you. It is going to take a little bit of the Senate's time. It is worth it. It is the taxpayers' money that is being used. People's lives are being affected. Good American citizens, who have family members in Vietnam, have a right to have this heard on the Senate floor. 
   I am not asking people to vote with me on the underlying resolution. I am just asking people to give me a chance to debate it and make a decision. It might take an afternoon. It might take an evening. I am certainly not going to use 10 hours, but I am prepared to do this in detail at whatever time the majority leader says so. I think we owe the American people that. I think it is wrong to prevent this debate. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I say to my colleague from Nebraska, with respect, if there is information and evidence which indicates that Vietnam or China--but, in this case, Vietnam--was not following the spirit and intent of Jackson-Vanik, why does my colleague oppose the opportunity to have me present that information to the Senate? We may respectfully disagree after looking at all the information, but it seems to me a reasonable request on my part to discharge this. To not discharge it, I say to my colleagues, bottles it up, does not give us the opportunity to debate it, does not give me the opportunity to present to my colleagues information I have that will show dramatically that that is not the case. 
   I only have, at the most, 15 minutes, so let me do it as quickly as I can with the facts at my disposal. I regret very much I am not going to get the opportunity, unless my colleagues support me on this.

   Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. In the same report:  
   Citizens' access to exit permits frequently was constrained by factors outside the law such as bribery and corruption. Refugee and immigrant visa applicants to the Orderly Departure Program sometimes encountered local officials who arbitrarily delayed or denied exit permits.....There are some concerns that some members of the minority ethnic groups, particularly nonethnic Vietnamese, such as the Montagnards, may not have ready access to these programs. The Government denied exit permits for emigration to certain Montagnard applicants.  
   And on and on:  
   Vietnam's Politburo has issued its first-ever directive on religion, in an apparent bid to tighten Communist Party control over the clergy and over the places of worship. Although no religions are mentioned by name, the directive, published in the official Nhan Dan daily, targets the unofficial Buddhist Church and the Catholic Church.  
   Unofficial. Interesting.  
   Banned practices include organizing meetings, printing and circulating bibles, constructing and renovating places of worship.....The Communist Party strictly controls all religious matters in Vietnam and many members of the Buddhist Church and the Catholic Church are presently in detention or under house arrest.  
   French Press Agency of Hanoi, July 8, 1998. 
   I say to my colleagues, we need to expose this. Why would you deny me the opportunity to bring this matter to the floor? I urge you, please give me the opportunity to get into these matters in the time allocated under the rules. Yes, it is 20 hours equally divided, 10 hours each. Will I use 10 hours? Absolutely not; a couple hours probably would do it. 
   If my colleagues are not familiar with these issues, it will open their eyes. I have very specific details about what is happening to these people. If Senators oppose me and they do not believe it, then come down here and present the alternative information for my colleagues and let our colleagues make the choice. But give me the opportunity by supporting me on this discharge. Do not let it stay bottled up. 
   That is the rule, and I respect the rule. The rule is, it stays there. If the Finance Committee does not discharge it, it goes away. I know that. That is why I am trying to discharge it. It goes away in the sense that the Jackson-Vanik waiver is granted because the burden is on us to prove otherwise. I want that opportunity, but I cannot get it if you leave it buried in the Finance Committee and do not discharge it. That is not a full debate. 
   Help me look at the issue. The bill needs to be put on the Senate calendar so we can have debate. I repeat, if my colleagues missed it, I am not trying to take the Senate's time. If there is something else the leaders want out here, that is fine. I will work out something with the leaders where we can do 20 hours equally divided at any time the leader thinks it is appropriate. 
   Also, when we delegate waiver powers to the President--let me go back to the Constitution of the United States, article I, section 8--we lose our constitutional prerogative. We have the right to debate this. Do not give up our constitutional prerogative to debate it. Do not be afraid to come out on the floor and challenge me on what I have to offer. I welcome it. I look forward to it. 
   I hope no one will come down here and say: Let's have the House kill this first so we do not have to be accountable to the voters. That is basically the pitch being made by my friend, the chairman of the Finance Committee: Let's have the House kill the bill first, and then there will not be any need for us to debate it at all. 
   Vote for the discharge motion. Let's get on with the debate, under the time agreement we will be bound by, and then the Senate can make an informed  judgment and go on record in favor or in opposition as to whether President Clinton's waiver of freedom of emigration requirements, in the context of our trading with Vietnam, is appropriate or not. That is all I am asking. 
   I pray this body will not put the concerns about business profits or most favored nation over principle. Support the discharge motion. Give me the opportunity to make these cases.

   Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I say to my colleague from Montana, I know he understands, but he doesn't understand enough to let me have the opportunity to debate it. Under the rule of Jackson-Vanik, I have the right to have the 20 hours equally divided on the Senate floor. That is the time to do it so that it is not misdirected in morning business somewhere. 
   In response to Senator MCCAIN, yes, there are six out of seven Vietnam veterans in the Senate who support not debating this, who say the Jackson-Vanik waiver should be granted, but there are 3 million or so in the American Legion, at least represented by a letter from the American Legion, who think otherwise. I am not sure what the point is on that one. 
   We have to feel very confident the waiver has reduced bribery and corruption. Here is the law. It says to assure continued dedication to fundamental human rights, if these things happen, you should not grant the waiver. No. 1, does Vietnam deny its citizens the right to emigrate? Yes. I can prove it, but nobody wants to hear it. No. 2, does it impose more than a nominal tax on emigration and the other visas? Yes, and I have a stack of names of people, Vietnamese nationals, who have said yes. 
   The bottom line is, if the Senate won't give me the chance to debate it, then as far as I am concerned my colleagues do not want to hear the facts. I can't give them, as I said before, in 30 minutes. 
   I urge support of my resolution so that we have the opportunity to debate this on the Senate floor.

   It is my understanding that based on the parliamentary decisions made earlier, the 1 hour will be equally divided, a half hour under my control and a half hour under the control of the other side, not by majority/minority, but by the two sides, pro and con.

   Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, notice of my intention to do these discharge motions was made to both the majority and minority leaders, the chairman and ranking member of the Finance Committee, and several other Senators on July 7, so there would be ample time for the leaders to adjust the time so we could have a vote prior to the House voting on this matter. 
   Mr. President, I yield myself 15 minutes out of my allotted time. 
   Despite President Clinton's 1992 campaign promise to link MFN certification to China's human rights record, the administration has chosen annually to grant Beijing what had been known as most-favored-nation status and is now called normal trading relations. It is amazing to me that that certification could be granted, given the dismal record of China in so many ways that we have talked about on this floor for so many weeks, especially in the area of human rights. 
   By offering this motion, I am asking the Senate to discharge S.J. Res. 27 from the Finance Committee. This legislation would disapprove the President's recommendation of normal trade relations status for China. Because of the rules of the Senate, it is in the Finance Committee. If I don't discharge it out, then it doesn't come out, and we don't get the opportunity to debate this issue. 
   This is a very important issue. Let me say, again, as I said earlier this morning on the Vietnam issue, whether my colleagues agree or disagree with me is not the issue. The issue is whether or not they will let us debate this on the floor. That is the issue. If they vote against my discharge motion, then they have said they do not want the Senate to debate this issue at all. They don't want to hear about the human rights violations in China or Vietnam. I would find that regrettable if the Senate made that decision. 
   If they feel strongly that they are right and there are not any problems in China which would justify holding up the NTR, normal trading relations, then they ought to come down on the floor and defend that. 
   I have a few things I could share with Senators that I think will give them the opposite impression. I would want the opportunity to do that on behalf of so many Americans who are fed up with the fact that we keep giving MFN, or most-favored-nation trading status, to a country who has been so abysmal on human rights violations, not to mention stealing our nuclear secrets. 
   I have come to expect the President to ignore China's total 
   disregard for human rights, its proliferation of nuclear weapons, and its piracy of U.S. technology by continuing Beijing's trading relationship with our country, but what I don't understand is why. Why are we doing this? Why are we afraid to debate this? Are we afraid we are going to find out how much technology has been pirated? Are we going to find out how much proliferation of nuclear weapons has actually occurred, how many human rights violations have occurred in China? 
   The answer is, yes, of course, we are going to find out, because I am going to present this on the floor if I get the opportunity to do it. Regrettably, the opposition is going to try to deny me that opportunity and probably will win. They win; the American people lose. 
   I will point out a few facts--I only have 30 minutes; I don't get the 10 hours I would have under the law, if, in fact, my discharge petition motion is approved. Unfortunately, I have to assume I am not going to get it and make the point as fast as I can in 30 minutes. 
   Since 1949, Communist China has operated one of the most brutal and repressive regimes the world has ever known. Indeed, the Beijing government has committed large-scale genocide in Tibet. It has killed millions of its own citizens, outlawed religion, obliterated freedom of the press, and fought against the United States in Korea and Indochina. 
   In 1989, the Chinese Government authorized a crackdown on thousands of students who had the courage to stand up for human rights and democracy, and crack down they did. We all know the sad stories that came out of that period of time in China's history. The actions of the Beijing government have also served to undermine international stability and U.S. national security interests. China continues to violate the missile technology control regime, exporting to rogue states like Iran, North Korea, and other nations. They export our most sensitive technology, which in some cases they stole and in other cases they bought, believe it or not, from the United States. 
   Moreover, China has failed to assist the United States in fully accounting for American POWs held by the Chinese forces during the Korean war. Certainly, the theft of our nuclear secrets by Chinese agents has been on our minds in the past several months. The Cox report provides extensive evidence on the damage done to our national security by Chinese espionage. But I am also very concerned about China's notorious and seemingly blatant disregard for U.S. intellectual property laws. 
   Over the last decade, Chinese exports to the United States have increased seven times in comparison to American exports to China, creating a significant trade imbalance. During this time, some of the most rapidly growing and most competitive U.S. industries have been adversely affected by China's failure to enforce intellectual property rights. These include computer software, pharmaceuticals, agricultural and chemical products, and trademarks. 
   American businesses are losing billions because of this persistent problem. Yet the President marches forward saying normal trade relations is perfectly acceptable. I don't understand it. How can the administration justify their decision to reward the Communist Chinese Government NTR status when that government has such a deplorable record of protecting just one issue--U.S. intellectual property rights--not to mention many others which I will be getting into. 
   Peace and economic stability in Asia are in America's interest and require Chinese-American cooperation. Unfortunately, the President's decision to reextend NTR status to Communist China effectively rewards Beijing for rejecting reasonable American demands for protection from this intellectual property rights piracy, for cooperation on international nonproliferation efforts, and for a greater respect for basic human rights. 
   Now we are hearing the ominous signs of the saber rattling around Taiwan. These threats of military acts of violence threaten the stability of the entire region in the Pacific rim. How can you justify giving a nation that has done this, and is doing this, most-favored-nation trading status? 
   Perhaps the most egregious are the human rights violations which we appear to condone by granting this NTR status to China. It has a terrible human rights record. I have heard so many times from my colleagues, some of whom are going to be denying me by a vote the access to be able to debate this, how terrible the human rights violations are in China. Their policies on the political dissidents, religious freedom, and population control are abhorrent. The State Department report on China's human rights practices illustrates an appalling picture. It provides example after example of torture, forced confessions, suppression of basic human rights, denial of due process, and, worse of all, forced abortion and sterilization. Is this a government to which the United States of America should give most-favored-nation status? I don't think so. 
   All I am asking for is the opportunity to go into these matters in detail and debate this on the floor of the  Senate. This is not a vote on whether you agree or disagree. It is very interesting. I was thinking as I walked down to the floor from my office a few moments ago that the President of the United States took the U.S. military, put them in harm's way and bombed the sovereign nation of Yugoslavia to protect the human rights of the Albanian Kosovars. I can't even get the Senate to give me the opportunity to debate human rights violations in Vietnam and China. That is the bottom line. That is what we are talking about today. 
   The President--I will repeat this--went to war in Yugoslavia to protect the human rights of the Albanians in Kosovo, and I am going to be denied on this floor, by a vote, the opportunity to debate--just to debate--human rights violations in China and Vietnam. They don't want to hear it. That is the bottom line. If you can live with that in your conscience, fine. 
   It is a sad, sad situation. 
   All I am asking for is what is required under the law. Give me 10 hours and I will agree to reduce the 10 to 2. I will say to my colleagues, wherever you are out there, it is 10 hours by requirement; but I will agree to 2 hours on my side if you will support my motion. Give me the opportunity to show you on this floor what China and Vietnam are doing by voting for both of these motions. 
   Mr. President, at this time, I yield the floor to give some time to the other side. 
   Mr. BAUCUS addressed the Chair.

   Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I cannot let go unchallenged on the floor the accusation that I am circumventing the legislative process. I think my colleagues know that is not true. This is the act, the Trade Act of 1974. I have it in my hand. I would encourage my colleague to read it before making accusations that are simply false.  
   In the committee of either House to which a resolution has been referred, that has not been reported at the end of 30 days after its introduction, and counting any day which is excluded under section 154(b) it is in order to move either to discharge the committee from further consideration of the resolution or to discharge the committee from further consideration of any other resolution associated with this.  
   The bottom line is, this went to the committee on June 3. It has remained there to this day. More than 30 days have passed. The bottom line is, which is perfectly legitimate under the rule, the Finance Committee does not have to discharge it. If they do not discharge it, what happens is China gets its NTR status, and Jackson-Vanik is waived. 
   So I am exercising my right in doing what I am doing. And for colleagues to come down here and say I am circumventing the legislative process simply is not true. I would like to go back and see how some of my colleagues voted on some of these matters. 
   I have heard on the floor that it is inappropriate to debate this issue; it is inappropriate to talk about it. ``Take morning business and come down here,'' or ``speak at midnight when nobody is watching.'' 
   There is a process here. It is written in the law that the Senate has an hour on the motion to determine whether or not to discharge, and then if we pass these motions I am offering on China and Vietnam, we have the opportunity to debate this. 
   So I am hearing that it is inappropriate for the Senate to debate something provided under the law. Why in the world is it inappropriate to debate anything on the floor? If you want to know what is wrong with this place, this is a pretty good example. ``It is inappropriate to debate what's going on in China and Vietnam on the Senate floor.'' 
   Let me tell you what is inappropriate. With all due respect, what is inappropriate is the fact that the Communist Chinese are threatening Taiwan with missiles. What is inappropriate is what the Chinese Communist Government did to the people of Tibet. What is inappropriate is the fact that the Chinese Government put hundreds of thousands, maybe millions of dollars into U.S. elections. What is inappropriate is that they have tried to take over the Long Beach shipyard. What is inappropriate is that the Chinese have gobbled up the port leases on both sides of the Panama Canal. What is inappropriate is population control. What is inappropriate is forced sterilization. What is inappropriate is killing unborn children, female children. That is what is inappropriate. What is also inappropriate is trying to run over peaceful protesters with tanks in Tiananmen Square. 
   So do not tell me it is inappropriate to debate something on the floor. It is an outrage that this Senate will not approve this motion and allow the opportunity to do that. 
   Let me come to the floor and debate these issues. They do not want me to come to the floor, I say to the American people. That is why my resolutions are going to go down, because they do not want to hear about it, because the administration has made a decision to grant most-favored-nation status, normal trade relations--a decision to look the other way while China does 
   these appalling things. 
   I say, with all due respect--I said it earlier, and I will say it again--this President went to war and put American forces in harm's way to protect the human rights of the Albanians in Kosovo. And I can't get a resolution passed to debate human rights violations in China or Vietnam. What does that tell you? Is this America? Do you want to know what is wrong with politics? This is what is wrong with politics. 
   In China, they can do what they want. China is a sovereign nation. I guess, under the Clinton policy, we may be bombing them tomorrow. I do not know if it is human rights violations. Apparently, we cannot talk about them in the Senate. However, let me read you a little bit about what goes on in China from the 1998 State Department Human Rights Report. 
   Disciplinary measures against those who violate policies can include fines (sometimes a ``fee for an unplanned birth'' or a ``social compensation fee''), withholding of social services, demotion, and other administrative punishments.......intense pressure to meet family planning targets set by the Government has resulted in documented instances where family planning officials have used coercion, including forced abortion and sterilization, to meet government goals. During an unauthorized pregnancy, a woman often is paid multiple visits by family planning workers and pressured to terminate the pregnancy. 
   It goes on and on and on. 
   Are we going to give most-favored-nation status to this country? This is the issue. We are going to give it to them without giving me and other Senators in this body the opportunity to debate it on the floor? Welcome to America, for goodness sakes. 
   I thought the Senate was the greatest deliberative body in the world where all of the great debates took place. I am standing at Daniel Webster's desk. He would probably turn over in his grave if he heard that we would refuse to debate something as important as this. Daniel Webster stood on this floor, the strong advocate, year after year, against the outrage of slavery--and we cannot talk about China and Vietnam because my colleagues will not allow me to bring these resolutions out. 
   It is outrageous. I just do not understand it. It is exactly everything that is bad and wrong and outrageous about politics and about the process around here. I am sick of it. It is wrong. 
   Yes, bringing these motions is within the rules. Somebody put it in there. But for goodness sakes, what is fair is fair. It is not a question of me coming to the floor and saying: Well, nothing is happening in China; I'm just going to come down on the floor and create some problems here and tell you about things I made up, or I'm going to say nothing is going on in Vietnam. 
   I am not making this up. Right today, in the Washington Times:  
   Chinese companies transferred missile components to North Korea last month in a sign Beijing is stepping up arms sales in response to the NATO bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade. ``We are concerned about Chinese entities providing material for North Korea's missile program,'' a senior administration official told the Times. ``In our judgment, the Chinese government has no interest in seeing North Korea develop its missile technology.'' The Pentagon believes that some of the missile technology contains material of U.S.-origin, and that the transfers violate Chinese promises not to ignore international missile export controls barring such sales to rogue states, said U.S. intelligence officials.   
   Apparently we are not upset enough, are we? We are going to give them normal trade relations and look the other way. You steal our secrets; you abort your children; you forcibly abort female children; you saber rattle in Taiwan; you threaten to run over peaceful demonstrators with tanks. A priest was murdered a couple of months ago on the streets of Beijing. You give 
   contributions to one of the major political parties in America, and we are going to look the other way. 
   We are not even going to debate it. I say to the people out there in America: Watch the vote. You will see it. One right after another, they will come down here and SMITH will lose on Vietnam and SMITH will lose on China. And the American people will lose the opportunity to debate it. 
   I cannot do this in 30 minutes. I would like to go into some of these matters in detail, but I do not have the time. That is the rule. I have 30 minutes, an hour equally divided. That is it. 
   So I just say to my colleagues, give me the opportunity to debate these matters on the floor so I can point out to you the human rights abuses and the flagrant violations of both of these countries. Vietnam does not deserve the Jackson-Vanik waiver and China does not deserve to be given normal trade relations. 
   Mr. President, I see my time has expired. I yield back the last minute.

    Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to honor John McLaughlin, Chairman of McLaughlin Transportation Systems, Inc. for being named the 1999 Greater Nashua Chamber of Commerce Citizen of the Year. 
   The Citizen of the Year Award is an effort to recognize a local individual for their contributions to the betterment of life in the Greater Nashua Area. The award recipient has sustained a lifelong commitment to the best interests of Nashua and the state of New Hampshire. John has definitely exceeded these requirements. 
   A longtime resident of Nashua, New Hampshire, John started with his father's business as a teenager sweeping floors. After graduating from high school and serving in the armed forces, he went to work for the company upon his father's death in 1949. From the company's initial size of 3-4 trucks and a hand full of employees, McLaughlin Transportation has grown into a company that includes approximately 120 trucks, five facilities, and approximately 150 employees. The company's core focus is the moving and storing business, however, they have now expanded to include a limousine service and fuel-oil delivery business. 
   Although he has been extremely successful in business, John is equally recognized for his community stewardship. He has been involved with the Nashua Chamber for over 50 years, served for two decades as the Nashua fire commissioner and served four terms as the District 13 State Senator. In addition, he has held many leadership positions within the community, including the Nashua Parks and Recreation Commission, Rivier College Advisory Board, N.H. Council on Aging, and many more. 
   As a former small business owner, I admire John for his hard work, determination and dedication to the community. He is a role model for us all and I commend him for his efforts. It is an honor to represent him in the United States Senate.

   Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, as many of you know, it has been a very difficult period of time for me these past several days. I want to recognize the sacrifices of my wife and three children over the past several weeks as I agonized through this gut-wrenching political decision. My wife, Mary Jo, and my daughter, Jenny, and son, Bobby, and son, Jason, have had to endure the ups and the downs and the difficulties of making such a decision. I am deeply grateful to them for their support and comfort because, without  them, I could not really have gotten through it all. 
   My first political memories are of talking to my grandfather, who was a died-in-the-wool Republican. He always said he would vote for a gorilla on the Republican ticket if he had to. I remember conversations with him about the Dewey-Truman campaign. He was obviously for Dewey. It didn't work out very well. But I can also remember having conversations with my classmates, telling them that I, too, was for Dewey and explaining why I was for Dewey in that election. 
   At that time I was 7 years old. Years went by, and, in 1952, in the Eisenhower-Stevenson election, I was 11 years old. I bet a friend, who lived down the road and had a farm, a dollar versus a chicken that Eisenhower would win the election. I won, and my grandfather immediately drove me down to my neighbor's farm to pick up the chicken I had won. The young man's parents graciously acknowledged that I won the bet and provided me a nice barred rock hen that laid a lot of eggs over the next year or so. 
   In 1956, I volunteered to pass out literature for Eisenhower, and, as a college student, I worked for Nixon in 1964. But 1964 was the first election I voted in. Barry Goldwater's campaign was the one that really sparked my conservative passions. I worked as a volunteer in the Nixon campaigns in 1968 and 1972, but it wasn't like the Goldwater campaign. I remember walking into the booth, saying, this is a man I really believe in, and I said I really felt good about that vote. 
   In 1976, these conservative passions were again awakened while I worked for the conservative Ronald Reagan in the New Hampshire primaries against the incumbent President of the United States, Gerald Ford--not an easy thing to do for a lot of us who were basically grassroots idealists, if you will, who believed that Ronald Reagan should win that primary. In those days I was not a political operative; I was not a Senator; I was not a candidate; I was not an elected official. I was a teacher, a coach, a school board member, husband, father, small businessman--just an ordinary guy who cared about his country. I got involved because I cared, and I believed deeply in the Republican Party. 
   I came to this party on principle, pretty much initiating with Barry Goldwater but certainly finalized with Ronald Reagan. I was disappointed in Reagan's loss in 1976 because I believed that grassroots conservatives in the party, who had worked so hard for Reagan, lost to what I considered the party elitists, the establishment, who were there for Ford because he was President, not with the same passion that was out there for Reagan. 
   Watching that convention in 1976, I remember those enthusiastic grassroots party members who were unable to defeat that party machinery that was so firmly behind the incumbent 
   President. I remember seeing the tears in their eyes, and the passion. It was a difficult decision. It was close, as we all remember--just a few delegates. That was 1976. At that time, as a result of the election, it inspired me to run for political office for the first time. 
   When Reagan sought the nomination again in 1980 I ran in the primary, hoping to be part of this great Reagan revolution. Reagan was pro-life. He was for strengthening our military. He was anti-Communist. He was patriotic. He brought the best out in the American people. I was excited. In all those years that Reagan was President, the criticism, the hostile questions, the political cheap shots, he rose above it all. And most of them, indeed probably all who criticized him, weren't qualified to kiss the hem of his garment. He rose above them all. He was the best. 
   As a result of that, I began a grassroots campaign in 1979, and I lost by about a thousand votes with seven or eight candidates in the race, including one candidate, ironically, who was from my hometown. It was tough, but I decided to come back again in 1982, after losing, because I still wanted so much to be a part of the Reagan revolution. So I did come back in 1982. And that, my colleagues and friends, is when I had the first taste of the Republican establishment. 
   I had a phone call that I thought was a great sign. I had a call from the National Republican Party. Boy, was I excited. They told me that some representatives wanted to come up to New Hampshire from Washington to meet with me. They came to New Hampshire. We sat down at a meeting. It was brief. They asked me to get out of the race, please, because my opponent in the primary had more money than I did and had a better chance to win. I had been a Republican all my life, a Republican in philosophy, but that was my first experience with what we would call the national Republican establishment. I did not get out of the race. I beat my wealthy opponent in the primary, and I received the highest vote percentage against the incumbent Democrat that any Republican had ever received against him, and it was 1982, which was a pretty bad year for Republicans, as you all remember. 
   In 1984, several candidates joined the Republican primary again for an open seat in the Reagan landslide. Now everybody wanted it because the seat was open. I was just a school board chairman from a small town of 1,500, no political power base, no money, but I beat, in that primary, the president of the State senate, who was well known, and an Under Secretary of Commerce who was well financed. They still do not know how I did it, but it was door to door, and I fulfilled my dream of coming to Washington as part of the Reagan revolution in Congress. 
   I then had successful reelections in 1986 and 1988 and, of course, was elected to the Senate in 1990 and 1996. In the Reagan era, as in the Goldwater era, the pragmatists took a back seat to those who stood on principle. Idealists ruled; those who stood up for the right to life, a strong national defense, the second amendment, less spending, less taxes, less government. Man, it was exciting. Even though we were a minority in the Congress, it was exciting because Reagan was there. Principles in, pragmatism out. Man, it was great to be a Republican. 
   In 1988, a skeptical--including me--conservative movement rallied behind the Vice President in hopes that he would continue the revolution. 
   The signal that this revolution was over was when the President broke his ``no new tax'' pledge. We let pragmatism prevail. We compromised our pledge to the voters and our core principles, and we allowed the Democrats to take over the Government. 
   In 1994, idealism again came back. The idealistic wing of the party took charge. Led by Newt Gingrich, we crafted an issues-based campaign embodied in the Contract With America. We put idealism over pragmatism, and we were rewarded with a tremendous electoral victory in 1994, none like I have ever seen. I remember sitting there seeing those results come in on the House. I was happy for the Senate, but I was a lot happier for the House. Those of us who were there know how it felt. 
   As we moved into the 1996 elections, we again began to see this tug-of-war between the principal ideals of the party and the pragmatism of those who said we need ``Republican'' victories. Conservatives became a problem: We have to keep the conservatives quiet; let's not antagonize the conservatives, while the pragmatists talked about how we must win more Republican seats. Conservatives should be grateful, we were told, because we were playing smart politics, we were broadening the case. Elect more Republicans to Congress, elect more Republicans to the Senate and win the White House. What do we get? Power. We are going to govern. 
   In meeting after meeting, conference after conference, the pollsters and the consultants--and I have been a part of all of this. Mea culpa, mea culpa, mea maxima culpa. I have been involved in it. I am not saying I have not, but the pollsters and consultants advised us not to debate the controversial issues. Ignore them. We can win elections if we do not talk about abortion and other controversial issues, even though past elections have proven that when we ignore our principles, we lose, and when we stick to our principles, we win. In spite of all this, we continued to listen to the pollsters and to the consultants who insisted day in and day out they were right. Harry Truman, a good Democrat--my grandfather did not like him, but I did--said, ``Party platforms are contracts with the people.'' Harry Truman was right. 
   Why did we change? We won the revolution on issues. We won the revolution  on principles. But the desire to stay in power caused us to start listening to the pollsters and the consultants again who are now telling us, for some inexplicable reason, that we need to walk away from the issues that got us here to remain in power. Maybe somebody can tell me why. 
   Some of the pollsters who are here now who we are listening to were here in 1984. Indeed, they were here in 1980 when I first ran. I had always thought the purpose of a party was to effect policy, to advocate principles, to elect candidates who generally support the values we espouse, but it is not. 
   Let me be very specific on where we are ignoring the core values of our party. 
   ``We defend the constitutional right to keep and bear arms,'' says the platform of the Republican Party, but vote after vote, day after day, that right is eroded with Republican support. I announced my intention to filibuster the gun control bill. Not only does it violate the Republican platform, but it violates the Constitution itself, which I took an oath to support and defend. 
   Then I hear my own party is planning to work with the other 
   side to allow more gun control to be steamrolled through the Congress which violates our platform. Not only does it violate our platform, it insults millions and millions of law-abiding, peaceful gun owners in this country whose rights we have an obligation to protect under the Constitution. 
   The Republican platform says:  
   We will make further improvement of relations with Vietnam and North Korea contingent upon their cooperation in achieving a full and complete accounting of our POWs and MIAs from those Asian conflicts.  
   Sounds great. So I got up on the floor a short time ago and offered an amendment saying that ``further improvement of relations with Vietnam are contingent upon achieving a full and complete accounting of our POWs and MIAs.....''--right out of the platform word for word. Thirty-three Republicans supported me. The amendment lost. 
   The platform says:  
   Republicans will not subordinate the United States sovereignty to any international authority.  
   Only one--right here, BOB SMITH--voted against funding for the U.N. I can go through a litany--NAFTA, GATT, chemical weapons, and so forth. Vote after vote, with Republican support, the sovereignty of the United States takes a hit in violation of the platform of the Republican Party and the Constitution. 
   The establishment of our party and, indeed, the majority of our party voted to send $18 billion to the IMF. Let me make something very clear. I am not criticizing anybody's motives. Everybody has a right to make a vote here, and there is no argument from me on that. But I am talking about the relationship between the platform and those of us who serve. 
   This $18 billion came from the taxpayers of the United States of America, and it went to a faceless bureaucracy with no guarantee that it would be spent in the interest of the United States. We have no idea where this money will go and no control of it once it goes there. 
   Meanwhile, while $18 billion goes to the IMF, I drive into work and I find Vietnam veterans and other veterans lying homeless on the grates in Washington, DC, in the Capital of our Nation. How many of them could we take care of with a pittance of that $18 billion? 
   As Republicans who supposedly support tax relief for the American family, can we really say that $18 billion to IMF justifies taking the money out of the pocket of that farmer in Iowa who is trying to make his mortgage payment? Can we really say that? I do not think so. 
   Another quote out of the Republican platform:  
   As a first step in reforming Government, we support elimination of the Departments of Commerce, Housing and Urban Development, Education, and Energy, the elimination, defunding or privatization of agencies which are obsolete, redundant, of limited value, or too regional in focus. Examples of agencies we seek to defund or privatize are the National Endowment for the Arts, the National Endowment for the Humanities, the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, and the Legal Services Corporation.  
   That is right out of the Republican platform. If I were to hold a vote today to eliminate any of these agencies, it would fail overwhelmingly, and it would be Republican votes that would take it down. Every Republican in this body knows it. 
   Can you imagine how much money we could save the taxpayers of this country if we eliminated those agencies and those Departments that the platform I just quoted calls for us to eliminate? It is not what I call for; it is what our party platform calls for. Why don't we do it? The answer is obvious why we don't do it: because we do not mean it, because the platform does not mean it. We do not mean it. 
   In education, our platform:  
   Our formula is as simple as it is sweeping: The Federal Government has no constitutional authority to be involved in school curricula or to control jobs in the workplace. That is why we will abolish the Department of Education, end Federal meddling in our schools, and promote family choice at all levels of learning. We therefore call for prompt repeal of the Goals 2000 and the School to Work Act of 1994 which put new Federal controls, as well as unfunded mandates, on the States. We further urge that Federal attempts to impose outcome- or performance-based education on local schools be ended.  
   If I were to introduce a bill on the Senate floor to end the Department of Education, to abolish it, how many votes do you think I would get? How many Republican votes do you think I would get? 
   If, as Truman said, it is a contract, then we broke it. Where I went to school, breaking a contract is immoral, it is unethical, and it is unprincipled, and we ought not to write it if we are going to break it. Let's not have a platform. 
   Our party platform says also:  
   We support the appointment of judges who respect traditional family values and the sanctity of innocent human life.  
   Listen carefully, I say to my colleagues. 
   In 1987, when President Ronald Reagan nominated Robert Bork to the Supreme Court, six Republicans voted against him, and he was rejected. What was Robert Bork's offense? That he stood up for what he believed in, that he was pro-life? He told us. He answered the questions in the hearing. God forbid he should do that. But when President Clinton nominated Ruth Bader Ginsburg, an ACLU lawyer who is stridently pro-abortion, only three Republicans voted no--Senator HELMS, Senator NICKLES, and myself. 
   Of course, all of the Republicans who voted against Bork voted for Ginsburg. I voted against Ginsburg because, as the Republican platform says, I want judges who respect the sanctity of innocent human life. I want my party to stand for something. Thirty-five million unborn children have died since that decision in 1973--35 million of our best--never to get a chance to be a Senator, to be a spectator in the gallery, to be a staff person, to be a teacher, to be a father, a mother--denied--35 million, one-ninth of the entire population of the United States of America. And we are going to do it for the next 25 years because we will not stand up. And I am not going to stand up any more as a Republican and allow it to happen. I am not going to do it. 
   Most interestingly, since that Roe V. Wade decision was written by a Republican, I might add, a Republican appointee, and upheld most recently in the Casey case, it is interesting there was only one Democrat appointee on the Court, Byron White, who voted pro-life. He voted with the four-Justice, pro-life minority. Five Republican appointments gave us that decision. 
   We are to blame. This is not a party. Maybe it is a party in the sense of wearing hats and blowing whistles, but it is not a political party that means anything. 
   About a week ago, my daughter, who works in my campaign office, told me the story of a 9-year-old girl whose dad called our office to say that his little daughter, 9-year-old Mary Frances--I will protect her privacy by giving only her first name--had said that she was born because of an aborted pregnancy, not an intentional one, an aborted pregnancy, a miscarriage at 22 weeks--22 weeks, 5 1/2 months--and she lived. 
   She is 9 years old. She said: I want to empty my piggy bank, Senator SMITH, and send that to you because of your stand for life because I know that children who are 5 1/2 months in the womb can live. 
   That is power.  
   Let me read from the pro-life plank of the Republican Party:  
   [W]e endorse legislation to make clear that the Fourteenth Amendment's protections apply to unborn children.  
   Anything complicated about that? Anything my colleagues don't understand about that?  
   We endorse legislation to make clear that the Fourteenth Amendment's protections apply to unborn children.  
   We are not going to apply any protections to unborn children. We will pass a few votes here, 50-49, if you can switch somebody at the last minute. I have been involved in those. Yes, we will do that, but we will not win. We are not going to commit to putting judges on the courts to get it done. Oh, no, we can't do that because we might lose some votes. So meanwhile another 35 million children are going to die. 
   This year I sponsored a bill out of the platform that says the 14th amendment's protections apply to unborn children. Do you want to know how many sponsors I have? You are looking at him. One. Me. That is it. Not one other Republican cosponsor. 
   In his letter to me--nice letter that it was--from Chairman Nicholson, he claims that ``every one of our Republican candidates shares your proven commitment to life''--he says. Gee, could have fooled me. Then how come every candidate isn't 
   endorsing the bill or speaking out on the platform if they don't want to endorse the bill? 
   The party, to put it bluntly, is hypocritical. It criticizes Bill Clinton, a Democrat, for vetoing partial-birth abortion and for being pro-abortion, but it does not criticize our own. It does not criticize the Republicans who are pro-choice. So why criticize Bill Clinton? Or why criticize any Democrat? We cannot get it done. We don't say anything about those people. 
   How about the Governors who vetoed the bill, the partial-birth abortion bill? You know, there are a lot of fancy words in the Republican platform. Every 4 years we go to the convention and we fight over the wording. Sometimes even a nominee says: Well, I haven't read it. At least he is being honest. Or, which is probably more the truth, we just ignore it. It is a charade. And I am not going to take part in it any more. I am not going to take part in it any more. 
   In the movie ``Mr. Smith Goes to Washington,'' after his own political party has launched attacks on him for daring to raise an independent voice, Jimmy Stewart's character is seated on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial, and here is what he says: ``There are a lot of fancy words around this town. Some of them are carved in stone. Some of 'em, I guess, were put there so suckers like me can read 'em.'' 
   You ought to watch the movie. It is a good movie. It will make you feel good. 
   Mr. President, I have come to the cold realization that the Republican Party is more interested in winning elections than supporting the principles of the platform. There is nothing wrong with winning elections. I am all for it. I have helped a few and I have won some myself, and there is nothing wrong with it. But what is wrong with it is when you put winning ahead of principle. 
   The Republican platform is a meaningless document that has been put out there so suckers like me and maybe suckers like you out there can read it. I did not come here for that reason. I did not come here to compromise my values to promote the interests of a political party. 
   I came here to promote the interests of my country. And after a lot of soul-searching, and no anger--no anger--I have decided to change my registration from Republican to Independent. There is no contempt; there is no anger. It is a decision of conscience. 
   Many of my colleagues have called me, and I deeply appreciate the conversations that I have had privately with many of you on both sides, but I ask my colleagues to respect this decision. It is a decision of conscience. Millions and millions of Independents and conservative Democrats and members of other political parties have already made this decision of conscience. As a matter of fact, there are more Independents than there are Republicans or Democrats. 
   I would ask you to give me the same respect that you give them when you ask them to vote for you in election after election. Indeed, we win elections because of Independents. 
   I found a poem, written by a man by the name of Edgar Guest, which my father, who was killed at the end of the Second World War, when I was 3 years old, had placed in his Navy scrapbook in 1941, just prior to going off to war in the 
   Pacific--newly married about 2 1/2 years. I can imagine what was going through his mind. But he placed it in his scrapbook and highlighted it. 
   I am just going to quote one excerpt. The poem is entitled, ``Plea for Strength.''  
   Grant me the fighting spirit and fashion me stout of will, 
   Arouse in me that strange something that fear cannot chill. 
   Let me not whimper at hardship. 
   This is the gift that I ask. 
   Not ease and escape from trial, 
   But strength for the difficult task.  
   Many have said that what I am doing is foolish. I have heard it from a lot of people--friends and colleagues. But you know what Mark Twain said--I think the Chaplain will like this:  
   I am a great and sublime fool. But, then I am God's fool. And all His works must be contemplated with respect.  
   I called Senator LOTT last week personally. It was the most difficult telephone call I think I had ever made. 
   I told him it was my intention to continue to vote in caucus with the Republicans, if he wanted me, provided that there was no retaliatory or punitive action taken against me. He was very gracious. He didn't like it--I don't blame him--but he was gracious. I appreciate his understanding, and I appreciate the compassion and understanding of many of my colleagues on both sides who have spoken with me these past few days. 
   I made another phone call, Mr. President. I called the chairman of the Republican Party, Mr. Jim Nicholson, last week to inform him of my decision and asked him if he could please maintain confidentiality until I had a chance to make my decision public. Before I had a chance to do that--indeed, about 20 hours after I had made the call--my home was staked out in New Hampshire. Where I was going to visit friends, their homes were staked out, sometimes until late into the evening, by the media, because the chairman put out a letter attacking me personally. 
   I am not going to dignify the letter by reading it here on the Senate floor. I do ask unanimous consent that the letter be printed into the RECORD.

   Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. I will only characterize the letter in the following way: It is petty, it is vindictive, and it is insulting. It is beneath the dignity of the chairman of any political party. It is an affront to the millions of voters who choose not to carry  a Republican membership card but have given the party its margin of victory in election after election. 
   Remember that little girl I talked to you about a little while ago, Mary Frances? I do not know what she is going to grow up to be. She might be a Democrat. She might be a Republican. Maybe she will be an Independent. Maybe she won't vote. I don't know. But I'll tell you what, in the old baseball tradition, I wouldn't trade her for 1,000 Jim Nicholsons, not in a minute. 
   There was talk on the shows this weekend that I might be removed as chairman of the Ethics Committee. I must say, I was disappointed at the intensity of the attacks on me by unidentified sources, I might add, in the Republican Party. Interestingly, one of those reports was that the party is considering suing me for the money it spent during my reelection. 
   I want to make it very clear, because press reports were inaccurate on one point. Senator MCCONNELL called me personally yesterday to clarify that this particular report of a lawsuit is not true, and I accept his answer as absolute fact with no question. But some faceless party bureaucrat had a really good time writing that and then leaking it to the press. That is what is wrong with politics. He ought to be fired, but you will never find out who it is. 
   Another interesting report was that a different party operative presumed to suggest that ``Smith should be booted out of the conference altogether if he is not a Republican; he shouldn't be in the Republican caucus.'' I wonder how much he is being paid to sit up there using up the party faithful's contributions to write that kind of garbage. 
   The chairman of the New Hampshire Republican Party, where for 15 years I have been a member, went on ``Crossfire'' the other night to debate BOB SMITH, but BOB SMITH wasn't there to answer for himself. He took the anti-BOB position. He attacked me viciously, saying it was a selfish move and that it meant the end of my political career. 
   There is something a little strange in that. If it is selfish and I am throwing away my political career, maybe somebody can explain what he means. Not a mention of 15 years of service to the State and to the party. Even Bill Press said: Can't you find something nice to say about BOB? 
   That is what is wrong with politics. It is the ugly. It is the bad. It is the worst. It is the worst. 
   In 1866 Abraham Lincoln said this--it is a very famous quote:  
   If I were to try to read, much less answer, all the attacks made on me, this shop might as well be closed for any other business. I do the very best I know how, the very best I can, and I am going to keep right on doing so until the end. If the end brings me out all right, what is said against me won't amount to anything. If the end brings me out wrong, 10 angels swearing I was right will make no difference.  
   Lincoln really knew how to say it. In a way, perhaps Chairman Duprey is right about my being selfish. I am putting my selfish desire to save my country ahead of the interests of the Republican Party, and some nameless, faceless bureaucrat in 
   the party machinery decides to take off on me. I wish he would surface. I would like to meet him. 
   If that is selfish, then Duprey is right. If putting your country ahead of your party, if standing up for the principles you believe in is wrong, maybe it is time to get out of politics. 
   Over the past 15 years I have traveled all over America helping Republican candidates. I don't very often ask for help. I don't remember ever asking for help from the Republican Party to do it. I spent hours and hours on the phone raising money. And the party has helped me; I will be the first to admit it. Some have made a big deal out of that. They should help me. I think that is what the party is there for. I went to California, Louisiana, Iowa, Missouri, and North Carolina during the last year on behalf of Republican candidates. It had nothing to do with my Presidential campaign; it was entirely on behalf of other candidates. When the chairman of the senatorial committee asked Members to pony up money, he gave me a bill. He said: You have X in your account, and you owe me $25,000. I wrote him a check the next day. Everybody didn't do it though, did they, Mr. Chairman? 
   I have a bureaucrat out there somewhere in the party saying throw me out of the caucus. Frankly, I gave without hesitation because I believed things were changing. I don't take a back seat in my willingness as a Republican to help candidates in need. But oh, no, I have committed the unforgivable sin here in Washington; I have exposed the fraud. It is a fraud, and everybody in here knows it. 
   It is true in both parties that the party platform is not worth the paper it is written on. That is why I am an Independent. That is why I am going to stay an Independent, whatever happens in the future. I am still the same formula. I am still Classic Coke. I am not a new Coke. I am the same ingredients. I have merely redesigned the label. It is the same BOB SMITH. My colleagues over there looking for help, you are not going to get it. You know where my votes come from, so don't get excited. 
   In my travels, I have attended hundreds of Republican Party events, but the most consistent message I hear from the voters is one of frustration, deep frustration that the party is not standing on principle. Last year CQ published a list of leading scorers on party unity. This is a list they do every year, ranking the most loyal Republican votes. 
   It is interesting because I don't look at them as loyalty votes. I just make the votes. Well, guess what. Let's see--LARRY CRAIG was here. He is not here right now. LARRY CRAIG and I were No. 1--very interesting, when you look down the list. So I am No. 1 in party loyalty. How many major committee chairmen in the conference are on the list? Take a look at the list. I am not going to embarrass colleagues. 
   I am the most reliable Republican vote in the Senate, but I am attacked--not by colleagues, not by colleagues. It is obvious from these kinds of attacks that it is not about me. What it shows is a complete and final divorce between the party machinery and the principles for which it professes to stand. I say, with all due respect to my colleagues in the Senate, whether you are running a campaign for President or whether you are in the House or something else, we have to stop it. We have to get a handle on it. I think it is true in the other party as well. 
   We have to get a handle on it. They don't represent us well. It is an injustice to the candidates who run for and the people who serve in the Republican Party, and it has to stop. It is a cancer, and it is eating away at the two great political parties that rose to power; in this case, the Republican Party that rose to power on the moral opposition to slavery; and it killed the Whig Party, because it wouldn't stand up against slavery. It will kill the Republican Party if it doesn't stand up for what it believes in, especially against abortion. 
   I told you I watched the movie ``Mr. Smith Goes To Washington'' again over the weekend. I remember talking to Mike Mansfield, who was here a few weeks ago for one of the seminars that the leader puts on. He said that after he left the Senate was the first time he really went around and looked at the monuments; he read the writings; he took the time to smell the roses. He said: These just aren't hollow words or statues anymore; they have meaning to me. 
   This morning--I am not trying to be melodramatic--but I did it. I left early, about 5:45. I took Jimmy Stewart's example from the movie ``Mr. Smith Goes To Washington.'' 
   I went to the Lincoln Memorial, the Jefferson Memorial, the Vietnam Wall, and the Arlington Cemetery where my parents are buried. I tried to smell the roses. Do you know what? These aren't memorials to people who fought for political parties. Lincoln helped to destroy his own political party. On that visit to Arlington this morning, I stopped at my parents' grave site. My father didn't fight for a political party. He didn't die for a political party. He fought for his country, as millions of others have done, and the ideals for which it was founded. I looked out at those stones all across Arlington Cemetery, and I didn't see any R's or D's next to their names. Then I went to the Vietnam Wall, and I didn't see any R's or D's next to anybody's name there. How about that? 
   Like Jimmy Stewart's character in the movie, I stand right here at the desk of Daniel Webster, one of the greatest lawyers of all time, one of the greatest Senators of all time, whose  picture is on statues everywhere. Most people probably could not even tell you what party he belonged to, unless you are a history buff. Who cares what party he belonged to? You will remember that he stood up against slavery, and his quote, ``Nothing is so powerful but the truth.'' And the opposite was John C. Calhoun, Henry Clay, the great orators of their time. You remember them for what they were and what they said, not for their party. Webster was an abolitionist and Calhoun the defender of slavery. 
   Calhoun said:  
   The very essence of a free government consists in considering offices as public trusts, bestowed for the good of the country, and not for the benefit of an individual or a party.  
   We have lost sight of it. Man, there is so much history in this place. My wife conducts tours for people from New Hampshire and at times people she finds on the streets. If we would just take a few moments away from the bickering and the arguing and look around and enjoy it, do you know what. It would inspire us. It inspired me today. Maybe I should be doing it every day. Every year, a Senator is chosen to read Washington's Farewell Address. I have been here 9 years and was never asked. I never understood how that person gets picked, but they do. How many of us have actually taken the time to sit and listen to that Farewell Address? Well, Washington, in that Farewell Address, warns us that:  
   The common and continual mischiefs of the spirit of party are sufficient to make it the interest and duty of a wise people to discourage and restrain it.  
   He spends a large part of his speech expounding on this point, and I encourage my colleagues to read it.

   Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. In the spirit of what Washington is saying, I think we need to rid ourselves of the nastiness and the partisanship that has destroyed the comity of this great body and has become a barrier to a full and spirited discussion of the issues in America generally. You may say: That is pretty good coming from SMITH; he is as partisan as they come. There is a time and place for partisanship. HARRY REID knows when I put the partisanship at the door. He knows, as cochair of the Ethics Committee with me. 
   Americans deserve an honest debate, an honest exchange of ideas. They want us to put these partisan interests aside. It is not partisan if somebody is against abortion or is for abortion; it is issue generated. 
   Americans want people who will lead, not follow polls. The American people are losing the faith in their ability to effect change, and rightfully so. 
   Since I came to Washington, I have seen Senators and Congressmen come and go. Do you know what. I will tell you what doesn't go. I refer to the entrenched political industry that is here to stay. Oh, it changes a little bit at the top when somebody else becomes the chairman. But the entrenchment is still there. The pollsters, the spin doctors, and the campaign consultants are all there. They all have their hands in your pockets, and they are doing pretty well. 
   They run the show, for the most part. They don't directly choose candidates in the sense of a smoke-filled backroom, but they do influence it because they are the ones who tried to talk me out of running in 1980--the same ones. 
   Some of the pollsters in the party have been around since I first came to town. Every time there is a Republican retreat--and I assume it is the same for the other party--and often at Republican conferences here in the Senate, we hear from the professional consultants and pollsters. They tell us what the message should be. They tell us how to make ourselves look good and how to make the other guys look bad. 
   We need to get out the fumigation equipment. We need to clean out the pollsters, the consultants, the spin doctors, and the bloated staffs who tell us what to say, how to say it, when 
   to say it, and how long to say it. The American people elected us. Isn't it time we start thinking for ourselves and leading? 
   This well-paid political industry, let me tell you, colleagues, is not interested in whether or not you believe in the issues of your party. Don't kid yourselves. This is about power, access, and jobs. I can have tea and crumpets with the President of the United States if I help him win it. As long as you look like a winner, it doesn't matter what you believe. Don't kid yourselves. They seek out the candidates who have the package they want--name ID, money, slickness. But, most importantly, they want candidates who won't make waves, or say anything controversial about an issue that might cost us a seat. They package you, wrap you up, put a little bow on it, tell you what to say, and then they sell you to the American voters. 
   The political professionals tell us all the time, ``Don't be controversial; it can cause you to lose your election.'' 
   Why are we afraid of controversy? Was Lincoln afraid of it? Was FDR? Was Calhoun? Was Washington? With controversy comes change--positive change sometimes. Imagine Patrick Henry, striding up to the podium in 1773 before the Virginia Assembly, prepared to give his great speech: ``Give me liberty or give me .....'' and then he turns to his pollster and says: I wonder whether they want liberty or death. I better take a poll and find out. 
   Let's not declare our independence; that is pretty controversial. They could have said that in 1776. Let's not abolish slavery; that is controversial. 
   In the 1850s, the great Whig Party said: 
   Let's not talk about slavery, it's too controversial. Let's put the issue aside and focus on electing more Whigs. 
   But a loyal Whig Congressman named Abraham Lincoln thought otherwise. 
   The pollsters come into the hallowed Halls in meetings of Senators to tell us how we can talk to people, to all the men who are 35 and over, what to say to them; and women 25 and under, what to say to them; to Social Security people; to black people; and what we should say to Hispanics; or white people; what do we say to pro-choice or to pro-life. Pollsters, pollsters, pollsters. 
   We are looking at polls to decide whether or not to go to Kosovo. We take a poll to decide whether or not we should send our kids to die in a foreign country. Did Roosevelt do a poll on whether or not to retaliate against the Japanese? Partisanship is poisoning this town. The pollsters are poisoning this town. Help members of your own party and destroy the other guy. 
   My proudest moment in the Senate in the 9 years I have been here--other than some of the meetings HARRY REID and I have had together where we have to discuss the futures of some of you quietly--was when we went into the Old Senate Chamber and talked during the impeachment trial. You know it, all of you; it was the best moment we have had since we have been here. We took the hats off and we sat down and talked about things, and we did it the right way. 
   I wanted to have every caucus that we had on the impeachment trial bipartisan; I didn't want any separation. But we didn't get that. Boy, what a delight it would have been had we done that. I am not saying it would have made the difference; maybe it would not have. But that is not the purpose of bringing it up. It is my belief that if we had come together and looked at the evidence--you never know. 
   I am proudest of my service on the Senate Ethics Committee where six Senators, including my good friend, Senator REID, and I, discuss issues without one iota of partisanship. 
   When we investigated Bob Packwood, a fellow Republican came up to me after that vote in which we voted to expel a colleague, and he was angry. He was a powerful Republican, and this was not an easy conversation. He scolded me, saying, ``I can't believe that you would vote to expel a fellow Republican. It's outrageous. How can you do that?'' I said, ``You will have the opportunity to sustain or overrule that vote on the floor of the Senate very shortly.'' 
   He came back later and said: Thank you for saving me a difficult vote. 
   We on the committee ignored the partisan mud balls. We did what was right. 
   I am not ashamed of being a member of a political party. The question is, Does party take precedence over principle? I want the 21st century to be remembered for debating important and  controversial issues in public: Abortion, taxes, size of government, restoring our sovereignty, gun control, moral decadence, freedom. Don't avoid these issues simply to help our own political fortunes or to destroy our opponents. 
   Lt. William Hobby, Jr., wrote a poem called ``The Navigator'' during the Second World War. I think it captures the vision and spirit of what I believe America should be. 
 The Morning Watch is mustered, and the middle watch withdrawn Now Ghostlike glides the vessel in the hush before the dawn. Friendly gleams polaris on the gently rolling sea, He set the course for sailors and tonight he shines for me.  
   We have the opportunity to take America into the 21st century of freedom, morality, support for the Constitution, respect for life, respect for the sacrifices made for us by our founders and the millions of veterans who have given so much of their precious blood. Politics should be about each one of us joining together to rediscover our moral compass, to reignite the torch of freedom, to return to our navigational chart: The Constitution, the Declaration of Independence, and the Bible. 
   In conclusion, in the movie ``Mr. Smith Goes to Washington,'' Jimmy Stewart portrayed a U.S. Senator who believed that America was good, that politics was good, and that the American people deserve good, honest leaders. I agree. 
   Chaplain Ogilvie said to me a few weeks ago:  
   Our time in History is God's gift to us. What we do with it is our gift to him. Let's not squander it with petty partisan politics.

    Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President I rise today to pay tribute to Hitchiner Manufacturing Co., Inc. for receiving Business NH Magazine's 1999 Business of the Year Award. 
   Since the company moved to Milford, New Hampshire in 1951, Hitchiner has been extremely active within the community. Hitchiner supports the community through contributions to the arts, education, and community welfare. Specifically, they offer much-needed dollars to local and state nonprofits and they make time available for their employees to participate in community affairs. Hitchiner President/CEO, John Morison III, believes when employees work in the community their experiences will translate into a positive experience for the company as a whole. 
   In addition to being involved in community affairs, Hitchiner Manufacturing is a leader in technology. The company is an international player for investment castings for customers such as General Motors, BMW and General Electric. Hitchiner will soon acquire their tenth patent, thereby establishing themselves as the leader in metallurgical advances. 
   Hitchiner's profit sharing philosophy has helped create a spirit of team work among its employees. President Morison believes that by sharing the profits and risks, of working as a team, the company will be better equipped to stay on the cutting edge of technology--this is the key to future success.

    Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to honor Christopher R. Rovzar, of Exeter, New Hampshire, for being selected as a 1999 Presidential Scholar by the U.S. Secretary of Education. 
   Of the over 2.5 million graduating seniors nationwide, Christopher is one of only 141 seniors to receive this distinction for academics. This impressive young man is well-deserving of the title of Presidential Scholar. I wish to commend Christopher for his outstanding achievement. 
   As a student at Phillips Exeter Academy in New Hampshire, Christopher has served as a role model for his peers through his commitment to excellence. Christopher's determination promises to guide him in the future.

    Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to acknowledge and commend Mr. Larry Stolte as he retires from the United States Fish and Wildlife Service. 
   Larry's career in New England began as a fisheries biologist in 1969 with the New Hampshire Fish and Game Department, working on the introduction of Coho salmon in the Great Bay area. In 1975, he joined the United States Fish and Wildlife Service and became the Atlantic Salmon Planner for New England. Larry took the lead in developing an Atlantic salmon strategic plan for southern New England, and chaired the state committee that developed the Atlantic salmon plan for Maine's rivers. 
   While working to restore Atlantic salmon to New England's waterways, Larry began researching the ``king of gamefish'' in the Merrimack River. He documented his research in a book titled ``The Forgotten Salmon of the Merrimack,'' which was published in 1981 and is recognized by many as the most accurate record of the history of the Atlantic salmon in the Merrimack River. 
   For the past 15 years, Larry has been the Fish and Wildlife Service's coordinator for anadromous fish restoration in the Merrimack River. He has also  chaired the U.S. Atlantic Salmon Assessment Committee and has been a working member of the International Commission on the Exploration of the Seas' North Atlantic Salmon Working Group. 
   Larry has devoted his entire career to restoring anadromous fish to New England rivers. His dedication and perseverance has been an inspiration to those who have worked toward this effort. Upon his retirement from the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, Larry and his wife Tracy will reside in Montana. I would like to thank Larry for his hard work and dedication to the restoration efforts of New England Rivers. It is an honor to represent Larry in the United States Senate.

    Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to honor Sy Mahfuz, of Nashua, New Hampshire, for being selected a 1999 Business Leader of the Year by Business NH Magazine. 
   Sy, the owner of Persian Rug Galleries, has lived in Nashua for 46 years. His business is a fixture on Main Street and draws customers from all over the Northeast and New York. Persian Rug Galleries is known for both the quality of its products and the expertise of its employees. 
   Sy dedicates his time both to his business and to the community. In 1994, he fought to pass a bill which protests consumers from ``going out of business'' sales. He also is a major organizer of many downtown events. His leadership role in planning Twist the Night Away brought an estimated 100,000 people to Nashua's Main Street in 1998. 
   Sy's sense of responsibility for both his colleagues and neighbors has brought him success in the past. With his determination to succeed rooted in this responsibility he will surely continue to be a positive role model for his community. 
   Mr. President, I would like to wish Sy my sincere congratulations and best wishes. While running a successful family business, Sy had dedicated much of his time to having a positive impact on his community. His accomplishments are truly remarkable.

    Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to CLD Consulting Engineering, a recipient of the ``Business of the Year Award'' from Business NH Magazine. They have shown incredible success, ingenuity, and community service, virtues that are indeed worthy of recognition. 
   CLD, a civil engineering firm, has specialized in public projects which benefit many New Hampshire residents. These projects include the transformation of Manchester's Elm Street into a more pedestrian-friendly environment, improving the traffic pattern at the Mall of New Hampshire, and a new project to design Manchester's new two-mile long Riverwalk. 
   In addition to engineering designs, CLD has had an extremely positive impact in the community. The firm has sponsored a Boy Scout Explorer Post, engineering competitions, high school internships, and mentoring programs at local schools. I applaud not only their business success, but also their dedication to serving their community. 
   As a former small business owner myself, I understand the hard work and dedication required for success in business. Once again, I wish to congratulate CLD Consulting Engineers for being selected as a 1999 Business of the Year by the Business NH Magazine. It is an honor to represent them in the United States Senate.

    Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate Aurelie V. Burnham on her 91st birthday. 
   Aurelie was born on July 5, 1908 in East Weare, New Hampshire to Fred and May Bellefeuille. Aurelie's mother, May, died in 1915 leaving Aurelie to care for her older brother, four younger brothers and her father Fred. In 1920, the Bellefeuille farm burned down, thus forcing Fred to move his family to the mill town of Manchester, New Hampshire. Fred later remarried a widow with four daughters and one son; together, they had a son--bringing the total number of children in the Bellefeuille family to eleven. 
   At the age of sixteen, Aurelie began working at the Amoskeag Mills. On December 9, 1938, she married Arthur H. Burnham. Arthur, a native of Peterborough, New Hampshire lived in the Nashua-Hudson area. After their marriage, they resided in Manchester where they raised their three children: Dorothy, Joanne and Arthur, Jr. Dorothy, a senior caseworker in my Manchester office, has been a valued member of my staff for the past fifteen years. Joanne is employed with the Internal Revenue Service and Arthur, Jr. is a computer programmer for the Associates National Bank in Dallas, Texas. Aurelie and Arthur have six grandchildren. Mr. Burnham passed away in September 1979. 
   Aurelie is known for her kindness and caring. She was a stay-at-home mother who was always there for her children and their friends. Aurlie has been a volunteer on several federal campaigns. Though her physical health is not what she would prefer, she is still an avid reader, crossword puzzle expert, and manages to go shopping at  the malls whenever possible. During the summer months, she enjoys a trip to the seacoast where she says she can breathe in the ocean air and feel more comfortable. 
   Once again, I would like to congratulate Aurelie on reaching her 91st birthday. It is an honor to represent her in the United States Senate.

   Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. I thank the majority leader for his courtesy. 
   This is a historic day. Ironically, today, the House of Representatives is scheduled to pass a constitutional amendment protecting our flag from desecration and on this same day we are, for the first time in the history of the Senate, as far as I know, saluting the flag as we begin its proceedings. 
   I thank both leaders, Senator LOTT and Senator DASCHLE, for their support in bringing this resolution to the floor quickly, and also to thank Senators MCCONNELL, HELMS, DORGAN, MIKULSKI, WARNER, BROWNBACK, FEINSTEIN, ROBB, CONRAD, THURMOND, MURKOWSKI, and Senator GORDON SMITH for their cosponsorship and to thank all of my colleagues as we had a 100-to-0 agreement to do this. 
   I am proud to be the sponsor of this historic resolution. I stand here at a very historic desk, the desk of Daniel Webster, who was here a few years before me. 
   This is history being made. I want to give credit to the person who helped make this history happen. Oftentimes, we get letters and phone calls from constituents, sometimes with good ideas, sometimes they are not so good. But in this particular case a young woman, who is in the gallery today, by the name of Rebecca Stewart, of Enfield, NH, made a simple phone call to my office. She said: Why don't we salute the flag before the proceedings begin in the Senate? 
   I said: That's a good idea. Why didn't I think of that? But I had not. 
   Thanks to Rebecca, who gave us the idea--and I looked into it with the Rules Committee and everything moved quickly, thanks to both leaders--here we are. Today, Rebecca brought with her the flag that was draped over the coffin of her husband's grandfather, who was a World War II vet. 
   I think it is very fitting this morning that a young woman from New Hampshire, which has the Nation's first primary, was first to see that the flag of the United States will from now on be saluted prior to the proceedings in the Senate. 
   I say thank you to Rebecca and to my colleagues for their courtesies in making a good idea come to pass. 
   I thank the Chair, and I thank my colleague for yielding.

    Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the Orion Computer Sourcing Group for being named one of Entrepreneur Magazine's ``Hot 100'' fastest growing businesses in the country. Orion was the highest ranking of the three New Hampshire business included on this prestigious list and one of only seven New England businesses recognized by the magazine. 
   This Portsmouth based company, which purchases excess computer hardware from manufacturers and sells it to clients like Hewlett-Packard, Compaq, and Packard Bell, is definitely on the move. Orion's president, Grant Guilbeault, started the company in his basement in October of 1997 with just $30,000. It has grown to a work force of 14, and continues to expand as business increases. Orion has more than doubled last year's revenue, and similar growth is expected for next year. 
   Orion Computer Sourcing is not content with resting on its laurels. Grant Guilbeault and the entire Orion team have set their goals for the future and are currently in the process of making plans to grow the company into a $100-million dollar business in the next few years. If their efforts of the past 18 months are any indication, I have no doubt they will reach their goals. 
   Part of Orion's tremendous success has been their ability to come together as a team and have a good time. One of the centerpieces of the office is a pool table where all the employees can gather to enjoy themselves, escape the pressures of building a business, and get to know each other. It has obviously been a very successful formula for everyone at Orion. 
   Once again, I wish to congratulate the employees of Orion on their achievement. I am proud to serve you in the United States Senate.

   Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, yesterday on vote No. 180, which was the State Department authorization bill, in that legislation was $819 million in U.N. back payments that the United States would pay to the U.N. In addition, there was $107 million the U.N. owed to the United States that was forgiven. 
   I was unaware that those provisions were in the legislation, and I voted yea. Had I been aware of this, I would have voted nay. 
   Therefore, I ask unanimous consent that I be permitted to change my vote. This will in no way change the outcome of the vote.

    Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to honor Celebrate New Hampshire Culture, a nonprofit organization formed by the New Hampshire Commission on the Smithsonian Folklife Festival that works in partnership with the New Hampshire State Council on the Arts and the Department of Cultural Resources. 
   I commend the many dedicated volunteers and participants from my State for their hard work in planning, organizing, and demonstrating our New Hampshire culture through the exhibits for this year's Smithsonian Folklife Festival. 
   Since being elected to Congress 15 years ago, I have had the pleasure of sharing with my fellow Members of Congress why I believe New Hampshire is such a special place in which to live. I am extremely proud that they, and countless others, will now have the opportunity to experience firsthand all the wonderful things New Hampshire has to offer. 
   In 1994, Mervin Stevens of Walpole began working towards New Hampshire's participation after attending the festival over the years. Curators Lynn Martin and Betty Beland have made Mervin's dream a reality. These two women, along with many volunteers, have worked tirelessly for months to make sure that the more than 1 million visitors to the Folklife Festival on the Mall this week will have a meaningful and memorable experience. 
   New Hampshire's diversity, vibrancy, and entrepreneurship will be portrayed through several themes: Music of New Hampshire; Town and Community; Ingenuity and Enterprise; Seasons of Work and Recreation; and Farm, Forests, Mountains, and Sea. The themes and displays will be enhanced through several hands-on examples of living traditions. These exhibits include a 35-foot-long by 15-foot-high covered bridge, a timber-framed barn, a wrought-iron archway, and granite walls. 
   There will also be two music stages set up. One will be a replica of a town hall and the other of a New England front porch with rocking chairs and benches. These fascinating displays of New Hampshire culture will be celebrated in three ways: First, at this summer's Smithsonian festival. Next, a reenactment will take place next summer during Festival New Hampshire at the Hopkinton State Fairgrounds in Contoocook. Finally, an educational program for schools and communities will be based on the extensive research of culture needed to launch the festival. 
   Mr. President, I wish to offer my most sincere congratulations to Celebrate New Hampshire Culture and the countless volunteers. Their hard work and dedication will now help show the world what makes New Hampshire the greatest State in America. It is an honor to represent Celebrate New Hampshire Culture and all the people of New Hampshire in the Senate.

   Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, several weeks ago a young woman named Rebecca Stewart of Enfield, NH, notified me by telephone there was no flag salute before the opening ceremonies when we opened the Senate in the morning. Due to the cooperation of both the minority and the majority side, I think we have a 100-to-0 agreement that we do that. 
   So at this point, I ask unanimous consent that S. Res. 113, which is the resolution to salute the flag at the beginning of the opening of the Senate each morning, be discharged from the Rules Committee, and further, the Senate now proceed to its immediate consideration.

    Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to honor Jonathan Edward Stephens on his graduation summa cum laude from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. I commend his outstanding academic achievements. 
   Jonathan was the 1995 Dover High School Valedictorian and went on to a superb academic career at Rensselaer. Ranking first in his class with a 4.0 average, Jonathan was also awarded the Erwin R. Gaerttner award, given to a nuclear engineer or engineering physics major. The award recognizes excellence in scholarship, personal character, and promise of outstanding performance in research related to nuclear engineering and physics. 
   Jonathan was also awarded the Senior Design Project Award for his project, titled the ``International Neutron Spherical Torus Explosives Detector.'' His research will be used to detect land mines. Mr. President, as a veteran, I recognize our need to find land mines.  
   Jonathan also has exciting opportunities ahead of him. He has been offered a full fellowship at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology to pursue a doctorate in the field of nuclear physics. He has also received the national full fellowship from the Oak Ridge Labs in Tennessee to pursue a doctorate at any University in the United States. Jonathan has chosen to accept a position as a nuclear engineer with the Knoll Atomic Power Lab, a division of Lockheed Martin, where he will design nuclear reactors for the U.S. Navy's aircraft carriers. He plans to complete his Master's at Rensselaer. 
   As a former teacher and school board chairman, I recognize the challenges students face to succeed. I applaud Jonathan for his exemplary academic career. I wish him luck as he continues his education and work in the engineering field. I am pleased to recognize such an outstanding young mind, and it is with great pleasure that I represent him in the United States Senate.

    Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Joyce Tugel for her outstanding work as a teacher at Marshwood High School. Joyce is one of 208 teachers nationwide to receive the ``Presidential Award for Excellence in Mathematics and Science Teaching.'' 
   This award, which is administered by the National Science Foundation, is the highest honor a secondary teacher of mathematics and science can receive. Joyce, who teaches chemistry and freshman science, applied for the award in February 1998. The process was very intense with minimum requirements of: a 20-page report showing evidence of talent, an assessment of student learning, a listing of background and experience and even photographs of learning activities. 
   Joyce received both her bachelor's and master's degrees from the University of New Hampshire. She was a biogeochemistry research scientist at UNH's Institute for Study of Earth, Ocean and Space in Morse Hall. She has now been with Marshwood High School for 9 years, and is one of their most valued faculty members. 
   As a former high school teacher, I am extremely pleased to see educators from New Hampshire being nationally recognized for their tireless efforts and dedication to education. I commend Joyce for her excellent track record. I am proud to represent her in the U.S. Senate.

Joel received the ``Prudential Spirit of Community Inspiration'' Award, given to those who are significant contributors to their community in the face of enormous personal challenges. 
   As a volunteer, Joel created the ``Help Them Heal'' fund to support spinal chord research and facility improvement at the Children's Hospital in Boston. He has raised over $10,000, a figure which was more than double his original goal. 
   The reasons Joel's accomplishments are so extraordinary is he too suffers from Curvature of the spine. Instead of focusing on his own problems, Joel is consumed with making spinal surgery and extended stays at the Boston Children's Hospital easier for others, especially the younger patients. His concern for people suffering from spinal problems similar to his has led him to establish the ``Help Them Heal'' fund. 
   The money Joel's fund has raised will be used for research on improved spinal surgical techniques. The funds will also be used to purchase a computer, games, and educational materials for the patients at the hospital. 
   I commend Joel for his commitment and dedication. He is an inspirational young man. I am proud to represent him in the U.S. Senate.

    Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to honor Phil Gravink the senior statesman of New Hampshire's ski industry. Phil Gravink is one of the industry's most respected and experienced leaders. He is currently director of Attitash/Bear Peak Resort in Bartlett. This resort is New Hampshire's largest and is a vital part of the state's economy, attracting skiers from all over New England and bringing in millions of dollars in revenues. Phil is a resident of Jackson, and has devoted 36 years to operating ski resorts, 22 of which have been in New Hampshire. 
   Phil Gravink has had a truly successful and distinguished career. He has served as chairman of the National Ski Association and the American Ski Federation. In 1963 he founded Peak 'n Peek ski area in Western New York. He then served as superintendent of Gore Mountain Ski Area in New York until he came to New Hampshire in 1977 as General Manager of Loon Mountain. In 1980 he became president of Loon and lead it through its most successful growth years. In 1991 he moved on to a Littleton based ``sno.engineering'' company as a senior associate, and then helped operate the two state-owned resorts: Cannon and Mount Sunapee ski areas. In 1992, he took the job as head of Attitash/Bear Peak and oversaw an extensive expansion that nearly doubled the size of the resort. 
   Phil Gravink has been an integral part of New Hampshire's Ski industry. On June 4, Phil announced his retirement, but plans to stay with Attitash/Bear Peak as an advisor. Phil and his wife are scheduled to spend the year 2000 on a bicycling trip around the world, raising money for the New England Ski Museum and the Northeast Passage, a disabled sports program that his daughter Jill has worked to develop. The Northeast Passage began as a way for post-trauma patients to become re-involved in skiing and has since expanded to involve other sports. 
   I commend Phil for his critical role and unwavering dedication to the success and progression of the New Hampshire ski industry. I wish him and his wife the best of luck in the Odyssey 2000 cycling trip. Phil Gravink is a great business man and a model citizen. His retirement leaves behind a great legacy. It is an honor to represent him in the United States Senate.

    Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the Concord High School girls' lacrosse team, the Crimson Tide, on their fantastic 1999 season. 
   Remarkably, Concord High School's lacrosse team, which was just established last year, had one of the best records in the state this year. Under the direction of Coach Terry Anderson, this young team compiled an impressive record of 17 wins and only three losses--making it to the state finals. 
   The Crimson Tide, consisting predominantly of freshmen and sophomores, made great strides this season. Led by team captains Molly Aldrich, Kate Provencal, and Katie Anderson, they had one of the most impressive records in the state. With many of the players returning to play next season, they are sure to remain a strong force in New Hampshire lacrosse. 
   Although they were not successful in winning the state championship, the team showed true sportsmanship and team spirit in the wake of such an amazing season. Perhaps most importantly, after the hard-fought championship game, the two teams showed outstanding sportsmanship in the sincere way they congratulated and publicly complimented each other on their game. The overall performance of Concord High School's lacrosse team confirmed that this program is one of New Hampshire's finest. 
   Mr. President, I congratulate every member of the Concord High School Crimson Tide girls' lacrosse team, as well as their coach, Terry Anderson. I wish them luck in the future and in all their following lacrosse seasons. It is an honor to represent these hardworking and talented young people in the United States Senate.

The ``Excellence in Education'' award is an annual program designed to identify one elementary, middle, and secondary school that is representative of the many outstanding schools in New Hampshire. 
   Kingswood Regional High School was chosen for this honor because of the dedication and commitment to education by its teachers, parents, and students. Its exemplary community involvement in support curriculum has created an environment conducive to the development of young minds. 
   I admire Kingswood's commitment to excellence. In recent years Kingswood Regional High School has taken on challenging initiatives with outstanding results. Its achievement of academic excellence based on New Hampshire's 10th grade and SAT testing results, and ensuing Writing Across The Curriculum Project, is to be commended. Technology education is integrated throughout Kingswood Regional's curriculum and it's newly established electronics course will lead to student certification in the electronics field. 
   The teachers, parents, and students of this school hold a special place in my heart. My wife Mary Jo and I live in nearby Tuftonboro, and I taught history at Kingswood Regional High School. I have had the wonderful opportunity of meeting with both the students and faculty and have established strong and lasting friendships. This close relationship with the Kingswood has allowed me to witness the quality of education that is provided at this school. 
   As a former Kingswood Regional High School teacher and school board member. I know first hand that this school is truly deserving of this honor. Kingswood Regional High School is a testament to the tradition of molding students into successful adults. I wish to offer my most sincere congratulations and best wishes to Kingswood Regional High School. The school's achievements are truly remarkable.

    Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President I rise today to honor Arthur Nelson, of Goshen, New Hampshire, for his dedicated service to his town and the nation. 
   Arthur has been an important figure in the town of Goshen. His commitment to the community has not gone unnoticed. It is for this reason that he was chosen Honorary Parade Marshall in celebration of the founding of the Goshen Volunteer Fire Department. 
   In 1939, Arthur helped establish the Goshen Volunteer Fire Department. This was the beginning of Arthur's long and fulfilling career as a public servant to the town of Goshen. Since then he has served as fire warden for fifty years. During those years he had been known to strap on a backpack pump and search reported puffs of smoke. This intense devotion led him to successfully find, and extinguish, many wildfires. 
   In addition to service to the town of Goshen, Arthur has been an active participant in fire fighting in Sunapee, Croyden, Marlow and Grantham. His concern for the safety of his own community, and those of his neighbors, has brought Arthur a tremendous amount of respect from all who know him. All of these towns join Goshen in recognizing Arthur as a true hero. 
   Arthur's presence in the Goshen Volunteer Fire Department is not his only contribution to his community. He has been elected and served as a selectman, been a part of the Historical Society and served on the Conservation Commission. Arthur has also been an active member of the Goshen Community Church. Among all of his commitments, Arthur was also able to write a book in his spare time. Foundations of Old Goshen, published in 1980, in a history of the town he loves. 
   At age 91, Arthur can look back on a fulfilling life in the town of Goshen. His dedication to community service should be used as an example for others. I want to commend Arthur for his commitment to serving his town and country. it is an honor to represent him in the United States Senate.

Gary, along with individuals from each state across America, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, received the ``VITA Wireless Samaritan Award.'' 
   This award, which is awarded by the Cellular Telecommunications Industry Association (CTIA) is presented to honor the contributions heroic individuals make to their communities. Gary, who is an emergency medical technician (EMT), responded to a page to assist an injured mountain biker, who was too deep in the woods for an ambulance to reach. The biker, who had been stung by bees and was having a severe allergic reaction, was unable to make it out of the woods on her own, Gary went in the woods with his four-wheel drive vehicle, emergency medical equipment and his wireless phone. He and two other EMTs were able to stabilize the biker while maintaining contact with emergency dispatch and the ambulance that was waiting at the edge of the woods. Gary kept both dispatchers and ambulance attendants apprised of the victim's condition, enabling them to prepare to take over the rescue as soon as he got the woman out of the woods. 
   I commend Gary for his excellent reaction in a situation that called for immediate attention. He is a true hero. I am proud to represent him in the Senate.

    Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to honor Kate M. Riggs, of Hooksett, New Hampshire, for being selected as a 1999 Presidential Scholar by U.S. Secretary of Education. 
   Of the over 2.5 million graduating seniors nationwide, Kate is one of only 141 seniors to receive this distinction for academics. This impressive young woman is well-deserving of the title of Presidential Scholar. I wish to commend Kate for her outstanding achievement. 
   As a student at Manchester High School West in New Hampshire, Kate has served as a role model for her peers through her commitment to excellence. She will graduate as a co-valedictorian with a 3.9 grade point average. Kate's positive attitude has endeared her to both teachers and students. 
   Kate's determination promises to guide her in the future. She will attend Harvard University in the fall and will be faced with many new challenges. Kate is sure to tackle them with the vigor that has brought her success in the past. 
   It is certain that Kate will continue to excel in her future endeavors. I wish to offer my most sincere congratulations and best wishes to Kate. Her achievements are truly remarkable. It is an honor to represent her in the United States Senate.

    Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President I rise today to honor the Bedford Memorial School for being selected as the 1999 Top Elementary School of the Year by the Excellence in Education Committee. The ``Excellence in Education'' award is an annual program designed to identify one elementary, middle, and secondary school that is representative of the many outstanding schools in New Hampshire. 
   The Bedford Memorial School was chosen for this honor because of the dedication and commitment to education by its teachers, parents, and students. Its exemplary partnership with home and community and outstanding mentoring program for all staff has created an environment conductive to the development of young minds. 
   I admire this school's commitment to excellence. Over the last five years they have taken on challenging initiatives, participated in goals setting, created a community school council, and forged school-business partnerships. Student focus is also one of Bedford Memorial's strengths. The many co-curricular programs, an excellent special education department, and a gifted program are able to serve the students' individual needs. The school's success is epitomized in the school's motto ``The partnership of home, school, and community is essential to achieve our goal of academic excellence.'' 
   The teahers, parents, and students of this school hold a special place in my heart. Over the years, Mary Jo and I have visited the Bedford Memorial School many times, had the chance to meet both students and faculty, and have had the honor of teaching several classes there. This close involvement with the school has allowed me to witness, first-hand, the quality of education that is provided at this school. 
   The honor of being named Top Elementary School of the Year is a fitting end to an era for Bedford Memorial School. I am confident that as they take on additional grades and students, their school spirit will only continue to grow. 
   As a former teacher and school board member, I understand the tremendous impact teachers have on a child's life. The Bedford Memorial School is a testament to the tradition of molding students into successful adults. I wish to offer my most sincere congratulations and best wishes to the Bedford Memorial School. The school's achievements are truly remarkable. I feel honored to have had such a close relationship with the Bedford Memorial School and represent them in the United States Senate.

   Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, the resolution that I am submitting today provides that immediately following the prayer such as we just heard this morning by Chaplain Ogilvie, at the beginning of each daily session of the Senate, the Presiding Officer of the Senate would lead the Senate in the Pledge of Allegiance to the flag of the United States. 
   I am pleased and honored that the chairman of the Rules Committee, Senator MCCONNELL, as well as Senator FEINSTEIN, Senator HELMS, an Senator LOTT, have joined me as original cosponsors of this resolution. 
   The flag of the United States is our most revered and preeminent symbol, and the flag is recognized and respected throughout the world as a symbol of democracy, freedom, and human rights. As you know, the House of Representatives has such a flag salute in the morning at the beginning of each day. I think it is appropriate that the Senate follow suit. It is probably long overdue. 
   The Chief Justice of the United States, William Rehnquist, has written that the flag of the United States of America ``in times of national crisis, inspires and motivates the average citizen to make personal sacrifices in order to achieve societal goals of overriding importance ..... and serves as a reminder of the paramount importance of pursuing the ideals that characterize our society.'' 
   Many Americans, including my father, have given their lives to protect freedom and democracy as symbolized by this flag. Our family was presented with a flag at the burial, as so many other families of veterans have also experienced. It means a great deal, and I think it is appropriate that we salute the flag every morning to start our business. 
   Since 1988, as I said, the House of Representatives has demonstrated its reverence and respect for the flag, and all of the ideals for which it stands, by opening its morning session with the Pledge of Allegiance. 
   I wish to give credit to a constituent of mine. I would like to take credit for the idea--perhaps I should have thought of it--but it came from Rebecca Stewart of Enfield, NH, who recently contacted my office and suggested that the Senate should do what the House does--open each session with the Pledge of Allegiance. I thought that was a great idea and contacted several members of the Senate Rules Committee to get a sense of the level of support on that committee for the idea, and I was pleased and delighted by the response from Rules. 
   The result then is the resolution I am submitting today. I might also in conclusion point out that Monday, June 14, is Flag Day. It would be a great tribute if we could get this resolution to the floor and pass it sometime on or before Monday, June 14. We do have time this week to do that. It is my hope we can move this legislation out of Rules quickly and bring it to the floor. I understand Senator MCCONNELL will be in the Chamber to speak on this matter very shortly. 
   Mr. President, I trust that the Senate will see fit to promptly adopt this resolution. I hope that it will receive the unanimous support of my colleagues in the Senate.

    Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Loon Mountain Recreation Corporation of Lincoln, New Hampshire for their outstanding achievements in the environmental arena. This month. Loon Mountain will receive the Times Mirror Company's Silver Eagle Award for Environmental Excellence in Visual Impact. 
   Loon Mountain will be receiving this award due to the recent installation of a new snowmaking pump station. The resort's two objectives in the design of this station were to reduce the visual impact of the pump station to the surrounding community and minimize the impact of the new water withdrawal system on the adjacent river. 
   Through careful site planning and creative architectural design, the pump station blends in naturally with its surroundings. The techniques employed during construction were environmentally sound and the withdrawal system does not disturb the river environment. 
   As a senior member of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, I realize the impact that industrial design can have on the environment, and I am excited to see businesses such as Loon Mountain working hard to minimize these impacts. I commend the Loon Mountain Recreation Corporation for their environmental awareness, and I am proud to represent them in the U.S. Senate.

   Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise to introduce two resolutions concerning our trade relationships with the People's Republic of China and the Socialist Republic of Vietnam. Last Thursday, June 3, 1999, the President of the United States formally recommended waivers of the application of the Trade Act of 1974 provisions with respect to China and Vietnam, thereby allowing U.S. taxdollars to subsidize business operations in these countries. In the case of China, the waiver also allows for continuation of most-favored-nation trade privileges, now known as normal trade relations. Mr. President, there's very little that is normal about our relationship with these communist countries. In short, I think the President's policy is seriously flawed and deeply troubling, especially in view of recent events. 
   Mr. President, on November 26, 1974, in its report on the Trade Act, the Senate Committee on Finance stated: ``The Committee recognizes that segments of the private sector wish the U.S. Government to provide credits and investment guarantees, and other conditions before private capital investments are ventured. The Committee believes that it is equally reasonable to establish conditions on all basic human rights, including the right to emigrate, before extending broad concessions to communist countries.'' The resolutions I have introduced keep faith with the original Congressional intent of the Trade Act of 1974. One need only read the annual State Department Human Rights Reports on China and Vietnam to recognize that they have failed to meet any recognized standards with respect to human rights. Moreover, there are a myriad of other national security and foreign policy issues concerning our current relationship with Beijing and Hanoi--from wholesale espionage of our nuclear secrets to POW/MIA accounting--which warrant support for my resolutions. We should not be putting profit over principle. These waivers from the President should be overturned by the Congress, using the procedures provided for by law. Thank you, Mr. President.

   Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise to support the amendment of the Senator from Mississippi. This amendment deserves the support of every Senator because it is the right thing to do. 
   During World War II more than 10,000 Americans served their country on LCS ships, and these ships were heavily involved in combat in the Pacific. There is only one LCS left in the world, and a group of World War II sailors wants to bring that ship back to the United States and make it a floating museum. 
   Three years ago, I sponsored an amendment to the Defense authorization bill urging the Secretary of Defense to seek the expeditious return of the LCS 102 from Thailand. That amendment passed the Congress and became part of Public Law 104-201. 
   For three years not much has happened because the Thai Navy still needed the LCS 102, even though it is now more than 55 years old. Thai officials have indicated that they would be prepared to return the LCS 102 to the United States if we could provide a suitable ship to take its place. The U.S. Navy is planning to retire just such a ship this year, and that is what this amendment is about. 
   The ranks of those World War II sailors is thinning each year, and there is a need to move expeditiously. We need to bring this historic ship home before all of our World War II veterans are gone. 
   Let me list briefly some facts about LCS ships and their service to our country. 
   These ships were born out of desperate need. In the early years of World War II, our Navy and Marine Corps discovered that they needed more close-in gunfire support to protect our troops as they went ashore in amphibious landings. With typical American ingenuity, a new small gunboat was designed and quickly moved into production. The result was the LCS(L) which stood for Landing Craft Support Ship (Large). 
   This newly designed ship had more firepower per ton than a battleship, and it was capable of going all the way in to the beach and providing close-in fire support for our troops going ashore. 
   One hundred and thirty of these ships were built and rushed into service in 1944 and 1945. These ships and their brave crews helped save the lives of countless soldiers and Marines by providing heavy close-in firepower to support amphibious landings at Okinawa, Iwo Jima, and many other Pacific Islands. Twenty-six of these ships were sunk or badly damaged in the Pacific campaign. 
   These ships were nicknamed the ``Mighty Midgets'' because of their firepower and their service in World War II. These ships, like so many others, received little notice when the history books were written because Carriers, Battleships, and Cruisers took most of the glory. However, the sailors aboard LCSs served bravely and well, and their part of World War II needs to be preserved as a part of our Navy's history. 
   LCS sailors received many decorations for their service during World War II. A young Lieutenant by the name of Richard McCool from Washington State received the Congressional Medal of Honor from President Truman for his service at Okinawa. A young Lieutenant by the name of John F. Lehman received a bronze star for his service at Okinawa, as well. His son, John, Jr. served as a naval officer many years later and became Secretary of the Navy under President Reagan. 
   Since the mid-1990s, several books have been published covering the history of the LCS ships. Former Secretary of the Navy John F. Lehman, Jr. wrote the foreword to one of those books. This foreword provides eloquent summary of the service to our Nation provided by LCSs and their brave sailors. 
   Finally, Mr. President, a distinguished former Senator who served as Chairman of the Armed Services Committee in this body served ably as a Boatswain's Mate on an LCS during World War II. John Tower served his nation in World War II on an LCS. 
   This body needs to honor his service and that of all the LCS sailors by helping to save the LCS 102--the only one left in the world. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this amendment and to do what they can to help in the task of bringing this ship home to the United States to serve as a museum and a memorial to the valiant service of thousands of LCS sailors.

   Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I want to thank the managers of this bill for accepting this amendment, and I thank all of my colleagues for their support. 
   Let me say this is a very simple amendment, but one that becomes profoundly relevant as we approach Memorial Day next Monday, especially for the families of unaccounted for servicemen from World War II. 
   The amendment instructs the Secretary of the Army to make every reasonable effort to search for, recover, and identify the remains of U.S. servicemen from World War II crashsites in the South Pacific. As many of my colleagues know, the Army is DoD's executive agent for this kind of recovery work. 
   Mr. President, earlier this month I attended a military funeral for a World War II Army Air Corps pilot from Worcester, Massachusetts. I can't begin to tell you how moved I was to attend this funeral and listen to the eulogy about this young pilot, who joined the Army the day after Pearl Harbor, went on to get his wings in the Army Air Corps, married his sweetheart, only to have to leave her two days later. He was never to come home. He was lost over the jungles of New Guinea flying his P-47 Thunderbolt in 1943. 
   Fifty-three years later, in 1996, his remains inside his crashed plane were accidently located by a private American citizen, Mr. Fred Hagen, who was searching for his great uncle's B-25 bomber. 
   Only then, did the emotional rollercoaster ride for the surviving elderly family members really begin because it took almost 3 additional years, and my continuous intervention along the way, for the remains to be formally recovered and identified by the Army. There was political instability in New Guinea at one point, and that delayed things, and there were also competing priorities that the Army was trying to balance. 
   That case is now behind us, but I am aware that there are other World War II crashsites in New Guinea where the remains of American servicemen are presently located, yet they have not been formally recovered by the Army. Indeed, Mr. President, I would like to enclose for the record a letter I received yesterday from one American who has located several crash sites in New Guinea. 
   All this amendment does, Mr. President, is ensure that the Army works hard at locating, excavating, and identifying remains from these crash sites. By passing this amendment, we increase the likelihood that some of these families of missing World War II aviators will finally have a grave at which to lay flowers during a future Memorial Day. It's the least we can do, Mr. President, to honor those who made the ultimate sacrifice, and their aging family members. 
   Accounting for missing servicemen from World War II is just as important as accounting for missing servicemen from the Vietnam or Korean Wars. Each of these brave men made the ultimate sacrifice for their country. This amendment makes sure every effort is made to account for these missing servicemen.

   Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to express my strong support for S. 1059, the National Defense Authorization Bill for Fiscal Year 2000. As Chairman of the Strategic Subcommittee, I want to briefly summarize the Strategic Subcommittee portion of the Armed Services Committee markup and the philosophy that it is based on. As in the past, the Strategic Subcommittee has reviewed the adequacy of programs and policies in five key areas: (1) ballistic and cruise missile defense; (2) national security space programs; (3) strategic nuclear delivery systems; (4) military intelligence; and (5) Department of Energy activities regarding the nuclear weapons stockpile, nuclear waste cleanup, and other defense activities. 
   This year, the subcommittee's review included two field hearings--one at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory on DOE weapons programs, and one at U.S. Space Command in Colorado Springs on U.S. national security space programs. In addition, the subcommittee visited the U.S. Army Space and Missile Defense Command in Huntsville Alabama, Barksdale Air Force Base in Louisiana, the Capistrano High Energy Laser Test facility in California, Beale Air Force Base in California, and a variety of military facilities in the Denver and Colorado Springs area. These visits greatly enhanced my understanding of the issues under the subcommittee's jurisdiction and significantly influenced the bill before us today. 
   The Strategic Subcommittee recommended funding increases for critical programs under the subcommittee's jurisdiction by approximately $850 million, including an increase of $500 million for Ballistic Missile Defense programs, $220 million for national security space programs, $110 million for strategic forces, and $50 million for military intelligence. 
   The Strategic Subcommittee also supported the full amount requested by the Department of Energy with the exception of the Formerly Utilized Sites Remedial Action Program. Let me highlight the key funding and legislative issues. 
   In the area of missile defense the Strategic Subcommittee included the following funding: An increase of $120 million to accelerate the Navy Upper Tier program and provide for continued development of advanced radar concepts. An increase of $212 million to fix the Patriot PAC-3 funding shortfall so the program can begin production during fiscal year 2000. An increase of $60 million to begin production of the Patriot Anti-Cruise missile program, which will provide an upgraded seeker for older Patriot missiles. 
   In the area of space programs and technologies, the Strategic Subcommittee included the following funding: An increase of $92 million, which the Administration requested, to fully fund the revised Space Based Infrared System (High) program. An increase of $111 million for advanced space technology development, including funds for space control technology, micro-satellite technology, and space maneuver vehicle development. 
   In the area of strategic nuclear delivery systems, the Strategic Subcommittee included the following funding: An increase of $40 million for the Minuteman III Guidance Replacement Program to put the program on a more efficient production schedule. An increase of $52.4 million for bomber upgrades based on the Air Force's unfunded priorities list, including funding for the B-2 Link-16 program and B-52 radar upgrades. 
   In the area of military intelligence programs the Strategic Subcommittee included a number of funding increases, including an increase of $25 million for U-2 cockpit and defensive system upgrades. I would note that the Strategic Subcommittee toured the U-2 base at Beale Air Force base and witnessed first hand the serious deficiencies associated with the U-2. 
   In the area of DOD legislative provisions, the Strategic Subcommittee included the following: A provision addressing DOD's proposed TMD Upper Tier strategy, which reverses DOD's decision to compete Navy Upper Tier and THAAD. A provision establishing a commission to assess U.S. national security space organization and management, which is modeled after the Rumsfeld Commission. 
   A provision limiting the Retirement of strategic nuclear delivery systems, which extends last year's law on this matter, but also allows the Navy to retire 4 older Trident submarines while modernizing the remaining fleet to carry the D-5 missile. A provision regarding the Airborne Laser program, which requires a number of tests, certifications, and acquisition strategy modifications before the program can move into successive phases of its development. A provision regarding the Space Based Laser program, which requires near-term focus on an Integrated Flight Experiment. 
   In the Department of Energy section of the markup, the Strategic Subcommittee provided the full amount of the Administration's request with the exception of the Formerly Utilized Sites Remedial Action Program. I took great pains to examine the budget request and eliminate those funding items that do not support organizational mission requirements. In the weapons program, my goal was to ensure DOE has a well planned and funded stockpile life extension program that is capable to remanufacturing and certifying every warhead in the enduring U.S. nuclear stockpile. My goal in the cleanup program was to maintain the pace of clean-up at DOE facilities and continue to press for earlier deployment of innovative technologies to lower out-year costs.  
   The Strategic Subcommittee included the following recommendations regarding DOE funding: An increase of $55 million for the four traditional weapons production plants. An increase of $15 million for the tritium production program. A reduction of $30.0 million to the Advanced Strategic Computing Initiative. An increase of $35 million to support security and counter-intelligence activities. An increase of $17 million to increase security investigations in support of security clearances at DOE. 
   In the area of DOE legislative provisions, the Strategic Subcommittee included the following: A substantial package of legislation dealing with security and counter-intelligence at DOE. A provision regarding tritium production, which would require DOE to implement the Secretary's tritium production decision. 
   Mr. President, in closing let me reiterate my strong support for S. 1059. This is a good bill that deserves strong bipartisan support.

   Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Davis-Bacon Repeal Act of 1999. This legislation would repeal the Davis-Bacon Act of 1931, which guarantees high wages for workers on Federal construction projects, and the Copeland Act, which imposes weekly payroll reporting requirements. 
   Davis-Bacon requires contractors on Federal construction projects costing over $2,000 to pay their workers no less than the ``prevailing wage'' for comparable work in their local area. The U.S. Department of Labor has the final say on what the term ``prevailing wage'' means, but the prevailing wage usually is based on union-negotiated wages. 
   My bill would allow free market forces, rather than bureaucrats at the Labor Department in Washington, DC., to determine the amount of construction wages. There is simply no need to have the Labor Department dictating wage rates for workers on Federal construction projects in every locality in the United States. 
   The Department of Labor's Office of the Inspector General recently issues a devastating report showing that inaccurate information had been used in Davis-Bacon wage determinations in several states. The errors caused wages or fringe benefits to be overstated by as much as $1.00 per hour, in some cases. If Davis-Bacon were repealed, American taxpayers would save more than $3 billion over a 5-year period, according to the Congressional Budget Office. 
   Davis-Bacon also stifles competition in Federal bidding for construction projects, especially with respect to small businesses. Small construction companies are not knowledgeable about Federal contracting procedures; and they simply cannot afford to hire the staff needed to comply with Davis-Bacon's complex work rules and reporting requirements. 
   Congress passed Davis-Bacon during the Great Depression, a period in which work was scarce. In those days, construction workers were willing to take what jobs they could find, regardless of the wage rate; most construction was publicly financed; and there were no other Federal worker protections on the books. 
   Conditions in the construction industry have changed a lot since then, however. Today, unemployment rates are low, and public works construction makes up only about 20 percent of the construction industry's activity. Also, we now have many Federal laws on the books to protect workers. Such laws include the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, which imposes a general minimum wage, the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, the Miller Act of 1935, the Contract Work House and Safety Standards Act of 1962, and the Social Security Act. 
   Yet the construction industry still has to operate under Davis-Bacon's inflexible 1930s work requirements and play by its payroll reporting rules. Under the law's craft-by-craft requirements, for example, contractors must pay Davis-Bacon wages for individuals who 
   perform a given craft's work. In many cases, that means a contractor either must pay a high wage to an unskilled worker for performing menial tasks, or he must pay a high wage to an experienced worker for these menial tasks. These requirements reduce productivity. 
   A related problem with Davis-Bacon is that it reduces entry-level jobs and training opportunities for the disadvantaged. Because the law makes it costly for contractors to hire lower-skilled workers on construction projects, the statute creates a disincentive to hire entry-level workers and provide on-the-job training. 
   The Congressional Budget Office raised this issue in its analysis, ``Modifying the Davis-Bacon Act: Implications for the Labor Market and the Federal Budget.'' As stated in that 1983 study:  
   Although the effect of Davis-Bacon on wages receives the most attention, the Act's largest potential cost impact may derive from its effect on the use of labor. For one thing, DOL wage determinations require that, if an employee does the work of a particular craft, the wage paid should be for the craft. 
   For example, carpentry work must be paid for at carpenters' wages, even if performed by a general laborer, helper or member of another craft.  
   Moreover, the General Accounting Office has maintained that the Davis-Bacon Act is no longer needed. GAO began to openly question Davis-Bacon in the 1960s; and in 1979, it issued a report calling for the Act's repeal. Titled ``The Davis-Bacon Act Should Be Repealed,'' the report states: ``[o]ther wage legislation and changes in economic conditions and in the construction industry since the law was passed make the law obsolete; and the law is inflationary.'' 
   To those who remain unconvinced that Davis-Bacon is bad public policy, I urge a review of the Act's legislative history. Some early supporters of Davis-Bacon advocated its passage as a means to discriminate against minorities. For instance, Clayton Allgood, a member of the 71st Congress, argued on the House floor that Davis-Bacon would keep contractors from employing ``cheap colored labor'' on construction projects. As stated by Congressman Allgood on February 28, 1931, ``it is labor of that sort that is in competition with white labor throughout the country.'' Unfortunately, Davis-Bacon still has the effect of keeping minority-owned construction firms from competing for Federal construction contract, because many such firms are small businesses. 
   Early supporters of Davis-Bacon also believed that the law would prevent outside contractors from undermining local firms in the Federal bidding process. In practice, however, Davis-Bacon wages hurt local businesses and make it more likely that outside contractors will win bids for Federal projects.  
   Mr. President, for all of the above reasons, I believe that the Davis-Bacon Act should be repealed. I urge my colleagues to support the Davis-Bacon Repeal Act of 1999.

   Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I thank my colleague. I indicated I am more than happy to have the Senator from Nebraska finish his remarks, but if he chooses to have me proceed now, I will be happy to do that. 
   Section 1041 of this bill, which is in question here in the amendment of Senator KERREY, does prohibit the retirement of certain strategic delivery systems unless START II enters into force. The amendment by the Senator from Nebraska just strikes that entire section, section 1041. 
   For the last several years, the Defense Authorization Act has included a provision limiting the retirement of strategic delivery systems. Recently, it has specifically prohibited reductions below 18 Trident submarines, 500 Minuteman III ICBMs, 50 Peacekeeper ICBMs, and 71 B-52s. This year the provision has been modified to allow the Navy to reduce the number of Trident submarines from 18 to 14. This change was made after close consultation with U.S. Strategic Command, the Navy, and the Office of the Secretary of Defense. On April 14, 1999, the Strategic Subcommittee conducted a hearing on this matter. We did agree to reduce the number of Tridents from 18 to 14, with my support. 
   The overall intent of the provision is to send a signal to Russia, that if they want the benefits of START II, then they ought to ratify the treaty. I think this is where I part ways, respectfully, with my colleague. This really is a unilateral implementation of START II--or to make even deeper reductions that would fundamentally undermine the arms control process and our national security. 
   I believe I am correct, the Senator supported START II. If he is going to make unilateral reductions as part of our policy, I do not think it leaves much incentive for the Russian side to do what they have to do to get to START II.  
   But section 1041 is a very flexible provision. Since it must be renewed each year, there is ample opportunity to take into consideration proposals by the administration and to make our force structure adjustments as necessary. 
   This was demonstrated this year in the way the Armed Services Committee responded to the Navy's proposal, which was to retire four of the oldest Trident submarines. 
   With all due respect, the adoption of the Senator's amendment I believe could be interpreted as a sign that Congress no longer supports the policy of remaining at START I levels until START II enters into force. It seems to me the Senator is advocating that explicitly, but I could be wrong. I note that the administration does not support such a change in policy and, indeed, the administration's budget request fully funds the forces at the levels specified in the section in question that the Senator wishes to strike, section 1041. 
   The provision does not preclude the administration from making any changes in U.S. force structure that it is currently planning to make. Section 1041 does not require the administration to retain any strategic delivery system that it otherwise would retire. It is clear that the principal objective of this amendment is to encourage unilateral arms reductions outside the framework of existing arms control agreements. 
   My concern is this is a very dramatic departure from existing U.S. policy. Essentially, this approach would amount to an abandonment of, or certainly a significant deviation from, the formal arms control process. 
   I may support a change in U.S. policy that would base our strategic force posture on a unilateral definition of U.S. military requirements rather than on the arms control framework, but I believe that as long as formal arms control agreements govern our force posture, we ought to adhere to a policy of not unilaterally implementing such agreements. 
   Also, just as a bit of a side discussion here, the issue of what has happened now with China may also sound an alarm bell that these agreements with the Russians--were the Soviets, now the Russians--may not be the major issue before us if things keep going. 
   One has to remember that an agreement, START I, START II agreements with the then Soviets, now Russians, for arms control reductions between two countries in a bilateral world, could very well now expand to something beyond just the bilateral agreements with the Russians to the Chinese and perhaps to Syria and Libya and even Iran, or some other nice countries out there that are now, thanks to the Chinese, going to be receiving a lot of our secrets, if you will, nuclear weapons. That furthers the case for not unilaterally reducing these systems without the Russians agreeing first. 
   I therefore urge my colleagues to oppose the Kerrey amendment. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, during the markup of the defense authorization bill in committee, we twice rejected base closure amendments. So it does seem anticlimatic to be out here on the floor again for the very same proposal. But such is the way of the Senate sometimes. 
   Senators MCCAIN and LEVIN did offer an amendment to have two rounds of base closures in 2001 and 2003. The process was adjusted to ensure that the next incoming President would appoint the commissioners. Everything else was identical to the amendment now being offered, and the amendment was defeated by a vote of 12-8, with members on both sides of the aisle voting one way or the other. Then Senators LEVIN and MCCAIN offered another amendment that called for only one round of base closures in 2001. 
   The House version of the Fiscal Year 2000 Defense Authorization bill is silent on base closures. Opposition to base closure in the House is much stronger than it is in the Senate, and the Membership has let it be known that they will oppose any base closure legislation in conference, even though the administration 
   proposes these two rounds in 2001 and 2005. We are in a debate on the floor taking a lot of the Senate's time on a proposal that probably lacks the support in both the House and the Senate to get this to the President's desk. 
   There have been a lot of arguments made on both sides. Let me offer a few of my own. 
   During previous rounds, the Department had the opportunity to reduce the infrastructure to the extent that it believed necessary. That was the purpose of the previous rounds. The bottom line is that the Department failed to do that. 
   When first announced, the 1995 BRAC round was proclaimed to be ``the mother of all BRACs.'' But the outcome was just a whimper; it was a little daughter rather than a mother. 
   Any purported savings of another round of these closures would not be available in the near-to-medium term for the procurement of equipment and weapons modernization or any other purpose. That is really what we care about. We want money for new equipment. We want money for readiness and modernization. 
   The bottom line, as most of my colleagues know, is that it is going to cost us in the immediate future money that we desperately need right now for readiness. No one disputes that if you close down infrastructure, in the long run it is going to save money. That is obvious. But it is going to cost us somewhere in the vicinity of $3.2 billion right up front to begin the closing, with the environmental issues and all the changes that have to be made: the upfront cost transfer of units and equipment, new facilities at receiving installations, buyouts of civilian employees and environmental cleanup. If we do not have the dollars now to do what we need to modernize our troops, to get the equipment they need, to get them up to the readiness level at which they should be--how will we be able to pay these initial costs? 
   Arguments that have been made, rightfully so, by Senator INHOFE and others, concerning the politicization of the last BRAC process. We all know that the administration seriously damaged the base closure process by its handling of the Commission's 1995 recommendations concerning McClellan Air Force Base in California and Kelly Air Force Base in Texas. We need to let these issues settled. There are a lot of hard feelings left over from that. We need to fully resolve these issues before we attempt another round. 
   BRAC should be focused on excess capacity, but it should not be an excessively broad approach. We ought to target any future BRAC legislation--we do not want every single installation in America to be in BRAC purgatory. I believe the Senator from Kansas, who is in the Chair now, has used that term. And that is what happens. Everybody gets put in this purgatory and everybody has to hire all these consultants and experts to try to get out of purgatory and hopefully not go to Hell, but hopefully wind up in Heaven, with their base preserved. 
   As the number of worldwide commitments increases for the Armed Forces, we should be considering increasing the size of the Armed Forces. We can make a very compelling case for that. I am willing to make it. Further base closures could preclude that eventuality. What we lose, we never get back. For example, if we close a shipyard, imagine how much time and effort and money we would have to expend, and how many environmental hoops we would have to jump through to open another shipyard after it has been developed into condominiums along the harbor somewhere. We will never be able to do it. Once it is gone, it is gone. We need to understand that. 
   I think we have to look at it and ask ourselves this basic question: Is it now the time to reduce further our infrastructure for the purpose of some long-term savings that are going to cost us in the short term when there is all this uncertainty out there? 
   The Senator from Michigan very eloquently, in his statement, talked about the percentage argument--that force structure has gone down 36 percent, personnel has gone down 40 percent, and base closings are only down 18 percent. That sounds like a fair argument, and it sounds like you ought to be able to put it all together, and there ought to be an even 36 or 40 percent cut in all areas. But that is not the case. 
   If you use an analogy of a football team, your team may be half the size it used to be, but you still have to have a stadium to play in. So you can reduce helmets and you can reduce personnel  and you can reduce support, bandages, or whatever you need for the players, but you still have to have a stadium. 
   So I do not think you can break it down that simply. It does not matter whether you have a good team or a bad team, or whether you have 75 players as backup or 12 players as backup, you still need a stadium, you still need to have a certain amount of infrastructure to run the team. 
   So I say this is very ill-advised. We do not know where we are going. I personally believe that right now, the way things are going in the world, we are going to have to increase, not decrease, our personnel, increase, not decrease, our forces, and if we are going to do all that, we are going to have to have the infrastructure to support it. 
   So I hope this amendment will be defeated for those reasons alone, not to mention the anguish the communities would have to go through. 
   I think it is important to understand that the President of the United States is calling up reserves right now, in great numbers, to be deployed, Lord knows where--perhaps Bosnia, perhaps Kosovo; we do not know just where. We do not know what other crisis may break out. 
   I just think it is a terrible time to think about taking down infrastructure. What message does that send to the troops out there and to the people who support those troops all across the country in the bases and the infrastructure around those bases? What message does it send to those people if we say, in spite of all of this increase in activity around the world, we are now still going to eliminate more infrastructure, not knowing what we need for the next crisis? 
   We can eliminate it at some point, if it is necessary. We are not saving that much now to do it. As a matter of fact, even in the short term it is costing us. So there is no rush here. I think we ought to just settle down, take a careful look at what we are doing, reevaluate our entire military structure--and in my view, increase the size of our forces--and not rush to judgment here with some additional base closings. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, here we go again with the same amendment that comes up every year. The vote is always close. There are a lot of very strong feelings on both sides. 
   Again, as I have in the past, I rise in opposition to this amendment--this time the Murray-Snowe amendment--  which would allow U.S. military facilities to be used for the performance of abortions on demand. 
   Under current law, no funds may be made available to the Department of Defense for the performance of abortions. The amendment now before the Senate is completely inconsistent with the Hyde amendment, which has been existing law for 20 years. Under the Hyde amendment, no taxpayer dollars may be used to pay for abortions. 
   The issue here is whether or not you want to basically throw out the Hyde amendment and say that Members are willing to have taxpayer dollars used to pay for abortions in military hospitals. The Hyde amendment recognizes that millions of American taxpayers believe that abortion is the taking of an innocent life, an unborn human being. Those Members, myself included, who proudly call ourselves pro-life should not be forced to pay for a procedure with our tax money that violates our fundamental and deeply held belief in the sanctity of innocent human life. That is the issue here. 
   In the 1980 case of Harris versus McRae, the Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the Hyde amendment. The Court determined that there is no constitutional right to a taxpayer-funded abortion, no matter how we feel on the issue otherwise--no constitutional right, according to the Harris versus McRae decision in 1980. 
   Current law with respect to abortions at military facilities, then, is fully consistent with the Hyde amendment. This amendment by the Senator from Washington will overturn existing law. The proponents of this amendment, which would overturn current law and allow abortion on demand at military facilities, claim that their proposal is somehow consistent with Hyde. It is not. They say this because, under their proposal, servicewomen seeking these abortions would pay for them. That is true. 
   This argument, however, evinces a fundamental misunderstanding of the nature of military medical facilities. Military clinics and military hospitals, unlike private clinics and private hospitals, receive not 10, not 20, not 30, not 90, but 100 percent of their funding from the taxpayers of the United States. A woman cannot go into a military hospital and use those facilities without the taxpayers paying for the facility she is using to have that abortion. The clinics, the hospitals, the doctors, the equipment--all of it is paid for by the U.S. taxpayer. 
   Physicians who practice in those clinics and hospitals, government employees whose salaries and bills are paid by the taxpayers, all of it, all of the operational and administrative expenses associated with the practice of military medicine are paid for by the taxpayers of the United States. 
   Furthermore, equipment that would be used at these facilities to perform the abortions, equipment that we abhor--those of us who are pro-life, who find it repulsive and reprehensible, and I won't go into the details about what happens with the equipment that is used on these innocent children--that equipment will be purchased by taxpayer 
   dollars. It will be purchased by dollars that I pay in taxes and that many of my millions of friends around the Nation who oppose abortion, their dollars will be used to pay for this. 
   The Supreme Court of the United States has said that that is wrong and they ruled in the McRae case that it should not be done. In short, it is simply impossible to allow the performance of abortions at military facilities, even if the procedure itself is paid for by the servicewoman involved, without having the taxpayers forced to subsidize it. You can't have it. 
   The only way to protect the integrity of the taxpayer's dollars is to keep the military out of the business of abortion. We could go on and on, on just that issue. Just what business should the military be in? The military has gotten into a lot of things lately under this administration that don't belong in the realm of the military, but do we have to now go to the taking of the lives of unborn children and use the military to now do that? Do we have to really do that? Isn't it bad enough that we have to see throughout America since the illustrious Roe versus Wade decision in 1973--I ask everyone to reflect for a moment on what has happened since that decision. 
   In 1973, Roe versus Wade was passed. Since that date, 35 million babies, that we know of, have been aborted. Let's define abortion: The taking of the life of an unborn child. Thirty-five million. If you look at the statistics of how many girls are born and how many boys are born, that probably translates into about 18 million young girls who would now be as old as 30 years, perhaps, depending on when the abortion might have been performed. How many of those 18 million young women may have had the opportunity to serve in the U.S. military? They don't get that chance because our country, our Nation, supported a Supreme Court decision that said they didn't have a chance to ever have the opportunity to serve in the military, never have the opportunity to be a mother, never to have the opportunity to be a daughter, never to have the opportunity to live their dreams, to enjoy the liberties of the United States of America--never to have that opportunity. Never to have the opportunity to fight for the freedom of the United States as a member of the military because they were aborted--they were killed in the womb. 
   This Nation, through this Supreme Court decision, allowed it to happen. That is beyond the dignity, to put it mildly, of a great nation. We let it happen. 
   It is bad enough that happened, but now we have to go one step further with the amendment of the Senator from Washington and say that the taxpayers have to fund it. 
   Mr. President, I wish everyone who will vote on this amendment in the next hour or so had had the opportunity I have had to personally meet a young woman who is now in her midtwenties. She could not serve in the military because she was not physically able to serve in the military. Let me tell you why she could not serve in the military. She was aborted, and she lived, and she is crippled. So she cannot serve in the military. I have met this young woman, as many have. There are many like her, but I use her as an example, Gianna Jessen. Who knows, maybe Gianna would have liked to have been a woman in the military, but she cannot. 
   Why do we not wake up in America and understand what we are doing? Should we really be surprised when our children do some of the things they do in this country? Why should we be surprised? What is the underlying message? And this amendment sends the same message. 
   The underlying message is: Go to school today, Johnny. Go to school today, Mary. You be good kids. You do the right thing. And meanwhile, while you are at school, we will abort your brother or your sister. 
   That is the message we are giving to our kids. That is the message this amendment is giving to our kids. That is the message this amendment is giving to all Americans--that now we are going to say the taxpayers can support this kind of thing. 
   I wish the Senator from Washington would come down here on the floor with an amendment that might say we could provide a little help, a little counseling, a little love, a little compassion, a little understanding to this woman who wants this abortion, and explain to her the beauty of life and explain to her what a great opportunity it would be for her to have that child and to have that child grow up into a world where that child could be loved and could be understood and could have the opportunity to perhaps follow her mother's ambitions and serve in the U.S. military or perhaps to follow in her mother's wake and be a mother herself, to enjoy the fruits of the greatest nation in the world. 
   Let's not agree to this amendment and violate the spirit of the Hyde amendment and violate more unborn children, intrude into the womb, take the lives of unborn children. 
   When are we going to wake up? Would it not be wonderful to come down on the floor of the Senate just one year when we did not have to deal with this, when people would respect life and we would be offering amendments to protect life rather than to take it. That is an America I am dreaming of, Mr. President. That is an America I would like to see in the 21st century, not an America of death but an America of life, where we respect life. 
   Allowing abortion on demand in military facilities would violate the moral  and religious convictions of millions and millions and millions, tens of millions, of Americans who believe, through their own religious convictions, or in any other way, as I do, that the unborn child has a fundamental right to life, a right to life that comes from the Declaration of Independence, from the Constitution, and from God Himself. Yes, from God Himself. That is where it comes from, and we do not have the right to take it. 
   For the sake of one or two votes on the floor of the Senate, in a very few minutes we are going to make that decision. Whichever way it goes, we are going to find out how many more children have to die. How many more children have to 
   die? 
   When are we going to wake up, America? How much more of this do we have to take? Why are you surprised when your children do something wrong? What kind of message do we send? 
   This amendment is not about the so-called right to choose abortion that the Supreme Court created in 1993. I disagree with Roe v. Wade. Everybody knows that. I just said it. I introduced a bill, S. 907, that would reverse Roe v. Wade, establishing that the right to life comes with conception and protecting that life. I dream of the America of the future when we will respect it. 
   But, as I said, this amendment is not about the larger issue of abortion; it is about taxpayer funding of abortion. Millions and millions of pro-life Americans, who believe to the very core of our being that abortion is the taking of an innocent life, should not be forced to pay for abortions, not directly, not indirectly, not any way you can define it, with taxpayer dollars. 
   I urge my colleagues, no matter what their personal views are, to reject this amendment, to vote to preserve current law, to vote to protect and be consistent with the Hyde amendment. Let's get the military involved in protecting America and not taking innocent children's lives. 
   I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Oklahoma.

   Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I just want to respond to one point that was made on the other side regarding the payback, if you will, the fact that the woman agrees to pay out of her own pocket, therefore, I would assume the issue is that she would reimburse the Government. 
   But I would ask one to consider the accounting nightmare that would ensue as we try to figure out--we had a doctor paid for by the taxpayers, a clinic, a hospital paid for by the taxpayers, equipment paid for by the taxpayers, and supplies and special equipment involving abortions--how one would allocate all of this? 
   We would have to figure out, how many abortions were done and how all the allocations would be done. It simply is not workable. It would not work. The bottom line, as I have been indicating, is that the taxpayers would be subsidizing abortions in military hospitals. I think everyone understands that. I do not think there should be any confusion on that, that those who do not support abortion would be subsidizing abortions. 
   I just want to review, in closing, the current law. Just to summarize, no funds made available to DOD are used for abortions. Under current law, military facilities are prohibited, in most cases, in the performance of abortions. So the amendment now before the Senate is inconsistent with the Hyde amendment, which has been in existence for over 20 years, that taxpayer dollars may not be used to pay for abortions. 
   Current law, with respect to abortions at military facilities, is fully consistent with the Hyde amendment. The proponents of this amendment, which would overturn current law and allow abortion on demand, claim that their proposal is somehow consistent. As I said before, it is not. Under their proposal, women seeking abortions would pay for them, but this evinces a fundamental misunderstanding of the nature of military medical facilities, which I pointed out. 
   In conclusion, I say that it is just simply unfair, and it has been so ruled by the Supreme Court, that people, who, because of their own values and beliefs and principles, do not believe in abortion, that they should have to subsidize it with their tax dollars or pay for it with their tax dollars. That is the issue. 
   We have had a vote on this issue many years in the past. I hope people will see the light to see that this is wrong and basically unfair, and that we would respect the innocence of human life, and perhaps encourage the young woman in trouble to talk to a chaplain. There are military chaplains out there, and some darn good ones, who are available to counsel young women in need. 
   I would certainly be very excited to hear that some of these women went to the chaplain because this law didn't get changed and perhaps chose life over abortion. 
   At this point, I yield the floor, Mr. President.

   At this point, I move to table the Murray amendment and ask for the yeas and nays.

   Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. My concern is the tabling motion. As the Senator knows, this issue is on the calendar now as a separate issue. My purpose in bringing it up on this bill: There are a lot of Senators on both sides of the aisle who support it. My assumption is there may be enough, but I haven't done a whip count. 
   My inclination would be, if the chairman is going to move to table it, to not bring it up at this time, because I do have the option of bringing it up as a separate resolution because it is on the calendar.  
   I hoped to have an up-or-down vote. I put it to the chairman this way: If the chairman will allow an up-or-down vote, I am happy to have a time limit, say, of 30 minutes, depending on what the other side desires. I don't need any more than 15 minutes. 
   If the chairman is going to table, I think at this point I will not offer the amendment.

   Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I spoke in morning business on this issue a couple of days ago, to call it to the attention of my colleagues, because I believe it is one that is very important and very relevant to this bill. I wanted my colleagues to be aware that I would probably be bringing it up at some point in the near future. I did not expect it to be quite this soon. 
   A lot of individuals who have expressed an interest in my bringing it up earlier rather than later, are not only my colleagues but many aboard the U.S.S. Indianapolis who survived this great tragedy at sea. In deference to them, I felt it would be appropriate to try to get a vote on this. I want to emphasize to my colleagues, I hope my colleagues are paying attention out there, watching on TV. Because if there is any doubt or concern about whether or not this should be supported, I urge Senators to listen to me for a few minutes as I try to explain why I believe this amendment should be agreed to. 
   First of all, I have a number of cosponsors who came in as original cosponsors. Not only myself, but Senator FRIST, Senator BOND, Senator LANDRIEU, Senator ROBB, Senator HAGEL, Senator BREAUX, Senator TORRICELLI, Senator HELMS, Senator INHOFE, Senator DURBIN and Senator EDWARDS. It is a joint resolution. I also, subsequent to that, received cosponsorship from Senator BOXER and from Senator INOUYE. 
   We can see it represents all regions of the country and both sides of the political spectrum. It is not in any way, shape, or form a political issue. It simply expresses the sense of Congress with respect to the court-martial conviction of the late Rear Adm. Charles Butler McVay, III. It calls upon the President to award a Presidential Unit Citation to the final crew of the U.S.S. Indianapolis. 
   This is an incredible story of incredible bravery and at the same time it is a story of incredible prejudice to an individual with a great, distinguished record as a captain, as an officer in the U.S. Navy. 
   I want to share with my colleagues this brief story from the closing days of World War II, the war in the Pacific. I know as we debate the issues of the day, and believe me I have been involved in them all week, and there are some huge issues--the China issue and so many others. But I think it is important to understand. I just spoke a few moments ago to new flag officers who were just getting their stars. It was quite an honor to do that. But I think it is important, if we are going to ask people such as these new flag officers to come on board to serve and continue to serve in the military, not to leave after their enlistment is up, but to become those flag officers, they need to understand if there is some type of inequity or something that has happened that causes an injustice, we need to look at it in a way so we can make a wrong right. I think they need to know that. If something was wrong and the military did something wrong, we need to be big enough to admit it and to correct it. That is what this story is about. 
   This is a harrowing story. It has a lot of bad elements--It has bad timing; it has bad weather. It has heroism and fortitude, but it also has negligence and shame. It has good luck and bad luck. And above all, it is a story of some very special men whose will to survive shines like a beacon even today, many decades later. 
   We have the opportunity, right now, perhaps as soon as an 
   hour, to redeem the reputation of a fine man--a wronged man, in my view--and salute the indomitable will of a very fine crew of the U.S.S. Indianapolis. I had the privilege of hosting two--actually more than two, several survivors of the U.S.S. Indianapolis, a couple here yesterday or the day before that, and several before that at a meeting. The bill I offer today will honor all these men and their shipmates of the U.S.S. Indianapolis and redeem their captain, in my view--Capt. Charles McVay. 
   Captain McVay graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy in 1920. He was a career naval officer. He had an exemplary record in the military that included participation in the landings in North Africa, award of a Silver Star for courage under fire earned during the Solomon Islands campaign. Before taking command of the Indianapolis in November of 1944, Captain McVay chaired the Joint Intelligence Committee of the Combined Chiefs of Staff in Washington. That is the highest intelligence unit of the Allies during the war. 
   McVay led the ship through the invasion of Iwo Jima, then bombardment of Okinawa in the spring of 1945, during which Indianapolis antiaircraft guns shot down seven enemy planes before the ship was severely damaged. Captain McVay returned his ship safely to Mare Island in California for much-needed repairs. 
   Another great story about the Indianapolis which is not well known. In 1945, the Indianapolis delivered to the island of Tinian the world's first operational atomic bomb, which would later be dropped on Hiroshima by the Enola Gay on August 6. After delivering her fateful cargo, she then reported to the naval station at Guam for further orders. She was ordered to join the U.S.S. Idaho in the Philippines to prepare for the invasion of Japan. 
   It was at Guam that the series of events ultimately leading to the sinking of the Indianapolis began to unfold. It is quite a story. 
   There were hostilities in this part of the Pacific, but they had long since ceased. This is 1945. The war is almost over. The Japanese surface fleet is no longer considered a threat and attention instead had turned 1,000 miles to the north where preparations were underway for the invasion of the Japanese mainland.  
   So we have a picture here of very little Japanese activity in the Pacific. These conditions led to a relaxed state of alert on the part of those who decided to send the Indianapolis across the Philippine Sea unescorted, and consequently Captain McVay was randomly told, just zigzag at your discretion. 
   So the higher-ups were in a relaxed state. We were going into the Japanese homeland. There was little presence, Captain McVay was told. So we will send you out across the Philippine Sea unescorted. The Indianapolis, unescorted, departed Guam for the Philippines on July 28, 1945. Think about how close we are now to the end of the war. Just after midnight, on 30 July 1945, midway between Guam and the Leyte Gulf, the U.S.S. Indianapolis was hit by two torpedoes fired by the ``I-58'', the Japanese submarine that was not supposed to be there according to the higher-ups. 
   The first torpedo blew the bow off the ship. The second hit the Indianapolis at midship on the starboard side adjacent to a fuel tank and a powder magazine. You cannot imagine--no one could--the resulting explosion, but it split the ship completely in two. 
   There were 1,196 men aboard the U.S.S. Indianapolis on that fateful night. Mr. President, 900 escaped the ship before it sunk in 12 minutes. In 12 minutes, the naval ship went to the bottom and 900 men were able to get off that ship before it sank. Few liferafts were released, and at sunrise on the first day of those 900 men being in the water, they were attacked by sharks. The attacks continued until the remaining men were physically removed from the water almost 5 days later. 
   If you can imagine in the middle of the night aboard ship: It is hit by two torpedoes and sinks in 12 minutes, very few liferafts; you are in the water. The men were in the water for 5 days and the sharks began immediately to circle and attack and pick these men off, literally, one by one, as wolves might pick off a weakened antelope or some other animal they were pursuing. 
   Shortly after 11 a.m. on the fourth day, the survivors were accidentally discovered by an American bomber on a routine antisubmarine patrol. This is important for my colleagues to understand this--accidentally discovered. 
   A patrolling seaplane was dispatched to lend assistance and report. En route to the scene, it overflew the destroyer Cecil Doyle DD-368, and alerted her captain to this emergency. The captain of the Cecil Doyle, on his own authority--no orders--decided to divert from his mission and go to the scene of the Indianapolis sinking. 
   Arriving there hours ahead of the Cecil Doyle, the seaplane's crew--the seaplane's crew had called the Cecil Doyle; the Cecil Doyle is en route and the seaplane, in the meantime, began dropping rubber rafts and supplies to these men who had been in the water for 5 days. While doing so, they observed the shark attacks. They literally saw men who were moments from rescue dragged under by attacking sharks. These men were so overcome by this that, disregarding standing orders not to land at sea, the plane landed and taxied to the stragglers and lone swimmers who were at greatest risk of shark attacks, as the sharks would pick off those who were not able to stay up with the rest of the group. It was an act of extreme bravery on the part of the seaplane crew. 
   As darkness fell, the crew of the seaplane waited for help, all the while continuing to seek out and pull nearly dead men from the water. When the fuselage of the plane was full, the survivors were tied to the wing with a parachute cord. That plane rescued 56 men from the water on that particular day, just literally sitting in the water allowing these men to cling to that plane. 
   Then came the Cecil Doyle. This was the first vessel on the scene, and it began taking survivors aboard. Again, disregarding the safety of his own vessel, the Doyle's captain pointed his largest searchlight into the night sky to serve as a beacon so other rescue vessels might catch it. This was the first indication to the survivors that their prayers had been answered. Help at last had arrived.

   Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the comments the Senator has made. I think clearly it would be in the best interests of the Senate, and certainly of the Indianapolis, to not have the amendment tabled. I believe you bring up some very valid points. There may be some Senators who have not had a chance to digest this. 
   I did send out a significant amount of information over the past several days, but we have been busy. So in deference to the chairman, as long as my rights are protected--I would like to complete 5 or 6 minutes to just finish the statement I was making, to finish the story, if you will, as to what happened--I will, with the chairman's commitment to a hearing, withdraw the amendment. We will have the hearing at some point, whenever is appropriate, where we can both convene it. Then perhaps we can bring it back after that hearing to the floor as a separate piece of freestanding legislation, which I have on the calendar, as is, anyway.

   Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. I thank my colleague from Michigan for his comments. 
   Just finishing the story briefly, in 5 or 6 minutes, so we can go ahead to the next issue, there were 900 men who made it into the water and only 317 remained alive at the end of those 5 days. If you can imagine 5 days of shark attacks, starvation, thirst with only salt water, suffering from exposure. The men from the U.S.S. Indianapolis were finally rescued. Curiously enough, the Navy withheld the news of the sunken ship from the American people for 2 weeks until the day the Japanese surrendered, on August 15, 1945. So the press coverage was minimal. Also, it was somewhat suspicious that they started the proceedings without having all the available data that was necessary. And less than 2 weeks after the sinking of the Indianapolis, before the sinking of the ship had even been announced to the public, the Navy opened an official board of inquiry to investigate Captain McVay, the captain of the ship, and his actions. The board, strangely enough, recommended a general court-martial for Captain McVay 2 weeks after the incident before it had even been made public. Indeed, many of the survivors' families were not even made aware that the ship had gone down. 
   Admiral Nimitz, commander in chief of the Pacific Command, didn't agree. He wrote the Navy's judge advocate general that at worst, McVay was guilty of an error in judgment, but not gross negligence worthy of a court-martial. Nimitz later recommended a reprimand. Nimitz and Admiral Spruance later were overridden by the Fifth Fleet, Secretary of the Navy James Forrestal and Adm. Ernest King, Chief of Naval Operations. They directed that the court-martial would go on and proceed. 
   It is pretty difficult to understand why the Navy brought the charge in the first place. 
   Explosions from torpedoes, as I said before, had knocked out the ship completely, knocked out its communication system so he was unable to give an abandon ship order except by word of mouth, which all of the crew said McVay had done. So he was ultimately found not guilty on that count. 
   Then the second count was not zigzagging, and it goes on to talk about that. 
   The bottom line, Captain McVay was ultimately found guilty on the charge of failing to zigzag and was discharged from the Navy with a ruined career. And in 1946, at the request of Admiral Nimitz, who had now become the CNO, Chief of Naval Operations, in a partial admission of injustice, Secretary Forrestal remitted McVay's sentence and restored him to duty. But Captain McVay's court-martial and personal culpability for the sinking of the Indianapolis continued to stain his Navy records. The stigma of this conviction remained with him always. And as sometimes happens in these kind of tragedies, in 1968, he took his own life. To this day, Captain McVay is recorded in naval history as negligent in the deaths of 870 sailors. Not one sailor said that he was negligent, yet it still continues to be on the record. 
   This is an injustice. I look forward to having the hearing and hearing from these sailors who will tell us publicly how they feel about this. 
   We need to restore the reputation of an honorable officer. In the decade since World War II, the crew of the Indianapolis, to their everlasting credit, has worked tirelessly in defending their captain. Captain McVay could be and would be, if he were here, very proud of his men who are trying to see that his memory is properly honored.  
   We can do that. We can help the crew do just that right here in the Senate. It is at the request of the survivors that I introduce this resolution. 
   Since McVay's court-martial, a number of other things have come up. I will not get into those now because of time, but we will get into them in the hearing. 
   Let me conclude on this point: Many of the survivors of the Indianapolis believe that a decision to convict Captain McVay was made before the court-martial. That is a very serious charge. They are convinced that McVay was made a scapegoat to hide the mistakes of others higher up. McVay was court-martialed and convicted of hazarding his ship by failing to zigzag despite overwhelming evidence that the Navy itself had placed the ship in harm's way, not Captain McVay, despite testimony from the Japanese submarine commander that zigzagging would have made no difference, despite the fact that although 700 Navy ships were lost in combat in World War II, McVay was the only Navy captain, ship captain, to be court-martialed, and despite the fact that the Navy did not notice when the Indianapolis failed to arrive on schedule. In spite of that, he was court-martialed, thus costing hundreds of lives unnecessarily and creating the greatest sea disaster in the history of the United States.

   Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, this is an amendment I regret very much that I have to offer. I cannot express in words how strongly I am opposed to the war in Yugoslavia and the conduct of that war. I have to say that the only weapon in the arsenal of a Congressman or a Senator is funding. 
   Cutting off funding is the only way you can stop an administration policy that you do not approve of. It is the only instrument we have at our disposal under the Constitution. And I will be the first to admit that it is a blunt instrument, but it is the only weapon I have in my arsenal to stop a policy that I think is very dangerous, one which is going to cost us dearly if we continue. 
   So with great reluctance, I am offering this amendment, not because I want to but because I have to. As we deliberate funding the Department of Defense for the next fiscal year, I think the Senate of the United States should go on record as to whether or not we ought to be expected to vote on funding this operation in Kosovo. 
   We have been warned many times against interventions like the one in Yugoslavia. Our Founding Fathers themselves implored us in written statement after written statement, in speech after speech--George Washington comes to mind in his Farewell Address--not to meddle in the affairs of sovereign nations. He took care to warn us against the mischiefs of foreign intrigue. We would do well to heed his words. 
   But we did not heed his words when we attacked Yugoslavia. It is not the first time in American history, but we did not heed those words. We started the war in Yugoslavia. We attacked a sovereign nation in the midst of a civil war. The Founding Fathers explicitly gave the responsibility to Congress to approve or disapprove acts of war, and we cannot and we must not abdicate that. 
   We have already authorized airstrikes. We did that, regrettably, in a vote that I lost earlier this spring. But the issue here is: Are we going to have an operation of possible ground forces and a possible continuation of airstrikes in a sovereign nation in the midst of a civil war, without any statement from Congress other than one that was to fund an air war, which kept the ground troops out, which allowed Milosevic to take over Kosovo? This policy has not worked. We are being dragged into a ground war. Believe me, there are plans on the table, and everybody in America should know it, right now as we speak, to put ground forces into Kosovo. 
   When a superpower uses military force against another nation, it has to do it with an intensity and ferocity that shows purpose and decisiveness. I do not want any more Vietnams. I served in Vietnam. I watched the politicians debate the war, and the people in the streets protest the war while the rest of us fought the war, and then were not treated very well when we came home. I have had enough of that. It has been said many times: ``No more Vietnams.'' Well, to do anything less than to go in with absolute purpose and absolute decisiveness and end the war that you began--to do less than that is another Vietnam. 
   Somalia comes to mind. People lost their lives. We did not have a clear purpose there either. We just went in. And here, in Kosovo, we just went in. Yes, Milosevic is a terrible person and he has done terrible things to innocent people. The question is, though: Was bombing Milosevic the way to end it? 
   Well, apparently not, since there were 2,000 people dead and 50,000 refugees when we went in, and now there are 150,000 dead and a million refugees. Apparently, the policy that 58 senators supported in here two months ago is not working. 
   I have been on this floor repeatedly arguing against this war. I do not like doing so. But we are attacking a sovereign nation, and our national interests are not at stake. Humanitarian problems in Yugoslavia are serious problems, but are they national security interests of the United States of America? Every single person out there who has a son or daughter old enough to serve in the military should ask themselves: Is it worth my son's or daughter's life to die in Yugoslavia for a humanitarian crisis that does not involve the national security of the United States? 
   If the answer is yes, then you ought to tell all your Senators 
   to vote against me. Call them up tonight and tell them that. I, for one, have two sons and a daughter, and I do not want any of them in Yugoslavia. 
   As the sole remaining superpower, we have a special obligation and responsibility. We have to be committed to democracy, we have to keep our markets open, and we have to have the finest military in the world. And we do. But most importantly, we have to act clearly, decisively, and within our explicit national interests. We have not done that here in Yugoslavia. 
   Some people have said: Let's go win the war. Maybe somebody can explain to me what ``win'' means. Does it mean that we occupy Yugoslavia for the next hundred years? That we put a partition up between Kosovo and the rest of Yugoslavia, or barbed wire, and keep  50,000, or 60,000, or 200,000 troops there for a hundred years? Perhaps we should just bomb every bridge, every building, every oil refinery, every railroad, flatten it to the ground, kill every Serb. Maybe that is how we win. Somebody tell me. I have been waiting. I have offered this challenge on broadcast after broadcast, in interview after interview, in conversation after conversation with administration officials, Senators, Congressmen, people on the street, people in the military. Nobody has given me the answer yet. How do we win? I have not heard the answer. 
   Our military is stretched to the breaking point. Recruiting is down. There are chronic spare part shortages. Deployments continue to increase. And now we are hearing reports about shortages of cruise missiles and other smart weapons. Over 30,000 reservists are being called up. 
   Let me ask my colleagues to reflect on something. God forbid, but what if North Korea were to attack the South tomorrow morning; or Iraq decided to invade Kuwait; or the Iranians, or the Libyans, or anybody else caused some problems somewhere in their part of the world? Are we ready to meet those threats? Could we meet those threats all at once, or any of them, and keep all of the commitments--including that in Kosovo--that we have now? If you have a son or daughter in the military, ask them. They will tell you that they cannot. Ask a general or an admiral in private, I say to my colleagues, and they will tell you that we cannot. If we cannot, then we ought not to be doing this. 
   Let me tell you something. If we get into a ground war in Yugoslavia, we are going to be there for a long, long time. I do not want that to happen. I do not want to be proven right. But we are at a turning point. If we continue to increase our intervention in Yugoslavia--which ground forces will certainly do--we are in fact committing ourselves to the Balkans, not for a day, not for a week, not for a month, not for a year, but for decades. Mark my words: we will be in the Balkans for decades. 
   We went into Vietnam in 1965. Thirteen years later and after 58,000 Americans were dead, when we tried to defeat and conquer an indigenous people who were dug in in their country, in their homeland, we still had not gotten it done. 
   These people are going to fight for their homeland, and we are going to have to be prepared to take heavy casualties to move them out. 
   Again, I will be blunt about it. If you think it acceptable to put your son or your daughter into Kosovo, then you ought to vote against me. But you ought to be prepared to put your son or daughter in there at the same time you put somebody else's son or daughter in there. 
   This region of the Balkans has been inflamed for centuries. If they attacked the United States, or if they threatened the national security of the United States anywhere in the world, I would lead the charge here in the Senate for a declaration of war. But they have not done that. 
   I am hearing a lot of pious arguments about this humanitarian crisis. But the question we have to ask: ``Will our grandchildren be patrolling the streets of Kosovo?'' 
   Think about it--not you, not your son, but your grandson, and maybe his grandson. Are they going to be patrolling the streets of Kosovo to keep the Serbians from coming across their border and killing more ethnic Albanians? That is what you had better ask yourself. 
   There are those who say that the integrity of NATO is at stake. I hear that all the time--if we do not go to war in Kosovo, NATO will fall apart. Look-- NATO survived the Soviet Union. It survived Joseph Stalin. It survived Khrushchev and Brezhnev. But it is not going to survive Slobodan Milosevic? 
   For goodness' sake. This alliance has stood for decades for all of these great powers, and has stood well. I supported NATO in those years. The administration would almost laughingly tell us that Slobodan Milosevic has the power to do what Stalin, Khrushchev, and Andropov could not do--destroy the NATO alliance. If the alliance is that fragile, maybe it is time to shut the door on NATO. Surely it is not that fragile. 
   The key for NATO's success has been that it is a defensive alliance. But it must stay true to its core mission--which it is not doing now; we are seeing tremendous broadening of the scope of NATO here, under this President--the collective defense of its members. If we use this as the overriding principle of NATO, that it should be there for the collective defense of its members, not only will the cohesion of the alliance not be in question, but we would never have gotten involved in the swamp in the Balkans. That is exactly what it is. It is a swamp. And we are going to get stuck in it. 
   Let me assure you of one thing. If this war against Yugoslavia continues to escalate, then NATO truly is finished, because NATO will disgrace itself. Even today on the news we have our commander, General Clark, saying we need to hit more targets, we need to hit more specific targets in Belgrade, we have to come closer to those embassies, closer to those populations, take more risks, take out more facilities, risk more collateral damage, because, if we do not, we will never win--or, if we do not, we are going to have to put in ground troops. 
   Should ground troops be introduced? Should we be forced to attack and occupy Yugoslavia? This will certainly be the end of NATO. This alliance is not an offensive force. It never has been. The greatness of NATO is the fact that it is defensive--that is what allows it to function by consensus. 
   Already our allies have tried to find a way to end the airstrikes. Anybody who tells you that there are no cracks in NATO and that NATO is solidly behind this is not telling you the truth. Who can blame those in NATO who are taking a different position now? They joined NATO to prevent a European war. Now they find 
   that the U.S. has led them into one--in the Balkans, of all places. 
   One of the main reasons I do not support this war is because I want to preserve our standing in the world. It is because I believe our relationship with Russia is on the line. It is because I believe that we should not draw precious military resources from our overseas commitments. It is because I care about the stability in Bosnia. It is because I believe in the sovereignty of other nations that I am against the escalation of this conflict. Some call that isolationism. It is not isolationism, and I resent that reference. It is actually realism.

   Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. I certainly will add that to the list. I referred to that a few moments ago. But it is a point well taken. 
   Mr. President, great powers use discretion. They do not allow themselves to be bogged down in places where their interests are not at stake. They use their power judiciously. 
   When do we use force? When do we use diplomacy? We have made commitments around the world in places like Korea and the Middle East. The United States has shown resolve. We place American lives at risk when our vital interests are the stake. We have done it all over the world. Americans have died in places all over the world that some cannot pronounce and never heard of. It has been happening for decades. There is no question about it. But our vital interests are not threatened in Yugoslavia.  
   We have troops in warships across the world. Every year we send billions of Americans' tax dollars overseas in foreign aid. The American people are the most generous in the world. Private citizens, corporations, and charitable organizations send hundreds of millions of dollars every year to help needy people throughout the world. If we have a flood, or an earthquake, or a tornado in America, how many times do you hear about all of these other countries pouring in money to help the people in Des Moines, or to help the people someplace else where a tornado or a flood occurs? 
   To somehow say now that we have to get into this conflict when we have countries in Europe who can, and should, deal with it--how much more blood do we need to shed in Europe for Europe? It is about time Europe stepped up to the plate. 
   The United States does not need to resort to airstrikes to show we are not isolationist, and we certainly should not put our troops at risk. And we do not need somebody who has never been a strong military leader--indeed, who has never been in the military--to be the macho man who drags us into a war where we do not belong in. 
   With this legislation, I am just trying to keep the administration from throwing money and forces at Kosovo without regular accountability. If Congress wants operations after 1 October, all we have to do is authorize them. This vote tonight will not be the mission. We have made that vote. This vote is going to be on whether or not we want to have another opportunity fund this operation after October 1. 
   I respect my colleagues on both sides of this question. I respect immensely the thought that they put into it. I respect their convictions. Again, the only instrument I have as a Member of Congress, blunt as it may be, if I disapprove of this policy, is to cut off the funding. That is the reason I offer this amendment. 
   I yield the floor.

   If my amendment were to prevail and I were one of those pilots, I would hope that my Commander in Chief, after this amendment did prevail, would begin to make a compelling case for our actions against Yugoslavia, and would bring that case before the American people for a vote in Congress. That is all this amendment requires. It is the only way to ensure that the American people are behind their troops in the field.

   Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I think that if we were to look at the resolve of Mr. Milosevic, he has done pretty well for himself, considering after 60-some days of bombing he has cleared out Kosovo of just about every ethnic Albanian he can clear out, with the exception of those who can serve him as human shields to protect his army and tanks. 
   That is despicable. I am not going to stand on the floor of the Senate and defend Slobodan Milosevic. I am concerned about the long-range situation and what our objective is. We can bomb and bomb and bomb. We have been doing that. How long that goes on, I do not know. The bottom line is: he has achieved what he wanted to achieve, which is to get the ethnic Albanians out of Kosovo. He has accomplished what he wanted to accomplish in spite of the bombing--and maybe because of the bombing. 
   I do not know what we are gaining by continuing. But I do think that, as a minimum, the President must get Congressional authorization to continue the war.

   Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. The respect is mutual, as my friend knows. 
   Mr. President, there have been a few misstatements about my amendment that I would like to clarify, as Senators now begin to make their way to the floor. I will only be a few minutes in closing. 
   All this amendment requires is that the President make the case and get congressional approval to go forward with this war after October 1. No funds are cut off until October 1, and unless Congress chooses not to authorize the President to continue. That is what this amendment requires. 
   I heard one of my colleagues on the other side of the issue say a few moments ago that this is coming at the last minute and that we do not have time to deliberate. I will tell you how much time you have to deliberate. You have the rest of this month, you have June, July, August, and September. You have 4 months to think about whether or not you want this war to continue and whether or not you want to authorize more funding. It does not send any message to Milosevic other than the fact that Congress intends to exercise its constitutional authority. That is all. 
   I could probably give emotional speeches about a number of human tragedies around the world. My colleague from Delaware got very emotional; and that is a good quality when you believe in something. But this decision should not be based on emotions. This is a decision about how we should use our finite power. We should make the decision on how we use our power on the basis of American interests. No American life should be risked based on any Senator's emotions, for goodness' sake. 
   In 1995, 500,000 Rwandans were slaughtered in six weeks--most of them hacked to death by machetes--in tribal warfare in the nation of Rwanda. Maybe I am mistaken--and if I am, I will apologize to any Senator who says he came down here and said that we should enter the war in Rwanda, enter that civil war, fire cruise missiles, bomb the blazes out of all the cities, bring those tribes back to their knees to stop the hacking--but I did not hear it. That was a humanitarian crisis of the highest magnitude, and we did not enter it. And we should not have entered it. 
   Those 500,000 people are just as precious under the eyes of God as anybody else in the world, and we said nothing. We did not fire cruise missiles, we did not drop smart bombs, and we did not talk about ground forces, we did not talk about NATO forces, or any other forces of the world going in and setting up a partition to keep two warring tribes apart. Why? Because, as in Kosovo, the conflict posed no threat to the United States. No American lives were worth risking. 
   This is not about tying the President's hands as he tries to defend America. It is about guiding and restraining an incompetent administration as it muddles around in a place  where U.S. interests are, at best, peripheral. 
   There are terrible humanitarian situations that Mr. Milosevic has created. I will be the first to admit it. The question is, as I said at the outset of this debate, How do we resolve it? Do we resolve it with more bombs? By bombing and causing collateral damage to innocent people? Or do we do it through diplomacy? 
   I am not trying to send a message one way or the other to Milosevic with this amendment. I am trying to send a message to the American people and to the Senate to say, if we are going to put Americans at war in a sovereign nation in a civil war, the least the Senate can do is have the intestinal fortitude to say yes or no, rather than to let this thing string on like Vietnam did and then, after 58,000 people are dead, we say, oh, my goodness, if we had just stopped this war a little bit earlier--or perhaps, as Senator Goldwater said, we had fought it to win a little bit sooner. Meanwhile, there are 58,000-plus people on the Vietnam Wall. 
   Now is the time to speak, not 5 years from now. All I am asking in this amendment is that we have from now until October 1 to decide whether or not we want to fund this war any further. That is the message I am sending. I am sending that to my colleagues who represent the people of the United States of America. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, the leader has asked me to make a couple of announcements this morning. 
   The Senate, of course, will resume consideration of the defense authorization bill, and under the previous order the Senate will debate several amendments with the votes on those amendments occurring in a stacked sequence beginning at 2:15 today. Therefore, Senators can expect at least three votes occurring at 2:15 this afternoon. It is the intention of the majority leader to complete action on this bill as early as possible this week, and therefore Senators can expect busy sessions each day and evening. 
   I thank my colleagues for their attention to this matter.

   Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to share with my colleagues a brief story from the closing days of World War II, the war in the Pacific. 
   It is a harrowing story, with many elements. Bad timing, bad weather. Heroism and fortitude. Negligence and shame. Bad luck. Above all, it is the story of some very special men whose will to survive shines like a beacon decades later. 
   I should point out that it is because of the efforts of a 13 year old boy in Florida that I introduce this bill today. Hunter Scott, working for nearly two years on what started as a history project, compiled a mountain of clippings, letters, and interviews that ultimately led Congressman JOE SCARBOROUGH to introduce this bill in the House, and for me to do so in the Senate. Hunter, on behalf of the survivors of the U.S.S. Indianapolis, the family of Captain McVay, and your country, I thank you for your courageous efforts. 
   Mr. President, we have the opportunity to redeem the reputation of a wronged man, and salute the indomitable will of a courageous crew. I had the distinct honor and priviledge of hosting two distinguished members of that courageous crew just this morning; Richard Paroubek, of Williamsburg, VA, who was a Yeoman 1st Class, and Woodie James of Salt Lake City, UT, who was a Coxswain. The bill I introduce today will honor these two men, and their fellow shipmates of the U.S.S. Indianapolis, and redeem their Captain, Charles McVay. 
   A 1920 graduate of the U.S. Naval Academy, Charles Butler McVay III was a career naval officer with an exemplary record, including participation in the landings in North Africa and award of the Silver Star for courage under fire earned during the Soloman Islands campaign. Before taking command of the Indianapolis in November 1944, Captain McVay was chairman of the Joint Intelligence Committee of the Combined Chiefs of Staff in Washington, the Allies' highest intelligence unit. 
   Captain McVay led the ship through the invasion of Iwo Jima, then the bombardment of Okinawa in the spring of 1945 during which Indianapolis' antiaircraft guns shot down seven enemy planes before the ship was severely damaged. McVay returned the ship safely to Mare Island in California for repairs. 
   In 1945, the Indianapolis delivered the world's first operational atomic bomb to the island of Tinian, which would later be dropped on Hiroshima by the Enola Gay on August 6. After delivering its fateful cargo, the Indianapolis then reported to the naval station at Guam for further orders. She was ordered to join the battleship U.S.S. Idaho in the Philippines to prepare for the invasion of Japan. 
   It was at Guam that the series of events ultimately leading to the sinking of the Indianapolis began to unfold. Hostilities in this part of the Pacific had long since ceased. The Japanese surface fleet was no longer considered a likely threat, and attention instead had turned 1,000 miles to the north where preparations were underway for the invasion of the 
   Japanese mainland. These conditions led to a relaxed state of alert on the part of those who decided to send the Indianapolis across the Philippine Sea unescorted, and consequently, Captain McVay's orders to ``zigzag at his discretion.'' Zigzagging is a naval maneuver used to avoid torpedo attack, generally considered most effective once the torpedoes have been launched. 
   The Indianapolis, unescorted, departed Guam for the Philippines on July 28. Just after midnight on 30 July 1945, midway between Guam and the Leyte Gulf, she was hit by two torpedoes fired by the ``I-58,'' a Japanese submarine. The first blew away the bow, the second struck near mid-ship on the starboard side adjacent to a fuel tank and a powder magazine. The resulting explosion split the ship in two. 
   Of the 1,196 men aboard, about 900 escaped the sinking ship and made it into the water in the twelve minutes before she sank. Few life rafts were released. Shark attacks began at sunrise on the first day, and continued until the men were physically removed from the water, almost five days later. 
   Shortly after 11:00 A.M. of the fourth day, the survivors were accidentally discovered by an American bomber on routine antisubmarine patrol. A patrolling seaplane was dispatched to lend assistance and report. En route to the scene the pilot overflew the destroyer U.S.S. Cecil Doyle ( DD-368), and alerted her captain to the emergency. The captain of the Doyle, on his own authority, decided to divert to the scene. 
   Arriving hours ahead of the Doyle, the seaplane's crew began dropping rubber rafts and supplies. While doing so, they observed men being attacked by sharks. Disregarding standing orders not to land at sea, the plane landed and began taxiing to pick up the stragglers and lone swimmers who were at greatest risk of shark attack. 
   As darkness fell, the crew of the seaplane waited for help to arrive, all the while continuing to seek out and pull nearly dead men from the water. When the plane's fuselage was full, survivors were tied to the wing with parachute cord. The plane's crew rescued 56 men that day. 
   The Cecil Doyle was the first vessel on the scene, and began taking survivors aboard. Disregarding the safety of his own vessel, the Doyle's captain pointed his largest searchlight into the night sky to serve as a beacon for other rescue vessels. This beacon was the first indication to the survivors that their prayers had been answered. Help had at last arrived. 
   Of the 900 who made it into the water only 317 remained alive. After almost five days of constant shark attacks, starvation, terrible thirst, and suffering from exposure and their wounds, the men of the Indianapolis were at last rescued from the sea. 
   Curiously, the Navy withheld the news of the sunken ship from the American people for two weeks, until the day the Japanese surrendered on August 15, 1945, thus insuring minimum press coverage for the story of the Indianapolis' loss. 
   Also suspicious, conceding that they were ``starting the proceedings without having available all the necessary data,'' less than two weeks after the sinking of the Indianapolis, before the sinking of the ship had even been announced to the public, the Navy opened an official board of inquiry to investigate Captain McVay and his actions. The board recommended a general court-martial for McVay. 
   Admiral Nimitz, Commander in Chief of Pacific Command, did not agree--he wrote the Navy's Judge Advocate General that at worst McVay was guilty of an error in judgment, but not gross negligence worthy of court-martial. Nimitz recommended a letter of reprimand. 
   Overriding both Nimitz and Admiral Raymond Spruance who commanded the Fifth Fleet, Secretary of the Navy James Forrestal and Admiral Ernest King, Chief of Naval Operations, directed that court-martial proceedings against Captain McVay proceed. 
   Captain McVay was notified of the pending court-martial, but not told what specific charges would be brought against him. The reason was simple. The Navy had not yet decided what to  charge him with. Four days before the trial began they did decide on two charges: the first, failing to issue orders to abandon ship in a timely fashion; and the second, hazarding his vessel by failing to zigzag during good visibility. 
   It's difficult to understand why the Navy brought the first charge against McVay. Explosions from the torpedo attacks had knocked out the ship's communications system, making it impossible to give an abandon ship order to the crew except by word of mouth, which McVay had done. He was ultimately found not guilty on this count. 
   That left the second charge of failing to zigzag. Perhaps the most egregious aspect however, was in the phrasing of the charge itself. The phrase was ``during good visibility.'' According to all accounts of the survivors, including written accounts only recently declassified and not made available to McVay's defense at the trial, the visibility that night was severely limited with heavy cloud cover. This is pertinent for two reasons. First, no Navy directives in force at that time or since recommended, much less ordered, zigzagging at night in poor visibility. Secondly, as Admiral Nimitz pointed out, the rule requiring zigzagging would not have applied in any event, since McVay's orders gave him discretion on that matter and thus took precedence over all other orders. Thus, when he stopped zigzagging, he was simply exercising his command authority in accordance with Navy directives. Unbelievably, this point was never made by McVay's defense counsel during the subsequent court-martial. 
   Captain McVay was ultimately found guilty on the charge of failing to zigzag, and was discharged from the Navy with a ruined career. In 1946, at the specific request of Admiral Nimitz who had become Chief of Naval Operations, Secretary Forrestal, in a partial admission of injustice, remitted McVay's sentence and restored him to duty. But, Captain McVay's court-martial, and personal culpability for the sinking of the 
   Indianapolis continued to stain his Navy records. The stigma of his conviction remained with him always, and he ultimately took his own life in 1968. To this day Captain McVay is recorded in history as negligent in the deaths of 870 sailors. 
   We need to restore the reputation of this honorable officer. In the decades since World War II, the crew of the Indianapolis has worked tirelessly in defending their Captain, and trying to ensure that his memory is properly honored. It is at the specific request of the survivors of the U.S.S. Indianapolis that I introduce this resolution. 
   Since McVay's court-martial, a number of factors, including once classified documents not made available to McVay's defense, have surfaced raising significant questions about the justice of the conviction. 
   Although naval authorities at Guam knew that on July 24, four days before the Indianapolis departed for Leyte, the destroyer escort U.S.S. Underhill had been sunk by a Japanese submarine within range of the Indianapolis' path, McVay was not told. 
   Although a code-breaking system called ULTRA had alerted naval intelligence that a Japanese submarine (the I-58, which ultimately sank the Indianapolis) was operating in his path, McVay was not told. Classified as top secret until the early 1990s, this intelligence--and the fact it was withheld from McVay before he sailed from Guam--was suppressed during his court-martial. 
   Although the routing officer at Guam was aware of the ULTRA intelligence report, he said a destroyer escort for the Indianapolis was ``not necessary'' and, unbelievably, testified at McVay's court-martial that the risk of submarine attack along the Indianapolis' route ``was very slight''. 
   Although McVay was told of ``submarine sightings'' along his path, he was told none had been confirmed. Such sightings were commonplace throughout the war and were generally ignored by Navy commanders unless confirmed. Thus, the Indianapolis set sail for Leyte on July 26, 1945, sent into harm's way with its captain unaware of dangers which shore-based naval personnel know were in his path.

   Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today just as the Cox report is about to enter the public domain. This report--a bipartisan report by Congressman CHRIS COX of California and Congressman NORMAN DICKS of Washington--will go to an issue of great importance to the United States; it is the issue of Chinese espionage in the United States. 
   I am rising on the Senate floor today to introduce legislation--which I will do at the conclusion of my remarks--establishing a bipartisan select committee to examine Chinese espionage against United States national security interests, responding to what is increasingly being viewed as the greatest security breach against the United States in our history--the loss to China of our most sensitive nuclear warhead data over many years from the Los Alamos National Lab, and from other national security facilities and programs. 
   Through no one's fault, and with the best of intentions, congressional efforts to examine this matter have been disjointed and inconsistent. I respect every Senator on both sides of the aisle who has been working and doing their best to try to get to the bottom of this, especially the chairmen of those committees with some claim to jurisdiction over the Labs and over this whole issue of Chinese espionage. 
   Unfortunately, that is the problem. There are too many individuals conducting too many independent investigations, if you will, and too many committees going down the same path. The result has been a duplication of witnesses, many of whom have come back and testified four or five times before the Senate. I don't think this makes a lot of sense. 
   I think my colleagues on these respective committees--and I chair a subcommittee on the Armed Services Committee with direct jurisdiction over this matter, so I say that as one who would be involved in such an investigation--will agree that there is too much duplication. We need to streamline this effort and we need to put the full weight of the Senate behind it. That means an investigation, a true investigation, the power to call witnesses and administer oaths, and a unified focus of our shared bipartisan concern. 
   I have had the privilege to serve on two such bipartisan committees. One, the Senate Ethics Committee, is a nonpartisan committee, really, of three members from each party. We look at all the matters before us in a truly nonpartisan way. That is exactly what needs to be done here. 
   I also served on the Senate Select Committee on POWs and MIAs a few years ago, where Senator JOHN KERRY was the chairman and I was vice chairman. It was a bipartisan effort. That is what it is going to take in the Senate, just as the House has been well-served by its committee chaired by Congressman COX of California and Congressman DICKS of Washington. It was a bipartisan effort and it has come to a bipartisan--and unanimous--conclusion. 
   We need to do this in the Senate. We need to take what was in that report, review it carefully, find out where it leads, and take appropriate action. But I do not think we are going to accomplish that if we are going to have all of these witnesses called in five, six, seven, or eight times before all these different committees, and not have one consistent message. It will waste a lot of money and time. I think it is better to consolidate, which is why I am calling for a select committee. 
   I am not interested in scoring partisan points here. This is concerns the national security of the United States of America. No partisan points were scored in the classified presentation I attended the other day with Congressman Dicks and Congressman Cox. It was presented in a way that I felt was truly bipartisan. Members of both parties were there. It is a lot bigger than that. The national security of the United States is a lot more important than any of the partisan attacks. We all want answers. We deserve answers, and we deserve to put these witnesses under oath, under threat of perjury, and to speak before the Senate--together, not as five or six different committees of jurisdiction. 
   The Cox committee did heroic work in the House--much of it despite obstacles put in their path by the administration. They had to dig and claw to get the information, and the report that will be released tomorrow has been blocked for several months by the administration. 
   It is time for the Senate now to do its part, to focus its collective concern about these matters into a coherent and effective committee. I believe a select committee with a specific intent, with the opportunity to call witnesses, to put people under oath, and to have investigators look into this is the correct approach. Otherwise, it is going to be defused all over the Government and we are going to have all kinds of stories popping up from this committee and that committee, this subcommittee and that subcommittee, and this Senator and that Senator, and it will all be disconnected. 
   So I urge colleagues to support this legislation. I urge our leaders to support it as well. I think it is a good idea. It has worked in the past when we have had serious issues like this. And our effort here is to gain the truth, to get the facts. I believe this select committee will get the job done. 
   I want to review briefly what has happened, and why I think it is so important to have a select committee. 
   About 5 months ago, a special congressional committee investigating security problems with China questioned whether the Department of Energy had adequate safeguards to protect its nuclear secrets. On February 1, 1999, President Clinton responded, saying safeguards were ``adequate'' and getting better. 
   That was the statement of the President on February 1. With all due respect, and being as nice about it as I can, that was not true then. It is not true now. 
   One week later, on February 8, Mr. Lee failed a polygraph test. More than a month later, the FBI finally searched his computer. This is not something one can take lightly. When the President says that safeguards were ``adequate'' and getting better, that simply was not true. 
   Between the time the Justice Department refused the FBI's request for a court order to search Lee's computer and Lee's firing, there were more than 300 break-ins involving the computer network on which Lee had allegedly transferred nuclear secrets. 
   When Ho Lee was hired by Los Alamos National Laboratories in 1978, he first came under suspicion in 1982 when he made a telephone call to a scientist from Lawrence Livermore Lab who had been fired as a result of an investigation into evidence that a spy had passed neutron bomb secrets to China. 
   In 1989, when Lee's 5-year security renewal was up for review, Energy Department officials learned of the FBI's inquiry into Mr. Lee. But a file put together on Lee that was sent to DOE headquarters for security review was ``lost.'' And it was not until 1992 that the Department hired an outside contractor to reconstruct the ``lost'' file. 
   In 1994, a Los Alamos employee reported to security officials that Lee was ``embraced'' by a Chinese intelligence officer during a delegation  visit, and that Lee had discussed with the Chinese the nuclear weapons code similar to the ones he is now suspected of stealing. 
   In 1995, the Energy Department and the CIA began to learn the record of China's alleged espionage. 
   In early 1995, scientists at the Los Alamos Nuclear Lab had told Mr. Notra Trulock, then intelligence director at the Energy Department, of their fears that China had achieved a remarkable breakthrough in its nuclear tests. About that same time those fears were raised, U.S. intelligence files showed that a Chinese agent had handed over a secret document to American officials containing evidence that China had stolen design data on American nuclear warheads and missiles. 
   In 1996, the CIA concluded American secrets had been stolen. Lee emerged in early 1996 as the FBI's ``prime suspect'' at the Laboratories. 
   In 1996, Mr. Trulock tried to raise warnings about espionage at the Laboratories but was thwarted by his superiors at the Energy Department. Trulock said he finally talked to administration officials as early as April of 1996. He said he met with Sandy Berger. He said Mr. Berger had said subsequently that he briefed Mr. Clinton and took steps to address the problem. 
   We are in 1996 now--3 years ago. President Clinton denied that. But I will get to that in a minute. 
   Like all employees, Lee had signed a waiver permitting his e-mail and personal computer to be reviewed without his knowledge. Despite the waiver, the Justice Department, in 1996, decided that a court warrant would be needed before his computer could be searched, and denied the request. 
   Coincidentally--or not--in 1996, President Clinton relaxed all controls on sales of advanced computers to countries like China. The next year, his administration resisted congressional efforts to retighten those controls. The Cox committee reportedly 
   concluded that some of the computers sold to China went to organizations involved in military activities, and they might have been used for military purposes--like upgrading nuclear weapons or developing more accurate missiles. 
   When something goes to China, it does not just go to private industry. It goes to the military too. Let's make sure we understand that. 
   The relaxation of export controls on technology is something I have been hammering away at in my subcommittee--the Strategic Forces Subcommittee--in the Armed Services Committee for seven years. I have watched these controls relax in this administration. I have watched the State Department and the Defense Department and the Justice Department lose the fight time after time after time to the Commerce Department. 
   In 1996, President Bill Clinton shifted licensing responsibility for some commercial satellite sales from the security-oriented State Department to the business-friendly Commerce Department. 
   I do not know what most Americans think about all of this, but I am going to say what I think about it. I think this is the worst breach of national security in the history of the United States of America. It is not just about Los Alamos, as we are going to find out tomorrow when this report is declassified when we can talk about it in more detail. Unfortunately, I cannot talk about some of it today. But I urge everyone to get a copy of it and you will see what I am talking about. The Rosenbergs in 1953 were executed, in my view, for less than what has happened here. 
   I have seen, time after time, witness after witness from this administration come before the Armed Services Committee--either taking the fifth amendment, refusing to come, or fleeing the country, or lying under oath, or being unable to remember. That is one thing during some financial inquiry about who gave how much money to some candidate. But I am going to tell you one thing. I am not going to stand for people coming before the Senate--when the security of the United States of America is at stake, when nuclear weapons have been transmitted to a foreign nation who is an enemy of the United States--I am not going to stand for people coming before this Senate and not telling the truth. 
   I will say it on the record: somebody is going to be held accountable for what has happened. Somebody is going to be held accountable. Every nuclear weapon in the United States arsenal has been compromised--every one of them, every warhead. I am not going to stand by and take no for an answer. I am not going to stand for this being obfuscated all over the Senate and all over the country with defused, mixed messages. We will get to the bottom of this. Nobody in this Senate should have any objection to that. Whoever did this, whoever is responsible for this, wherever it leads, needs to be held accountable, period. 
   In 1996, the American intelligence community concluded that China had stolen the secret design information about the neutron bomb. In April 1997, the FBI recommended measures to tighten security at the Labs. 
   No action was taken; no action. 
   In July 1997, Mr. Trulock, concerned about lack of progress, went back to the White House to ask for assistance. He gave National Security Adviser Sandy Berger a fuller briefing. Berger briefed the President of the United States as early as July 1997. Twice in 1997 the Justice Department rejected a request by FBI counterintelligence officials to seek a search warrant authorizing more aggressive investigative techniques, including a wiretap and clandestine searches of homes, offices, and computers. The request for a wiretap was turned down by a political appointee, Frances Townsend. A request for a wiretap was turned down. 
   The numbers of wiretaps authorized each year is classified, but we know there are hundreds in any given year. We also know that seldom are more than two or three in a given year denied. Put yourself in Frances Townsend's place at the Justice Department for a moment. Somebody comes in from the FBI and says, we have a problem. Somebody stole all the nuclear weapon secrets from the United States of America and sent them to China. We have a suspect. We need to wiretap him. And your answer is, no. 
   Now, I am not going to accept some feeble explanation about why that happened. Somebody is going to answer that question in my presence in this Senate before I leave here; I state that right now. 
   In August of 1997, FBI Director Louis Freeh recommended Mr. Lee's access to classified information be cut off immediately. What happens? Lee is still granted access to top secret warhead data despite the recommendation. What is going on? This kind of thing does not happen unless somebody makes it happen and wants it to happen. 
   When the FBI Director says no, the answer is no. But somebody decided that Mr. Freeh was not going to have the last word here. They decided that Mr. Lee was going to continue to have access to top secret warhead data. 
   During the 1998 congressional investigation into satellite export controls, Trulock has said, acting Energy Secretary Elizabeth Moler ordered him--I emphasize the word ``ordered,'' because I heard him say it in my presence--ordered him not to disclose the Chinese espionage in testimony before the U.S. Congress. A political appointee in the Energy Department ordered Mr. Trulock, a subordinate, not to tell the Congress. 
   Now she denies it. Clearly, we need these two witnesses to come forth in public session before this select committee. Let the public decide who is lying and who isn't. 
   Mr. Lee retained access to classified information after he came under suspicion of spying, from October 1997 to October 1998. 
   On April 28, 1999, the Clinton administration finally admitted that secret nuclear weapons data had been compromised. They finally admitted it when Bill Richardson, the new Secretary of Energy, to his everlasting credit pushed this issue and refused to stand for it anymore. 
   Wen Ho Lee was fired on March 8. His computer was not searched until the following week. They found he had transferred 
   legacy codes covering many U.S. nuclear weapons from the classified to an unclassified computer system where they could be vulnerable to outsiders. In a computer search, more than 1,000 top secret weapons files had been deleted after being improperly transferred from a highly secure computer system.  
   Those are the facts as I can outline them without going into classified materials. I point out in the framework of the last 4 or 5 months, this information has been withheld from the public. Certain Senators and Congressmen, if they took it upon themselves, could get a briefing on the Cox report, but it was not allowed to be released. 
   What happened? What did the President know and when did he know it? That sounds familiar. 
   March 19, 1999, at a press conference, the President assured the public, ``There has been no espionage at the Labs since I've been President.'' Let me repeat that: ``There has been no espionage at the Labs since I've been President.'' 
   And, ``No one reported to me that they suspect that such a thing has occurred.'' 
   The President, in March of this year, March 19, says, ``There has been no espionage at the Labs since I've been President,'' and, ``No one reported to me that they suspect that such a thing has occurred.'' 
   Mr. Berger told the Cox Committee he didn't speak with the President about Chinese spying for at least a year, but he did say he did it in early 1998. Berger's aides now say he remembers informing Clinton in July of 1997. 
   Mr. President, this is serious business. When atomic secrets in 1953 were passed to the Russians, a man and a woman--a husband and a wife--were executed. We have got to get to the bottom of this. Any Senator worth his or her salt, regardless of political party, ought to be ready to go on this with no nonsense. 
   We are not going to accept ridiculous ``I don't remember'' answers anymore. I do not want to hear any of this. And I do not want to be bound by some committee rule where I have 5 minutes to ask a question, and the witness answers for 4 1/2 minutes, and I cannot ask any more. I want the time to ask my questions. I want the time for every Senator to ask these questions on behalf of the American people. 
   I have never in my life seen anything like the witnesses they have paraded before the committees of this Congress that I have been a party to--Government Affairs Committee investigations, the Armed Services Committee--time and time and time again, saying ``I don't remember, I can't recall.'' 
   That is not good enough. That does not cut it. And it does not cut it on the part of the President of the United States, either. He should have been up here testifying during his impeachment trial. By golly, if we have to have him come up here and testify on this, then bring him up here. 
   This is the national security of the United States we are talking about. This is classified, nuclear, codeword-level information that has been passed, and the President needs to tell us what he knows, if he knows anything. 
   According to the New York Times, what counterintelligence experts told senior Clinton administration officials in November of 1998 is that China poses an acute intelligence threat to the weapons labs--an acute intelligence threat to the weapons labs. We now know the President had been briefed in November of 1998 about FBI and CIA suspicions, and in January had even received the secret Cox report detailing those security lapses during the Clinton watch. 
   What is going on here? All right, so he does not tell us the truth about Monica Lewinsky. But this is national security. According to Mr. Berger, his own National Security Adviser, President Clinton was told about the problems at the weapons labs in July of 1997 or February of 1998. 
   On May 9, 1999, Tim Russert, on ``Meet The Press,'' extracted from Energy Secretary Bill Richardson the acknowledgment that President Clinton was ``fully, fully briefed,'' an admission for which, news reports say, Richardson was savaged by Clinton aides. 
   Here is the explanation. Clinton put in ``at the labs'' and ``against the labs'' because we technically don't know if the stolen info came from the labs or somewhere else. Richardson also said, ``there have been damaging security leaks. The Chinese have obtained damaging information during past administrations and the current administration.'' 
   Perhaps this spying started in previous administrations, but this administration knew it was going on and did not respond to it. That just does not cut it. This is not about ``what is is.'' This is about the security of the United States of America. 
   On May 23, 1999, the deputy intelligence director at the Department of Energy suggested the White House was informed about China's theft of United States nuclear secrets much sooner than it has acknowledged. 
   The inaction from this administration did not come in a vacuum. It came in the thick of a 1996 reelection effort that we now know included campaign contributions from those with ties to the Chinese Government, ties to the military, and ties to the intelligence organization. Mr. Berger first briefed in April of 1996, and not until 2 years later does the White House move to tighten security after receiving more detailed evidence in 1997. NSC sought a narrowly focused CIA report to cast doubt on Energy Department claims. 
   At the same time the FBI and CIA were investigating the source of the Los Alamos leak, Vice President AL GORE was passing the hat among wealthy Buddhist nuns, the President was serving coffee at the White House to PLA arms dealer Wang Jun, and the administration responded favorably to a request from the man who would be the Democratic Party's largest single donor in 1996, Loral chairman Bernard Schwartz, to transfer authority over licensing of satellite technology from the State Department to the Commerce Department. Two years later, Loral would be granted a Presidential waiver to export its technology to China, even though it was under criminal investigation by the Justice Department for previous technology transfers. 
   Wake up, America. Wake up. What is going on here? Who knows what? Officials from those two companies, I have news for you. You are coming in here, and you are going to answer some questions as well. 
   In April of 1996, Energy Department officials informed Mr. Berger that Trulock had uncovered evidence which showed that China had learned how to miniaturize nuclear bombs and it appeared the Chinese had gained that knowledge through the efforts of a spy at the Los Alamos Labs. Berger was told the spy might still be there. 
   What action did the White House take? Absolutely nothing. But the warning came at an awkward time, the verge of the 1997 Strategic Partnership Summit with Beijing. The administration was also facing the congressional investigations into charges that the P.R.C. had illegally funneled money into their 1996 Clinton-Gore reelection campaign. I do not know where these dots connect or if they connect, but there were a lot of dots. Mr. Berger assigned an NSC staffer to look into things and asked the CIA to investigate. The CIA's report comes back that the Trulock analysis was an unsupported worst case scenario. That is not what he told us in private. 
   Finally, in February of 1998, President Clinton formally ordered the reforms into effect. But, curiously, Energy Secretary Federico Pen 8a never followed the order and soon after left the Cabinet. 
   Reforms were not instituted until Bill Richardson did so in October of 1998, 30 months after Trulock's first warning, 9 months after the President's directive. In the meantime, Assistant Secretary Moler orders Trulock not to tell Congress because it could be used against President Clinton's China policy. 
   Do not tell Congress? If this Senate tolerates that kind of action, we deserve all the criticism we get and 10 times more. We have oversight responsibility. This area, the labs and the security of those labs and those weapons, is directly under this Senator's supervision and oversight responsibility as the chairman of the Strategic Forces Subcommittee. I am going to tell you something; I do not accept that answer. I am not going to accept that answer. Someone is going to talk, and whoever is accountable, in my view, if they did these things, they are going to go to jail, because that is where they belong. We are going to find out where this path leads, if it is the last thing I do. 
   Political contributions poured in and United States technology flowed out to China day after day, week after week, month after month, year after year--flowed out to China, made possible by  the easing of export controls to this strategic partner of the President's. 
   We are going to hear that this is China bashing. This is not China bashing. This is the national security of the United States. I hope when the American people read the Cox report, they will understand that the Chinese gained vital information on every nuclear warhead in our arsenal. They now have the missile to fire it, the warhead to put on it, and the targeting information to direct it at any city in the United States of America--all thanks to the relaxation of export controls, and to the fact we left a spy in our labs. 
   When are we going to wake up? All through March and April of 1999, the White House fought over the release and declassification of this report. No wonder they do not want it released. The Cox report believes China is still spying. I believe they are too. This has to be investigated. 
   In conclusion, we need a bipartisan select committee to find out where this trail leads, wherever it leads.

   Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise in strong opposition to final passage of S. 254, the Violent and Repeat Juvenile Offender Accountability and Rehabilitation Act of 1999. I do so because I believe that the gun control amendments to this bill that have been adopted by the Senate will do lasting damage to the fundamental right to keep and bear arms, which is guaranteed by the Second Amendment to the Constitution of the United States. 
   I am outraged, Mr. President, that the gun control lobby in this country has taken advantage of the tragedy last month at Littleton, Colorado, as well as the incident today in Georgia, to mount an unprecedented assault on the Second Amendment rights of law-abiding gun owners. They cast blame on law-abiding gun owners, while leaving the movie moguls and video game makers who promote wanton violence to children virtually unscathed. 
   Frankly, Mr. President, I am also disappointed by some of my colleagues in my own political party here in the Senate. I have spent a great deal of time, over the past two weeks as the Senate has debated this bill, arguing privately with these colleagues and trying to persuade them to hold the line against this onslaught of gun control amendments. Sadly, Mr. President, I have not been successful. Nevertheless, I am proud to have stood up for the Second Amendment, even, in one case, when I was only one of two Senators to vote against a gun control amendment to this bill. 
   I am particularly angered, Mr. President, by what the Senate has voted to do with respect to gun shows. Sadly, it seems evident to me that the practical effect of the Lautenberg Amendment, adopted earlier today when Vice President GORE cast the tie-breaking vote, will be effectively to ruin gun shows--to put them out of business. This, unfortunately, seems to me to be the aim of the Lautenberg Amendment. 
   I am also deeply concerned about the effects of the so-called ``trigger lock'' amendment. Even though the amendment appears only to require trigger locks to be sold with guns, the legal effect of the amendment may well be to do great damage to the Second Amendment rights of law-abiding gun owners. This is because courts may construe the amendment as creating a new civil negligence standard under which gun owners will be seen as having a legal obligation to use their trigger locks or face legal liability if their gun is misused by some third party. 
   If, in fact, the law develops such that gun owners have a legal obligation to use trigger locks, these law-abiding gun owners may be forced to put their safety, and that of their families, at risk. It is certainly not unreasonable to imagine a single mother of small children, depending on her gun for safety, panic-stricken as she struggles unsuccessfully with her trigger lock in the middle of the night after hearing a burglar break into her home. 
   Mr. President, these are but two examples of the grave harm that the gun control amendments adopted to this bill by the Senate have done to the Second Amendment rights of Americans. When the heat of this moment is gone, and the passions so shamelessly stirred up by the gun control lobby have subsided, I am afraid that many of those who supported these amendments will realize that they have done the Second Amendment serious and lasting harm. Sadly, though, it will be too late. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. I am pleased to join the distinguished chairman of the Committee on Environment and Public Works in introducing the Superfund Program Completion Act of 1999. This is a good day for the environment and for the American taxpayer, because this bill addresses many of the problems in Superfund that have wasted resources and delayed the cleanup of hazardous waste sites across the country. 
   Since I became chairman of the Superfund, Waste Control and Risk Assessment Subcommittee in 1995, I have had one overriding goal with respect to Superfund reform: To increase cleanups by decreasing the unfairness of the law. 
   By now, most are well aware of Superfund's dismal history. The program was created in 1980 to clean up abandoned hazardous waste sites. Begun with the best of intentions, Superfund has failed to meet even minimal expectations. Despite public and private expenditures of more than $40 billion dollars, less than 14% of approximately 1,300 sites have been cleaned up and removed from the National Priorities List over the last nineteen years. 
   The primary reason for this abysmal performance is Superfund's retroactive, strict, joint and several liability scheme. Under joint and several liability, the EPA or a private party can seek to hold any other potentially responsible party liable for the entire cleanup cost at a site--regardless of the type of contamination, when the material was disposed of, or whether the activity was legal at the time. Joint and several liability allows the government or a larger polluter to legally extort payments far in excess of a company's true share of responsibility for waste at a site. 
   Most reasonable people would agree that such a liability scheme is simply unfair. Worse yet, this unfairness has significantly hindered progress in cleaning up sites and wasted vast amounts of taxpayer funding. As one might expect, when a company is faced with paying 100% of the costs at a site for which their true liability may be less than 10%, that company will delay, negotiate, and litigate at every stop of the process. That, unfortunately, is the well-documented history of Superfund. 
   It is important to recognize that this unfairness is not confined to EPA's enforcement of the law. EPA merely begins the process at most sites by targeting one or more large parties who are potentially responsible for cleanup. Then those parties typically turn around and sue tens or hundreds of other parties--average citizens, small businesses, schools, churches, and others who face huge legal bills and years of expensive litigation if they don't pay up. 
   My position on this issue has been constant: I believe that retroactive, strict, joint and several liability is fundamentally unfair. If I had my way, I would repeal it today. Some of my colleagues see things differently, however, and the bill we introduce today represents a reasonable resolution of conflicting views on that topic. 
   While our legislation does not go as far as many would like, I believe it goes as far as we can if we are interested in passing a bill this Administration will sign into law. There's an old saying around here: ``Don't let the perfect be the enemy of the good.'' That is certainly the case with Superfund and the legislation we introduce today. This is a good bill. It will make a profound and positive difference in the lives of millions of Americans. It is a bill that can pass the Senate on a strong bi-partisan basis; and it is a bill that the President should sign into law. 
   The Superfund Program Completion Act makes major reforms in six areas. Specifically, the SPCA: 
   Directs EPA to finish the job that was started nearly two decades ago by completing the evaluation of the 3,000 remaining sites on the CERCLA Information System (CERCLIS). 
   Clearly allocates responsibility between states and EPA for future cleanups. 
   Protects municipalities, small business, recyclers, and other parties from unfair liability--while making the system fairer for everyone else. 
   Provides states $100 million per year and full authority for their own cleanup programs. 
   Revitalizes communities with $100 million in annual brownfields redevelopment grants. 
   Requires fiscal responsibility by EPA and saves taxpayers money. 
   Our legislation will result in more hazardous waste sites being cleaned up--and in fewer dollars being wasted on litigation. It will give much-needed and much-deserved liability relief to innocent landowners, contiguous property owners, prospective purchasers, municipalities, small businesses and recyclers. Unlike EPA's administrative reforms, this bill does not shift costs from 
   politically popular parties to those left holding the bag. Instead, it requires payment of a statutory orphan share and authorizes the use of the Superfund Trust Fund for those shares. 
   For those left trapped in the Superfund liability scheme, the SPCA requires an allocation process to determine a party's fair share in an expedited settlement--instead of fighting it out for years in court. 
   In addition to increasing fairness, the SPCA provides much needed guidance and direction to a sometimes wayward EPA. It recognizes and builds upon the growth and strength of State hazardous waste cleanup programs. It provides new resources to States and localities for their cleanup and redevelopment efforts. As many of my colleagues know, the fear of Superfund liability has resulted in an estimated 450,000 abandoned or underutilized properties, or ``Brownfields,'' that lay fallow because private developers and municipalities don't want to be dragged into Superfund's litigation quagmire. With new resources and appropriate liability protections, our bill will allow the cleanup of those sites, spurring economic redevelopment in cities, towns, and rural areas across America. 
   We take a different approach to the brownfields redevelopment issue than  the Administration seeks. Along with many of my colleagues, I believe that economic redevelopment is primarily a State and local issue. Our approach provides the resources and freedom States need to make progress on this front, rather than giving EPA new authority to get into the commercial real estate and redevelopment business. That is not EPA's role, nor should it be. Where EPA does have a role is in identifying and addressing risks at uncontrolled hazardous waste sites. Our legislation ensures that EPA regains its focus on that mission. 
   Earlier this year, the General Accounting Office (GAO) reported that ``completion of construction at existing sites'' and reducing new entries into the program was the Environmental Protection Agency's top Superfund priority. Unfortunately, EPA's narrow focus on generating construction completion statistics appears to have diverted resources from EPA's fundamental mission--protecting human health and the environment from releases of hazardous waste. 
   GAO reported last year that there are still 3,000 sites awaiting a National Priorities List decision by EPA, most of which have been in the CERCLIS inventory for more than a decade. According to the report, however, more than 1,200 of those sites are actually ineligible for listing on the NPL, for a variety of reasons. Some of the sites were classified erroneously, while others either do not require cleanup, have already been cleaned up, or have final cleanup underway. EPA's failure to remove the specter of an NPL listing at these sites has likely caused significant economic and social harm to the surrounding communities. EPA needs to focus on that task. 
   In addition, far too many of the sites that are still potentially eligible for listing have received little or no attention from EPA. EPA admitted taking no cleanup action at all at 336 sites and provided no information for another 48 sites. The only action taken at 719 sites was an initial site assessment. EPA's inattention may be due to the fact that EPA and state officials together identified only 232 of the sites as worthy of being added to the NPL. In that case, however, the appropriate response is to archive the sites while ensuring that any necessary cleanup occurs under some other Federal or state program. EPA needs to focus on that task as well. 
   Unforfunately, there is also disagreement between EPA and state officials about even those 232 sites. EPA identified 132 that may be listed on the NPL in the future, but state officials agreed on only 26 of those. Conversely, state officials identified a different group of 100 sites as worthy of an NPL listing in the future. 
   EPA agreed with GAO's recommendation that it ``develop a joint strategy'' with the States for addressing these sites. After nearly 20 years and $20 billion in taxpayer funded EPA appropriations, it is disturbing that the agency only now is developing such a strategy. Nonetheless, Congress has an obligation to provide direction and assistance to EPA in this effort. The Superfund Program Completion Act provides that direction by: 
   Requiring EPA to finish evaluating and/or archiving old sites stuck in the CERCLIS inventory, correcting the current imbalance between evaluating uncontrolled sites and amassing construction completed statistics. 
   Providing EPA with a schedule of 30 NPL listings per year, to ensure that it and the States appropriately allocate sites for cleanup under Superfund, RCRA, or State response programs. 
   Increasing current law limits on EPA removal actions to provide greater flexibility in responding to sites that at least initially should be the responsibility of the Federal government, but ultimately do not require an NPL listing. 
   These provisions will ensure that the limited universe of sites remaining in the Superfund pipeline are dealt with quickly and safely. 
   In addition to keeping EPA focused on the task at hand, our bill provides increased resources and authority to the States, in recognition of the progress made by State cleanup programs in the last decade. 
   Superfund is notable among the major Federal environmental statutes not only for its abysmal track record, but also for its heavy reliance on EPA action rather than state implementation. In other environmental programs--RCRA, the Clean Water Act, the Safe Drinking Water Act--EPA typically sets general program direction and provides technical support while leaving implementation and enforcement to the states. In the Superfund program, however, EPA takes a direct role in both enforcement and cleanup. This leadership role was originally justified by a perceived inability or alleged unwillingness on the part of states to perform or oversee cleanups. The situation today is far different. 
   The Environmental Law Institute reported last year that States have now completed 41,000 cleanups, with another 13,700 in progress. The Association of State and Territorial Solid Waste Management Officials (ASTSWMO) reports that ``States are not only addressing more sites at any given time, but are also completing more sites through streamlined State programs. State programs have matured and increased in their infrastructure capacity.'' 
   Most now recognize that states have made great strides in their programs, and even EPA in May of 1998 released a ``Plan to Enhance the Role of States and Tribes in the Superfund Program.'' Not surprisingly, while that plan appears to provide some increased opportunities for state leadership, it also envisions a significant, on-going role for EPA. 
   The Superfund Program Completion Act, on the other hand, assists, recognizes and builds on the growth of state cleanup programs. The SPCA also responds to pleas from ASTSWMO, the National Governors Association and others to remove the ever-present threat of EPA over-filing and third party lawsuits under Superfund when a site is being cleaned up under a State program. The SPCA recognizes the fact that States should be the leaders in cleaning up hazardous waste sites by: 
   Providing $100 million annually for State core and voluntary response programs to allow States to build on their impressive record of accomplishment in this area. 
   Providing finality, except in cases of emergency or at a State's request, for cleanups conducted under State law. 
   Requiring EPA to work with the States so that sites listed on the NPL are those the Governor of the State agrees warrant an NPL listing. 
   Mr. President, the legislation we introduce today represents the culmination of years of hard work. In the four years I have been Chairman of the Superfund Subcommittee, we have heard from more than 100 witnesses, representing every viewpoint, in an effort to grapple with the problems caused by the Superfund law. We have communicated with thousands of individuals and organizations who have urged us to fix this law. 
   Senator CHAFEE and I have spent long hours with our Democratic colleagues on the Environment and Public Works Committee, and with EPA Administrator Carol Browner. So far, we and our staffs have devoted more than 600 hours to this effort. We have negotiated issues, identified areas of agreement, eliminated many areas of controversy, and pinpointed those few remaining areas where our differences will need to be resolved through the legislative process itself. I look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle during that process. 
   Before I close, let me say a few words about taxes. Simply put, there are no taxes required to finance this bill, and I will oppose all attempts to attach them to it. 
   Congress has appropriated more than $20 billion to support EPA's Superfund program during the past 19 years. The GAO reports that amount includes more than $6 billion of unrecovered ``recoverable costs.'' ``Recoverable costs'' are taxpayer expenditures that EPA made in anticipation of recovering them from individual polluters at sites. That sum alone would be sufficient to finance EPA's cleanup efforts throughout the life of this reauthorization. Our bill allows those funds to be used for cleanup when EPA does recover them. Further, there should be no doubt that Congress will continue to appropriate funds needed for EPA to finish its job. More taxes are not required to finance this bill or to finish the Superfund program. 
   During the last two Congresses, I was willing to support the reimposition of  taxes to finance Superfund legislation with major changes in the areas of remedy selection and natural resource damages--as well as more sweeping liability reforms than are contained in the bill we introduce today. There remains a real need for those reforms, and I pledge to continue my efforts in that regard. 
   The bill we introduce today, however, is designed to achieve all that we can under the current Administration. It represents substantial, real reform that will help thousands of communities and millions of Americans. I urge my colleagues to support it.

    Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the town of Plaistow, New Hampshire on its two hundred and fiftieth anniversary. The town's residents will celebrate this historic occasion on June 27, 1999 with a number of festivities including a grand reception. I was proud to be invited to participate in this meaningful event. 
   Plaistow's history first dates back to the year 1642 when families first settled in the Plaistow area. It was then that the Plaistow area was purchased. In 1749, Plaistow was incorporated. At that time, it was separated from Haverhill, Massachusetts. Then Governor Benning Wentworth, along with King George II signed the town's first charter. 
   The town has had a rich and fruitful history. The First Baptist Church was built in 1837, and subsequently remodeled in 1906. The first Catholic Church, Holy Angels, was built in 1893, then redone in 1964. The first high school was built in 1966. Prior to that, the students traveled outside the town for schooling. 
   Plaistow has steadily grown throughout the years. In 1854, there were 800 people. In 1949, the town had grown to 1800 people. Today, over 7000 people are residents of Plaistow. 
   Through the years, Plaistow residents have courageously served their country. They have served in the Colonial War, Revolutionary War, Civil War, World War I, World War II, the Korean War and the Vietnam War. 
   The most well known benefactor of the town was Arthur Pollard. Pollard donated the bell for the First Baptist Church, the land for Pollard School and the town hall, and the Civil War statue and cannons on the town green. 
   I congratulate the town of Plaistow, and all of the dedicated and patriotic citizens there. I am proud to be their Senator.

   Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Second Amendment Preservation Act of 1999. 
   Mr. President, my bill is intended to address the lawsuits that have been filed by various municipal governments against firearms manufacturers. These lawsuits are premised on the novel theory that manufacturers in full compliance with all of the laws governing the production of their products can nevertheless be held liable for the criminal misuse of those products by individuals who are completely beyond their control. This radical notion is flatly contrary to the principle of individual responsibility on which the tort laws of our Nation are based. 
   In at least some cases, Mr. President, these lawsuits seem to be intended to subject firearms manufacturers, importers and dealers to legal costs that are so onerous that they may not be able to defend themselves, or indeed be able to remain in business. A majority of firearms manufacturers, importers and dealers are small, privately-owned businesses that cannot afford to bear the legal costs of defending themselves in a large number of judicial forums. Moreover, compared to most firearms manufacturers, importers and dealers, States and local governments are large and relatively wealthy entities that are able to spend large amounts of taxpayers' dollars on wars of attrition against small business. 
   Mr. President, these lawsuits represent an effort by social activists and trial lawyers to use the Nation's judiciary to secure victories against the firearms industry that they never would be able to achieve through the legislative process. In fact, the firearms industry won't be the last target of these lawsuits. In a January 31, 1999, article in the Washington Post, plaintiffs' attorney John Coale stated ``..... we are interested in taking a close look at the exorbitant prices of prescription drugs for the elderly, for example.'' ``Unless the courts reject our approach,'' Coale continued, ``we will continue to utilize it to tackle industry bullies.'' 
   Thankfully, Mr. President, the public is not fooled. A December, 1998, survey of 1,008 U.S. adults by DecisionQuest, a jury consulting firm, found that 66.2% of American adults oppose these lawsuits against firearms manufacturers. Only 19.3% of Americans believe that these suits are justified. 
   Even some anti-gun elements of the media oppose these lawsuits. A March 1, 1999, editorial in the Boston Globe stated that ``..... guns should be controlled by the legislative process rather than through litigation.'' ``gun makers may be responsible for flaws in their products that lead to injury or death,'' the editorial continued. ``Making manufacturers liable for the actions of others,'' the editorial concluded, ``..... stretches the boundaries beyond reasonable limits .......'' 
   Mr. President, I believe that fairness requires that a unit of government that undertakes an unsuccessful ``fishing expedition'' against a firearms manufacturer, importer or dealer should bear the costs of that business in defending itself against such an frivolous and unwarranted civil action. Fairness also requires that taxpayers not be required to pay millions of dollars to wealthy attorneys, out of  awards that are intended, at least in part, to benefit the victims of crime. 
   The second amendment to the Constitution of the United States requires that Congress must respond to actions that are intended to, and that would have the effect of, nullifying that provision of the Bill of Rights. Congress has the power under the second amendment, and under the Commerce Clause, to take appropriate action to protect the rights of citizens to obtain and own firearms. 
   Onr action that Congress may take, Mr. President, is to provide protection from excessive and unwarranted legal fees. The Second Amendment Preservation Act, which I am introducing today, provides that protection. My bill limits attorneys' fees to plaintiffs in civil lawsuits that seek ``to hold a firearms manufacturer, importer, or dealer liable for damages caused by the unlawful or tortuous use of a firearm by a person not employed by or affiliated with the manufacturer, dealer, or importer.'' Under my bill, those fees are limited to the lesser of $150 per hour, plus expenses, or 10% of the amount that the plaintiff is awarded in the action. 
   Further, my bill provides that in lawsuits in which the defendant is found by the court to be ``not wholly or primarily liable for the damages sought,'' the plaintiff must reimburse the defendant for reasonable attorney's fees and costs. 
   Finally, Mr. President, my bill provides that if a court strikes down this legislation as unconstitutional, the decision is directly appealable as of right to the Supreme Court of the United States.

   Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to an American hero. We could use some heroes today, of all days, considering the last few days we have had in America. But I rise today to pay tribute to retired Col. Theodore Wilson Guy, United States Air Force, from Missouri. Ted Guy, nicknamed the ``Hawk'' by those who knew him best, was a genuine American hero. He was best known for having sacrificed his freedom for his country as a U.S. POW during the Vietnam war. But aside from being a hero, perhaps more importantly, Ted would say he was a husband, a father, a brother, and a friend to many, including myself. Last Friday, April 23, 1999, Ted passed away only 6 months after discovering symptoms associated with leukemia. 
   I will always remember Ted Guy for the encouraging faxes and e-mails he used to send to my office, especially during the investigation conducted by the Senate Select Committee on POW/MIA Affairs, which I cochaired in the early 1990s. I gained a lot of strength from those inspiring messages from this hero. Ted will never know, but I want his family to know how much those messages meant to me. 
   Ted felt strongly that our Government needed to do more to account for his missing comrades from the Vietnam war. He traveled at his own expense to Washington, DC, to the Halls of Congress, to make this point. 
   Ted was right to be concerned about our Government's handling of the issue of POWs and MIAs, and with his support, and the support of his fellow veterans and family members of POWs and MIAs, we have made significant progress in opening the books, declassifying the records, and pressing foreign governments for answers over the last decade. 
   However, as Ted continued to maintain up until his last days with us, there is still much work to be done with our accounting effort, and I, for one, am committed to seeing this issue through, in part because of people like Ted. 
   I commit to you, Ted, we will keep working. We owe it to you. 
   I say to the youth of America, if you want a role model to aspire to and to inspire you, they do not come any better than men like Ted Guy. When looking for a hero, oftentimes young people  look to professional athletes or others. You want to remember that a hero is not only somebody you care for, but if they are a real hero, that person will care about you, too. 
   Ted joined the Air Force in 1947. He served his country as an Air Force fighter pilot for the next 26 years. He served in both the Korean and Vietnam wars flying the F-84 in the Korean theater and the F-4 in the Vietnam theater. On March 22, 1968, while attacking an automatic weapons position near the Vietnamese-Laotian border during the battle of Khe Sanh, Ted's plane was shot down and he was captured by the Communist forces. 
   Ted Guy was subsequently marched up the Ho Chi Minh Trail and then held in several POW camps in the Hanoi area, to include the infamous Hanoi Hilton. He was brutally tortured by the North Vietnamese to the point where he would pass out from severe beatings. He also was forced to spend nearly 4 years in solitary confinement. 
   He was one tough guy--Ted Guy. He did not talk about it much, though. You could not get him to talk about it. He was not looking for sympathy. 
   When he was finally removed from solitary confinement, he was put in a prison with more than 100 other U.S. military and civilian prisoners. He became the senior officer among them and was responsible for maintaining order, the chain of command, and the code of conduct among his fellow POWs. 
   His leadership and guidance helped his fellow POWs survive their ordeal. Many have said just that. Many referred to themselves as ``Hawks' Heroes'' in honor of Ted Guy. 
   To the code of conduct, Ted added his own personal code that consisted of two points. The first point was to resist until unable to resist any longer before doing anything to embarrass his family or his country. The second point was to accept death before losing his honor. 
   Ted once said:  
   Honor is something that once you lose it, you become like an insect in the jungle. You prey upon others and others prey upon you until there is nothing left. Once you lose your honor, all the gold in the world is useless in your attempt to regain it.  
   Mr. President, Ted Guy never, never lost his honor. What an inspiration he was to all Americans. I wish more Americans could have known him personally. I wish more Americans knew more about Ted Guy. He leaves behind his wife Linda of 26 years, four sons and two stepdaughters. He touched a lot of people--so many people. 
   However, his unselfish and patriotic sacrifices for America and his heartfelt concerns about efforts to account for his missing comrades from the Vietnam war who never made it home were huge accomplishments. I was proud to call him a friend, and I already miss him. 
   As with other POWs, Ted used a tap code in Hanoi to communicate through the walls with other POWs. It was an alphabet matrix--five lines across, five lines down. Ted used to end his messages by tapping the code ``GBU,'' or ``God bless you,'' and ``CUL'' for ``See you later.'' 
   I end my tribute with the same message to Ted: ``GBU CUL, Ted.''

   Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I would like to take a few minutes to introduce important environmental legislation that will have a significant and positive impact on our nation's waterways. Today, along with my colleague from Maine, Senator SNOWE, and seven other cosponsors, I am introducing the Combined Sewer Overflow Control and Partnership Act of 1999. 
   While the title of this bill, indeed, the subject matter itself, may not be the most exciting, front-burner policy issue of the day, the control of overflows from sewer systems is a serious environmental and financial concern for hundreds of communities across this country. For my own state of New Hampshire, there are six communities with combined sewer overflow, or CSO, problems. The cities of Manchester, Nashua, Portsmouth, Exeter, Berlin, and Lebanon are all facing this challenge. 
   I have worked closely with the mayors of these cities over the past several years and have seen first-hand the environmental problems. This legislation is aimed at helping CSO communities comply with Clean Water Act mandates to reduce or eliminate overflows into nearby rivers and streams. CSOs are the last permitted point source discharges of untreated or partially treated sewage into the nation's waters. For those colleagues who don't have CSO communities in their states, I'll briefly explain what they are. 
   Combined sewer systems collect sanitary sewage from homes and office buildings during periods of dry weather for conveyance to wastewater treatment plants for treatment. However, these systems also receive storm water during wet weather, which typically causes a hydraulic overload of the 
   system, triggering the discharge of untreated wastewater to receiving waters through combined sewer overflow outfalls. Not a pleasant sight. 
   Most combined systems were installed at the turn of the century when they were state-of-the-art sewer technology, mainly in the Northeast and Midwest regions of the country. Controlling or eliminating CSO discharges is an enormously expensive proposition  that often requires communities to completely rebuild their sewer systems. The national cost estimates to complete this job range from $50 billion to $100 billion. Compounding the sheer financial magnitude of the CSO problem is the fact that the vast majority of the approximately 1,000 CSO communities nationwide have less than 10,000 residents, or ratepayers. These ratepayers could pay hundreds of dollars more per year on their water bills without this legislation. With these statistics, it is not surprising that a CSO control program often poses the single largest public works project in a CSO community's history. 
   Although the Federal Clean Water Act does not specifically speak to the issue of combined sewers, it has been interpreted to require the control and treatment of CSO discharges. Recognizing the financial burden this would pose on small towns, in 1994, the Environmental Protection Agency issued the ``Combined Sewer Overflow Policy,'' which allowed CSO control programs to be developed in the most cost-effective, flexible and site-specific manner possible. This policy was developed with the input from many stakeholders, including local governments, environmental groups, and engineering firms, and was viewed as a major step forward in tackling this problem through commonsense means. 
   Unfortunately, this policy is just an administrative policy and lacks statutory authority. So, one of the most important provisions of this bill would essentially codify or affirm EPA's CSO Policy. This provision will give CSO communities the legal protection and regulatory relief they so desperately need. A key component of the CSO Policy is to ensure that water quality standards are consistent with whatever CSO control plans are mandated. 
   The second part of the bill sets up a partnership between the Federal Government and our local governments by authorizing five years of funding assistance for these communities. While there is a State revolving loan fund under the Clean Water Act that provides loan assistance to municipalities for water treatment, the SRF cannot possibly meet the needs of these CSO communities. The financial burden of CSO control programs generally far exceed the capacity of local ratepayers to assume the full cost. 
   I emphasize that ratepayers cannot assume the full cost of these programs. 
   While this bill does authorize new funding assistance, I do not intend for this funding to increase EPA's overall budget. As many of my colleagues are aware, numerous earmarks for CSOs or other public works projects are frequently included in appropriations bills. I am hoping that the existence of a CSO assistance program at EPA will discourage the practice of earmarking specific projects and seek competitive funding through this program. 
   In conclusion, Mr. President, I would like to add that this legislation has been endorsed by the CSO Partnership, a recognized coalition of CSO communities and mayors. I would also like to thank Senator SNOWE for her support and assistance on this legislation, as well as the other original cosponsors: Senators WARNER, VOINOVICH, COLLINS, ABRAHAM, ROBB, HAGEL, and LUGAR. I am hopeful that we will have an opportunity to consider this legislation in the Environment and Public Works Committee and the full Senate sometime this year. It is both proenvironment and procommunity and I ask for my colleagues support and welcome their cosponsorship.

   Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Right to Life Act of 1999. 
   Our Nation's founding document, the Declaration of Independence, declared for all the world that we hold it to be self-evident that the right to life comes from God and that it is unalienable. Life itself, the Declaration held, is the fundamental right without which the rights to liberty and the pursuit of happiness have to meaning. As the author of the Declaration, Thomas Jefferson, later wrote, ``The care of human life and not its destruction . . . is the first and only object of good government.'' 
   Almost 200 years after the Declaration of Independence, however, in 1973, the United States Supreme Court violated its most sacred principle. In Roe versus Wade, the Supreme Court held that the entire class of unborn children--from fertilization to birth--have no right to life and may be destroyed at will. In subsequent cases, the Court has zealously guarded the right to abortion that it created. The Court has repeatedly rejected all meaningful attempts by the States to protect the unalienable right to life of unborn children. 
   Those of us who proudly count ourselves to be members of the right-to-life movement must not lose sight of our ultimate goal. Our objective is to keep the Declaration's promise by reversing Roe versus Wade and restoring to unborn children their God-given right to life. In order to keep that hope alive in the Senate, I am introducing today the ``Right to Life Act of 1999.'' 
   My bill first sets forth several findings of Congress regarding the fundamental right to life and the tragic constitutional errors of Roe versus Wade. Based on these findings and in the exercise of the powers of the Congress under Article I, Section 8, of the Constitution, and Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution, my bill establishes that ``the right to life guaranteed by the Constitution is vested in each human being at fertilization.''

    Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to honor Jeffrey Pollock on being named ``New Hampshire's 1999 Small Business Financial Services Advocate of the Year'' by the Small Business Association. 
   As President of New Hampshire Business Development Corporation in Manchester, New Hampshire, Jeffrey was selected for this award for his outstanding advocacy for entrepreneurs in New Hampshire. In fact, Jeffrey's strong support and dedication to small businesses has been a pivotal force in helping many small businesses succeed. 
   During the banking crisis of the early 1990's Jeffrey worked alongside the Small Business Administration and state leaders to revive the New Hampshire Development Corporation for the purpose of providing loans to credit-starved small businesses in New Hampshire. 
   Today, the New Hampshire Development Corporation offers a wide array of financial products and services aimed at helping small businesses succeed. Over the past nine years, Jeffrey has been instrumental in providing $12 million of investment to New Hampshire businesses. 
   In 1995, Jeffrey represented New Hampshire as a delegate to the White House Conference on Small Business, and in 1998 New Hampshire's current Governor appointed him to the State Board of Education. In addition, Jeffrey has also served on numerous state and congressional boards and advisory committees. 
   As a former small business owner, I recognize the important contributions that Jeffrey has made to the Small Business Administration and, especially, to small businesses across the Granite State. Mr. President, small business is the backbone of our economy in the United States. I am proud to honor and congratulate Jeffrey for receiving this award and it is an honor to represent him in the United States Senate.

    Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the University of New Hampshire's hockey team, the Wildcats, on their outstanding season. Their stellar performance was a great accomplishment. 
   The University of New Hampshire hockey team had the best record in NCAA hockey this season. They were ranked number one in the nation in college hockey. Senior Captain Jason Krog was the winner of the Hobey Baker Award, the most prestigious award in college hockey. In short, they had a tremendous season. 
   The Wildcats competed in the NCAA final four tournament (the Frozen Four) in Anaheim, California. The team went into the final round of the tournament as the favorite. They beat Michigan on April 1 by a score of five to three. They advanced to the finals to face the University of Maine. The game between the University of Maine and the University of New Hampshire was extremely exciting. The game went into sudden death over time before the University of Maine ultimately prevailed. Although they were not successful, the team showed true sportsmanship and team spirit in the wake of an amazing season. 
   Once again, I would like to pay tribute to the University of New Hampshire Wildcats hockey team, as well as their coach, Dick Umile. I wish them luck in the future and their following seasons. It is an honor to represent them in the United States Senate.

    Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Arlene Magoon for being named 1999 ``New Hampshire Women in Business Advocate of the Year'' by the U.S. Small Business Administration. This award is a great accreditation to her work. 
   Arlene is a childcare advocate and the founder and operator of American Nanny and Family Care Services, an Amherst-based child and elderly care referral agency. She founded her organization to provide family child care after she had difficulty finding childcare for her own three young children. Arlene's business offers a referral service, as well as training for child care providers in the state. Her service is an asset to the state of New Hampshire. 
   Arlene founded her business in 1990. She personally met with 300 New Hampshire family care providers in the process of deciding which child care facilities she feels are deserving of referrals. Over 65 percent of the childcare providers she has assisted in the past decade are still in business. Many of her business colleagues have commended her dedication and professionalism of her work. 
   Her service to the children of New Hampshire is a gift. I wish to thank her for her efforts and wish the best of luck in her future endeavors. It is an honor to represent her in the United States Senate.

   Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Accompanying the amendment were floor statements expressing our intent that the offset be derived from within the Department of Commerce, and specifically within Function 370. After negotiations with Senators LEAHY and FEINGOLD and other Democratic colleagues who cosponsored the amendment, we reached a bipartisan agreement that the $200 million would come from within the Commerce Department.

    Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Edith (``Edie'') Schmidtchen on her retirement as the Town Clerk for Bedford, New Hampshire after thirty-five years of service. She has had an exceptionally distinguished career with the Town of Bedford. 
   Edie began her career in Bedford as the Assistant to the Town Clerk. She was promoted and served as the Deputy Town Clerk and then served as the Town Clerk for twenty-one years. Her dedication to the Town and the State of New Hampshire is truly admirable. 
   Edie has also been very active in the community during her time in the Town Clerk's office. She has been a volunteer teacher for the Bedford Mother's Club, an active member of the Bedford Presbyterian Church, and Secretary of the Town of Bedford Planning Board. She has also participated in  many other activities that have bettered her community. 
   My thoughts and best wishes are with Edie, her children and her grandchildren for success in their future endeavors. Once again, I congratulate her on her retirement and thank her for her thirty-five years of continual service to the Town of Bedford. It is an honor to represent her in the United States Senate.

    Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize and congratulate Paul Slater of Londonderry, New Hampshire for his outstanding volunteerism and for being selected to serve as President of the Londonderry Lions Club for the next year. 
   Paul Began his volunteer work with the Londonderry Lions Club in September 1995. His unwavering commitment to the organization, its mission, and its activism within the community propelled hi to the club's Board of Directors during the summer of 1996. Today, Paul serves as both the Treasurer and Secretary of the Londonderry Lions Club. 
   Dedicated to social and humanitarian causes, Lions Club International is the world's largest service organization. With its primary focus on the needs of the blind and visually impaired, the mission of Lions Club International also extends to the needs of each chapter's respective communities. In addition to advancing the club's mission by organizing yearly yard sales and fund-raising dinners, Paul continuously works towards the betterment of his community and state. 
   Every year since his induction as a member of the Londonderry Lions Club, Paul has helped organize and distribute Christmas and Thanksgiving baskets to those who are less fortunate in the Town of Londonderry. His biggest contribution to the organization and the people of New Hampshire, however, has been through his tireless effort towards improving Lions Camp Pride. Camp Pride, located in New Durham, New Hampshire, is a summer camp for children and adults with mild through profound special needs. In cooperation with the Londonderry Police and Fire Departments, Paul has been instrumental in insuring that the proceeds from the annual Police-Fire softball game are contributed to Lions Camp Pride. 
   Having served as an honorary member of the Lions Camp Pride Board, I recognize the importance and the value of Paul's work and I would like to thank him for his commitment to Lions Camp Pride. 
   Furthermore, Paul has continuously exhibited his unselfish dedication to the community as the Chairman of the Londonderry Lions Club High School Scholarship Committee. As a strong believer in education and equal opportunity, Paul has worked hard to insure that students with financial hardship who work hard and strive for academic excellence can still pursue college and technical educations. 
   Mr. President, Paul Slater has devoted his time and his heart to serving the Londonderry Lions Club, the Town of Londonderry, and the people of New Hampshire. It is people like Paul that make New Hampshire a special place to live, and it is an honor to represent him in the United States Senate.

   Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, yesterday, I joined Senator ASHCROFT and others in offering an amendment to the budget resolution for Fiscal Year 2000. Our amendment addresses a troubling aspect of the President's Social Security proposal, about which I would like to say a few words. 
   President Clinton's plan calls for government-controlled investment of a sizeable portion of the Social Security trust funds. Our amendment expresses the sense of the Senate that the Federal government should not be directly investing the Social Security trust funds in private financial markets. 
   Enabling the Federal government to own millions of dollars worth of private shares in corporations is a recipe for disaster. No matter how much care is taken to avoid bias in government-controlled investment decisions, the potential for abuse would always be present. Even if an independent board is charged with making the investment decisions on behalf of the government, there is always the risk that the board would be overwhelmed by political pressure from lobbyists, lawmakers and others. 
   Inevitably, special interest groups or politicians would seek to influence the investment decisions. Questions such as whether or not a particular investment would benefit a corporation that hires union workers or is located in a certain state might become important considerations. The result would be that the rate of return on an investment would become secondary to numerous political or other concerns. 
   Also, under the President's plan, the government would eventually own private stocks worth $600 billion or more. That could have perverse effects on the free market. 
   Government-controlled investment of the Social Security trust funds would make possible what some have called ``crony capitalism.'' In a recent paper on this subject, Daniel Mitchell of the Heritage Foundation warned that government-controlled investment would give lawmakers power to control the economy indirectly by attempting to pick winners and losers. 
   The Federal Reserve Chairman, Alan Greenspan, is one of the more noteworthy critics of President Clinton's idea for government-controlled investment. Chairman Greenspan has said that it ``would arguably put at risk the efficiency of our capital markets and thus, our economy.'' Mr. President, the Senate should heed his words and reject any plan to have the government directly involved in the investment of Social Security trust funds.

   Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I am pleased to sponsor, along with the gentleman from Rhode Island and others, an amendment to increase funding for the Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF). Our amendment would accomplish two important goals. 
   First, the amendment authorizes $200 million in matching grants to states for their conservation and recreation programs. The amendment therefore would help fulfill a thirty-five year-old Federal commitment that has been largely ignored in recent years. 
   Second, our amendment maintains Congress' commitment to living within the budget agreement by offsetting the increased LWCF funding with an equivalent reduction in programs within the Department of Commerce. 
   Let me speak first about the LWCF. As most of my colleagues know, the Land and Water Conservation Fund was established in 1964, and it has been the main source of Federal funding for Federal and state recreational lands. The LWCF accumulates revenues from outdoor recreation user fees, the federal motorboat fuel tax, surplus property sales, and, most significantly, revenue from oil and gas leases on the Outer Continental Shelf. Due to early successes and strong support, authorized funding levels increased steadily from the initial authorization of $60 million to the program's current $900 million level--although appropriations have consistently fallen far short of authorized levels. 
   Until Fiscal Year 1995, about one third of the total $10 billion appropriated under this program went directly to the states. The rest of the revenue was split between four Federal agencies: the Park Service, the Forest Service, the Fish and Wildlife Service, and the Bureau of Land Management. 
   Matching grants to states have funded some 37,000 projects and helped conserve 2.3 million acres of land. While the law requires at least a 50% match from states receiving funds, in some cases the Federal grants enabled states to leverage up to seven times the grant amount. 
   The LWCF has enjoyed widespread support, both in my home State of New Hampshire and across the nation. 
   The LWCF has truly been, up until recent years, a Federal-state partnership that works. 
   In the early years of the program, the bulk of the funding for LWCF went directly to the states. However, the state share of LWCF funding has declined dramatically since Fiscal Year 1978, when annual LWCF appropriations stabilized at between $200 and $300 million after fiscal year 1978, but the state portion of LWCF appropriations steadily declined until Fiscal  Year 1996, when grants to states were completely eliminated. Since Fiscal Year 1996, overall funding for LWCF has begun to increase again, but all of the money has been appropriated for the Federal-side of the program, and none for the states. 
   Mr. President, to put it simply: that is wrong. These revenues were originally intended to be shared between the Federal Government and the states. We should not penalize states like New Hampshire that can effectively manage these funds and that have critical needs which must be addressed. The idea that only the Federal government can be trusted to conserve resources is again, Mr. President, simply wrong. 
   Last month, more than 100 elected officials, community representatives and other New Hampshire citizens sent a letter to the Chairman of the Budget Committee, expressing their strong support for the LWCF and other conservation partnership programs. I ask unanimous consent that their letter be inserted into the RECORD, along with a letter that I and thirty-five of my colleagues sent to the Chairman on this topic as well. 
   Today's amendment will help bring back some balance to this program by providing $200 million for states from the LWCF. Our amendment will not reduce LWCF appropriations to Federal agencies, but will, as I stated earlier, offset this increased funding with a corresponding reduction in appropriations for certain Commerce Department activities within Budget Function 370.

   Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Term Limits for Judges Amendment to the Constitution of the United States. I first introduced this proposal in the 105th Congress, with Senators SHELBY and HELMS as co-sponsors. I am pleased that both of those distinguished colleagues are joining me again as original co-sponsors. 
   Mr. President, the Framers of our Constitution intended that the judicial branch created by Article III would have a limited role. In Federalist No. 78, Alexander Hamilton argued that the judicial branch ``will always be the least dangerous to the political rights of the Constitution.'' Courts, wrote Hamilton, ``have neither force nor will but merely judgment'' and ``can take no active resolution whatever.'' Even as he advocated the ratification of the Constitution, however, Hamilton also issued a warning. ``The courts,'' he said, ``must declare the sense of the law; and if they should be disposed to exercise will instead of judgment the consequence would equally be the substitution of their pleasure to that of the legislative body.'' 
   More than two hundred years after Alexander Hamilton issued his warning, it is abundantly clear that the abuse of judicial power that he feared has become a reality. In recent years, for example, activist judges have repeatedly abused their authority by blocking the implementation of entirely constitutional measures enacted through state ballot referenda simply because they disagree with the policy judgments of the voters. Activist judges have taken control or prisons and school districts. Activist judges have even ordered tax increases. Worst of all, activist judges have created new rules to protect criminal defendants that result in killers, rapists and other violent individuals being turned loose to continue preying on society. Former U.S. Attorney General Edwin Meese estimates that over 100,000 criminal cases each year cannot be successfully prosecuted because of these court-created rules. 
   Mr. President, judicial activism has become such a severe problem that former U.S. Appeals Court Judge Robert Bork has proposed that the Constitution should be amended to give the Congress the power to overturn Supreme Court decisions. I believe, however, that a better solution is a constitutional amendment providing term limits for judges. 
   The Term Limits for Judges Amendment would put an end to life tenure for judges. Judges at all three levels of the Article III judiciary--Supreme Court, Appeals Courts, and District Courts--would be nominated by the President and, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, appointed for 10-year terms. After completing such a term, a judge would be eligible for reappointment, subject to Senate confirmation. Since under the Twenty-Second Amendment no person can be President for more than 10 consecutive years, no judge could be appointed twice by the same President. Finally, judges appointed before the Amendment takes effect would be protected by a ``grandfather'' clause. 
   Mr. President, activist judges are routinely violating the separation of powers by usurping legislative and executive powers. This widespread abuse of judicial authority is constitutional in dimension and it is serious enough to warrant a constitutional response. Term limits for judges would establish a check on the power of activists judges. No longer could they abuse their authority with impunity. Under the Term Limits for Judges Amendment, judges who abuse their offices by imposing their own policy views instead of interpreting the laws in good faith could be passed over for new terms by the President or rejected for reappointment by the Senate. Moreover, the Term Limits for Judges Amendment would make the President and the Senate more accountable to the people for their judicial selections.

    Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Contoocook Valley Regional High School for winning the regional competition of the Second Annual Ocean Sciences Bowl. I commend them for their accomplishment. 
   The regional competition included teams from fifteen other schools in New Hampshire, Vermont and Maine. Their final match, which was held at the University of New Hampshire, was played against high school students from Bridgeton Maine. It was a close call and Contoocook Valley won by the narrow margin of two points! 
   Contoocook Valley's team consists of five students. The team members are Amber Carter, Megan Cahill, Sonja Fritz, Cissy Courtemanche, and Emily Dark. Jon Manley, science teacher at the Contoocook Valley, is the coach for the team. 
   The students train very hard every year for this competition. This is the second year in a row that Contoocook Valley Regional High School has won this competition. They will soon be traveling to Washington, D.C. to compete in the nationals. 
   As a former high school teacher, I appreciate the hard work the students and the coach have dedicated to this team effort. I look forward to their visit to Washington and wish them the best of luck. It is an honor to represent them in the United States Senate.

   Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise to introduce a bill that I am calling the ``Brady Act Amendments of 1999,'' which would remove ``long guns'' from the requirements of the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS). I am pleased to be joined by my distinguished colleagues, Senators CRAIG, INHOFE, and HELMS, as original co-sponsors. 
   Mr. President, Congress has imposed many restrictions on firearms sales over the years, with no apparent effect on reducing crime. By contrast, the most effective crime fighting initiatives have been undertaken at the state and local levels. Many states have dramatically reduced crime by increasing their incarceration rates. Local governments, such as that of Richmond, Virginia, reduced crime rates by aggressively prosecuting cases involving possession of firearms by convicted felons and drug dealers--not by imposing any new restrictions on the purchase of firearms. 
   In fact, Mr. President, states that have fewer restrictions on the purchase of firearms have more favorable crime reduction trends than other states. Despite all of the favorable media fanfare over the Brady Act, states that were covered by its ``waiting period'' phase until the NICS went into effect late last year actually had worse crime trends than other states. 
   The Federal Bureau of Investigation notes that out of the total number of homicides in a recent reporting period that were committed with firearms, less than 7% were committed with rifles, and less than 7% were committed with shotguns. Out of the total number of homicides, rifles and shotguns each were used in 4%, while knives, which may be purchased without clearance by the NICS, were used in 13% of such cases. 
   Mr. President, my bill would amend the Brady Act to make the NICS apply not to firearms in general, but only to handguns.

   Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, the legislation before us--which Senator LOTT has introduced--is an amendment which I drafted several weeks ago when I saw the administration lurching toward war in Yugoslavia. I believe that Congress should determine whether or not America should commit an act of war against a  sovereign nation inside its own borders. 
   Regardless of what your view is on the conflict in Kosovo, I sense that most of my colleagues agree that Congress should take a position on any action in Kosovo. We simply cannot turn this or any other administration loose to commit acts of war around the world without the demonstrated support of the American people. We did that once in Vietnam. We know the results. Politicians stood here and debated it, and men and women died every day. 
   The purpose of my amendment is very simple. It simply requires Congress to debate, and then approve or deny, the use of military force in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. That is it, pure and simple. If you want the Congress to have a say in this, you should vote for my amendment. If you think the President should be able to go to war against a sovereign nation without the support of Congress, you should vote against my amendment. 
   This raises constitutional issues for some of my colleagues. I want to dispense with them right away. It is clear that the President has the power to commit U.S. forces to battle--this President or any other President--and he has the power to command them once they are committed. I interpret this authority as allowing the President to respond swiftly and unencumbered to an immediate threat to U.S. lives, liberty, or property. 
   We have seen in history, some of it recent, that a President can interpret this authority very loosely. But we also have seen that when Presidents use force in a way that they do not or cannot explain to the American people, and for a cause the American people do not in their gut support, that policy collapses. We saw it by the end of the war in Vietnam. We saw it in Somalia, in 1994. We saw it in Beirut in 1983. Republican and Democrat Presidents alike have learned this lesson. 
   It is entirely constitutional for the Congress to withhold funds from any activity of the Federal Government. It is the Constitution itself, Article I, Section 8, which gives us that power. This so-called power of the purse is a blunt instrument--there is no question about that--and one we should use sparingly, but it is sometimes the only instrument we in Congress have. It is why the administration must seek consensus, or at least some majority, in support of military hostilities. 
   So we should undertake an examination of this proposed action and then speak for the American people. We must consider our interests, the question of sovereignty, the nature of the conflict and the risks, and what we are trying to accomplish. 
   What are our interests? The administration has a hard time explaining why U.S. interests are at stake in Kosovo. This is not surprising. There are certainly no American lives at risk--not yet, at least. American liberty and American property are not threatened. It is not a humanitarian mission like the assistance we have given to Central America in the wake of Hurricane Mitch. 
   Nor is loss of life the administration's standard. Two thousand people have been killed in the fighting in Kosovo in the past year. That is a lot of people. However, in just 6 weeks in 1994, half a million Rwandans died. We didn't launch any cruise missiles in Rwanda, Mr. President. There, we did not launch any cruise missiles when half a million people died. 
   If anything, the administration's statements have added confusion to a very complex issue. During a recent Armed Services Committee hearing, I asked Under Secretary of State Thomas Pickering whether or not an attack on the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia would be an act of war. His response goes right to the heart of the problem I have with the actions of this administration. Here is what Mr. Pickering said:  
   Well, an act of war, as you know, and I have recently found out, is a highly technical term. My lawyers tell me ..... that an act of war, the term is an obsolete term in anything but a broad generic sense. If you would say that Milosevic, in attacking and chasing Albanians, harassing, torturing, killing Albanians and sending them to the hills is anything but an act of war, I would certainly agree with you on that particular judgement. If, in fact, we need to use force to stop that kind of behavior and also to bring about a settlement which recognizes the rights of those people which have been denied, I would tell you that it might well be a war-like act, although the technical term ``act of war'' is something we ought to be careful to avoid in terms of some of its former meanings that have consequences beyond merely the use of the term.  
   That sounds like a pretty bureaucratic explanation to me, Mr. President, but I will tell you one thing: To the young men and women who are going to be asked to put their lives on the line in Kosovo, there can be no bureaucratic explanation about what a declaration of war is or is not. It is not the lawyers Mr. Pickering is referring to who are going to fight. It is not the lawyers who are going to be manning the aircraft. It is not the lawyers who are going to be captured as POWs. It is not the lawyers who have to go in and get those POWs if they are shot down. It is the young men and women of our Armed Forces. I was then, and I continue to be, absolutely astounded by Mr. Pickering's response. 
   The administration tells us that we must become involved in the internal affairs of Yugoslavia to prevent the spread of this conflict into neighboring nations, including perhaps NATO members. This is a bogeyman argument, and it is meant to scare us into resolving this conflict by using American military forces. It obscures the real issue: should American troops be placed at risk in an area of the world where we have no real interests which justify direct intervention? Risking U.S. troops in a war in Kosovo is far more dangerous to American interests than the small risk that the conflict would spread. 
   The argument is also made that the conflict in Kosovo threatens NATO and threatens American leadership of NATO. There is nothing in the North Atlantic Treaty that authorizes NATO to commit the kinds of actions we are talking about here. NATO is not an offensive alliance, it is a defensive alliance. As a matter of fact, it was created to prevent aggression against the sovereign nations of Europe. By using NATO to attack a sovereign nation, we are about to turn the alliance on its head. 
   We are only weakening the alliance by using its forces offensively in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. The core of the alliance has always been to protect members from attack, not to be peace enforcers, not to meddle in the internal affairs of a sovereign nation--no matter how despicable the acts that are being committed are--and certainly not to dictate a peace agreement under the threat of violence. By intervening in this civil war, I fear the alliance is not showing strength to the world, but weakness and confusion. 
   Mr. President, NATO expansion has already diluted NATO's strength. By becoming enmeshed in the internal affairs of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, the alliance is distancing itself further from its core mission, which is to ensure the protection of its members. Although I opposed and continue to oppose expansion of NATO, I am a supporter of NATO and its core mission. But if this is what NATO has become--a means of dragging the United States into every minor conflict around Europe's edges--then maybe we should get out of NATO. 
   We are about to begin a high-risk military operation--a war--against a sovereign nation. Not because Americans have been attacked, not because our allies have been attacked, but because we disapprove of the internal policy of the Federal Republic Yugoslavia. That policy is easy to disapprove, but that is a very low standard to apply the use of force. If we applied that standard around the world, we would be launching cruise missiles around the world. 
   The fundamental question is whether the lives of American soldiers are worth interfering in the internal affairs of a sovereign nation where there are no vital U.S. interests at risk. This is not Iraq in 1990, where a ruthless tyrant invaded a peaceful neighboring country. This is a case of a disaffected population revolting against its government. Is Milosevic a 
   tyrant? Yes, absolutely. But his tyranny is happening inside his own nation. 
   We are dictating, under the threat of military action, the internal policy of Yugoslavia. We may not like that policy, but is that reason to go to war? Moreover, is it reason to let the President of the United States go to war without an act of Congress? That is the question before us today. It is a very  serious question, and our actions in this body will have ramifications for many years to come. This very well may be one of the most important votes we make on the Senate floor this year. 
   The conflict in Kosovo is a civil war. Neither side wants to be involved in the peace agreement that we are trying to impose. It took weeks of arm twisting and coercion just to get the Kosovo Liberation Army to agree to the deal. The administration had to send our distinguished former leader, Bob Dole, to persuade them to accept the agreement. 
   Both the KLA and the Serbs still want to fight, and they will fight until they do not want to fight anymore. We will be using U.S. troops, not as peacekeepers, but as peace enforcers. There is a difference. Peacekeepers are there to assist the transition to stability. Peace enforcers are there as policemen to separate two parties who want to do nothing but fight. They are not interested in an agreement. They still want to fight. By jamming the agreement down their throats, the administration is not solving the problem. At best, it is delaying it. 
   Many proponents of military intervention in Kosovo cite World War I as a lesson as to the ultimate danger of a crisis in the Balkans. They have it exactly backwards. A Balkan war became a world war in 1914 not because there was strife, but because the great powers of that day allowed themselves to become entangled in that strife. We need to heed this lesson. We did not fight and win the Cold War just to be dragged into marginal conflicts like this one. 
   Why are the Balkans so prone to conflict? The main reason is that this is where Christianity and Islam collide. Strife along these lines has gone on virtually uninterrupted for a millennium. This is no place for America to get bogged down. I believe in America and American power, but these are conflicts that America cannot solve. 
   The administration is prepared to send our pilots into combat against a combat-hardened nation that is well equipped to defend itself from attack. Let there be no doubt--I will say it here now in this Chamber--let there be no doubt, American lives will be in danger. This act will result in the deaths of American servicemen. The Joint Chiefs testified before the Armed Services Committee last week. They tried to tell us, as carefully as they could. 
   General Ryan, Air Force Chief of Staff, said:  
   There is a distinct possibility we will lose aircraft in trying to penetrate those defenses.  
   General Krulak, Commandant of the Marine Corps, said:  
   It is going to be tremendously dangerous.  
   He went on to ask the same questions I have: What is the end game? How long will the strikes go on? Will our allies stay with us? 
   In the coming days, if air strikes do go forward, we need to be ready to answer the questions of the families of those young men and women who will not be returning from Yugoslavia. We have to be prepared to answer those questions. We can begin to answer them today: Are we prepared to fight in Yugoslavia month after month, slugging it out with the Serb forces in those mountains, losing Americans day after day? Are we prepared for that? 
   I want to say one thing about the troops. If we go in tonight or tomorrow, they will have my support. That is the way it should be. But I have an obligation to the Constitution, and under the Constitution, the U.S. Congress must decide whether or not we go to war. That is the purpose of my resolution. 
   Mr. President, I abhor the bloodshed in Kosovo. But as much sympathy as I have for those victims, we must remember that the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia is a sovereign nation. We can provide safe haven for those refugees as they exit Kosovo. We don't need to go to war. 
   Throughout the cold war, we fought to protect the rights of sovereign nations, and in 1991 we sent American soldiers to war to turn back the unlawful and immoral invasion of the sovereign nation of Kuwait. George Bush sought to defend a sovereign nation after it had been attacked, and he came before Congress to seek that authorization. He came before the Congress. And he barely got our approval. 
   George Bush risked losing a vote in Congress because he believed that the American people should comment on whether or not we would go to war. In that case, the nation of Iraq had attacked and conquered the sovereign nation of Kuwait. What a change in just eight years; here we are today, preparing ourselves to attack a sovereign nation, and the administration at this very minute is trying to avoid this vote. 
   This is a terribly difficult time for all of us. Having been in the Vietnam war, watching politicians who could not decide whether they wanted to support the troops or not, day after day, month after month, year after year, I don't want to see us get embroiled in another conflict the American people are going to lose their taste for after we start losing young men and women. 
   I just came back from a 4-day trip around the country--Louisiana, Alabama, and Colorado--talking to the troops. They are the best. They can handle anything we ask them to do. But they should not be asked to die in a conflict where the national security of this country is not at risk. This is exactly what they will be asked to do it if we go into Kosovo. 
   Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to carefully think about the implications of what we are about to do at 2 o'clock or so this afternoon. I urge my colleagues to support the Smith amendment. 
   I thank the Chair. I yield the floor. 
   Mr. President, I note the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, that is not very much time, but this is a very serious matter. It is  a vote that I wanted. I have been asking for it for a number of days and weeks. Now we are here, and the President has already made up his mind. He didn't really care particularly one way or the other how the Congress felt, which is pretty much the way the foreign policy has been conducted. Thousands of people, hundreds of thousands have died in Rwanda. We are not firing missiles there. This is a mistake. This is a civil war. We are attacking a sovereign nation without a declaration of war and we are going to regret it.

    Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Alfred Testa on his departure as the Director of Manchester Airport. Fred has been the Director of Manchester Airport since 1991. He has brought about tremendous and exciting change to the airport during his tenure and I am proud to have worked with him during his distinguished career. 
   Fred came to Manchester after serving as Deputy Director of T.F. Green Airport in Warwick, Rhode Island. He is a graduate of the University of Rhode Island with a B.A. in Political Science and earned his J.D. at Suffolk University Law School. He is an Accredited Airport Executive with the American Association of Airport Executives and is a regular lecturer on airport development, management and marketing. 
   Fred has been the driving force behind the substantial growth at Manchester Airport. When Fred began as Manchester Airport's Director, the airport handled approximately 700,000 passengers a year and there were six commercial airlines that serviced the airport. Today, there are eleven commercial airlines based there, and last year, the airport served almost 2 million travelers. Fred's efforts have played a key role in the City of Manchester's nationally recognized renaissance. 
   Fred has worked closely with each member of the New Hampshire Congressional Delegation - educating, advising, and encouraging us to undertake a number of vital federal initiatives at the airport. He has vigorously pursued support for the Residential Sound Insulation Program; the New Passenger Terminal; the New Armed Forces Reserve Center; the Manchester Airport Access Road; and the Runway, Taxiway, Parking, Roadway and Terminal Improvements and U.S. Customs Service's at the renovated Ammon Terminal. It has been my great privilege to work with Fred on these and other important airport projects which have fundamentally changed for the better air transportation services for New Hampshire. Fred deserves the highest admiration and praise for these significant accomplishments. 
   Fred leaves Manchester Airport to become the Director of Philadelphia International Airport. Aldermen and the Mayor of Manchester have expressed high praise for the work Fred did for the City of Manchester, and I strongly agree. His leadership and effective advocacy for safe and efficient airline transportation will be fondly remembered by all New Hampshire citizens. 
   Once again, I would like to commend Fred Testa on his service to Manchester Airport and the State of New Hampshire. His work was greatly beneficial to the City and the State, and I wish him well. It has been a pleasure to represent Fred Testa in the United States Senate, and I am proud to call him my friend.

   Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to express my  wholehearted, overwhelming, passionate, and unwavering support of the National Missile Defense Act of 1999. 
   Finally, after years of fighting to get this legislation to a point where we can pass it, we appear to have succeeded. I sincerely hope it is not too late. The President had promised to veto this bill if we passed it. I was glad to hear last night that he has now dropped his veto threat. Unfortunately, his pledge comes a little late and still falls far short of the full support that we need to truly protect our citizens. 
   As Chairman of the Armed Services Committee's Subcommittee on Strategic Forces, I have devoted myself wholeheartedly to the cause of missile defense for many years. It has always troubled me that the President of the United States has refused to engage us and help us to pass a bill to defend the United States of America and its citizens from ballistic missile attack. It has been especially troubling in recent days, with news that data on our most sophisticated nuclear warhead may have been stolen by China--which may have already used this information to perfect their own warheads on missiles aimed this very minute at the United States. 
   The President seems to believe we need to let Russia have a vote on whether or not we choose to protect ourselves from blackmail and coercion from China, Iraq, Iran, and North Korea. With all due respect, I am not interested in having the Russians determine whether or not we should protect ourselves. I am more interested in having us determine whether or not we should protect ourselves. 
   The administration tells us that there are four critical criteria that must be met before we can decide whether to deploy a national missile defense: threat, technology, operational effectiveness, and cost. Let's look at these four issues; first, the threat. The Administration's national missile defense agenda is based upon, I believe, a false assumption that we will have plenty of warning to respond to the threat. 
   We can't base the security of the United States of America on our ability to detect and predict existing or emerging threats around the world. And we do not have to--it is here even as we speak. The administration can no longer ignore the threat. It is real, it is dangerous, and it is here now, today, this moment. 
   In May of 1998, India conducted three nuclear tests that shocked the world, and even worse, surprised our intelligence community. Ten days later, Pakistan conducted their own nuclear test. 
   In July of 1998, a bipartisan commission headed by Don Rumsfeld, former Defense Secretary, came to some very startling assertions. Here is what he said:  
   Hostile nations such as North Korea, Iran, and Iraq are making concerted efforts to acquire ballistic missiles with biological or nuclear payloads that will be able to inflict major destruction on the U.S. within five years of a decision to acquire such capability. And further, the U.S. might not even be aware if or when such a decision has been made.  
   That is a pretty sobering analysis, Mr. President. 
   He went on to say:  
   The threat from rogue countries is evolving more rapidly than U.S. intelligence has told us, and our ability to detect a threat is eroding because nations are increasingly able to conceal important elements of their missile programs. The U.S. faces a missile threat from hostile states with little or no warning.  
   The Rumsfeld Commission was bipartisan, and its conclusions were unanimous. Yet the entire report was downplayed by the administration. It was dismissed as paranoid, alarmist, and out of touch with current intelligence estimates. But only 2 months later, 2 months after the Rumsfeld report, the North Koreans shocked the world with the launch of a three-staged Taepo Dong missile over Japan. 
   This signaled their progress toward the Taepo Dong 2 that could hit the continental United States. Some in the Senate have been willing to write off Hawaii and Alaska because they are not continental. I notice that the Senators from Alaska and Hawaii were not willing to write themselves off, however. They were early advocates and supporters and cosponsors of this legislation in both political parties. 
   Not to be outdone, after North Korea, Iran tested their own new generation missile within weeks of the Rumsfeld report. On February 2 of this year, CIA Director George Tenet testified before the Senate Armed Services Committee:  
   I see a real possibility that a power hostile to the United States will acquire before too long the ability to strike the U.S. homeland with weapons of mass destruction.  
   In an interview with Defense Week on 23 February, Lieutenant General Lyles, Chief of the BMD organization, said:  
   We now have indications that the threat is growing, and certainly there is little doubt that this threat will be there around the year 2000.  
   The CIA recently reported that China has at least a dozen nuclear missiles aimed at U.S. cities right now. 
   I say to my colleagues, the threat is here. How much more warning do we need? 
   Let's go to the technology and the operational effectiveness issues that the President and some of this bill's critics have talked about. They say that this bill would require a deployment before the technology is ready. But technology and operational effectiveness are the cornerstones of this legislation. No one is suggesting we deploy a system before it is ready. How can we deploy something before it is ready? How can we deploy something that doesn't work? And yet we have had a big debate on this terminology. The Senator from Mississippi has done a good job, I think, in shooting holes in that false argument. 
   I honestly do not understand what the debate between ``technologically possible'' and ``operationally effective'' is all about. This is what the bill says:  
   ..... to deploy as soon as technologically possible an effective national missile defense.......  
   It is pretty clear. When the technology allows us to build an effective system, we deploy it. Is that too much for the American people to expect from their elected leaders, who are sworn to protect and serve them? Are we going to build a system, know that it is effective, but then not deploy it? I do not think so. If we had something that was technologically possible and operationally effective and we didn't deploy it, I think our constituents would be a little upset with us. 
   There are also those who claim it is simply too hard to, as they say, hit a bullet with a bullet. If we all had that attitude, we would still be using bows and arrows to defend ourselves. We certainly would not have the technology that we have today in stealth and missiles and lasers if we adopted that ``can't do'' attitude. 
   Just 2 days ago at White Sands, we did successfully intercept a missile target with a Patriot-3 missile, proving we can hit a bullet with a bullet. The only problem is that when you hit the bullet with the Patriot, you are hitting it pretty close to you. What we want to do is hit that bullet long before it gets anywhere near us. 
   The third issue the administration wants to base a deployment decision on is affordable cost. Boy, there is a bureaucratic attitude if I ever heard one. That statement is--frankly, with all due respect to those who made it--unconscionable. On February 2, Director Tenet told the Senate Armed Services Committee:  
   North Korea's Taepo Dong 1 launch last August demonstrated technology that, if further developed, could give Pyongyang the ability to deliver a payload to the western edge of the United States of America.  
   To put it bluntly, North Korea will soon be able to strike San Diego, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Portland, and Seattle with nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons--and the President is telling us he is worried about the cost? He is worried about the cost? What is the cost of one of those missiles hitting one of those cities? What in the world is he talking about? I wish he had been as worried about having a spy continue to operate in one of our weapons labs for 3 years without doing anything about it. 
   I note that the combined population of just the five cities I mentioned is 30 million people. The total population from San Diego to Seattle is 50 million people. What is the cost of losing 30 to 50 million people to that kind of missile attack? With all due respect, is the President willing to go out there and look those 50 million people in the eye and say, ``We're going to check this out to see if it is affordable''? I say, if we are worried about money, then let's  take money out of someplace else in the budget and protect 50 million people along the western coast of the United States of America. 
   The President wants to tell U.S. citizens we cannot protect them from weapons of mass destruction until we figure out how much it might cost. I say it is the opposite. We have to defend our citizens, and worry later about the cost. 
   This is not an imagined threat. The CIA recently reported that China now has a dozen missiles aimed at the United States. We have all heard the reports of the Chinese general who, in 1996, warned that if we chose to defend Taiwan, we had better be willing to sacrifice Los Angeles. This, from a nation that the administration says we must engage. Those are pretty tough words from a country that we are supposed to be engaging. Maybe we ought to disengage a little bit from China when it threatens us with nuclear attack and steals our nuclear secrets from our lab at Los Alamos. 
   Cost is a matter of relative priorities, Mr. President. As Senator SESSIONS pointed out recently, the cost of a 3-year deployment to Kosovo could reach 50 percent of what this administration plans to spend on national missile defense. We have already spent as much in Bosnia in the past 3 years as an entire NMD program is estimated to cost. Priorities, I say to my colleagues, priorities. Kosovo, Bosnia or 50 million people along the coast of the United States? We know what the President has chosen as his priority. What is the Senate going to choose for its priority? 
   Let's go to the last issue, the ABM Treaty of 1972, the bible for some people in this body. The biggest fear is that we are going to undermine the ABM Treaty. What ABM Treaty? We signed the ABM Treaty with the U.S.S.R. The last time I looked, there was no U.S.S.R. 
   On the 20th anniversary of the ratification of the treaty, President Nixon said:  
   The ABM Treaty has been overtaken by the cold war's end.  
   Dr. Kissinger, the primary architect of the treaty, said in 1995 in testimony before the Congress that the time had clearly come to:  
   ......consider either amending the ABM Treaty or finding some other basis for regulating the U.S.-Russian strategic relationship. The ABM Treaty now stands in the way of our ability to respond in an effective manner to the proliferation of ballistic missiles, one of the most significant post cold war threats.  
   That came from the architect of the treaty. He is saying that the treaty stands in the way of our ability to defend ourselves. 
   Even Secretary of Defense Cohen recently said before the Senate Armed Services Committee that we may have to consider withdrawing from the ABM Treaty. 
   I am not advocating withdrawing at this point. I am just insisting that we not let the treaty harm our national security. 
   How absurd would it be for us to continue to honor the treaty with Russia, preventing us from protecting ourselves from weapons of mass destruction, while all other nuclear-capable countries of the world would be free to develop their own missile defense? What would that do to American security if we could not defend ourselves, but our enemies could? Does that make sense? Am I missing something here? I just do not understand the foreign policy of this administration. 
   In conclusion, it would be indefensible to the American people to concede that the threat of rogue missile attacks is real and credible, but offer only a self-imposed weak defense against it. It is unconscionable. If the threat to the American people is real, then the defense against these attacks must be real; not only that, it must be aggressive, full-scale and monumental. Whatever resources are necessary, the American people deserve to be defended. 
   Some in the minority claim that the passage of this bill might lead to a new arms race with the Russians. But everyone knows that any missile defense currently in development would not upset the balance of power between Russia and the United States. NMD will provide defense against only limited and rogue attacks, not against incoming Russian missiles. 
   What about Russia's proliferation of missile technology to rogue states? Between technology transfers to Iran, India, and perhaps even China, Russia is a large part of the reason we are here debating this bill today, because they are selling their technology around the world. Proliferation is already a growing threat, independent of this bill. 
   Mr. President, we must pass this bill. This is not a partisan issue. It is an issue of national security. And the defense of the American homeland against a real and growing threat of ballistic missiles and our national security depends on it. 
   I urge my colleagues to pass this bill, and to do it today. 
   Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.

   Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the ``Second Anendment Rights Protection Act of 1999.'' I am pleased and honored that Senators INHOFE, BURNS, ENZI, and MURKOWSKI are joining me as original cosponsors. 
   Mr. President, the Second Amendment Rights Protection Act of 1999 encompasses all of the provisions of the Smith Amendment, which passed the Senate by a vote of 69-31 on July 21, 1998, during consideration of the Commerce, Justice, State appropriations bill for fiscal year 1999. Only a substantially modified version of the Smith amendment was included in the final omnibus appropriations measure. 
   The National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) went into effect on December 1, 1998. My bill would require the immediate destruction of all information submitted by any person who has been cleared by the NICS to purchase a firearm. There is no reason why such private information on law-abiding gun owners should be retained. I continue to be troubled by the Clinton administration's insistence upon doing so. 
   In addition, Mr. President, my bill would prohibit the imposition of any tax or fee in connection with the NICS. Once again, in his budget submission for fiscal year 2000, President Clinton is seeking to fund NICS with a gun tax. 
   With the Smith amendment last year, we told President Clinton ``no'' to the gun tax. Let us tell him ``no'' again, once and for all, by enacting the Second Amendment Rights Protection Act. 
   Finally, Mr. President, my bill would create a private cause of action for any individual who is aggrieved by a violation of its provisions. 
   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for the printing of the text of my bill, the Second Amendment Rights Protection Act of 1999, in the RECORD.

   Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Thank you very much, Mr. President. I thank my colleague, Mr. VOINOVICH, for not objecting. 
   I would like to compliment my colleague, the Senator from Minnesota, for his support on this issue. Mr. President, 1999 is the eighty-sixth anniversary of the Sixteenth Amendment and the collection of income taxes by the Federal government. It is not an anniversary that we really, in my view, ought to celebrate. As a matter of fact, I propose that we mark the occasion by throwing out our existing tax code and starting over from scratch. 
   The Tax Code Termination Act, which I am pleased to join with my colleague, Senator TIM HUTCHINSON, and others to soon introduce, would accomplish just that goal. Our bill would sunset the Internal Revenue Code by December 31, 2003. 
   This year provides a good opportunity for the Senate to reexamine the income tax and consider how the tax code has changed. As stated in the Salt Lake Tribune of Wednesday, January 27, 1999, the income tax is a relatively new development:  
   France had an income tax in 1793 and Britain in 1799. With a couple of short-lived exceptions, the United States generally managed to get by without one until 1913. An income tax was levied during the Civil War, but it was dropped after a few years. Congress passed a 2 percent income tax on individuals and business in 1894, but it was ruled unconstitutional. The Constitution barred the federal government from levying direct taxes except in proportion to population. In 1913, the 16th Amendment to the Constitution changed the rules, and an income tax was instituted.  
   Shortly after the Sixteenth Amendment was ratified in 1913, Congress passed the first income tax law. The Internal Revenue Service, then an obscure government agency, enforced the new law and collected the income taxes. 
   Back then, the taxpayers got to keep most of their earnings. In 1913, the income tax rate of 1 percent applied only to those making over $3,000 per year. Those making more than $20,000 paid a slightly higher surtax. The highest rate of seven percent was imposed on all income above $500,000. According to Peter Cleary of Americans for Tax Reform, in 1994 dollars, the one-percent income tax would apply on all income up to $250,000, while the seven percent rate would apply only to income above $6 million. 
   Few people had to file returns in 1913. Only about 1 in 250 Americans did. 
   Moreover, the original Form 1040 was brief and simple. As noted in yesterday's Washington Post Magazine, it consisted of just four pages, including one of instructions, and you would have finished calculating your income by Line 7. 
   Since 1913, things have gotten more than a little out of hand. Consider these statistics: 
   Close to half of all Americans file a tax return today. Instead of one form, there are many. 
   According to economist J.T. Young, the average family pays about 25% of its income in Federal, state and local taxes, and ``30 percent of every additional dollar earned by a four-person median income household of $55,000 will go to pay taxes. Individuals and families earning $50,000 and above already pay 82 percent of total taxes and 91 percent of income taxes.'' 
   The average middle-income taxpayer now has to work until at least May of each year just to meet all the federal, state and local taxes due. 
   The Tax Foundation has estimated that collectively, individuals devote close to 2 billion hours to preparing tax returns each year. 
   It's no wonder that Americans dislike the current tax code. It is unnecessarily complex and overly burdensome. 
   Some of my constituents are especially upset about the fact that tax revenues last year grew 9 percent, or twice as fast as the economy. Consider these comments from a man in Exeter, New Hampshire:  
   I have been reading and hearing about the tremendous budget surpluses we can expect over the next ten years. ..... Where is this money coming from and who authorized collecting it? It seems to me that if the government has a surplus it's because they're collecting more than they're spending. If that's the case, why are they collecting more than they're spending? I hope you realize that things like this are what disenfranchise American citizens from their government.  
   How did we get to this point? Much of the blame lies with Congress. We have changed the Federal tax code many times since 1913, turning it into a tangled cobweb that few can understand. The changes have become more complex and the tax rates have increased over the years. 
   What can we do about it? We can abolish the existing tax code and promptly adopt a new one that adheres to some basic rules: 
   First, we should have a tax code that is simple and fair.  
   Second, our tax code should encourage savings and investment. The current code distorts investment by creating incentives for Americans to use tax loopholes, rather than invest their money in more profitable ways. 
   We should provide greater tax relief to the overburdened American taxpayers. Tax cuts would provide American workers with more incentives to produce, because workers would be able to keep more of their earnings. 
   In closing, Mr. President, I want to urge my colleagues to support the Tax Code Termination Act. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

My bill, which is being cosponsored by Senators JEFFORDS and HELMS, would reserve two of the seven seats on the United States Sentencing Commission for victims of violent crimes. 
   Mr. President, the Sentencing Commission is an independent entity within the judicial branch that establishes sentencing policies and practices for the Federal courts. This includes sentencing guidelines that prescribe the appropriate form and severity of punishment for offenders convicted of Federal crimes.

    Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to honor Fred Kfoury, Jr., as the 1998 Manchester Chamber of Commerce ``Citizen of the Year.'' I commend his outstanding achievement. 
   Fred is the President of Center Paper Products Company in Manchester, New Hampshire. His company employs forty-five people and is a fixture in the Manchester business community. He is described by his business associates as a very generous, thoughtful businessman. His company, that was passed on to him from his father, continues to grow and thrive. 
   Fred has always tempered his business success with a great devotion to volunteerism. His own philosophy, ``Service to one's community is an integral part of his company's culture,'' has been readily apparent in his actions through the years. Fred has constantly maintained a record of service to his community that is highly admirable. He has been active in organizations from his college alumni association to the annual Christmas party for students and families at Notre Dame College. 
   As a former small business owner, I understand the demands of running a business. I commend Fred for his diligent work in his business as well as the devotion he has shown to the community. Once again, I wish to congratulate Fred on being named 1998 ``Citizen of the Year'' by the Manchester Chamber of Commerce. It is an honor to represent him in the United States Senate.

   Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to wholeheartedly endorse this Soldiers', Sailors', Airmen's, and Marines' Bill of Rights. With this bill, the members of the Senate Armed Services Committee are making a pledge to the men and women who so bravely defend our freedoms: we honor them, we respect them, they and their families are important to us, and we are going to take care of them. We have been asking them to get by for too long, with too little. Starting now, we are going to make good on our debt of gratitude. 
   In my view, this bill addresses three key areas that must be fixed if we are going to be able to keep quality people in uniform. The largest pay raise since 1982, and annual raises that outpace inflation, will shrink a double-digit pay gap that has been growing for 20 years. Service men and women know they will never make as much as their civilian counterparts, and they serve proudly anyway. But we cannot tell them their contributions to America are invaluable, and then stand by and watch their earning power erode more and more each year without any plan for stopping the erosion. They deserve to provide their families with an honorable standard of living, and we are committed to doing that. 
   In addition, Mr. President, raises for mid-level officers and enlisted personnel are designed to retain critical personnel and reward performance over longevity. Currently, some leaders are paid less than their subordinates due to an over-emphasis on years served rather then results achieved. We win or lose wars based on results, not seniority, and the pay chart ought to reflect that reality. We want to encourage and reward those who go ``above and beyond,'' and reinforce a culture dedicated to achievement and success. 
   Restoring previously reduced retirement benefits to their original levels shows a commitment to our veterans' long term security and the value of a career of honorable service. Our troops spend an entire career living in danger, sacrificing their own interests and putting their country's needs ahead of their family's. We cannot in good conscience reward their service by cutting their retirement benefits. 
   In closing, Mr. President, more than just voicing a commitment to our service men and women, we must take bold, swift action to put that commitment to work. We must provide them a long overdue increase in pay, we must reform the pay table to reward performance over longevity, and we must repeal the Redux retirement plan.

   Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, as President Reagan would say, ``Here we go again.'' This administration is now on the verge of making a commitment of American forces to another 911 humanitarian crisis around the world, without the approval of Congress. 
   As I stand here today, the United States is poised to launch airstrikes against the sovereign nation of Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. Given the apparent failure of the talks in France regarding the issue of the peacekeeping force, there is a real possibility that airstrikes may be imminent and that American forces, as part of a NATO force, may be committed in Kosovo. I would venture to say that many Americans would be hard-pressed to find Kosovo on a map; yet here again our sons and daughters are going to be asked to put their lives on the line for this administration without approval of their elected representatives in Congress, and without any declaration of war. 
   Mr. President, this is very, very disturbing. I have spoken out in the past against the Bosnia operation. I have spoken out against our occupation of Haiti. But Kosovo is the last straw for me. Today I am introducing a bill to ensure that Congress exercises its constitutional right of approval before this  administration commits us to an act of war against a sovereign nation. If we are going to be taking offensive military action, I don't believe there ought to be any troops in any sovereign nation unless there is a declaration of war, or at least a specific authorization by Congress. 
   The resolution I am introducing simply says that there will be no troops committed in any force of any kind without a specific authorization from the U.S. Congress. I am going to call on my colleagues to join me in this effort before we get embroiled in another long-term conflict that is not in the United States' interest. 
   I want to make a few points about this. 
   This administration apparently thinks nothing of committing an act of war without congressional approval--they will commit troops first, and come to us later and ask for our support. 
   On the contrary, when President Bush wanted to repel Iraq from Kuwait, he came to the Congress--a Democrat-controlled Congress--and Congress authorized him to do that. He came here. He took his chance. He did the right thing. But that is not happening now. 
   While this body has been wrestling with impeachment proceedings, President Clinton's administration has been preparing to wage war. 
   I want to repeat that. We were tied down here for almost 2 months talking about the impeachment of the President of the United States, and while we were doing that, the same President who was nearly removed from office was preparing to wage war against a sovereign nation without congressional approval. That is absolutely outrageous, and I am not going to stand by any longer and be silent about it. 
   The administration has crafted a plan to fix the internal problems of a sovereign state. And it proceeds, then, to hold a so-called peace conference where it threatens to use lethal force against that sovereign state if they don't accept the deal. The two parties are not even interested in an agreement. They still want to fight. They have been fighting in that region of the world for centuries. So we jam an agreement down their throats. And here come U.S. forces, again in harm's way, with no approval from Congress. 
   Before we send our troops to another dangerous part of the world, which this President has been prone to do for a long time, we have a sacred responsibility to these men and women to consider the risks. We did not fight and win the Cold War so that--as the sole remaining superpower--we would get bogged down in parts of the world that the vast majority of Americans have never heard of. 
   Kosovo is as much a part of Yugoslavia as New Hampshire is of the United States. We are dictating, under the threat of American military action, the internal policy of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. It may be a policy that I despise, that I hate, that I am upset about. But do we have that right, without an act of war or some authorization from Congress? We may not like it. It may be horrible. But that alone is not a reason to go to war. Should we go to war in Zimbabwe or Ethiopia or some other nation where some other problems are occurring that we don't like? Where do you draw the line? 
   The administration tells us we must become involved in the internal affairs of a sovereign nation to prevent the spread of this conflict into neighboring nations, including perhaps NATO members. This is a bogey-man argument. It is meant to scare us into resolving the conflict with the American military. This argument is false and it obscures the real issue of placing troops at risk in an area of the world where were we have no real interest to justify direct intervention. Frankly, I am tired of it. I am tired of risking American lives when we do not have American interests at stake. The precedent we would be setting by intervening in Kosovo is far more dangerous to American interests than the small risk that this conflict is going to spread somewhere. What other troubled Balkan region will we go to next? Montenegro? Macedonia? Where do we stop, Mr. President? 
   There was a letter to the Washington Post on February 20, written from a gentleman by the name of Alex N. Dragnich. He said:  
   We are threatening to bomb the Serbs, not because they have invaded a foreign country but because they refuse to accept an agreement which we have crafted, to resolve a domestic conflict inside Yugoslavia and to permit the entrance of NATO troops to enforce it.......  
   That is what this is about  
   More serious [he says] in the long run will be the precedent we would be creating. Our proposed actions would provide the arguments to justify a power or a combination of powers to invade some country in search of justice for a minority or minorities. This could be some Arab states, perhaps in agreement with Russia, or it could be China seeking to take over Taiwan.  
   The administration has created a situation where, no matter how the negotiations conclude, our military people will likely be placed at risk. Let me correct that--they will be placed at risk. The recklessness with which this administration treats our men and women in uniform is shameful--shameful. We had to fight 
   in the Senate on this floor 2 years ago to get the administration to give them a pay raise. We fight on this floor to try to get a national missile defense to protect our own Nation--and we still cannot get it. If the parties do agree to a foreign military presence, then our troops will be committed to peace enforcement for more years than the administration is ready to admit; a lot more years than this administration has left in office. And they will be in great jeopardy from retaliation, not by one side, but by both sides. They will be in the middle of a civil war. 
   If the Serbs do not agree, then this administration is prepared to send our troops into combat against an aggressive nation that is well equipped to defend itself from attack. Let there be no doubt, American lives will be endangered. This is not Iraq where everything is out in the open. There are SAM sites embedded in mountains. The Serbs have the capability to shoot down American aircraft. Remember that. 
   We all remember the promises made by the administration about Bosnia. They said the troops will be out in a year. It was one year, then another year, then another; now it is 3 years, with no end in sight, and it's cost $10 billion. Most of the time the President didn't even fund the operation; he took it out of funds for the troops, he raided their equipment modernization accounts to fund it. One of the primary reasons given by the administration, justifying the Bosnia intervention, was it would stabilize the region--yet today we are about to commit American troops to intervening in a new unstable region, Kosovo. 
   We field an army, not a Salvation Army. Our military is woefully underfunded. We need $125 billion over the next 5 years just to recover from where this administration has cut us. There are mounting concerns about readiness. Should a crisis emerge that truly does endanger America's legitimate interests, what happens? By volunteering to send forces to Kosovo, the President is again stretching our military too thin. The President is not just risking the lives of soldiers sent to the region, but also our troops around the world. And for what? 
   Later on today we are going to be debating pay increases and retirement benefits for our troops. That is a serious need. The operations tempo that we require from our troops is a serious concern as well. Yet as we try to help on these problems, the administration once again overextends our forces. There are troops that have been in three or four hot spots in the last 3 years. Some have been in Bosnia, some have been in the Persian Gulf, some have been in Haiti, some have been in Korea, and there will probably be a fifth one, Kosovo, for some people. How much more can we take? 
   The administration says the possible troop commitment for peace enforcement in Kosovo is only for 4,000 troops. In the military there is the three-times rule. Not only do we commit those 4,000 on the ground, but 4,000 more are preparing to go and 4,000 are recovering from being deployed there. This 4,000-man operation ties up 12,000 troops. In truth, a four-times rule is probably more realistic, so it is more like 16,000. 
   We are already facing serious problems in recruiting, spare parts, and other results of this high operating tempo. The administration has strained the budget of the Defense Department to the limit, and our troops are going to be the losers because of it.  We simply cannot ask our military to do more and more with less. That is what this President has continued to do. 
   Mr. President, we are 7,000 troops down in recruitment for the U.S. Navy. We don't even have enough sailors to man our ships. We are short 23,000 recruits in the U.S. Army. Spare parts bins are empty in military bases all over this country. They cannot repair some vehicles-- they are just too old. And yet here is the administration, ready to send them into Kosovo. 
   In conclusion, throughout the Cold War we fought to protect the rights of sovereign nations to conduct themselves according to their own laws. We fought World War II over the same thing. In the Gulf War we sent American soldiers to war to turn back an unlawful and immoral invasion of the sovereign nation of Kuwait. There was much disagreement over that policy, but it was an attack of one sovereign nation on another. Now, look at what has happened in just 8 years. Today we find our commitment to sovereignty turned on its head. 
   Let me issue a warning. The KLA, the Kosovo Liberation Army--these are not Boy Scouts. Neither is Slobodan Milosevic. This is going to be a bloody mess, and we are going to be right in the middle of it. The KLA started a war that it cannot finish and now the administration wants U.S. pilots serve as its Air Force the American people know what we are spending in Bosnia--$4 billion a year and growing, now adding to that in Kosovo, and at the same time not yet deploying a missile defense system for this country which is imperative for the security of our own people and our troops wherever they may be in the world. 
   I applaud the efforts of the Senator from New Hampshire. I certainly hope that we will get a chance to talk about this. I look forward to having the leaders in Congress stand up and say, What is the policy; how many more times are we going to put troops in harm's way, paid for by the taxpayers of America, when there is no exit strategy, there is no plan, there is no rotation out, there is no temporariness about this. It is open-ended. 
   I applaud my colleague from New Hampshire, and I hope that the Senate will address this before we have a fait accompli, troops on the ground, as we have had in Bosnia in an unending mission, with no strategy, no plan and no exit.

Mr. President, in accordance with Rule XXVI(2) of the Standing Rules of the Senate, I ask that the Rules of Procedure of the Select Committee on Ethics, which were adopted February 23, 1978, and revised April 1997, be printed in the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD for the 106th Congress.

   Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. Chief Justice, thank you very much. I would certainly give more than a penny for your thoughts on this matter. But I am afraid we will probably never know. 
   Mr. Chief Justice, I have been proud to be a U.S. Senator ever since that day over 8 years ago when I took the oath of office and my colleague, Senator BYRD, told me that I was the 1,794th person to serve in the U.S. Senate. 
   During my tenure in the Senate, I have learned to respect my colleagues even when I strongly disagree with them on the issues of the day. I have challenged colleagues on issues and maybe at times even criticized their votes. But I have never challenged a colleague's motives and I never will. I respect each and every one of you and the high office you hold. 
   I consider it a great honor to serve in this body, and serve with some giants here--Senator HELMS, Senator THURMOND, Senator BYRD, to name a few. 
   I remember when I came to the floor of the Senate and signed that book as No. 1,794. Senator BYRD reminded me of the significance of that. And I have never forgotten it. 
   I also sit at the desk of Daniel Webster. It is a constant reminder that I am just a temporary steward occupying this seat in the U.S. Senate. It is also a reminder that we will move on. But the Constitution will not move on. The Constitution will endure forever. Our role here in this proceeding is to preserve the Constitution and the Presidency. Yes--even if it means we have to remove the President. 
   Mr. Chief Justice, when the rollcall is called tomorrow, I will be voting ``guilty'' on both of the articles that are now before the Senate. It is clear that the Senate will not be finding President Clinton guilty on either article. But I just want to say regarding censure that my vote is my censure. I think anyone who votes to find him guilty does not need to be concerned about censure. 
   As I contemplate my vote, I am reminded of a prayer offered in 1947 by a former Chaplain of the Senate, Rev. Peter Marshall. Reverend Marshall prayed: ``Our Father in Heaven ..... help us to see that it is better to fail in the cause that will ultimately succeed than to succeed in a cause that will ultimately fail.'' 
   I have faith that the cause in which I believe will ultimately prevail, because I believe that history will judge that President Clinton is, in fact, guilty of high crimes and misdemeanors that warrant his removal from office. I know others respectfully disagree. And believe me, I respect that disagreement. 
   Many of my colleagues have spoken on the instability a guilty verdict would cause for the Nation. We should never remove a President unless there is clear and present danger to the Nation, they say. With respect, colleagues, I submit to you that the double standard that we have set for our leader will ignite a cynicism directed against all of us. A cynicism is a clear and present danger to society. 
   With a not guilty verdict, you will tell the American people that perjury and obstruction of justice for the President are acceptable; that those who put their lives on the line for our Nation every day in our Armed Forces have a higher standard than the Commander in Chief; and that for everyone else in America who lose their jobs because of perjury and obstruction, that is not acceptable. 
   We reap what we sow. In my view, respectfully, history will judge us harshly for this. And I say that in great humbleness. It is my view. A not guilty verdict is a short-term victory for the President. It is a long-term defeat for truth, for honor, for integrity, for the Presidency, and, in my view, for the Constitution. 
   As Peter Marshall intimated in his prayer, with a not guilty verdict we have succeeded in a cause which I believe will ultimately fail. 
   My colleagues, we are all elected officials. And I want to comment about this partisanship. I say it in the spirit of bipartisanship. We have all been through the same ordeal together here. The nasty fundraising, the ad wars, dirty campaign tactics, thousands of miles of travel, neglecting our families, hours and hours away from home, much to the detriment of our own health and financial well-being. We do it all the time. And for anyone inside or outside this institution to suggest that my vote, or your vote, or anyone's vote in here is based on partisanship not only makes me sick, it makes me bristle with anger. 
   What are my colleagues really saying when they invoke the word ``partisanship''? Do you really believe that the impeachment of the President of the United States by a majority of the Members of the House of Representatives, the body that is elected every 2 years, gives closure to the people, and  the body elected by the same voters who elect one-third of us every 2 years would impeach the President of the United States because he is a Democrat? Even to imply that is unworthy, it is arrogant, and it is below the dignity of this very seat that you now hold. Have you forgotten the ``war'' that James Carville declared on Ken Starr a year or so ago, and on the Republicans, to protect the innocent Bill Clinton? 
   Was that partisan? Was the President totally innocent? Partisanship has no place in this Senate, especially when it sits as a Court of Impeachment. We are here to do impartial justice, to be unbiased triers of fact. Yet, we have allowed that runaway partisan train of White House apologists, I might say, to rumble into the Senate with no brakes. 
   One of my colleagues mentioned the courage of Republicans who voted against impeachment in the House. How about the Democrats who voted to impeach? Are they, by implication, cowards? 
   Alexander Hamilton would be appalled at the notion of partisanship in an impeachment trial. Indeed, writing in the Federalist Papers, Hamilton said that the impeachment of the President ``will seldom fail to agitate the passion of the whole community, and to divide it into parties more or less friendly to the accused. 
   ``There will always be the greatest danger,'' Hamilton warned, ``that the decision will be regulated more by the comparative strength of the parties, than by the real demonstrations of innocence or guilt.'' 
   Mr. Chief Justice, there was a hero of the Revolutionary War era, Dr. Joseph Warren. He was a doctor. He didn't have to serve; he was 34 years old. His colleagues begged him not to go. But he picked up arms at Bunker Hill at 34 years old and he said, ``Our country is in danger. On you depend the fortunes of America. You are to decide the important questions upon which rest the happiness and the liberty of millions yet unborn. Act worthy of yourselves.'' He was killed at the Battle of Bunker Hill. 
   We don't act worthy of ourselves when we let partisanship enter into this trial, or even accuse one another of it. Why is it, when Democrats march in lockstep on a vote, that we Republicans are the only ones being accused of partisanship? 
   Why are the House Republicans partisan because they vote out the articles, yet the Democrats who vote to block them are not partisan? 
   I have served with HENRY HYDE in the U.S. House of Representatives, and so have many of you. There is not even a remote chance--and every single one of you knows it--not even a remote chance that HENRY HYDE would bring articles of impeachment against the President of the United States of any party if he didn't believe they were justified. 
   Honorable men and women can disagree on these articles, but leave your politics at the door. Act worthy of yourselves. 
   If the articles were so outrageous, so political, so partisan, so vindictive, and it is nothing more than a private sexual matter, then why do those of you who say those things want to censure this President using such terms to describe his actions as ``shameful,'' ``disgraceful,'' ``reprehensible,'' ``false'' and ``misleading,'' and so 
   forth? 
   Before I leave the matter of partisanship, let me say a few words about the case of our former colleague, Senator Packwood. My colleagues know I was a member of the Ethics Committee, and I supported the expulsion of Senator Packwood. I lost a colleague, and I lost a friend over that. 
   That case, too, was ``about sex.'' My colleagues and I didn't shrink from doing our duty in the Packwood case because this outrageous behavior was about sex. 
   In addition, those organizations advocating that the Senate take strong action against Senator Packwood were, by and large, liberal feminist groups, which I disagree with on nearly every issue. 
   That, however, did not matter. Instead of being partisan or being deterred because the case was about sex, those of us on the Ethics Committee painstakingly investigated that case in all of its sordid and unpleasant detail. We considered the shameful behavior in which Packwood engaged. We considered how his behavior reflected on his fitness to serve. We considered his obstruction of the investigation with respect to his diaries. 
   And in the end, the committee, Republicans and Democrats alike, voted to recommend to the full Senate that he be expelled. In doing our duty as we saw fit, we were not deterred by the argument that we were ``overturning an election,'' nor were the Republican members of the Ethics Committee--at the time, Senators MCCONNELL, CRAIG and myself--deterred by the fact that Senator Packwood was a member of our own party, nor were we deterred because liberal feminist groups were aggressively supporting many of the women accusers of Senator Packwood. The heart of the issue is not who Paula Jones' lawyers are, my colleagues, but, rather, did Bill Clinton expose himself in the presence of Paula Jones against her wishes? That is at best sexual misconduct, and at worst it is sexual harassment. Right wing groups did not find Paula Jones. Bill Clinton did. He says he didn't do it. Do you really believe him? The women accusers of Senator Packwood received justice in spite of those who promoted their cause. Paula Jones deserves the same treatment. The Supreme Court agreed 9 to zero. It is outrageous to say, as some have on this floor, that it is acceptable to expel Senator Packwood and acquit the President. That kind of debate should not take place on the floor of the Senate. How can you say that Senator Packwood is equal under the law, and yet the President is above the law? 
   Today, I ask my colleagues in the Senate to do in the impeachment case of President Clinton what we did in the ethics case of Senator Packwood. Put aside your political affiliation. Put aside your friendship or your personal disdain for President Clinton. Put all of that aside and do the right thing. 
   The House managers have established, I believe, beyond a reasonable doubt that President Clinton perjured himself and obstructed justice. As such, I don't believe we have any option other than to remove him from office and replace him with the Vice President--a fine, decent man, as many of his predecessors who have assumed the office of the Presidency during difficult times, and the Nation has persevered. 
   As I have listened to my colleagues in these final deliberations, I have heard time and again that the House managers did not prove their obstruction of justice charge because of conflicts in testimony. We heard about all these conflicts--conflicts in testimony about the hiding of the gifts, conflicts in testimony about the job search, conflicts in testimony about the President's coaching of Betty Currie. 
   Well, let me ask you, colleagues, if you believed that these conflicts needed to be resolved, then why didn't you join some of us who signed a letter to call for the President of the United States to come here to the Senate and tell the truth? What were you afraid of? 
   We could have called President Clinton here to a closed session of the Senate. It need not have been a media spectacle. 
   It can and should have been a closed session--just the Senate and the President. 
   Time and again, I have heard my colleagues say that there should be a higher standard for removing a President of the United States than for removing a Federal judge or expelling a Senator Packwood. If there is such a higher standard for the law, then why not insist on a higher standard for the man? 
   One of my colleagues mentioned the Iran-contra matter. At an earlier time, not too many years ago, when impeachment talk was in the air, President Ronald Reagan walked to the microphone, and he said, ``I take full responsibility for my own actions and for those of my administration. As angry as I may be about activities undertaken without my knowledge, I am still accountable for those activities. As disappointed as I may be in some who served me, I'm still the one who must answer to the American people for this behavior. And as personally distasteful as I find secret bank accounts and diverted funds--well, well, as the Navy would say, this happened on my watch.'' 
   Oh, what a little honesty and candor can do for the soul of the Nation. Why didn't we call the President? Why didn't every Member of this Senate sign that letter? What would be wrong  with having him come, either in deposition or in person? I will always regret that we failed to do so. We will never know whether the President's own testimony here before us could have better enabled us to do our constitutional duty. We will never know. The President testified before the grand jury. He testified before the Paula Jones case. He should have testified at his own impeachment trial so we could get the truth, so those of you who want to know whether or not he obstructed justice or committed perjury could have heard from him, not his lawyers. It is a permanent black mark on this trial, and I believe historians will ask for a long, long time: Why didn't the President testify? It could have changed the outcome of the trial. 
   Speaking of constitutional duty, I am reminded of the President's oath. Article II, section 1, clause 7, of the Constitution provides that:  
   Before he enter on the Execution of his Office, he shall take the following Oath or Affirmation: ``I do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will faithfully execute the Office of the President of the United States, and will to the best of my Ability, preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States.''  
   The Constitution considers the oath so important that it requires the man or woman who is elected President to take it. So given the importance of an oath--it is so important that no one elected can serve unless they take it--how can we say that willful violation of that oath, being perjury and obstruction, doesn't rise to the level of impeachment? 
   President Clinton has discredited the oath that the chief law enforcement officer of the Nation must take. We have compounded that discredit by not holding him accountable. 
   Manager LINDSEY GRAHAM said that ``we could leap boldly into the 21st century by ignoring the rule of law.'' Unfortunately, the Senate opted to crawl. 
   My colleagues, we all in politics know what a user is. With all due respect, Bill Clinton is a user. He used Monica Lewinsky; he used his friends; he used his Cabinet; he used the American people; and now he is using the Senate. 
   The President has never been held accountable. He wasn't held accountable for not telling the truth about the draft; he was not held accountable for not telling the truth about marijuana; he was not held accountable for lying about his relationship with Gennifer Flowers; he was not held accountable for his actions towards Paula Jones; he was not held accountable for lying about Monica Lewinsky. He will walk away from this trial with an acquittal, and yet again he will avoid accountability for his actions. He will avoid being held accountable for the actions that every American citizen, every teacher, every CEO, every military man and woman, would have lost his or her job over, and we let it happen. We did. With the greatest respect, that is not a profile in courage. 
   After the acquittal, I hope we will not be a party to the party. The champagne corks will pop; cigars will be lit; maybe even the bongo drums will be played. I implore you, colleagues, don't go to the party. There is nothing to celebrate. Act worthy of yourselves. 
   In 1880, when Dostoevsky, the great Russian author, wrote ``The Brothers Karamazov,'' he could not even have dreamed that there would ever be a Bill Clinton, but here is what he says, and it goes right to the heart of this entire case:  
   The important thing is to stop lying to yourself. A man who lies to himself and believes his own lies becomes unable to recognize the truth, either in himself or anyone else, and he ends up losing respect for himself as well as for others. 
   When he has no respect for anyone, he can no longer love. And in order to divert himself, having no love in him, he yields to his impulses, indulges in the lowest form of pleasure, and behaves in the end like an animal in satisfying his vices. And it all comes from lying, lying to others and to yourself.  
   The rule of law and the President's constitutional oath must pass the test of truth. President Clinton, regrettably, failed that test. 
   Mr. Chief Justice, I am satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that William Jefferson Clinton is guilty of perjury, is guilty of obstruction of justice, and must be removed from office. I have only to answer to my conscience, to the Constitution, and the judgment of history, and I stand ready for that judgment. 
   I yield back any time.

    Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize students from Milford High School in Milford, New Hampshire for their outstanding performance in the ``We the People.*.*.*.The Citizen and the Constitution'' program. 
   On May 1-3, 1999, more than 1200 students from across the United States will be in Washington, D.C., to compete in the national finals of the ``We the People.*.*.*.The Citizen and the Constitution'' program. I am proud to announce that the class from Milford High School will represent the state of New Hampshire in this national event. These young scholars have worked diligently to reach the national finals and through their experience have gained a deep knowledge and understanding of  the fundamental principles and values of our constitutional democracy. 
   The ``We the People.*.*.*.The Citizen and the Constitution'' program is the most extensive educational program in the country developed specifically to educate young people about the Constitution and the Bill of Rights. The three-day national competition is modeled after hearings in the United States Congress. These hearings consist of oral presentation by high school students before a panel of adult judges. The students testify as constitutional experts before a ``congressional committee,'' that is, the panel of judges representing various regions of the country and a variety of appropriate professional fields. The student testimony is followed by a period of questioning during which the judges probe students for their depth of understanding and ability to apply their constitutional knowledge. 
   Administered by the Center for Civic Education, the ``We the People *.*.* The Citizen and the Constitution'' program has provided curricular materials at upper elementary, middle, and high school levels for more than 26.5 million students nationwide. Members of Congress and their staff enhance the program by discussing current constitutional issues with students and teachers and by participating in other educational activities. 
   The student team from Milford High School is currently conducting research and preparing for the upcoming national competition in Washington, D.C. As a former history teacher, I recognize the importance and value of this unique educational experience.

    Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, last year, we enacted a three-year moratorium on new Internet sales taxes. Today, I am introducing a bill that would make this moratorium permanent. 
   Internet commerce has exploded in recent years. For example, U.S. sales on the Internet last year totaled $8 billion. This last Christmas season was about three times as busy as the previous one, with consumers spending about $3 billion on goods purchased over the Internet. A recent survey of American adults by the Pew Research Center suggests that 41% of American adults now uses the Internet. 
   For Americans who live in remote areas, such as residents of New Hampshire's North Country, the Internet offers major advantages. They now can shop by computer instead of driving several hours to the urban shopping malls or Main Street businesses. As noted by economist Larry Kudlow, other potential Internet shoppers include the elderly, busy executives, stay-at-home parents, the disabled and others. 
   Despite all of its benefits for our economy and American consumers, Internet commerce is at risk from state and local politicians seeking ever more tax revenues. Already, a number of states have imposed taxes on Internet sales. But there are several reasons why we should refuse to transform the Internet into a pot of gold for state and local tax collectors. 
   First, not only do all states and localities have other options for raising revenue--such as income taxes, use taxes and property taxes--but most are running budget surpluses. I asked the Congressional Research Service to analyze what has happened to traditional sales tax revenues over the past five years, when Internet use exploded. CRS reported that the growth in sales tax revenues has outpaced inflation in this period. 
   Second, a tax on Internet shopping is really just another tax on the American consumer. American consumers already pay taxes on their salaries, taxes on their capital gains, property taxes on their homes, taxes on the goods they purchase from instate vendors, and estate taxes on any property they have managed to save by the time of their death. Imposing yet another layer of taxes in cyberspace is simply unfair, especially because many Internet shoppers already pay shipping or handling costs in addition to the purchase price of the goods they buy. 
   Furthermore, imposing new taxes on Internet-related revenues could stifle the development of Internet commerce in the U.S. As reported in yesterday's Wall Street Journal, a University of Chicago economist who studied the buying decisions of 25,000 Internet shoppers found that applying sales taxes to Internet commerce ``would reduce the number of online buyers by 25% and spending by more than 30%.'' 
   Some politicians would like to make each online business be a sales tax collector for every tax jurisdiction in the United States. Doing so simply would give Internet businesses--especially those whose profit margins are slim--a good incentive to move offshore. Geography is not important on the Internet, and many Internet vendors can relocate without disruption to their customers. 
   Finally, many Internet transactions are really interstate commerce. The Founding Fathers recognized the danger that each state might impose taxes or tariffs on goods produced in other states, so they authorized the Federal government to prevent interstate trade wars. In interpreting the Commerce Clause of the U.S. Constitution, the Supreme Court has held that commerce which crosses state boundaries should be subject to state sales taxes only when both seller and buyer are in the same state, or when the seller has a presence in the buyer's state. 
   There is little reason to fear, as some have claimed, that Main Street businesses are at risk from Internet vendors. I can think of nothing that would prevent these businesses from offering their own on-line shopping services. Some already have done so with great success. Moreover, the Internet likely will attract entirely new customers whose purchases will only increase total retail sales. 
   The purpose of the bill I am introducing today is to allow Internet commerce to continue to prosper in this country, by making permanent the three-year moratorium that we enacted last year. Under my bill, state and local governments could not impose new Internet sales taxes. 
   Mr. President, I hope that all of my colleagues will support this legislation, which is of great importance to the American consumer and our economy.

    Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I am here today to join my colleagues, Majority Leader TRENT LOTT and Environment Committee Chairman JOHN CHAFEE, in expressing support for enacting legislation this year to reform the remediation waste provisions of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA). 
   As many of my colleagues know, since I assumed the chairmanship of the Superfund, Waste Control and Risk Assessment Subcommittee, which has jurisdiction over RCRA, I have worked to bring some rational reforms to this hazardous waste law. It is well known that hazardous waste cleanups in this country take too long, are too costly, and inhibit the redevelopment of industrial brownfield sites. 
   Since I first introduced RCRA remediation legislation in the 104th Congress, I have worked with Senators LOTT, CHAFEE, BREAUX, BAUCUS, and LAUTENBERG, with the Clinton Administration, state governments and members of the industrial and environmental communities to achieve a bipartisan fix to this confusing and burdensome law. Despite our best efforts, we were not able to come to an agreement before the close of the 105th Congress. 
   However, I am eager to press forward and reach a bipartisan agreement this year. There is simply too much time and money being wasted under the current regulatory process for Congress not to take action on this important issue. In fact, according to a GAO report, as much as $2 billion per year could be saved by making certain common sense legislative fixes to RCRA. In addition to cost savings, cleanups would be accelerated by removing bureaucratic roadblocks. Such reforms mean a win for the economy and a win for the environment. 
   In closing, I want to reiterate my pledge to working with Senators LOTT, CHAFEE, BAUCUS, and LAUTENBERG to reach consensus on much needed reforms to the RCRA program this year. It will certainly be one of my subcommittee's top priorities.

    Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to honor Matthew Conor Repeta, of Bedford, New Hampshire, on achieving the rank of Eagle Scout. This first-rate young man was awarded the rank of Eagle Scout on September 9, 1998, by the District Eagle Board. 
   Matthew began scouting at the age of seven in Eagan, Minnesota, as a Tiger Cub. He advanced through the Cub Scout ranks of Bobcat, Wolf, Bear and Webelos. Matthew joined Bedford Troop 414 in 1991. While in Troop 414, he was an Assistant Patrol Leader and a Patrol Leader. 
   I want to commend Matthew for receiving the highest award that is attainable in Scouting. For his Eagle Project, Matthew built a handicap ramp for a local museum with other scouts from his troop. This example of service demonstrates the ideals for which scouting stands. Matthew exemplifies these qualities for which all Scouts strive: Honor, Loyalty, Courage, Cheerfulness and Service. For all of Matthew's hard work and devotion to these ideals, he has earned this coveted recognition. As the father of two former Scouts, I understand the time and effort that is involved in fulfilling the ideals of being a Scout. 
   I know that Matthew will continue to be a positive role model among his peers, a leader in his community, a friend to those in need and an inspiration to all. I want to extend my sincerest congratulations and best wishes to Matthew. His achievement of Eagle Scout and significant contributions to the Bedford community are truly outstanding. It is an honor to represent him in the United States Senate.

    Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to honor Ronald and Beverly Gendron, two remarkable people who have been dedicated to making a difference in the lives of the less fortunate for over ten years in the city of Manchester, New Hampshire. 
   Ronald and Beverly founded the Helping Hands Outreach Center over ten years ago and have been committed to helping New Hampshire's needy ever since. Ronald and Beverly have now retired from the Helping Hands Outreach Center and are continuing their dedication to helping others by organizing a new outreach center in Laconia, New Hampshire. 
   Ronald and Beverly Gendron founded the Helping Hands Outreach Center of Manchester in 1986. The Center is dedicated to assisting in the problems of homelessness, hunger, and drug and alcohol addictions. 
   Ronald and Beverly have retired from Helping Hands of Manchester to embark on a new endeavor. They are organizing a new social service organization in Laconia, New Hampshire. With the Gendrons' help, the Open Arms Outreach Center of Laconia will be a ministry dedicated to providing assistance to troubled families. Ronald and Beverly will work closely with Laconia and State officials to offer housing and shelter in the Greater Laconia area. 
   Mr. President, the Gendrons have devoted their time and their hearts for over ten years to serve the homeless and suffering in the Greater Manchester Area. Ronald and Beverly served southern New Hampshire's needy well. 
   I would like to extend my best wishes to them as they embark on their new endeavor to assist in the lives of the needy in the Lakes Region of New Hampshire. It is people like the Gendrons that help make New Hampshire a special place to live. It is an honor to represent them in the United States Senate.

   Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill to allow qualified members of the clergy of all faiths to participate in the Social Security program. 
   This bill would provide a two-year ``open season'' during which certain ministers who previously had filed for an exemption from Social Security coverage could revoke their exemption. These members of the clergy would become subject to self-employment taxes, and their earnings would be credited for Social Security and Medicare purposes. 
   Before 1968, a minister was exempt from Social Security coverage unless he or she chose to elect coverage. Since 1968, ministers have been covered by Social Security unless they file an irrevocable exemption with the Internal Revenue Service, usually within two years of beginning their ministry. 
   On two other occasions, in 1977 and again in 1986, ministers were given a similar opportunity to revoke their exemption from Social Security coverage. Despite the existence of these brief ``open season'' periods, many exempt ministers did not take advantage of or have not had the opportunity to revoke their exemption from Social Security coverage. Because the exemption from Social Security is irrevocable, there is no way for them to gain access to the program under current law. 
   Only an ``individual who is a duly ordained, commissioned, or licensed minister of a church, or a member of a religious order who has not taken a vow of poverty,'' would be able to revoke his or her exemption from Social Security, under my bill. Of course, this measure would not permit ministers who already have reached retirement age to gain access to the Social Security program. 
   This bill primarily would benefit modestly paid clergy, who are among the most likely to need Social Security benefits upon retirement. Many chose not to participate in the Social Security program early in their careers, before they fully understood the ramifications of filing for an exemption. 
   If enacted, this measure would raise about $45 million over the next five years, according to the Congressional Budget Office. CBO has scored the bill as a revenue raiser and, as a result, it will require no budget offset. Over the long-term, the legislation would cost money, but I do not expect its costs to be that significant because CBO has estimated that only about 3,500 members of the clergy would exercise the option that this bill provides. 
   The need for this legislation was brought to my attention by the distinguished bishop in Manchester, New Hampshire, Reverend Bishop O'Neil. He made me aware of the hardships facing individual ministers who may or may not have any retirement income. The bill also has the endorsement of the U.S. Catholic Conference. 
   I want to thank my principal cosponsors, Senators MOYNIHAN and MACK, for their support of this much-needed legislation. Let me also point out that this measure is identical to Title 8 of H.R. 3433, the Ticket-to-Work Act, which passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 410 to 1 last June. 
   In closing, this bill gives members of the clergy a limited opportunity to enroll in the Social Security system, similar to those provided by Congress in 1977 and 1986. Mr. President, I hope that all of my colleagues will support this legislation, which is so important to a number of clergy in the United States.
