Mr. WARNER. During the past two weeks, the Senate Armed Services Committee has conducted hearings on the readiness of the armed forces. Through testimony from the Secretary of Defense, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and the service secretaries, it has been revealed that the military is trained and being asked to perform beyond capacity. The readiness of the armed forces is clearly and unmistakably suffering. For the past several years, this has been the concern of many of the committee and in the Senate, myself included, and we have made every argument during this precipitous decade-plus decrease in defense budgeting to reduce the cuts, arguing that we've cut well beyond the fat and the flesh, and have long been cutting into the bone. 
This situation is now receiving the priority so long overdue. Approximately $7 billion of the emergency spending supplemental currently being debated is for immediate defense readiness funding shortfalls. This is, however, only a stop gap measure, and must be the first step in a long journey to ensure the military is properly exercised and outfitted to defend U.S. national security interests. 
If we are to responsibly correct this readiness shortcoming, then we must look to the root cause or causes. I believe, as do several of my colleagues on the armed services committee, and others in the Senate, that the primary and foremost reason for the readiness shortfall is an incongruity between the foreign policy goals of this administration, the strategy, and the resources to achieve those goals. 
While defense spending is at an historical low, the armed forces are being exercised and deployed in ever increasing frequency and with less and less direction. Earlier this year, for example, Admiral Conrad Lautenbacher gave the remarkable statistic that since the demise of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War, the Navy-Marine Corps team alone has been involved in 93 naval contingencies in 96 months. That is an average of almost once a month that the Navy-Marine Corps team has been involved in a contingency of importance to our national security. 
As the Congress prepares to adjourn, we do so in a world laden with instability, one which will demand U.S. leadership and engagement. In Kosovo, refugees--numbering nearly a quarter of a million--are fleeing from Kilosevic's forces. They are cowering in the mountains where the harsh winter of the Balkan mountains will kill thousands more, or they are flooding neighboring countries for relief--but finding those countries ill-equipped to support them. I am confident NATO, under U.S. leadership, will soon take action to end the strife action which will require the deployment of a ground forces in Kosovo--with some U.S. participants in view of having an American commander of NATO. 
Israel remains the flashpoint in the Middle East, but others come and go. Turkish troops are massing on the Syrian border, preparing to defend a pre-World War II territory claim and retaliate to any Syrian opposition in force. The Taliban, having secured a religious revolution in Afghanistan, have engaged Iranian forces along their common border in an escalating war between two sects of Islam. 
While the Gulf War has been over for seven years, Iraq, in defiance of the world community, continues to remain armed. Two months have passed since Saddam Hussein prohibited officials from the United Nations Special Commission on Iraq from conducting inspections. Further, the testing of Vx gas by Iraq has been corroborated by independent tests in France. Questions, credible ones, still arise over their nuclear posture. 
Worldwide, a proliferation of nuclear technology and the proliferation of the means to deliver weapons of mass destruction is unnevering. India and Pakistan now have the bomb, and unfortunately, like so many other neighbors in the world community, they also have the motive to use it against each other. The launch of the Taepo Dong 1 by North Korea was a clear and unmistakable `shot heard round the world.' Such an action by a militarized, secretive, isolated, country in the throws of an overwhelming economic depression, by a people increasingly in despair, is a harbinger of catastrophe. 
This is but a brief summary--a few examples to illustrate where I see continuing and emerging challenges to United States national security interests. Clearly, the end of the Cold War was not peace, but a transformation of the world's politico-military order with unsettled ancient conflicts based on ethnic, religious or tribal differences and interests against emerging. These threats require our continued vigilance and must be our highest concerns. 
It is in this context that former Secretary of Defense, Dr. James Schlesinger, examines the current administrations ability to meet these threats given current U.S. force structure and the resources accorded to achieving foreign and defense goals. In his article, `Raise the Anchor or Lower the Ship, Defense Budgeting and Planning,' published in the Fall of 1998 edition of The National Interest, Dr. Schlesinger articulates the dilemma with which we find ourselves in recouping the peace dividend in an unstable world that demands U.S. presence and leadership. 
Dr. Schlesinger is far too modest to observe that his insights were part of the foundation that led to the increase in military funding that occurs in legislation to be adopted by Congress this week; I encourage each of my colleagues to take a moment to review the article. His forthright, candid discussion of the mismatch between the ends of U.S. foreign and defense policy and the means with which to realize those ends will be a prominent reference for the Senate Armed Services Committee and this body as we deliberate this emergency defense appropriations supplemental and future defense funding issues in the coming congress.

Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished President pro tempore. I think it should be noted from time to time, particularly on this, presumably one of the last 2 days of the Congress, that this distinguished President pro tempore has reported every morning the Senate has convened, so far as I know, to open the Senate. It is a responsibility he has taken unto himself with great dignity as he carries out his duties to the credit of this memorable institution, and we express our great appreciation to the President pro tempore. To the best of my knowledge, he has not missed a single day of this Congress in opening up the Senate, which is another record to add to the many, many records of our distinguished President pro tempore.

Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I have great concerns about our Nation's policy towards Cuba. Castro remains, in the mind of this Senator and the minds of most, as an individual who has brought great harm to that nation, and it persists to this day. The human suffering there is incalculable. 
Some months ago, I joined with my distinguished friend and colleague, the senior Senator from Connecticut, Mr. Dodd, who has had considerable experience in this region of our hemisphere, in trying to seek legislation to allow the sale of U.S. food, medicine and medical equipment to Cuba. 
Regrettably, that has not been done in its totality. There have been some efforts, but nevertheless that continues to present itself as an example of how I believe--and others share my belief--that the overall policy between the United States of America and Cuba should be thoroughly, pragmatically and objectively reviewed. With that purpose in mind, I and other Senators--I think some 15 in number--have written the President of the United States requesting that he, hopefully jointly with the Congress, establish a commission to make such a study. In short, we wrote President Clinton recommending `the establishment of a national bipartisan commission to review our current U.S.-Cuba policy.' 
My reason for making this recommendation is simple and straightforward. The current United States-Cuba policy in effect for nearly 40 years--that is astonishing, 40 years--has yet to achieve its goal of a peaceful transition to democracy in Cuba. 
Of course, Castro remains the single most formidable obstacle to achieving that goal. 
Now the time has come, in our judgment, for a thoughtful, rational and objective analysis of our current U.S. policy toward Cuba and its overall effect on this hemisphere. I am not alone in putting forward this proposal. As I have previously stated, I was joined in this recommendation to the President by a distinguished and bipartisan group of Senate colleagues. In addition, a world-respected group of former senior Government officials of our United States have written to me--I asked for that letter and obtained it--in strong support of the establishment of the commission. 
That distinguished group includes Howard Baker, Jr., former Senate majority leader; Frank Carlucci, former Secretary of Defense; Lawrence Eagleburger, former Secretary State; Henry Kissinger, former Secretary of State; William D. Rogers, former Under Secretary of State; Harry W. Shalaudeman, former Assistant Secretary of State and Malcolm Wallop, former U.S. Senator. Further, I am informed that former Secretary of State George Shultz supports our efforts. 
Mr. President, it is my hope that President Clinton will act to implement our recommendation. Should he choose to do so, the analysis and recommendations that are put forth will provide both the Congress and the Administration with the means to shape and strengthen our future relationship with Cuba. 
The recommendation that we have for this commission is parallel to one that was set up by a past President in response to the need to look at the overall hemisphere. It was known as the Kissinger Commission. It has, I think, the customary provisions in it whereby the President makes certain appointments and the Congress will make certain appointments. I think there will be a wealth of talent ready, able, and willing to step forward at the call of the Executive branch and the Legislative branch to take up the responsibility of a very serious challenge, to establish a revised policy between our Nation and Cuba.

Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I have repeatedly taken the floor to speak about my great concern regarding the people who are suffering today in Kosovo. As I stated in my remarks on previous days, I visited Kosovo some weeks ago in the company of the KDOM--which is a most unusual organization--but it has the permission by which to take unarmed missions into the countryside around Pristina and elsewhere, to see the ravages of that tragic conflict. 
Regrettably, even though we have now in place an agreement with Milosevic, the fighting and the strife continues. We have recently executed an agreement. I say `we.' Primarily, the United Nations and NATO have entered into an agreement with the Yugoslav Government, and President Milosevic signed it. 
There have been some changes in the status of forces of the Yugoslav Army and the like, but it is a very fluid situation. We hear one day units are moving out and then today there are reports that other Yugoslav Army units are being redeployed. The suffering, however, continues and the winter is coming. The whole world is standing by to witness what is, I think, one of the greatest recent tragedies. 
Weather is as cruel as weapons. I saw, for my own eyes, these people huddled in the hills, helpless, homeless, without food, without medicine; tens of thousands--we do not know with any specific accuracy how many there are, but it certainly is in excess of 100,000 human beings--innocent victims, by and large, of the conflicts, political and military, in this region of Kosovo. 
I have had the opportunity to get briefed by the Central Intelligence Agency, briefed by the Department of Defense; I try to remain as current as I can on this issue. The bottom line of what I am saying today is it is time that we look with great seriousness at the need to constitute a force which will have sufficient arms to go into that region and provide the stability necessary--I repeat, the stability necessary for the nongovernmental institutions and others to bring in the food, the medicine and the shelter that is required to support these people. It is as simple as that. They will simply perish by the tens of thousands without this sort of help. 
The agreement provides for the OSCE to come in. This is the first time in the history of that organization that they have ever undertaken a challenge of this magnitude. They are not organized, really, to work to provide security which requires force of arms, but some attempt will be made along that line. The bottom line, I think, is someone has to stand up--and I am prepared to do it--and say that NATO is the only force constituted that can come in, in a short period of days, literally days, to give that degree of stability so these emergency supplies can come in. It is my grave concern that unless that is done and done promptly, the world will witness human suffering of a magnitude we have not seen, certainly, in a long time. I think only NATO can step in to do this. 
I know the deep concern here in the Senate and elsewhere in the United States about employing any U.S. ground troops in the region of Kosovo. We went through those debates with regard to Bosnia. I personally was never in favor of it. But once we make a decision, as we have now made, and we have the agreements in place, there is absolutely no alternative but to faithfully try and execute our responsibility, together with NATO and the United Nations, to provide the environment in which, in the few weeks to come, we can save the lives of tens of thousands of innocent people. That can only be done by putting in place uniformed, organized, well-trained troops. Their presence could well be the deterrent to stop the fighting. 
In my judgment, there are no clean hands in this situation. The preponderance of the atrocities obviously have been committed by the Serbian forces under the direction, either indirectly or directly, of Slobodan Milosevic. There is no doubt about that. But there also are some attacks being perpetrated by the KLA, which is that disparate group, relatively undefined, whose leadership changes from time to time, whose organization has very little coordination between the various bands of the KLA, but nevertheless they have perpetrated atrocities and, apparently, there are reports that some atrocities are continuing to be perpetrated by the KLA. 
Only an absolutely neutral independence force, as constituted by the United Nations, together with NATO, can provide the security necessary to bring in the needed food and medicine. 
In looking over the agreement, and in consultation with the Department of Defense, I have learned of one very interesting development. I have not, as yet, seen it in the open press, but I have obtained the authority of the Department of Defense to mention this, because I think it is a positive goal. There are certain positive goals that have been achieved by this agreement. This one will be severely criticized. I certainly have some criticism of it. But there are some positive results of the agreement that have recently been executed between the United Nations, NATO and the Yugoslav Government.

Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, today, an enhanced Virtual Tour of the United States was published on the U.S. Senate web server. This enhanced tour uses state-of-the-art technology to combine high quality graphics with still pictures to provide information about historical events, rooms, and works of art in the Senate. 
The Virtual Tour provides people from all over the country, and indeed from around the world, an opportunity to visit the U.S. Senate via the World Wide Web. Information provided can be used to learn more about the U.S. Capitol, as well as to plan for tours of the Senate. 
From panoramic views of the Senate Chamber to a zoomed-in focus on the President's chair in the Old Senate Chamber, visitors to the Virtual Tour will experience the history of the Capitol Building and its famous rooms, as well as the richness of our country's heritage through artwork, statues, and sculptures that reflect the diversity of our Nation. The Virtual Tour currently has four rooms of the Senate available: the Senate Chamber, the Old Senate Chamber, the Old Supreme Court, and the President's room. Descriptions of important events associated with each room are provided with the graphics. Additional rooms are planned to be added on a monthly basis. 
I encourage my fellow Senators to let their constituents know about the Virtual Tour. This is a resource meant to be shared with the public and enjoyed by all. 
Finally, I would like to thank the following staff from the offices of the Senate Committee on Rules and Administration, the Senate Sergeant at Arms, the Secretary of the Senate, the Clerk of the House, and the Architect of the Capitol for their hard work and effort in planning, developing, and making the Virtual Tour of the Senate a reality: Cheri Allen, Chuck Badal, Richard Baker, Trent Coleman, Michael Dunn, Lisa Farmer, Wayne Firth, Charlie Kaiman, Betty Koed, Christopher Lee, Megan Lucas, Thomas Meenan, Heather Moore, Steve Payne, Brian Raines, Diane Skvarla, Ray Strong, Scott Strong, David Wall, and Wendy Wolff.

Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise to restate my strong support for the Internet Tax Freedom Act. I am proud to be a cosponsor of this legislation and pleased that with end the 105th Congress legislation that brings fairness and equitable tax treatment to hundreds of Virginia Internet and online companies. 
It has been a difficult week, but we have succeeded reaching a resolution on this most important issue. This moratorium is critical to the development of an industry that has become a pillar of Virginia's, and our Nation's, economy. 
I will ask a resolution passed earlier this year expressing the sense of the General Assembly of Virginia that the Internet should remain free from State and local taxes. 
Mr. President, I also wish to commend Governor Jim Gilmore. He has been a tireless advocate and a true leader on this issue. He was one of a handful of governors to recognize the potential of this industry and the irreparable harm that could come to it at the hands of tens of thousands of tax collectors across the Nation. He shares my view that we will remain the leader in the information technology industry only as long as we pursue policies of lower taxes and less regulation--policies that have made Virginia such an attractive home to thousands of high tech companies and their employees.  
House Joint Resolution No. 36 
Expressing the sense of the General Assembly of Virginia that services which provide access to the international network of computer systems (commonly known as the Internet) and other related electronic communication services, as well as data and software transmitted via such services, should remain free from fees, assessments, or taxes imposed by the Commonwealth or its political subdivisions. 
Agreed to by the House of Delegates, February 17, 1998; agreed to by the Senate, March 10, 1998. 
Whereas, services which provide access to the international network of computer systems (commonly known as the Internet) and other related electronic communication services, as well as data and software transmitted via such services, have provided immeasurable social, educational, and economic benefits to the citizens of Virginia, the United States, and the world; and 
Whereas, technological advancements made by and to the Internet and other related electronic communication services, as well as data and software transmitted via such services, develop at an ever-increasing rate, both qualitatively and quantitatively; and 
Whereas, these advancements have been encouraged, in part, by public policies which facilitate technological innovation, research, and development; and 
Whereas, companies which provide Internet access services and other related electronic communication services are making substantial capital investments in new plants and equipment; and 
Whereas, it has been estimated that consumers, businesses, and others engaging in interstate and foreign commerce through the Internet or other related electronic communication services could be subject to more than 30,000 separate taxing jurisdictions in the United States alone; and 
Whereas, multiple and excessive taxation places such investment at risk and discourages increased investment to provide such services, which, in turn, could put such jurisdictions at a long-term social, educational, and economic disadvantage; and 
Whereas, the growth and development of electronic communication services should be nurtured and encouraged by appropriate state and federal policies; and 
Whereas, the Commonwealth's exercise of its taxation and regulatory powers in relation to electronic communication services would likely impede the future viability and enhancement of Internet access services and other electronic communication services in the Commonwealth, which, in turn, could restrict access to such services, as well as data and software transmitted via such services, for all Virginians; and 
Whereas, previous rulings of departments of taxation or revenue in several states have resulted in state taxes being levied on Internet service providers or Internet-related services, and have, in some cases, prompted action by those states' legislatures to overturn such rulings; and 
Whereas, a majority of the states that have addressed the issue of taxing Internet-related services have chosen to exercise restraint in taxing Internet service providers and Internet-related services; and 
Whereas, Virginia's existing tax code (58.1-609.5) exempts from retail sales and use tax purchases of services where no tangible personal property is exchanged; and 
Whereas, pursuant to 58.1-609.5, the Commissioner of the Department of Taxation has promulgated regulations (Title 23 Virginia Administrative Code 10-210-4040) which provide that charges for services generally are exempt from retail sales and use tax, but that services provided in connection with sales of tangible personal property are taxable; and 
Whereas, in interpreting and applying Virginia's tax code and regulations, the Commissioner has ruled that sales of software via the Internet are not subject to Virginia's retail sales and use tax (P.D. 97-405, October 2, 1997); and 
Whereas, in further interpreting and applying Virginia's tax code and regulations, the Commissioner has ruled that providers of Internet access services and other electronic communication services are not subject to Virginia's retail sales and use tax (P.D. 97-425, October 21, 1997); and 
Whereas, services which provide access to the Internet and other related electronic communication services, as well as data and software transmitted via such services, are not tangible personal property and, therefore, should not be subject to Virginia's retail sales and use tax: now, therefore, be it 
Resolved by the House of Delegates, the Senate concurring, That Internet access services and other related electronic communication services, as well as data and software transmitted via such services, should remain free from fees, assessments, or taxes imposed by the Commonwealth and its political subdivisions; and, be it 
Resolved further, That P.D. 97-405 (October 2, 1997), by which the Commissioner ruled that sales of software via the Internet are not subject to Virginia's retail sales and use tax, correctly reflects the sense of the General Assembly and the law of the Commonwealth regarding this issue; and, be it 
Resolved further, That P.D. 97-425 (October 21, 1997), by which the Commissioner ruled that providers of Internet access services and other related electronic communication services are not subject to Virginia's retail sales and use tax, correctly reflects the sense of the General Assembly and the law of the Commonwealth regarding this issue; and, be it 
Resolved further, That, to the greatest extent possible, future rulings of the Commissioner reflect the sense of the General Assembly that Internet access services and other related electronic communication services, as well as data and software transmitted via such services, should remain free from fees, assessments, or taxes imposed by the Commonwealth and its political subdivisions; and, be it 
Resolved finally, That the Clerk of the House of Delegates transmit a copy of this resolution to the Commissioner of the Department of Taxation that he may be apprised of the sense of the General Assembly in this matter.

Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I wish to continue a series of remarks that I have placed before the Senate in the past several weeks regarding the increasing problems relating to Kosovo. Together, with other Senators, I have tried to avail myself of every opportunity to learn about this situation. Just weeks ago, I made a trip myself into the region, accompanied by two outstanding ambassadors, Miles and Hill, and had an opportunity to get firsthand impressions. My trip included Bosnia, Belgrade, Macedonia, and Kosovo. 
Those impressions, together with many years of really hard work studying the Balkan region, having first gone, in September 1992, into Sarajevo, I have even greater concern today about the implications of the problems unfolding in Kosovo and the necessity for the world to respond to stop the tragic killing that is taking place every day. 
I commend the majority leader--indeed, I am sure there are others who have worked diligently on this--but he has, in this busiest of all weeks of the year in the Senate, found time to convene in his office and otherwise meet with people--and I have joined him on several occasions--about this situation. Indeed, a few days ago a group of us sent a letter to the President of the United States expressing our concerns. This was a letter that followed the briefing by the Secretaries of State and Defense, with the National Security Adviser and the Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs. 
Mr. President, I will address particular parts of that letter to the President and his response. The response was quite comprehensive. 
Further today, I, and I am sure other Members of the Senate, have received drafts of proposed resolutions put forth by a Member on that side of the aisle and a Member on this side of the aisle. Given that they are drafts, and I don't know what the ultimate intention of the drafters will be, I will not identify the persons who distributed the drafts as a senatorial courtesy, but I would like to address my concerns relevant to both drafts. 
The purpose today is, again, to give my personal views regarding the plan of operation that has been laid before us publicly by this administration, by the NATO commanders and, indeed, by one or more of our allies, notably Great Britain. 
I commend their Minister for National Security and Defense. He has spoken most forthrightly. Indeed, I think his views closely match my own, and that is, any planning to go forward to correct the problems that exist in Kosovo today has to be, in my judgment, and in his, twofold--ground as well as air. 
One, a very decisive series of airstrikes, which I support. I believe, and others believe, that a necessary second component of any military action, to back up the airstrikes, has to be the quick placement of a stabilization ground force into Kosovo, into the region, primarily the capital, Pristina. If that is not done, Mr. President, the goals of the airstrikes can not have been fulfilled in my opinion. 
In my judgment, the predominant number of military units involved in that airstrike would be American, because of our specialized aircraft and air-to-ground precision ordinance. Our Allies in NATO will provide other important air assets. I think in order to consolidate the gains that we can anticipate from those air strikes, a stabilization force has to be put in place on the ground. 
The main urgency of the moment--is some approximately quarter of a million Kosovars, Albanians who have been driven from their homes and villages into the hills who are confronting now another enemy. Once it was the Milosevic police, the Milosevic regular army, but now it is weather that is forcing these tragic people to endure conditions which will be severely injurious to their health and safety. 
Food, medicine, and shelter must be brought in beginning immediately, to alleviate that crisis. 
And secondly, we want to have a cessation to the conflicts that have gone on between these peoples for these many months which have resulted in some 2,000-plus deaths, largely again suffered by the Albanians, the 90 percent of the population. But, indeed, there are incidents where the KLA, the insurgent forces within the Albanian population, have got to answer, themselves, for their responsibility for certain tragic killings of Serbs in this area. There are not clean hands on either side. 
But again, to summarize the objectives: Get immediate relief in for these refugees; and, secondly, stabilize the fighting among the minority Serbians and the majority Albanians. 
If that is not done, if that stabilization force is not quickly put in, this situation could even escalate in terms of the killing, because you will have removed that military force, i.e., the Serbian paramilitary police, and indeed the regular army, and the remnants that will be left of the Serbian people, such police that are left, will then be faced with the preponderance of a 90 percent ethnic Albanian population coming down out of the hills. And I doubt that they will come down and shake hands with their former Serbian neighbors--finding their homes ravaged, destroyed, their livestock killed, their fields burned. It will not be, Mr. President, a very peaceful setting once the air seals off the flow of heavy armaments and military down from Belgrade. 
Mr. President, herein is the problem as I see it. Our administration, regrettably--and I will refer to their letter momentarily--regrettably, has evaded, in my judgment, a full debate on the issue of the need for a stabilization force. They have focused the public attention in our country solely on the need for an airstrike, leaving out what I think should be responsible dialogue, beginning with the President and the Secretaries of State and Defense, on the need for a stabilization force. 
Yesterday, I met with a senior officer from NATO, together with other Senators, and he clearly understood the necessity for that stabilization force. Indeed, I happen to know firsthand NATO has studied the need for it. NATO has contingency plans to address that. The plans range all the way from taking the indigenous KDOM, which is a very interesting creation in this conflict--it is a combination of military people from the United States, Canada, and certain other European nations, and indeed I think some Russians, together with diplomatic officials from those nations who go out into this region, unarmed, for the purpose of reporting back on what is taking place in terms of the ravaging of the countryside, the condition of those who have been driven into the hills. And it has been a very valuable source of information for the free world to have had the reports of KDOM. I traveled with them; they are a brave lot. 
One option is to enlarge the KDOM. But again, KDOM is not there for military purposes. They are not trained as policemen. They are not trained as security forces. The individual military officers may have some training, but certainly by design and in terms of the logistic equipment, and the like, they are not prepared, in my judgment, to take on the potential parameters of conflicts that could break out following air strikes. 
Next it is thought that one or more organizations, like the O.S.C.E. in Europe, could come in and take over this situation to provide a stabilizing force. But that organization has no history. It has no history of taking on an operation of this magnitude. It has no logistical support. It has no experience in coordinating, bringing in troops from other countries. 
And so after dialogue with our guests yesterday, and dialogue with many others, it is my judgment that only NATO can provide such stabilization force as will be necessary in the immediate aftermath of a series of airstrikes--I repeat that--only NATO. I believe it unwise for the Administration now to rule out U.S. ground forces as being a part of a stabilization force composed of several NATO members. 
When we had the Secretary of Defense before the Armed Services Committee the other day, regrettably, he did not respond with the precision I would have liked regarding U.S. participation. Indeed, I think the record reflects statements to the effect that there will be no U.S. participation should a ground element for stabilization be necessary. 
Mr. President, I do not think that we should embark--I want to repeat that--I do not think we should embark on these airstrikes without a resolution of how that stabilization force is to be constituted and whether or not the United States will be a part of that force, because we will have started a situation of hitting a sovereign country. We have done that twice already here in the past month or two--hitting a sovereign nation with predominantly U.S. air assets--with really no clear understanding of what is going to take place immediately afterwards on the ground in Kosovo. 
We talk about a peace settlement. All of us would like to have a peace settlement, but I cannot believe that if you inflict severe air damage of the magnitude it will take to bring Milosevic, the principal wrongdoer in this whole situation--the principal wrongdoer for years and years, beginning back in Bosnia --you cannot suddenly expect him to come to the negotiating table in a matter of days. And it is within those days that the instability could grow in the Kosovo region. That is my concern. 
This instability could spread over into Albania, which is already torn by civil strife. Refugees could begin to flow into Montenegro. Montenegro is now burdened, heavily burdened, with refugees from Albania. More refugees into Macedonia. This whole region could be destabilized unless a stabilization force is put into Kosovo in a timely way. 
And further, in my judgment, the work that we have done, together with our allies over many years, to secure Bosnia, to the extent we achieved any results there--certainly relative peace compared to the war of several years ago--that could well be undermined, because if the insurgents down in Kosovo are not contained, that will spread into Bosnia and begin to undo what we have achieved, what little we have achieved thus far, toward the implementation of the Dayton accords. 
So my purpose in addressing Kosovo, again, is twofold. These resolutions in draft form call for only U.S. participation in airstrikes. I mean, it is very clearly laid out in both these resolutions. One of them states that: Whereas the Secretary of Defense, William Cohen, opposes the deployment of ground forces in Kosovo, as reflected in his testimony before Congress on October 6, and clearly says that while we support the use of air, it will be air, and air alone. 
That I think is an unwise position for the U.S. to take. 
Let me give you an example. Should it be the consensus of NATO that you have to bring a NATO ground force into Kosovo for stabilization, which is my judgment, and you plant the NATO flag, and the U.S. flag is not on the staff, we are not represented there, the question arises why? I mean, we bring into question, who is the commander in chief of NATO? It is an American officer. An American officer is to command of a stabilization force put into a hostile region, and there is not a single additional American there in that force! We should not take that position now. 
I fought for many years placing the ground troops in Bosnia. Year after year I voted against it. It was only on the last vote where I joined Senator Dole that I relented. I had no desire to see Americans go in there. I questioned, in some way, the vital security interests. But that s history; we are on the ground in Bosnia and our troops, with other SFOR elements are working to secure a lasting peace. NATO's credibility is on the line now in Kosovo, for only a credible threat to use force can move settlement talks in Belgrade. 
If NATO leaders, upon failure of diplomacy, launch a NATO air operation, the credibility of NATO is on the line. 
I think you should not start the air until we have fully answered the question: How do you secure the benefits flowing from the air operation and stabilize that region until the negotiators can come to the table and work out a cease fire. 
The other resolution being circulated today, likewise, calls solely for air, very explicitly. It has another provision in here which troubles me a great deal; that is, you can only use air for 6 months unless there is further consideration by the Congress. 
Mr. President, we have known for a long time that setting deadlines with regard to troops just does not work. Therefore, the placing of a deadline in connection with the use of air and limiting it to 6 months, to me, is not a wise way to proceed. Therefore, I have indicated I would not participate; indeed, I would vote against either of these resolutions should they come back in this form. Both resolutions limit the U.S. participation to air. The President is authorized to use the U.S. Armed Forces for the purpose only of conducting air operations and missile strikes against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. 
Again, you cannot plan an air operation without a concomitant means to secure the ground. 
Let me pose the hypothetical: Suppose you strike with air and you are successful in destroying certain targets, then is Milosevic likely to sit there and do nothing? He could counterattack. His only means of counterattack, in all probability, given his air capability is largely destroyed, his naval capability is hopefully bottled up in the caves or elsewhere, his only avenue to retaliate would be on the ground; perhaps, once again, send out his column of tanks and his column of heavy artillery. Bad weather and darkness of night travel could inhibit air operations. 
Air could interdict, I am sure, much of it, but it might require a ground force at some point to interdict such actions as may be taken in retaliation by Milosevic. 
I urge the Senate to be very, very cautious as we proceed. I hope to continue our debate with other Senators here as it relates to this situation. 
I turn to the response of the President. As I said, it contained specific responses. This is the President speaking. On page 4 he states:  
Second, on the question of ground force, although NATO planners reviewed a broad range of options, some of which would involve grounding forces and hostile circumstances. I can assure you [this is written to all nine of us] the United States would not support these options and there is currently no sentiment in NATO for such a mission. The mission under consideration involves the use of graduated air power, not military forces on the ground. 
Now, to me, that is just faulty planning. 
I do support the use of force to stop the killing, to enable the NGOs and others to have an environment into which they can bring supplies to help these people. I do not give my support unless a convincing argument is put forth about a stabilizing force and the need to have that force in order to secure the Kosovo region. 
We have to be very careful that the credibility of NATO is protected. It is on the line. We cannot allow the NATO force to be considered as acting in concert with the KLA. That is a tough call. Try and find a KLA leader. They are difficult to find. I am not talking about Rugova in Pristina. He has been accessible to all. These militants, the heads of the KLA troops, in this area of Kosovo are not well defined, not well known, and not well coordinated. It is a problem to contain them once we begin to use our air. We cannot seem to be coming in here with a military hand to support Kosovo gaining independence from the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. That is not our goal. 
Again, only a ground force containing this situation in Kosovo, until such time as a settlement can be worked out at the table, is the only way, in my judgment, that this matter can be resolved. 
I hope other Senators will come forward and give their views because this could break in military action any day now. I don't predict in any way when the strike may begin. Hopefully, diplomatic efforts, which are still ongoing, can prevent the necessity of the use of force. It is only that credible determination to use force, as perceived in Belgrade, that will bring about successful diplomatic negotiations.

Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Admiral Joe Lopez on the occasion of his Change of Command as Commander of Allied Forces, Southern Europe and U.S. Naval Forces, Europe and his retirement from the United States Navy after 39 years of dedicated service to the nation. 
Joe Lopez joined the United States Navy to see the world--and see the world he did. A native of Powellton, West Virginia, he enlisted in the Navy in September 1959. In 1964, he was commissioned an Ensign via the Seaman-to-Admiral Program and upon commissioning, he was assigned first to the U.S.S. Eugene A. Greene (DD 711) and then to the U.S.S. Lind (DD 703). While onboard both of these destroyers, he saw action in Vietnam. 
Admiral Lopez received his first command in September 1969, when he assumed the duties as Commander, River Assault Division 153, which operated in the Mekong Delta in Vietnam and as part of a counter-offensive into Cambodia in May 1970. Admiral Lopez was the only Navy commanding officer to lead a river assault into Cambodia. 
Following tours of duty at the Naval Postgraduate School, the Armed Forces Staff College, and as Flag Secretary and Staff Officer for Commander, Cruiser-Destroyer Group Eight, Admiral Lopez served as the Executive Officer onboard the U.S.S. Truett (FF 1095) from 1977 to 1979. While he was XO, the Truett operated in the Mediterranean and Red Seas. 
Admiral Lopez commanded the U.S.S. Stump (DD 978) from September 1982 to November 1984. As the CO of Stump he completed a Persian Gulf deployment. Admiral Lopez' next command tour was as Commander, Destroyer Squadron 32, which deployed to the Mediterranean Sea. He followed his Squadron Commander assignment with duties as Executive Assistant to the Deputy Chief of Naval Operations for Manpower, Personnel and Training and as Executive Assistant to the Vice Chief of Naval Operations. 
Admiral Lopez was promoted to Rear Admiral in July 1989. He served as Defense Secretary Dick Cheney's senior military assistant from July 1990 to July 1992 including during the Persian Gulf Conflict. From July 1992 to December 1993, he commanded the United States Sixth Fleet and NATO's Striking and Support Forces, Southern Europe, homeported in Gaeta, Italy. 
For the next three years he served as the Navy's senior acquisition official, the Deputy Chief of Naval Operations for Resources, Warfare Requirements and Assessments. He led the Navy's transition to a force that is able to operate effectively in the littorals. His accomplishments include helping to develop the next generation of nuclear-powered attack submarines, the recently named Virginia class of fast attack subs, which are being built jointly by Newport News Shipbuilding and Electric Boat. 
Admiral Lopez became Commander in Chief, U.S. Naval Forces, Europe and Commander in Chief, Allied Forces, Southern Europe on 31 July 1996. As CINC AFSOUTH, he commanded the Peace Implementation Forces (IFOR) in Bosnia-Herzegovina from July 1996 to November 1996. 
Tomorrow, at a ceremony at Headquarters AFSOUTH in Naples Italy, after more than two years as the senior military commander in NATO's southern region, Admiral Lopez will relinquish command to Admiral James O. Ellis, Jr. The ceremony will also mark the retirement of Admiral Joe Lopez after a 39-year Navy career. 
Mr. President, Admiral Lopez has had a tremendous career and I wish to thank him for the superb job he has done as Commander in Chief of Allied Forces, Southern Europe and U.S. Naval Forces Europe. He demonstrated outstanding leadership as commander of the NATO forces in charge of enforcing the Dayton Peace Agreement. In my travels to that war-torn region of the world I have come to know Admiral Lopez well. We have traveled together on official business. On many occasions, I have visited Joe and his wife Vivian at their quarters in Naples, and have sought the Admiral's counsel, especially on the volatile situations in the Balkans. Admiral Joe Lopez is a man of vision and an astute realist. I will continue to seek his counsel during his retirement. 
I congratulate Joe and Vivian Lopez upon the completion of their active duty Navy career and thank them for their service to the country. And finally, I want to thank Admiral Lopez for his friendship and honest counsel over the years. Since the closing days of World War II, 1945, I have known and served with many sailors. I rank him at the top, a `4.0 seaman patriot.'

 Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the U.S. Navy Submarine Force as it approaches its 100 year anniversary and to commend to the work of the National Commemorative Committee for the Centennial of the Submarine Force. 
The submarine force traces its beginnings to the spring morning of April 11, 1900. Following demonstration trials off Mount Vernon on the Potomac River, the Navy agreed to purchase the submarine boat USS Holland (SS-1). The USS Holland was named for its inventor John Holland. Inventors such as John Holland and Simon Lake had been experimenting in submarine design during the last decades of the nineteenth century. However, Mr. Holland was the first to give the submarine true mobility by using a gasoline engine on the surface and a battery supplying electric motors when submerged. It was due to the success of the USS Holland that the Navy pursued the submarine program. For this reason, the Submarine Force traditionally recognized April 11th as the anniversary of its establishment. 
Dramatic improvements to the submarine have been made since the USS Holland. The diesel engine replaced the gasoline engine in 1912. All welded hulls, allowing submarines to submerge to much greater depths, were introduced in the 1930s. Radar and sonar were incorporated during World War II. It is with the introduction of nuclear power, however, that the submarine became a true submersible--limited in endurance only by the needs of its human crew. 
Earlier this year the Naval Nuclear Propulsion Program celebrated its 50th anniversary. It was in 1948 that the legendary Admiral Hyman Rickover, then a Captain, assigned himself the task of building a nuclear submarine. At that time, the technology that enabled the release of nuclear power was in its infancy. Just seven years later, the USS Nautilus put to sea under nuclear power. Today the Navy's nuclear submarine force is a crown jewel of our Nation's Defense arsenal. 
In the year 2000, the Navy's Submarine Force will celebrate its 100th anniversary. The Secretary of the Navy has designated the period from January 2000 through December 2000 for the commemoration of the Centennial of the U.S. Submarine Force. The Director of Submarine Warfare, Rear Admiral Malcolm Fages, and the Submarine Warfare Division have the responsibility for overall coordination of commemorative activities with assistance of the National Commemorative Committee for the Centennial of the Submarine Force. 
Mr. President, it is the work of the National Commemorative Committee and its chairman, Admiral Hank Chiles, that I wish to recognize today. Plans are already underway to observe the anniversary at appropriate occasions throughout the calendar year 2000. The National Commemorative Committee is planning events and ceremonies that will provide the opportunity for people to observe and experience the special world of the U.S. Navy Submarine Force and to become more acquainted with its rich and colorful history. Proposed events for 2000 include the opening of a Smithsonian exhibit, a birthday ball and the unveiling of a submarine stamp in Washington, DC, and participation in fleet week celebrations throughout the year. 
I commend the dedicated effort of the National Commemorative Committee for the Centennial of the Submarine Force and urge my colleagues to support the Committee as they continue their work planning the centennial events.

Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, there is increasing concern within the United States, and quite properly, for the fate of the people of Kosovo. I wish to address my concerns, in what I deliver to the Senate this afternoon, in what are entirely my remarks. I take full responsibility for the views and opinions that I express. I have, however, availed myself of every opportunity to learn firsthand about the critical nature of this problem, 
including a visit several weeks ago to this region which included a trip to Bosnia, thence to Belgrade, thence to Macedonia, and then into Kosovo. I commend the Ambassadors from the United States to Macedonia and--he has the rank of DCM--to Serbia for their very diligent and hard work in representing the interests of our Government and, indeed, those of our principal allies. That is Ambassador Hill and Ambassador Miles. I spent a considerable time with both. 
Likewise, I was given the opportunity in Kosovo to visit with a group known as KDOM, which is an unusual group constituted following negotiations between our Ambassadors and, as I understand, their counterparts in Belgrade whereby this group of U.S. military and diplomatic, Russian military and diplomatic, Canadian military and diplomatic and, indeed, some of the EU nations, are given the opportunity to travel without weapons into certain regions of Kosovo for the purpose of observing--and I repeat--observing the tragic unfolding of atrocities throughout that country. I joined them in their armored cars for the purpose of this visit and then had the opportunity to be debriefed extensively by these individuals. 
They are doing a remarkable job taking personal risks and providing the free world with an inside examination of this serious and critical problem. I wish to pay them tribute. I also was able, when I returned, to visit with the NATO commander, General Clark, to get them some additional equipment to carry out their missions. 
I have also, like most Senators, availed myself, since 1992, of the opportunities to visit in Bosnia and to study the complex issues that brought about that tragic period of hostilities, which hostilities now have been brought to some measure of conclusion, largely because of the allied forces that are in there providing the security so that the Dayton accords can be implemented. 
In this entire region, referred to as the Balkans, you cannot touch one spot without affecting, in my judgment, the others. 
Now NATO, the United Nations, the United States--all of us --are faced with the following situation: Repeatedly in Kosovo atrocities are taking place against innocent human beings, largely innocent. We have no way of judging their culpability in the separatist movement initiated sometime ago by the forces known as the KLA, but while I was there, I saw the houses being burned, I saw armed people, I saw the hopeless refugees numbering in the hundreds of thousands who had been driven into the hills and wanted to do the right thing, to alleviate the human suffering. That is the main threshold. 
Also, our Nation and our allies have put a very considerable investment, first, of the risks taken by our military and diplomatic people and the NGOs--those of nongovernmental organizations who have brought relief to this region--we have put an enormous investment of time and effort to bring about a cessation of those hostilities. In my judgment, unless this situation in Kosovo is likewise secured, it could undermine such advances, although modest, in my judgment, that we have made collectively as nations in this region. First is humanitarian concern for the people; second is to prevent instability as a consequence of this conflict, erasing some of the gains that we have had there. 
Lastly, our Nation is proud of the fact that we are the leader, in my judgment, in NATO. Only NATO is the only military force that can and, indeed, should be employed if it is necessary to bring about the cessation of hostilities in Kosovo. 
The administration has made efforts, I think many bona fide efforts, through the diplomatic chain--speaking directly with Milosevic in Belgrade. We have been joined by other nations, referred to as the `contact group.' I think every effort has been made diplomatically in the past that could have been made, and now that effort is strengthened by a degree day by day of the assertion by the United Nations with regard to their growing concern about the humanitarian problems taking place in Kosovo. 
But in no way should the military option, which has to back up diplomacy--diplomacy can be no more effective than the credibility of the willingness of certain nations to back up that diplomatic effort--in no way should the United Nations, in my judgment, have any veto over the decision of the collection of nations--the United States being one, Great Britain, France, Germany and others--to take such action as they deem necessary to bring about a cessation of the tragic situation in Kosovo. 
I want to repeat that. Never should the United Nations be put in the position, nor NATO allow itself to be put in a position, where the United Nations has a veto power over the decisionmaking of NATO. But I think the annunciations by the Security Council recently give adequate cover for those nations who wish to collectively act, if necessary, to back up their diplomacy with military action. 
That military action, in my judgment, has very severe consequences. I want to make it clear, speaking for myself, that I support the use of force if diplomacy fails, and that is a tough position to take, because I have had grave reservations through these many years about our continued participation and expenditure and deployment of troops in Bosnia, but in the final resolution of the Dayton accords, I felt that I would lend my support, and did, for the putting in of the SFOR and IFOR forces. They have, as I say, to some modest degree, achieved the milestones set out in the Dayton accords. But, in my judgment, of course, we took a step backward, regrettably, as a consequence of the recent elections. Nevertheless, always focus on the considerable investment we have put in that region and how that investment can be jeopardized unless the Kosovo situation is stopped in terms of the atrocities. 
How do we do it? My concern is the discussion in the open thus far--and I have availed myself of classified sources and I will only address the open discussion--is that the use of air power will bring about a situation whereby Milosevic in Belgrade will cease the directions and cease sending the Serb Army and the police associated with the Serb Army to stop perpetrating these atrocities. I think if that air power were absolutely and unequivocally of a magnitude that could get that attention, then it would work. But, in my judgment, air alone will not satisfy the situation. 
There is a very interesting fact of Kosovo that is well known: 
that the Kosovar Albanians number about 90 percent of the population, and 10 percent are of Serb ethnicity. Yet, for the past several years, ever since Milosevic I think wrongfully stripped Kosovo province of a certain degree of its autonomy years ago, the Serbians have pretty well controlled that region. And they have used repressive forces against the Kosovars for years. 
This insurrection did not happen overnight. It has been coming on for many years. I visited Kosovo in 1991 with Senator Dole, with Senator Nickles, and others. We went into that region. And we saw with our own eyes the tension that was developing. But the point I wish to make, the air operation, I am confident, could be of such a magnitude as to seal off and stop the flow of supplies, the professional Army and, indeed, I think many of the supplemental police forces that have come down from Serbia to perpetrate these atrocities. That can be done. 
But then we leave a region which is affiliated largely 90 percent with the Kosovar Albanians pitted against the 10 percent remnants of the Serbian force. And it is my judgment that that situation would quickly destabilize and you would experience atrocities of a greater magnitude than are taking place in the recent weeks and, indeed, for many, many months in that region. 
I want to point out these atrocities, the greater proportion of the atrocities, I think, are directly linked to Milosevic and the Serbian interests. But there have been instances where the Kosovar Albanians have perpetrated atrocities of a comparable magnitude in viciousness, but of course not in a magnitude of totality of loss of life in that region. So both sides come to this problem not with clean hands at all, in my judgment. 
The Kosovar Albanians have as one of their objectives a greater Albania. You have virtual anarchy now in Albania. You have large populations of the refugees that have left Albania in Montenegro. That is destabilized. You have some in Macedonia. Indeed, these refugees are throughout this region. And in the event that force has to be used as a consequence of the failure of diplomatic efforts, my concern is that the KLA will view that as the allies, the nations of NATO, coming to their aid and supporting their long-term goal of a greater Albania. That is very troublesome, Mr. President, very troublesome. 
That is why I believe--and, again, it is my judgment--that any military action to bring about a cessation of the current level of atrocities in Kosovo has to be associated with what I call a ground element or a stabilizing force that would prevent a greater level of insurrection amongst the populations of predominantly 90 percent Kosovar Albanians and 10 percent Serbs.

Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I go back to the situation and recap quickly. As I look at what is in the open, as I say, reported in the New York Times, the Washington Post--and recently we have had some excellent reporting about the military options being examined by NATO--they either intentionally or otherwise leave out any reference to a stabilizing force and the need for that force in Kosovo. And that is the basic reason why I take the floor of the Senate today, to express my own professional judgment that any air operation to alleviate the suffering here has to have, very speedily, a follow-up ground presence in Kosovo to prevent what I predict would be an increased clash among these peoples with the absence of a stabilizing force. 
I think it is very important that the President, if he is contemplating the use of force, together with the heads of state of other nations, come to the Congress, come to the American people and point out--if I am wrong, point it out. But I have consulted a great many people about this situation. As I say, I saw it myself weeks ago. The hatred between the Kosovar Albanians and the remnants of the Serbs that are still there is incredible. It is beyond the ability of anybody really to explain it. They will fall upon themselves as they come down out of these hills. 
There are maybe as much as a quarter of a million people--refugees--in these hills. When they return to their villages and homes, which I saw, which are burned and destroyed, and see the looting and the destruction, both of human beings and property, they will be incensed, and I think they will turn to fighting themselves. And that is a situation we cannot allow to happen as a consequence of an air operation there and in other areas of that region. 
It would bring about greater instability, in my judgment, in Bosnia, that sort of insurrection. It could bring it about in Macedonia. It could feed into the instability here. Montenegro is an integral part of Serbia. There is a good deal of competition between the head of state and government in Montenegro and Milosevic in Serbia. And that situation would be exacerbated. 
You must always remember, if airstrikes go against the Serbs, Greece historically has had long relationships with Serbia, as has Russia. Russia now has a very important part of the military that is stationed in Bosnia. What are the consequences that will flow with those two nations if we strike against Serbia? 
So I basically conclude my remarks by saying that I think that any operation will have to explain why it is the judgment of those preparing this operation that the ground element is not necessary before this Senator is going to sign off and lend his support. 
In my judgment, it is an essential part of any operation to prevent what I predict would be a greater increase of tragedies there. Nevertheless, with the absence of the Serbian Army and the police, other fighting would quickly fall behind. 
Furthermore, if you are to help these quarter of a million refugees, you have to bring in food, medicine, supplies and shelter. How could these be brought in if there is a virtual civil war going on? Therefore, without a stabilizing force, you are not going to be able to get the NGO support and such other support that is essential to be brought to bear in that region in the coming weeks, as weather closes in on these hopeless, hapless people who are now confined in the hills. 
Furthermore, if you start bombing in this region, that will create another group of refugees who will begin to flee from the sites that either have been bombed or sites that are likely to be bombed if the first raid or the second raid doesn't succeed. So the quarter million down here will grow in number by many more refugees in this situation. Then they will start, in my judgment, flowing across the borders. 
I do not believe to the extent this plan has been discussed in the open--largely by the press--that this is a workable operation. At this time I could not lend my support, although I support a plan that would bring about the cessation of this tragic killing that is going on in Kosovo. The likely and precipitous undermining of what progress we have made in Bosnia and the fact that NATO would be viewed as not fulfilling its mission under the leadership of the United States are the reasons compelling us to look at this operation. 
If we are going to do it, let's make certain we do it properly to achieve the goals of humanitarian relief and the lessening of the killings. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished colleague and friend. I wish to commend the leadership of Senator Lott and yourself, Senator Helms, Senator Thurmond, Senator Domenici, Senator McCain, and many of us who have quietly begun to try to look at this situation, to give constructive advice to Senator Lott and yourself. I think that, hopefully, that message will get to the administration. 
At the moment, I am expressing my own view. I am not satisfied with what I have seen in the open about this plan. I think it has to incorporate pieces which will bring about a stabilization of the potential conflict that could take place in the aftermath of an airstrike. 
The Senator rightly points out we had the Joint Chiefs before the Armed Services Committee the other day seeking additional funds for critical needs in our forces, and we have now expended by our Nation up to $9 billion in Bosnia--much of that coming out of the military budget. It is unprogrammed, unbudgeted. We are taking funds out of R&D, operation and maintenance accounts. That has a direct adverse effect on the readiness and the lifestyle of our men and women in the Armed Forces. 
We will take steps to correct that, but I think the Senator is absolutely right. I thank the Senator and the distinguished majority leader for the work they have done.

Mr. WARNER. I thank my colleague for bringing that up. I participated, of course, in those briefings. 
I am not here to advocate the U.S. ground forces in Kosovo. It seems to me if there is an air operation that the United States--because of its particular type of aircraft and munitions--would have to take a lead in that and then the role of the stabilization force should fall to other allies, in my judgment. I think you can't have one without the other. 
I thank my colleague.

 Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I would like to give notice to Members and staff of the Senate that the Committee on Rules and Administration has approved amendments to four Committee regulations, as noted below. 
A. Committee Regulations Governing Franked Mail were amended by adding the following: 
In section 8 (c), add the phrase `in excess of 500 notices per town meeting' after the phrase `Town meeting notices', so that it reads `Town meeting notices in excess of 500 notices per town meeting may not be sent fewer than 60 days immediately before the date of any primary or general election (whether regular, special, or runoff) for any Federal, State, or local office in which a Member of the Senate is a candidate for election, unless the candidacy of the Senator in such election is uncontested. 
EXPLANATION: The statutory prohibition on mass mailing (2 USC 3210) prohibits mailings in excess of 500 and completely exempts town meeting notices from this restriction. However, Committee regulations prohibited the use of town meeting notices during the 60 day period before a primary or general election regardless of the number of such notices that might be sent. This created the anomaly that a member may send less than 500 letters which include notice of a town meeting but may not send a simple, and less costly, town meeting notice. This amendment will permit town meeting notices less than 500 in number during the 60 day moratorium period. 
A copy of the Committee Regulations Governing Franked Mail, as amended, is at attachment A.

While I will not take a position one way or another on the issue, I would be remiss, and all others would be remiss, if we did not recollect last year how Senator Dorgan stood the floor on behalf of his constituents and others with regard to the devastating floods, and when he spoke just now about his support about other areas of the country, and I think in the depths of his heart about those harrowing experiences in which he so ably represented the citizens of his State.

Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, again, I worked very closely with Chairman Thurmond throughout the conference, and I can reply to my colleague's question. I would be pleased to explain the impact of this provision. 
The intent of the proposed compromise is to keep the Department of Energy tritium program moving forward. The proposed conference agreement would require the Secretary of Energy to select his preferred tritium technology not later than December of this year, consistent with the requirements of the National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 1998. Although the Secretary would be prohibited from spending any money in fiscal year 1999 to implement the selected technology, he would not be prohibited from completing research, development, demonstration, or design activities, and, indeed, we strongly encourage him to do so. 
I would like to call on the Senator from New Hampshire, Strategic Forces Subcommittee chairman Bob Smith, for a few comments on this.

<TEXT>
Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the committee has a long history of keeping the Department of Energy focused on restoring tritium production to meet defense needs. 
Unfortunately, we found that the Department of Energy had not requested adequate budget authority nor developed sufficient plans to effectively implement a tritium production source decision, which the Secretary is required to make in December of 1998. The conference report requires the Secretary of Energy to submit with the President's fiscal year 2000 budget request a comprehensive plan on how he would implement his preferred technology. The plan would include a proposed implementation schedule, annual funding requirements for the life of the project, any legislation needed to implement the technology selected, and an assessment of the viability of purchasing tritium, if necessary for national security purposes, on an interim basis. 
By requiring the plan to be submitted with the President's budget, Congress can act if we find the selected technology cannot reliably meet defense requirements, the implementation schedule is too lax, or funding is inadequate.

Mr. WARNER. I say to my colleague, in brief, the answer is yes. Consistent with the committee's previous actions, we would address any schedule our funding shortfalls identified in the Secretary's plan and budget request. We fully expect that Secretary Richardson will submit the required plan on time and that the plan will include a credible budget request for this important program.

Mr. WARNER. In response, Mr. President, the Department is not restricted by this legislation from requesting permission to reprogram funds to implement its December 1998 tritium production decision. We expect the Secretary to take all actions necessary to restore a permanent and reliable tritium production source in time to meet established DOD requirements, and that includes reprogramming funds if necessary. 
The comprehensive tritium implementation plan required by this bill requires the Secretary to submit a life-cycle plan to fully fund and implement whichever technology is selected. We intend to review that plan very closely to ensure that it can be implemented and that it will result in the delivery of tritium by the date required by the Department of Defense.

Mr. WARNER. First, I would say we should ensure that the Department of Energy's fiscal year 2000 budget request be adequate to ensure delivery of tritium on a schedule that meets the Department of Defense requirements defined in the Nuclear Weapons Stockpile Memorandum. 
Second, it is the responsibility of the Armed Services Committee, working with other committees of the Senate, to ensure that the program plan and budget laid out by the Secretary of Energy in January of 1999 are credible and will allow the Department to meet the requirements of the Department of Defense. This means, among other things, that the Department of Energy is going to have to submit more credible budget requests than it has in the past. 
Third, we are prepared to consider reprogramming requests or other actions DOE believes necessary to meet tritium production requirements on the schedule identified by DOD.

Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I would like to address the importance of bringing up the defense authorization bill. I first commend my distinguished friend, long-time friend, Senator Thurmond, and our ranking member, the Senator from Michigan, Mr. Levin, and all members of our committee, together with staff, for a very hard job throughout the year to put together the bill and now the conference report which Chairman Thurmond worked out with his counterparts on the House Armed Services Committee. 
These are very difficult times in the history of our Nation. I look back over my lifetime when in World War II and the very closing days of that war I served briefly in the U.S. Navy. There was absolute clarity in the minds of all who served in uniform, in the minds of every citizen of the United States. We knew who the enemy was, what they stood for, what their capabilities were, and there was no doubt as to what this Nation should do to bring that conflict to an end, and, indeed, it was done. 
Subsequently, in the Korean war, President Truman made a very bold and correct decision to draw the line in the face of communism. Again, it was understood, understood by all of us in uniform. I happened to have served a second tour in the Marines in that conflict. All of us understood that as well as the people back home. Through his courage, he did draw that line against communism. 
In subsequent conflicts, indeed in Vietnam, there was a measure of clarity. I wish to stress, that clarity does not exist today. Today, the problems confronting the security of this Nation, as well as that of our allies and friends, lack clarity. It is very difficult, in many instances, to determine who is the enemy, what are their capabilities, and, most important, Mr. President, what are their intentions to inflict harm on this great Nation or the nations of our allies or, indeed, the free peoples of the world. 
That is why yesterday we had a historic meeting of the Armed Services Committee. Before that committee appeared the chiefs of the several services, the Army, the Navy, the Air Force, and the Marine Corps, together with General Shelton, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs. It was a very important meeting. 
Reports today in the press describe, and, indeed, we had strong differences of views, but the issues are so serious, they merited nothing less than strong expressions of opinion by Members of the Senate, and, indeed, the members of the Joint Chiefs, I think in a very steadfast and credible manner, stated what their positions are today and for the future. There is no doubt in my mind that those fine individuals, all of whom I know very well, have foremost in their hearts the interests of this Nation and the people, the men and women who proudly wear the uniform of this country and the thousands of civilians who dedicate their careers to work in the Department of Defense or other agencies directly related to our national security. 
Yesterday was a landmark hearing. We, as a matter of practice, in the Armed Services Committee, whenever these men--hopefully someday women--come before that committee seeking confirmation of the U.S. Senate to become a chief of staff, it is a long tradition of our committee that we obtain from them their commitment, at any time the committee so desires, to have them present to testify and to give their personal opinions regarding the state of the Armed Forces of the United States and the need for the President and for the future. 
They did that yesterday in a very forthright and courageous manner. They had consulted with the President, they had consulted with the Secretary of Defense, and they came before the Senate Armed Services Committee and laid down with specificity the respective needs of their departments. Those needs, in my judgment, should be addressed as quickly as possible by the Senate, then by the Congress, and those dollar needs authorized and appropriated so that we can restore the full confidence of those who proudly wear the uniform today in their ability to endure the hardships and the risks associated with military service and to having nothing less than the best equipment to carry out their respective missions proudly as soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines. 
I commend the chiefs for their testimony yesterday. I think our colleagues, in the course of the hearing, elicited, by way of questions and other colloquy, important facts which make an irrefutable case to bring before this body in the very near future requests for immediate funding to take care of certain needs and then, in the next fiscal year, considerable sums of money, Mr. President, for each of the military departments and, hopefully, lay down the foundation for the outyear budgets to be increased in amounts comparable to those in the year 2000 budget so that, once again, America can avoid, in the words of the respective members of the chiefs, a hollow military force. 
I remember so well that period when General Shy Meyer, then Chief of Staff of the U.S. Army, used the phrase `a hollow army.' It resonated not only in the Department of Defense and in the Halls of the Congress and not only in the United States, it resonated all over the world, that America, the superpower--at that time there was a second superpower, the Soviet Union--but the superpower acknowledges that its army was hollow, that they lacked the quality and the quantity of personnel, 
that they lacked the equipment to defend the security interests of this country and to associate with our allies wherever it might be in the world in the cause of freedom. 
It was a real bugle call. And this Nation responded, largely through the leadership of President Reagan, to build back America's military strength. Well, we did not reach, in the judgment of the Chiefs--and I concur in that judgment--we did not reach that bottom that would in any way reflect back on the hollow Army of the early 1970s, fortunately, because the Chiefs have come to the Congress and stated their case. 
Now I am absolutely confident--and indeed I hope for the participation of the President and the Secretary of Defense--that the Congress will begin to do the necessary authorizations and the appropriations to pull, in the very words of the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, that aircraft which is nosed over in the dive, pull it out and to bring it back up to that level of readiness, that level of quality of life that the men and women of the Armed Forces deserve--that level of a military that will leave in the minds of Americans and people all over this world no doubt that the United States has behind it, the military power to support its foreign policy and to preserve the cause of freedom here at home and wherever we are challenged throughout the world. 
I thank the Chair. 
I yield the floor.

 Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the U.S. Navy for their initial efforts in search and recovery operations in the wake of the SwissAir Flight 111 tragedy. 
At the request of the Canadian government, the U.S. Navy sent the Hampton Roads-based Rescue and Salvage Ship USS GRAPPLE and members of Mobile Diving and Salvage Unit Two to assist our friends and neighbors in this operation. The ship, commanded by Lieutenant Commander David E. Davis, has a lifting capability of 300 tons and employs the latest high technology sonar and diving equipment. This enables her to conduct diving operations up to 190 feet beneath the ocean's surface. 
Specifically, I'd like to commend the men and women who are carrying out this important mission. These sailors are highly-trained professionals who have experience in handling challenging and dangerous diving operations. Some of the team members worked with the TWA Flight 800 recovery and can draw upon those experiences. Although the circumstances that sent GRAPPLE and our sailors to Nova Scotia are tragic and unusual, the teamwork of our Navy and that of Canada has been fostered for many years. This allows us to work together effectively in such times of crisis. It is our hope that the efforts of GRAPPLE and Mobile Diving and Salvage Unit Two will help provide comfort and closure to those people who lost loved ones in this accident. 
Mr. President, please join me in recognizing the significant contribution of America's high-tech Navy and brave sailors.

Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I join with my distinguished colleague, Senator Robb, in expressing to both managers our appreciation. It is clear that we are about to adopt a bill which will have measurable impact, in terms of the environment, on the immediate region--Maryland, Virginia, and the District of Columbia. I am about to make a correction in an amendment which will provide, I think, adequate monitoring of that impact on the environment. 
I started on the question of these airports--I can't remember, it is so many years ago now. Now that Senator Robb has joined me in the Senate, he, too, has worked very hard on the airports. I was on the airport commission when we transferred them from Federal ownership to the current legal concept with MWAA. As a matter of fact, I think my colleague was Governor; isn't that correct? 
</TEXT>

<DOCNO>105-warner-va-2-19980924</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, that is correct. I actually wrote the legislation that was eventually adopted. But so much for history. 
The residents of this community have to endure the hardships as occasioned by this growing airport. But in the course of my analysis here, in the past year, of this question, I talked at great length with the technical people. The margin, the incremental margin that could increase both in noise pollution and safety--we should include safety in this, and certainly in my conversations no alarm bells were sounded. I hope the NEPA report eventually verifies that finding. 
I also would like--having a few moments here with the distinguished managers of this bill, would like to talk a moment about the MWAA board. I know the Committee on Commerce has had the hearing on them. They are yet to go on the Executive Calendar. This is something I have been following very closely. I do not wish to say more about it, but I just look my constituents straight in the eye and say, `Trust the old senior Senator that somehow this thing is going to be resolved.' I have known Mr. McCain a quarter of a century as a colleague. Trust me, this will be resolved. 
I would like to place in the Record the importance of allowing last year's money, and such moneys that flow from this piece of legislation--exactly what those projects are. I enumerated them in the course of the hearings on the MWAA appointees, but I think it is important to put them in the Record. Foremost among them is, hopefully, the elimination of those vehicles that go out between the terminals at Dulles--how many of our colleagues have come up to me on the floor: `John, the time has come; we have outlived those'?--and other very important modifications, modernization for both of these airports, for which I and others have fought hard in these years. 
At Reagan National Airport and Washington Dulles International Airport several major projects are virtually on hold as a result of inaction by the Senate on the confirmation of Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority board members:

Mr. WARNER. I am pleased to offer this amendment for myself and Senators Sarbanes, Mikulski and Robb. 
The purpose of this amendment is in the event the conference report adopts part or all of the provisions of this bill which would increase the number of slots--that is in this legislation that we are now considering--the Secretary of Transportation is given authority to grant additional slots and additional flights beyond the 1,250-mile perimeter of the Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport. These provisions will permit 24 additional flights daily at Reagan National Airport. 
I have worked with the managers of the bill for some time. I have expressed my grave concern about the perimeter rule and the associated potential, and probably likely degradation of environmental consequences from these flights. 
So, to the extent our bill as passed through the Senate, which still remains to be seen but I presume it will--will contain this provision, then of course, in the conference I cannot predict what will come out of conference. But in that event, then I think we better put a little insurance policy in here as regards the environmental concerns. That is the purpose of this amendment. These additional flights are permitted without any evaluation of the potential impact on noise level, safe operations of the airport, or other environmental impacts. 
The amendment I offer today, together with my distinguished colleagues from Virginia and Maryland, requires the Secretary of Transportation to conduct an environmental assessment of the potential impacts of these additional flights on noise levels, safety and the environment prior to the Secretary granting any exemptions. 
That is a very important provision. The environmental assessment process, as defined under the National Environmental Policy Act, ensures that the Secretary will fully review possible impacts of these additional flights. Also, this process provides the opportunity for the public to fully participate--I underline that, the public gets a voice--in making known their views on the potential impacts of these additional flights. 
I believe this amendment is critical to ensuring that the Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport continues to be a safe and efficient airport for the traveling public, the area residents, and, indeed, the many thousands of employees who work at this airport, together with the aircrews who operate these aircraft. 
Having worked the better part of the day on this amendment with the managers, it is my understanding at this time the managers indicate they will accept this amendment without the necessity of a rollcall vote.

Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, terrorism, both domestic and international, will regrettably, continue to be a threat to United States citizens and, indeed, to humanity into the millennium. It is the weapon of choice for those nations, entities, and individuals bent on pursuing myriad aims through the cowardly, cold-blooded sacrifice of innocents. 
In his remarks to the opening session of the United Nations General Assembly yesterday, President Clinton focused on the reality of terrorism in the world community. `This is a threat,' he said, `to all humankind.' At the end of this statement, I include excerpts of the President's speech. 
Terrorism is one of the principal threats to global economic and political stability and will continue to be for the foreseeable future. As such, U.S. foreign and economic policies designed to foster peace and prosperity through stability will be weakened. 
U.S. policies, citizens and interests continue to be prime targets for international terrorism. The April 1998 Department of State report, `Patterns of Global Terrorism,' noted that approximately 33% of all terrorist incidents worldwide were committed against U.S. citizens or property. These attacks were by and large perpetrated outside of the continental United States. 
The Congress will soon be considering appropriations to increase the physical security to United States missions abroad. Of the 260 diplomatic posts overseas, only 40 are determined to be safe against terrorist attack. 
While it is clear that the safety and stability of the world community continue to be threatened, terrorist activity and the perpetrators of that activity require leaders to reexamine our understanding of terrorism and develop policy to continue to combat the threat. 
The motivation to commit acts of terrorism are no longer viewed as those with simply political ends. No longer are these senseless acts of death and destruction purely the domain of those with a political agenda. Increasingly, terrorists are motivated by religious goals, by the pursuit of financial profit, by long-standing racial, ethnic or tribal divisions and animosities, or by a mix of all of the above. 
The age of information technology and proliferation of weapons of mass destruction threaten to increase the potential arsenal for terror. In testimony before the Armed Services Committee, witnesses have explained, as you can well imagine, the possible devastation which could be inflicted through skilled use of modern technologies. What have been violent attacks with rudimentary car bombs, may very well soon be attacks of apocalyptic proportions. 
A few days ago, Representative Frank Wolf, an outstanding Member of the House from just across the Potomac and able member of the Commonwealth's delegation, presented to me this legislation to address the challenges of the terrorism threat. His bill has been accepted by the House of Representatives and will be a conference item by the Appropriations Committee. I present this legislation to my colleagues in the Senate for consideration and deliberation. 
The legislation assembles 15 distinguished experts in the field of terrorism, including three Congressmen and three Senators. Their goal will be to review and assess United States policies on terrorism, from basic understanding to appropriate response, and recommend changes as warranted. This initiative is not intended as an attack on existing policy, but a means to enhance our understanding of one of the principal threats to stability in the millennium and focus every available resource to eliminate the threat. 
I urge my colleagues to review this important legislation.

 Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, on Sunday, September 20, I joined Members of the Virginia Congressional delegation--Senator Robb, Congressman Bliley, Congressman Scott, and Virginia's Lieutenant Governor Hager, and many other Virginians at `Virginia Day' at the Washington National Cathedral. I was privileged, together with Senator Robb, to read the scripture lessons. 
My family and I have had a long association with this great Cathedral which stands on the highest promontory in the Nation's Capital and serves as living symbol of religious freedom the world over. Over 70 years ago, I was baptized, later confirmed, and then served on the governing chapter of the Cathedral. My uncle, the Reverend Charles T. Warner started his career in the ministry here with Bishop Freeman and then worked with the Cathedral in his capacity as Rector of nearby St. Alban's Parish for 40 years.

 Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, today I introduce the Lorton Technical Corrections Act of 1998, along with my colleague Senator Robb. 
As you know, I along with my colleague Congressman Tom Davis and the rest of the delegation from the Commonwealth of Virginia succeeded in 1997, in passing the National Capital Revitalization and Self-Government Improvement Act to close the Lorton Complex in its entirety, and relocate prisoners to other facilities outside of northern Virginia. 
Under this act, transfer of the Lorton facility would go to the control of the U.S. Department of the Interior after 2001. Since that time, however, discussions with both the affected communities and the Department of Interior have concluded that this is not the best option for ultimate disposal of this property, and that the General Services Administration would be a better agency to assume title to the property for ultimate disposal. 
Fairfax County would then be able to submit a reuse plan to the General Services Administration delineating preferred permissible or required uses of the land. It should also be noted that the Department of Interior will still have the authority to use a portion of this property for land exchange, to expand the properties of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service properties, as originally envisioned. 
I look forward to working with my colleagues to resolve this most important issue.

Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I would like to report on a recent trip which I made in my role as a senior member of the Senate Armed Services Committee to a very troubled region of the world. During this trip, I took quick but informative visits through Bosnia, Belgrade, Yugoslavia, Macedonia, Kosovo, and NATO South Headquarters, in Naples. 
To make this trip possible, I asked for and received the full support of the Department of State and NATO. I particularly wish to express my appreciation to Admiral Lopes, Ambassador Miles, posted to Belgrade, and Ambassador Hill, posted to Macedonia. 
In my view there are parallels and distinctions between the situation in Bosnia and the situation in Kosovo. Kosovo is an integral part of a sovereign nation--Yugoslavia. It is a civil war between the ethnic function of Albanians and Serbs. 
The parallels are to be found in the tragic tactics of this war. While both factions are open for condemnation for human rights violations, the preponderance of evidence weighs against the Serb forces--regular army and `so-called' police. Clearly, President Milosevic must be held accountable for the continuing destruction of dwellings, the farm land, and most of all, the continuing cruel repression against innocent people driven from their homes and land by the combined Serb forces. 
Currently, there are estimates in the hundreds of thousands of refugees fleeing--many to the hills and forests near their villages. In a short time, with the coming of winter, the weather will compound their misery and sufferings. 
Diplomatic efforts by U.S. and other nations have made a credible, good faith effort to reach some measure of resolution. As I departed Kosovo on Monday, August 31, the very able Ambassadors Miles and Hill assured me they were continuing to press for some solution so that the U.S. and other nations and `NGO's' can put in place programs and logistic plans to bring relief to victims of both ethnic factions. 
In my view, the short time between now and winter, will not permit a solution that will embrace a form of limited government acceptable to Belgrade. That must come in time, but for the present, we must get a framework solution for the refugee relief program. 
I commend the efforts of Assistant Secretary of State Julia Taft, who, during her visit just days ago, sounded a fervent appeal. I attach a copy of her analysis. 
I also visited some of the towns ravaged by the war and continuing to be ravaged by the roaming Serb forces. This must be stopped. Today I learned that Senator Dole, who, like me is greatly concerned for the need to stop this conflict, is going to visit on his own initiative, Kosovo and the region. I briefed him on my trip and recommended he work with the consortium of nations, including the U.S., Canada, Russia and E.U. nations known as `KDOM'. 
I have great praise for the U.S. personnel of KDOM who provided me with a trip through some of the war torn regions. I place in this record a briefing given me by KDOM, together with their credible petition for more assistance--logistic--from the Departments of State and Defense. I personally will endorse their needs. 
While in NATO South Heights, I received a briefing on options involving military forces--U.S. and other nations. This weekend I will receive further briefings. 
I close by urging all Senators to devote time to the growing problems in the Kosovo region. I support the doctrine--time tested--that diplomacy can be no stronger than the resolve to back it up by force if necessary. I urge all Senators to carefully stand by the complexity of the problems--many unique and different than Bosnia--with the use of force. 
Hopefully, negotiations will produce a cease-fire and force can be avoided. A problem still exists as to who are the KLA leaders, are they in some agreement among themselves, and how would they be represented at the negotiating table.

Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I am joined here by my distinguished colleague from New York. We would like to bring to the attention of the Senate certain language in the report accompanying the bill. And I refer to page 40. It is entitled `Baltic States and NATO Expansion.' 
The Committee has provided $15,300,000 in FMF grant assistance to accelerate the Baltic States integration into NATO.

Mr. WARNER. Here the language says: 
These funds [$18,300,000] are provided to enhance programs aimed at improving the military capabilities of these nations and to strengthen their interoperability and standardization with NATO. . . . 
Mr. President, Partnership for Peace, is, I presume, the primary means by which these countries could work within the NATO framework. But I must say that I regret that this language is so specific as to use the word `grant assistance to accelerate the Baltic States integration into NATO.' 
The Senate considered NATO expansion very thoroughly earlier this year, at which time I, together with my distinguished colleague from New York, expressed our strongest reservations, particularly as it related to a timetable of any nature, for further admission of nations into NATO. 
This does not spell out a timetable, but it certainly gives them, in this language, together with the funds, a recognition which in my judgment is inappropriate, certainly at this time when the situation in Russia is so tenuous, as explained in the previous debate on NATO expansion, and in the context of the Baltic States. I will leave it to my colleague further details on that. But it is the judgment of the military planners in NATO that providing NATO assistance to these countries, should it be necessary, could well involve the use of nuclear weapons. I say that because inclusion of these nations in NATO at some future date is a matter that will have to be considered with great care and thoroughness by all NATO nations. 
I just think at this time to incorporate the language in an act of the Congress of the United States, presumably to be signed by the President, would send an improper signal into the community of nations who are desiring to join NATO at some future date. 
So I basically stated my views on it. I yield the floor, Mr. President.  
Mr. MOYNIHAN addressed the Chair.

Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, first, for the information of all Senators and others who are following the status of the conference between the Senate and the House on the annual authorization bill for the Department of Defense, the negotiations between the Senate and the House reached the final stage--and, indeed, concluded for all practical purposes--last night. 
We had several meetings throughout the day, under the supervision of our able chairman, Mr. Thurmond, with Mr. Spence and Mr. Skelton from the House, and Senator Levin and myself. 
I wish to report that at the day's end we were far enough along in reaching a final conference agreement that a set of sheets--the traditional conference sheets--were signed by all 10 Republicans on the committee. I have to await any statement by Senator Levin with respect to participation by the Democrats. But I anticipate on behalf of Senator Thurmond that Senator Thurmond will soon send to the House a final conference proposal, as modified by such agreements as we were able to reach in the course of our negotiations yesterday. If the House is able to agree to that proposal, we have essentially concluded the conference. With 10 signatures on the conference sheets, we have enough Senate conferees in support of the conference agreement for the Committee to file a conference report.

Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I have had the opportunity to work with the current Ambassador to the United Nations, Bill Richardson, on a number of occasions. I have met with him briefly twice this week. I find him to be a very impressive man. 
I, first, wish to commend him for his work at the United Nations, and particularly that chapter of his work which occurred during the course of the crisis in the gulf with Saddam Hussein in the early part of this year. I accompanied the Secretary of Defense on his trip to the gulf region and to Russia and to meet with his counterpart in Germany, and throughout that process then-Ambassador Richardson played a key role. 
I know for a fact Ambassador Richardson had a very significant participation, together with the President and the Secretaries of State and Defense, in negotiating with other nations to avoid the need for the use of force and to bring about a conclusion, while not entirely satisfactory to this Senator and to others, nevertheless, it was the best that could be achieved at that time. It was an extraordinary role that he played. 
I also observed, as did others, his tireless efforts throughout the world in fulfilling his responsibilities as Ambassador to the United Nations, and, indeed, he put a particular emphasis on Africa, where assistance is very gravely needed at this time. 
I think he comes eminently qualified to the position of Secretary of Energy. The Armed Services Committee, of which I am privileged to be a member, has oversight of approximately two-thirds of the budget of the Department. The key elements of that budget relate to stewardship of our nuclear weapons stockpile. We currently do no underground nuclear testing, and, therefore, there is a very significant challenge placed on the Secretary of Energy to make certain that the nuclear stockpile is maintained in a state of readiness to ensure its safety and reliability. The nuclear stockpile is an essential part of our arsenal of deterrence, and the certification of the stockpile's safety and reliability is a responsibility under the Secretary. 
That, together with the need to do cleanup at numerous Department of Energy weapons sites, places a great challenge on the Secretary. In my judgment, I believe unequivocally he has the ability to meet these challenges, and I join others in the Senate in supporting his nomination. 
Again, the term Secretary of Energy is aptly named for Bill Richardson because, as I think my good friend and colleague from New Mexico would say, he is a man of unlimited energy and is, indeed, the right man for that job. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, as Chairman of the Committee on Rules and Administration, which has jurisdiction over the Federal Election Commission, I seek recognition to join with my colleague, Senator Ford, our distinguished Ranking Member, to acknowledge the dedicated service of two public servants who will be leaving the Commission upon confirmation of their replacements. 
These two individuals, Joan D. Aikens and John Warren McGarry, have served as Commissioners of the Federal Election Commission for a total of 43 years. Senator Ford and I believe that their departure from the agency, after such distinguished service, should not go unnoticed. I have come to know and respect Commissioner Aikens and Commissioner McGarry first as a member of the Committee and now in my capacity as Chairman, and I can honestly report that these two individuals have served this agency, and their country, well. 
Commissioner Aikens is a native of Delaware County, Pennsylvania. She was appointed to her first term by President Ford and has served 23 years at the Commission. Mrs. Aikens is an ardent believer in the First Amendment and its importance in interpreting federal election law. Her qualities of fairness and impartiality will be missed by her colleagues in the election law community. 
Commissioner McGarry is a native of Massachusetts. He was appointed to this first term by President Carter. During his 20-year tenure at the FEC, he worked tirelessly for full public disclosure and uniform enforcement of campaign finance laws. Mr. McGarry believes that agency deliberations and decisions should take into consideration not only fundamental First Amendment interests, but also the government's interests in ensuring elections free from real or apparent corruption. 
Mr. President, I salute Commissioners Aikens and McGarry for their service to our nation and wish them the best of luck as they begin a new chapter in their lives.

 Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to recognize and congratulate a devoted and energetic physician for his tireless service to his patients, students, and fellow radiologists. On September 12, 1998, the American College of Radiology (ACR) will bestow the 1998 Gold Medal to Karl K. Wallace Jr., MD at their annual meeting in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The prestigious Gold Medal is ACR's highest award, and will honor this distinguished doctor as a national leader as well as a dedicated servant for Radiology. 
K.K., as he is known to those in medicine and Radiology, was a long time community hospital clinician at the Virginia Beach General Hospital. After 28 years as the director of the Virginia Beach General Hospital Department of Radiology, Dr. Wallace made an unusual career move. He undertook a `second career' as a professor at the University of Virginia Health Sciences Center, where he is currently co-director of thoraco-abdominal imaging and the medical director of chest diagnosis. 
Dr. Wallace's active commitment to medicine has been characteristic ever since his career began. Two years after starting his practice, he became an officer in the Virginia Beach Medical Society. One year later he was elected to the House of Delegates of the Medical Society of Virginia where he was speaker from 1977 to 1980. His history of service to the American College of Radiology goes back to 1967 where he was elected secretary/treasurer of the Virginia Chapter. Six years later, he served as its president and held a number of key leadership positions for the following 14 years, including speaker of the council and chairman of the Board of Chancellors. 
During those 14 years, Dr. Wallace continued to lead Radiology in its efforts to work on national health policy such as physician payment reform and the Mammography Quality Standards Act. He worked with members of the U.S. Senate to develop reasonable approaches to legislation in our rapidly changing health care system. He provided honest, fair and meaningful input efforts. I know all of my colleagues join me in congratulating my fellow Virginian, Dr. Wallace, on being chosen as a recipient of the Gold Medal.

 Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Lieutenant Colonel Kevin `Spanky' Kirsch, United States Air Force, on the occasion of his retirement after over twenty years of exemplary service to our nation. Colonel Kirsch's strong commitment to excellence will leave a lasting impact on the vitality of our nation's military procurement and information technology capabilities. His expertise in these areas will be sorely missed by his colleagues both in the Pentagon and on Capitol Hill. 
Before embarking on his Air Force career, Colonel Kirsch worked as an estimator/engineer for Penfield Electric Co. in upstate New York, where he designed and built electrical and mechanical systems for commercial construction. In 1978, Colonel Kirsch received his commission through the Officer Training School at Lackland AFB in San Antonio, TX. Eagerly traveling to Williams AFB in Arizona for flight training, Colonel Kirsch earned his pilot wings after successful training in T-37 and T-38 aircraft. 
In 1980, Colonel Kirsch was assigned to Carswell AFB, in Fort Worth, TX, as a co-pilot in the B-52D aircraft. While serving in this capacity on nuclear alert for the next five years, he earned his Masters degree, completed Squadron Officer School and Marine Corps Command and Staff School by correspondence, and earned an engineering specialty code with the Civil Engineering Squadron. 
An experienced bomber pilot serving with the 7th Bomb Wing, Colonel Kirsch, then a First Lieutenant, served as the Resource Manager for the Director of Operations--a position normally filled by an officer much more senior in rank. He was selected to the Standardization Evaluation (Stan-Eval) Division and became dual-qualified in the B-52H. Subsequently, he was selected ahead of his peers to be an aircraft commander in the B-52H. 
Colonel Kirsch was selected in 1985 as one of the top 1% of the Air Force's captains to participate in the Air Staff Training (ASTRA) program at the Pentagon. His experience during that tour, working in Air Force contracting and legislative affairs, would serve him well in later assignments. 
In 1986, Colonel Kirsch returned to flying in the FB-111 aircraft at Plattsburgh AFB, NY. He joined the 529th Bomb Squadron as an aircraft commander and was designated a flight commander shortly thereafter. He employed his computer skills to help automate the scheduling functions at the 380th Bomb Wing and was soon designated chief of bomber scheduling. 
Following his tour with the 529th, Colonel Kirsch was assigned to Strategic Air Command (SAC) Headquarters at Offutt AFB, NE. As Chief of the Advanced Weapons Concepts Branch, he served as a liaison with the Department of Energy on nuclear weapons programs and worked on development of new strategic systems--including the B-2 bomber. Colonel Kirsch was one of four officers chosen to be part of the commander-in-chief's (CINC's) staff group to facilitate the transition of SAC to Strategic Command (STRATCOM). Originally picked as a technical advisor for weapon systems, he soon became the legislative liaison for STRATCOM. In this capacity, Colonel Kirsch organized congressional delegations to visit STRATCOM, and managed CINC STRATCOM's interaction with Capitol Hill. 
In 1994, Colonel Kirsch traveled here, to Washington, to begin his final assignment on active duty. Initially serving as a military assistant to the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Legislative Affairs, Colonel Kirsch once again quickly distinguished himself and was designated the special assistant for acquisition and C3 policy. Representing the Secretary of Defense, the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Technology and the Assistant Secretary of Defense for C3I, Colonel Kirsch managed a myriad of critical initiatives including acquisition reform and information assurance. He also served as the principal architect for the organization's web page, computer network, and many of the custom applications used to automate the office's administrative functions. 
Colonel Kirsch's numerous military awards include the Defense Superior Service Medal, the Defense Meritorious Service Medal with Oak Leaf Cluster, the Air Force Meritorious Service Medal, the Air Force Commendation Medal with Oak Leaf Cluster, and the Air Force Achievement Award. 
Following his retirement, Colonel Kirsch and his wife Carol will continue to reside in Springfield, VA with their children Alicia and Benjamin. 
Mr. President, our nation, the Department of Defense, the United States Air Force, and Lieutenant Colonel Kirsch's family can truly be proud of this outstanding officer's many accomplishments. His honorable service will be genuinely missed in the Department of Defense and on Capitol Hill. I wish Lieutenant Colonel Spanky Kirsch the very best in all his future endeavors.

Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the Naval Nuclear Propulsion Program and to introduce a resolution to commemorate the 50th anniversary of this outstanding institution. 
The Naval Nuclear Propulsion Program was founded by the legendary Admiral Hyman Rickover in 1948 when he was a Captain. At that time, the technology that enabled the release of nuclear power was in its infancy--a byproduct of the atomic bomb. Captain Rickover assigned himself the task of building a nuclear submarine. Just seven years later, U.S.S. Nautilus put to sea under nuclear power. 
Admiral Rickover's legacy--the Naval Nuclear Propulsion Program--is a technical organization unequaled in accomplishment throughout the world. 
The Program is truly a gem of efficiency in government and a crown jewel in our Nation's security. The program fulfills its multifaceted responsibilities over all aspects of naval nuclear propulsion with only 750 Government personnel led by a single Director, currently Admiral Skip Bowman, USN. 
By law, the Director, Naval Nuclear Propulsion, is singularly responsible for the design, construction, operation, operator training, maintenance, refueling, and ultimate disposal of naval nuclear propulsion plants. During its 50 years of existence, the Naval Nuclear Propulsion Program has developed, built, and operated 246 nuclear reactors of more than 30 different designs. Since the Nautilus first sailed, the Navy has delivered 209 nuclear-powered warships which have safely steamed a combined total of over 113 million miles. 
The accomplishments of the Naval Nuclear Propulsion Program provide evidence that good engineering does not happen by coincidence, or by clever management technique. Good engineering is the result of thoroughly trained, dedicated people who are committed to ensuring proper attention to technical details. 
The high degree of public confidence in the Navy's nuclear-powered warships results from the Program's unparalleled operating, environmental, and safety record. This record is made possible because the Program has the requisite authority, structure, expertise, and experience necessary to focus all aspects of work on a common goal: Safe and reliable nuclear propulsion supporting military objectives. 
Mr. President, I congratulate the Naval Nuclear Propulsion Program on its 50th anniversary and on all the accomplishments it has achieved during that time. 
On a personal note, I wish to acknowledge the contributions of the Directors of the Naval Nuclear Propulsion Program past and present--Admiral Hyman G. Rickover, Admiral Kin McKee, Admiral Bruce DeMars and Admiral Skip Bowman--all of whom I am proud to have known and with whom I have worked closely over the years. 
I urge my colleagues to join me in honoring this fine organization by cosponsoring this resolution.

 Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today to set the record straight about the Patent and Trademark Office's lease procurement for a new or remodeled facility. There is a continuing misinformation campaign being waged to delay the Patent and Trademark Office's lease procurement or put it back to square one. 
Allegations are being made that, to the taxpayer's detriment, the new facility is vastly overpriced and that a new federal construction option has not been considered. 
The fact is that the procurement has been conducted by the book and has undergone several, impartial reviews, all of which conclude that the project is on the right track, competitively sound and should continue. 
Mr. President, we all know that funding is not available to support the federal construction of a new headquarters for PTO because of the limitations of the Balanced Budget Act. We also know that the new lease, authorized by the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee in Fall of 1995, will result in cost savings of $72 million over the life of the lease. That cost savings will accrue in spite of moving costs, an upgraded work environment, new furniture and other improvements designed to enable the PTO to more effectively do its job. 
The PTO is fully fee funded and does not receive any taxpayer support. All lease and moving costs will be borne by PTO's customers in the normal course of business. 
The Subcommittee on Transportation and Infrastructure intends to have a hearing on this matter in September. In the meantime, I am submitting a number of points regarding the procurement, in addition to a letter sent to me by Bruce A. Lehman, Assistant Secretary of Commerce and Commissioner of Patents and Trademarks. 
I urge you to take time to hear the real story of the PTO project. The clear facts are that failure to take action to consolidate PTO space will result in wasteful use of funds and prevents PTO from modernizing services for its customers.

Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished managers of the bill. I will speak to the amendment. I would suggest, however, as I am speaking, that the distinguished managers look at what possibly could be a rewrite of the bill; and then at such time, if you agree, we will substitute this for the one that is at the desk. 
Mr. President, I wish to just speak briefly, as chairman of the Rules Committee, on behalf of the work that our committee has been doing since I have been privileged to take over the chairmanship. 
We have been looking at, first, a program by which the security of the overall square here--we call it a square--both the building security and the outside security can be enhanced. 
There is an ongoing--almost weekly--meeting on security at some level in this system. The Rules Committee has given the clearest instructions to the Architect of the Capitol, indeed, to the chief of the police, and others, to bring to the attention of the committee, and others, any new type of equipment or concept that can help improve the security of the Nation's Capitol. That has been done, and done very, very well. 
On August 20 of last year--about a year ago--a plan was put forward entitled `United States Capitol Square Perimeter Security Plan.' A hearing was held before my committee, the Rules Committee, on September 25, and the Rules Committee accepted the plan on November 4, 1997. It was a concept to upgrade the security on the exterior of the building.

Mr. WARNER. From that report: 
Seven to 10 million tourists visit the Capitol complex annually. In 1997, the Capitol hosted more than 2,000 American and foreign dignitaries, and was the site for nearly 300 scheduled demonstrations. In addition to lawmakers and their staff, a sizable number of journalists, lobbyists, and service personnel also work within the Capitol complex. 
The challenge of achieving a secure environment for the Capitol complex, while still maintaining an atmosphere of openness, has become increasingly difficult in this century. Both the potential threats to the Capitol and the number of people using the area every day have grown dramatically. Incidents such as the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center and the 1995 bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal building in Oklahoma City, as well as international confrontations like Desert Storm in 1991, have prompted increases in the level of security afforded the Capitol complex. 
This report talks about the legislative proposals. I refer to one of the last paragraphs.

Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, on Friday, two veteran Capitol Police Officers were killed in the line of duty during a tragic attack in the United States Capitol. Their sacrifice in performance of duty will forever be remembered in the halls of the United States Congress. 
Tomorrow in the Rotunda of the Capitol, we will memorialize the bravery and sacrifice of these two officers--the first Capitol Police Officers to be killed in the line of duty. 
Officer `J.J.' Chestnut was 58 and the father of five children. He was a grandfather and a 20-year veteran of the United States Air Force with service in Vietnam. Officer Chestnut was a member of the Capitol Police Force for 18 years. 
Special Agent John Gibson was 42 and the father of three children. He was an 18-year veteran of the Capitol Police Force who served as a Special Agent assigned to House Majority Whip, Tom DeLay for the last three years. 
To the families of these men, we extend our deep and heartfelt sympathy during this very difficult time. The Capitol Hill community has lost two respected and brave defenders of democracy. 
To the fellow officers of these fallen heroes, you have our unqualified support as daily you carry your duties to protect the halls of freedom. Your dedication and service to the Nation is deeply appreciated. 
Indeed, all Americans are indebted to Officer Chestnut and Special Agent Gibson for their devotion to duty and their sacrifice in the defense of freedom. 
Mr. President, as chairman of the Rules Committee, I also had the opportunity over the weekend to maintain close contact with those here under the direction of our distinguished majority leader and minority leader, notably the Sergeant at Arms and the chief of police. I wish to commend them in the manner in which they very quickly took charge of this tragic situation and, once again, reopened the people's house--that is what this magnificent structure is--so that the people from the United States, people from all over the world, can continue to come and share the magnificence of this edifice. 
A great debt of gratitude is owed, of course, especially to these two officers and to their families. As I look into their eyes of the men and women who guard the Capitol, each day, I silently express my gratitude, for we couldn't have 32,000 visitors as we did the day before and probably in the day to come, who could walk through these magnificent halls with a sense of safety and confidence--we couldn't have that without the dedicated service of our Capitol Police. Nor could the business of the Congress itself take place without their taking a risk every minute of the day and night that this edifice is open for the people's business. 
I also thank the medical department. They responded and were on the scene within less than 2 minutes. I went down to personally express my appreciation and their reply to me was, we are there, we did our duty like everyone else, and we are delighted to be a part of this team that functions to make this magnificent organization and this building serve the people of this country and, indeed, stands as a symbol to the whole free world. 
I thank the Chair and I thank my distinguished colleague.

 Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise to recognize the dedication, public service, and patriotism of Lieutenant Colonel Steven Douglas Jacques, United States Air Force, on the occasion of his retirement after over twenty years' of faithful service to our nation. Colonel Jacques' strong commitment to excellence will leave a lasting impact on the vitality of our nation's Space and Intelligence capabilities, commanding the admiration and respect of his military and civilian colleagues. 
The son of a retired Air Force Senior Master Sergeant, Steve received his commission through the Air Force Reserve Officer Training Corps program while attending Texas Tech. He was first assigned at the Space and Missiles Systems Organization (SAMSO), Los Angeles AFS, CA in 1977, where he served as financial manager for the Expendable Space Launch Vehicles Program. 
In 1981, Steve was assigned to HQ Systems Command, Andrews AFB, MD, as Budget Officer for Space Programs. In 1983, he was transferred to Headquarters, United States Air Force, Pentagon, as the Program Element Monitor for the Expendable Launch Vehicles programs. During this time, the Department reversed its policy and determined that placing sole reliance on the Space Shuttle for access to space for military satellites presented an unacceptable national security risk. Consequently, new ELV programs were created, and Steve became the Air Force's first Titan IV `PEM.' 
Following his Pentagon tour, Steve was transferred back to Los Angeles AFB in 1985, where he was assigned as Deputy Program Control Director for Expendable Launch Vehicles. Months after Steve's arrival, the tragic loss of the Space Shuttle Challenger stimulated the nation's `Space Launch Recovery,' in which the Defense Department determined its satellites would eventually be removed from the shuttle and placed back on ELVs for launch. Steve led the efforts in costing and packaging the $10 billion Space Launch Recovery, which was fully approved by the Department and the Congress. 
In 1988, Steve returned to the Pentagon, serving in the Special Programs Division of the Directorate for Space Programs, Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Acquisition. Following duty as Executive Officer to the Director of Space Programs, Steve was assigned to the Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Legislative Liaison in 1991, where he served as the Air Force's liaison officer to the Congress for all Space Programs. 
During the winter and spring of 1994, Steve attended the Defense Systems Management College at Fort Belvoir, Virginia, receiving his Level III certification in Program Management. Following school, Steve was assigned to the National Reconnaissance Office, where he first served as Director of Program Control for a classified program, and later as the SIGINT and Launch Comptroller. While serving as Comptroller, Steve played a formidable leadership role during the NRO's `forward funding' recovery. 
In 1996, Steve began his final assignment in the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Legislative Affairs, where he served as Special Assistant for Space, Intelligence, and Special Programs. In this capacity, he represented the Secretary of Defense on a myriad of important and sensitive matters with the U.S. Congress, most notably the tragic Khobar Towers bombing in Saudi Arabia, legislation forming the National Imagery and Mapping Agency, and a number of highly classified issues. 
Colonel Steve Jacques' military awards include the Defense Superior Service Medal, the Defense Meritorious Service Medal, the Air Force Meritorious Service Medal, and the Air Force Commendation Medal. 
Mr. President, our nation, the Department of Defense, the United States Air Force, and Lieutenant Colonel Steve Jacques' family--his wife Debbie and daughters Tracy and Amy--can truly be proud of this outstanding officer's many accomplishments. While his honorable service will be genuinely missed in the Department of Defense, it gives me great pleasure to recognize Lieutenant Colonel Steve Jacques before my colleagues and wish him the best in his future endeavors.

Mr. WARNER. The Senator has made frequent use of `taxpayers dollars,' but I think in a sense of fairness, and I will eventually speak in greater detail, primarily the funding for this important function is entirely derived from the fees paid by the users of the services. It is not involved, these egregious sums of taxpayer dollars. I thought the Senator might want to comment on that, because I certainly will bring that out.

Mr. WARNER. I say to my distinguished friend, when we go to the Department of Transportation to consult and get their advice on an issue, issues which are very much foremost in my distinguished colleague's mind now on aviation, we don't pay any fees. When we go to the Department of Defense or the Department of Justice to work with other Government agencies and Departments, fees are not paid. This thing was devised by Congress, this institution, to operate on a rotating basis of fees paid, which fees are passed on down the line to the consumers. I just wanted to bring that out. 
Last, you mentioned the IPO. They just sent in a letter today endorsing it. I know the Senator is trying as hard as he can to list as many persons with an objection, but at the appropriate time I will put this letter in the Record. In the meantime, I will get a copy for the Senator. I thank the Chair and thank the Senator.

I worked until late last night with Senators Brownback and Inhofe to devise an amendment to which I have now added my name. And I send this amendment to the desk just for the purpose of filing it. And the managers have indicated--both the majority and minority--that it will be eventually accepted as part of the managers' package.

Mr. WARNER. But this amendment achieves many of the goals recited by Senator McCain, to crunch this down to a realistic purchase of equipment and not have the items which clearly were excessive in cost, as recited by our distinguished colleague from Arizona. 
I credit the distinguished Senator from Arizona. He is a constant watchdog on these various issues. And I responded to one of his points here. This is not taxpayers' dollars. Secondly, the reason we are pursuing this type of an arrangement is simply because there are insufficient taxpayers' dollars in the Treasury for the Government to build the building. And therefore, we have to work on this building lease type of financing to lower the burden of cost, indeed, to the taxpayers for the construction of a building which is absolutely essential. 
This vital function of Government, patent and trademark, is now being performed by very loyal, highly skilled Government workers. And they are disbursed in a number of buildings--a number of buildings. And anyone who understands the simple basis of management and trying to do a job knows that if you have your employees, first, in 16 different buildings--I want to repeat that; 16 different buildings--this concept is to bring it into a central concept financed under a lease arrangement, not by taxpayers' dollars, but by the payment of fees. 
So I say to my colleagues, this is a matter which both sides of the aisle have addressed in terms of cost containment. Both sides of the aisle have addressed in terms of its need and the propriety of a process that started in 1995 in the Senate Environment Committee which has overall oversight of this type of work. 
I have today a letter addressed to me from the General Services Administration which, once again, reiterates in absolute clarity the fact that they have reviewed this process, they have reviewed the proposals, and it is their conclusion that it is in the public interest. 
This is the Government agency in which we have reposed the trust and the confidence to make the vast number of technical decisions which are required for a very expensive contract, or in this instance a lease arrangement build.

Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, to reiterate, I rise today in opposition to the McCain amendment which seeks to delay the procurement of space for the U.S. Patent & Trademark Office pending an evaluation by the U.S. General Services Administration (GSA). It should be noted that I have agreed to accept an amendment offered by my colleagues Senator Brownback and Senator Inhofe regarding cost containment measures for the PTO consolidation in the Commerce-State-Justice appropriations bill. 
The Government's prospectus process provided thorough answers to all questions raised by the McCain amendment. Through the prospectus process, authorized by the Public Buildings Act, as amended, the Government submitted to the Congress detailed justification for procuring a new consolidated space for PTO. 
The Senate Environment and Public Works Committee Subcommittee on Transportation and Infrastructure, which I chair, in addition to the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee held extensive hearings on this prospectus and approved the prospectus in the Fall of 1995. Both committees concurred that in light of the limited funds available for capital investment, an operating lease for the PTO is in the best interest of the PTO fee paying customers. 
Mr. President, during these hearings, the government testified and the House and Senate committees of jurisdiction agreed, that procuring consolidated space for the PTO would achieve greater efficiency as well as cost-savings to the taxpayer while providing a more effective work environment for the PTO to perform its mission. 
Pursuant to the language in the supplemental appropriations bill, the Department of Commerce performed a review of these same issues and found conclusively that the PTO consolidation is in the best interest of the United States and the procurement should proceed. 
This project has been studied and studied and studied. These studies include: the Department of Commerce's Inspector General; an independent consultant to the Secretary of Commerce (Jefferson Solutions; headed by the ex Directors of OMB's Office of Procurement Policy in the Reagan & Carter administrations), both of which agree that the competitive lease procurement should proceed, so that the PTO can obtain the benefits of competition. 
Mr. President, it should further be noted that GSA, the Department of Commerce and OMB thoroughly evaluated the benefits of leasing versus purchase, Federal construction and other housing alternatives, such as lease purchase, before submitting the lease prospectus for congressional approval in the first place. 
The PTO procurement does not involve expenditure of taxpayer money. PTO and all its operations and procurement are supported entirely by fees paid by its customers. The PTO does not, and will not, receive any taxpayer money. 
In a colloquy between myself and the distinguished floor manager of this bill, Senator Gregg during the Senate debate on the supplemental appropriations bill H.R. 3579, P.L. 105-174, Senator Gregg agreed that no funds will be available in the foreseeable future to purchase or construct a facility to house the PTO. 
P.L. 105-174 already required the Secretary of Commerce to review the project and submit a report to Congress by March 1998. That report, conducted by Jefferson Solutions, and the cost benefit analysis report, referred to as the DEVA Report that accompanied it, show that the PTO will save $72 million over the 20-year life of the lease by consolidating. 
Mr. President, this $72 million is a conservative estimate of the savings that will be achieved. For example, if the PTO were to purchase less expensive furnishings than are reflected in the DEVA Report, the cost savings would be greater. 
While Senator McCain and others may charge that the furniture estimate used in the DEVA Report is high, I would indicate that the DEVA Report shows the `worst case' costs. These costs are used to calculate the potential savings of consolidation, and are certainly not the actual costs that the PTO will spend on furniture. 
The actual furniture costs will be lower, because they will include economies that will be achieved through competition, mass purchase and standardization. Therefore, the savings from consolidation will likely be higher than $72 million. 
The PTO intends to conduct a furniture inventory and will use existing furniture where practicable. 
In conclusion Mr. President, PTO is not contracting for a new $1.3 billion building. It is contracting for a new competitive 20-year lease. It would cost at least $1.3 billion for the PTO to remain where it is for the same 20-year period. The offerors in the prospectus have the option of building, renovating or consolidating to meet the PTO's space needs. 
The Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works carefully considered the need for the facility, various alternatives, and the costs of each approach before authorizing the lease procurement to be conducted by the GSA for the PTO. 
PTO will only move if it is economic and efficient to do so under the current competition. It is not a foregone conclusion that PTO will relocate. Crystal City, the current site of the PTO, is one of the three sites competing in the procurement. 
Taxpayer protections include the following: 
The rental rate ceiling of $28.50 per square foot contained in the approval resolutions are at or below the rates that PTO is currently paying, and current market rates in Northern Virginia; the build out allowances for the interior space are fixed in the procurement documents at less than $45.00 per square foot; an amount that is comparable to most government facilities; PTO currently leases 1.9 million rentable square feet of office space in 16 separate buildings in Arlington, Virginia. The prospectus calls for 2.17 million to 2.39 million square feet of space, which is between 15% to 25% more than currently exists, due to a projected increase in PTO's work from the now 5,200 employees to 7,100 employees by 2002. This is overall a 37% increase in the work force of PTO, which accounts for the increase in space needed to house this growing agency. 
PTO will only move if it is economic and efficient to do so under the current competition in which the incumbent lessor is one of the four finalists. 
I have seen the PTO study that compares costs of consolidation to remaining in existing buildings. Even with all these costs, the bottom line is that the PTO will save $72 million over the life of the new lease. 
Senator McCain said he would yield back his time. So I say to the distinguished manager, the time allocated for debate on this side, indeed, with my fellow colleague from Virginia has been completed. And Mr. McCain asked me to inform you he would yield back his time.

Mr. WARNER. Recognizing the distinguished Senator from Alaska wants to be brief, I will simply say this is a very important recommendation that the Senator from Arizona has made. It has been carefully studied by the Rules Committee. I, as chairman; Mr. Ford, as ranking member, we have taken a position in opposition--not to the ultimate goals sought by the distinguished Senator from Arizona, but to the time with which such a goal could likely be achieved. Second, we are still studying the issue and we are concerned that this proposal would take the Member out of the sequence of making this information available to the public. As I read the McCain request, it would mandate that the CRS and its Director would send a great deal of material---reports and issue briefs--right into the Internet system. No Member would be interposed between the recipients of that information and the Director of CRS. 
That concerns this Senator a great deal, because if I am out there and come up on the system and access some of this information, it reads that the Director of the CRS put it out. Who is he? Of course, we all know that the CRS is a part of the Library of Congress. It was created for the purpose of accommodating the important needs of Members of Congress, committees, and their respective staffs. Suddenly, this information takes on the imprimatur that the Director takes this position on an issue, as opposed to a Member sending it out and the recipient contacting the Member. 
So we, the Rules Committee, felt we should take a first step and therefore, on June 10, we sent to all Members of the Senate a Dear Colleague letter stating that we had now set up a system electronically whereby the CRS could, at the Member's request, transfer certain CRS products to a Member's web site.

Mr. WARNER. This helps Members, then, to better understand the inner workings of the Rules Committee, what we have done for Members, and what Senator McCain is endeavoring to do. It lays out my concerns that it is important that we run this initial test, whereby Members of the U.S. Senate can now put this material out or the committees of the Senate can put this material out. Let's make some assessment over the next few months of what it costs, what staff are involved, and to the extent there is an interest out there in the public for this very voluminous amount of information that is created by CRS. It may well be in the due course of time we will take a further step towards the goals Mr. McCain has in his amendment. 
So for the time being we oppose the amendment and ask Senators to entrust to the Committee on Rules and Administration the proper analysis of the objective by Senator McCain, as well as the costs associated with it and the desirability, in the public domain, for the dissemination of this information. 
That concludes the remarks of the Senator from Virginia.

In recent weeks, we have heard over and over again here on the Senate floor, on the weekend talk shows and in the editorial pages of numerous newspapers how unilateral sanctions on the export of agricultural commodities, medicine and medical equipment primarily hurts American producers of those producers. 
Also, in most cases, the prohibition or restriction on the sales of food, medicine and medical equipment in order to punish a foreign government harms the general population in the targeted country rather than that country's leadership. 
Gary Hufbauer--a renowned expert on the issue of sanctions--made that very point in his recent article in the Washington Post. He stated: 
. . . economic sanctions can inflict pain on innocent people while at the same time increasing the grip of the leaders we despise. When sanctions are applied broadside--as against Haiti, Cuba and Iraq--the hardest hit are the most vulnerable: the poor, the very young, the very old and the sick. Left unharmed, and often strengthened, are the real targets: the political military and economic elites. 
Finally, unilateral sanctions on food and medicine rarely achieve the goal of having the targeted nation alter its actions or policies. In light of that, I believe it is time to stop using food and medicine as a foreign policy weapon. 
As a member of the recently established Sanctions Task Force, I look forward to working with my colleagues on the broader issue of reviewing on the broader issue of reviewing the overall U.S. sanctions policy. 
However, I believe that is appropriate at this time to proceed with this amendment to exempt food and medicine--what I consider humanitarian products--from unilateral U.S. economic sanctions. 
Mr. President, Senator Dodd and I have been working towards this goal for a considerable time. Our former colleague, Senator Wallop of Wyoming, has been a valued resource for facts which compel this action. Likewise, a number of Cuban Americans have urged this goal. The time is now.

 Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the retirement of Roland W. Culpepper, Jr., an extraordinary individual who has rendered thirty-three years of civil service not only to the Commonwealth of Virginia, but also to the nation. 
Mr. Culpepper, who resides in Chesapeake, Virginia, with his wife, Shirley, will soon enter into retirement after a lifetime of service in the Norfolk District of the United States Army Corps of Engineers. 
During his time in the Norfolk District, Mr. Culpepper's expertise and professionalism facilitated his ascendance to the Chief of Programs and Project Management. His responsibilities included full delegated authority for the Norfolk District's Civil Works, Military, Environmental and Support for Others programs and projects. Preceding his duties as the Chief of Programs and Project Management, Mr. Culpepper spent a full twelve years as Chief, Plan Formulation Branch where he was responsible for the management of several large comprehensive water resources studies which led to Congressional-authorized projects. Afterwards, Mr. Culpepper moved to the administrative level within the Norfolk District as the Deputy Chief of the Planning and subsequently, served as Chief, Planning Division in 1986. 
Throughout his thirty-three year career as a professional engineer, Mr. Culpepper has received numerous awards and distinctions in recognition of his exceptional career. Among them, Mr. Culpepper has received the Meritorious Civilian Service Award, the Commander's Award for Civilian Service, and the Engineer of the Year Award. Further distinguishing his performance is Mr. Culpepper's graduation from the Executive Development Program for the Engineers and Scientists Career Program in 1993. 
Mr. President, Mr. Culpepper's thirty-three years of exceptional service, his numerous awards, and his distinguished education serve as testament of his dedication to the environmental improvement of the Commonwealth of Virginia and our country. I urge my colleagues to stand and join me in paying tribute to Roland W. Culpepper, Jr., and in wishing him happiness and contentment in his well-deserved retirement.

Mr. WARNER. Now, Mr. President, it is my distinct pleasure and honor, together with the distinguished ranking member of the Rules Committee, which I am privileged to chair, to submit legislation to the Senate. In my capacity as chairman of the committee, I have taken it upon myself, after consultation with colleagues on the committee, to name this bill in honor of our distinguished ranking member, Senator Wendell Ford of Kentucky, who will be retiring from a very distinguished Senate career at the conclusion of this Congress. 
The bill is entitled the `Wendell H. Ford Government Publications Reform Act of 1998.' 
If I just might hold this bill up, it is quite voluminous. That size reflects the tireless effort of my distinguished colleague from Kentucky and many others--over a period in excess of a decade--including Senator Stevens, the distinguished chairman of the Appropriations Committee, who have worked on this concept. I sort of picked it up and continued to work with Senator Ford in the course of my privileged service as chairman. 
Senator Ford has served four terms in the U.S. Senate. During that time he has dedicated himself to many causes, but this has been one very dear to his heart. I think it is a magnificent way of paying a respectful tribute to this Senator. 
We want to ensure that our Government produces its publications in the most cost-effective manner possible and that to the best of its ability the Government makes these publications accessible to the American public. They pay for them. But over the course of a number of years, like so many institutions' procedures and practices, it has gotten sort of tangled up. This prodigious document, hopefully, will be accepted by the Senate and accepted by the House and will go a long way to put this system back on track. 
Over the past decade there has been a steady and precipitous migration of printing, publication service procurement, and publication dissemination away from the Government Printing Office, which was established for the very purpose of making these documents available. 
In part, this migration occurred because of evolutions in technology. In part, this migration occurred because of the identified weakness and constant inability of the Joint Committee on Printing to enforce the work of the agencies and the departments of the executive branch in telling them to procure and disseminate their publications through the GPO. In part, this migration occurred because of the open encouragement by the current administration--through decisions and through the National Performance Review known as the NPR--for agencies to use printing and dissemination facilities other than the Government Printing Office. And in part, this migration occurred because the GPO has been slow to change and be more responsive to the ever-changing agency and Congressional needs, demands, and expectations. 
When I make reference to agencies and departments of the Government, I am talking about all three branches of the Government. We are not singling out any one as being less participatory of the desired result in publication and cost effectiveness. We are all in it together. This straightens it out. 
Despite the best efforts of Senator Ford and a long line of other Senators, successive administrations just have not been able to grapple and change the process and these problems are with us today. 
When I became chairman of the Senate Committee on Rules and Administration, Senator Ford urged that together we continue the work that he and others had started. Indeed, Senator Ford and I became partners in resolving these issues. We directed our staffs to work together, to analyze the problems and identify the key solutions to bringing successful reform to the Government's printing, publishing, and dissemination services. 
Senator Ford and I held a series of hearings during which we built a record to support the very bill that we introduce today. This bill primarily has four goals. 
First, it resolves the conflicts between the branches of Federal Government--executive, legislative, and judicial--and brings about cost savings in printing and production. It seems to me it eliminates the problems with public access. It is in here in great detail. 
Secondly, it guarantees the right of the public to access publications paid for by the taxpayers. We have to stress, they paid for this, so why shouldn't they have it? It requires that the Superintendent of Government Publications Access Programs--what a title; I will repeat that--the Superintendent of Government Publications Access Programs be notified when an agency creates a new publication whether on paper or electronically. That major advancement of dissemination in electronics has not been an easy one to deal with in this bill. 
Third, it promotes public availability of Government information in the electronic age through a Federal publications access program requiring no-fee availability, regardless of format, by requiring agencies to provide the same notification to the Superintendent for electronic publications that they are required to provide for printed publications, and by requiring the Superintendent to head a study which will recommend to Congress additional legislation which may be needed to further safeguard the public's access rights. 
Finally, the fourth goal is to facilitate the production and public access to Government publications by promoting the efficient and economic production of publications in an effective and equitable system of dissemination. 
It was James Madison who established as an essential element of America's democracy the principle of an informed citizenry. According to scholars, Madison's vision for the success of this Nation rested on the ability of an informed citizenry to participate in the democratic process and to hold Government accountable for its actions. Democracy requires the free flow of information. Access to the Government's publications is fundamental to our free society. 
Senator Ford and I and other members of the Committee on Rules and Administration, together with our staff, worked diligently and in a most nonpartisan manner to craft this legislation. The legislation is a culmination of nearly 18 months of discussion and negotiation. We consulted with the private sector, the printing industry, the information industry, representatives of the administration, the judicial branch, various legislative branch organizations, GPO, and, most importantly, the unions who really safeguard the future of employees throughout the printing system and other systems involved in this. My understanding is, and I think Senator Ford will have similar comments, that they recognize the need for change and have been a very constructive and helpful working partner in achieving this result. This bill, we feel, reflects a consensus among these interests and is to my mind one of the best examples of bipartisan cooperation in good public policy. 
At this time, of course, both Senator Ford and I want to recognize the invaluable services of Eric Peterson, staff director of the Joint Committee on Printing, Kennie Gill of Senator Ford's staff, Grayson Winterling and Ed Edens of my staff, and the many others who have worked on this during the past 18 months. We look forward to receiving the support of our colleagues in passing and enacting this important reform legislation in the concluding days of this Congress. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, those of us who are privileged to hear the remarks of our distinguished colleague from Kentucky might well clearly tell in the tenor of his voice and the forcefulness of his remarks the sincerity with which he believes in this very important goal. 
It is my fervent hope that the Senate will act quickly on this measure. 
He closed with the comment with regard to unions, which have a very important role in the past, today, and, indeed, in the future in the publication of our documents. It is the credibility which Mr. Ford brings to this institution that enables us to cross that last bridge and gain their support. 
The bottom line is that the men and women who work in this system, union members and all, want to have a more cost-effective, a more productive system, one that is compatible with the rapid movement of technology all across our land. 
Mr. President, I thank my colleague. I hope that the Senate will turn to this legislation at the earliest possible opportunity. The Committee on Rules and Administration will have a hearing and will promptly issue a report. At that point, it is my expectation that the distinguished majority leader, in consultation with the Democratic leader, will make the appropriate decisions at the time. 
I yield the floor.

I would like to state my case so that Senators can fully understand the purpose of this amendment. There is an ever-increasing problem, regrettably, throughout America at our colleges and universities, and that is binge drinking. But first I would like to congratulate the chairman of the committee, Senator Jeffords, for all his hard work in crafting an excellent Higher Education Reauthorization bill. I am privileged to serve on the committee with the distinguished Chairman.

Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I join with my distinguished colleague from Maryland, Mr. Sarbanes, and all Senators last night for the unanimous-consent passage of an important piece of legislation authorizing the placement of a Martin Luther King, Jr., Memorial in area I of the capital of the greatest country in the world, right here in Washington, DC. 
Mr. President, I rise to applaud the passage of this important legislation authorizing the placement of a Martin Luther King, Jr., Memorial in Area I of the Capital. 
I would like to take this opportunity to recognize Senator Sarbanes and Congresswoman Morella for the leadership they have both shown over the years we have worked together on legislation authorizing the establishment of a Martin Luther King, Jr., Memorial. 
In 1996, Congress passed and the President signed legislation, also sponsored by Senator Sarbanes and myself, authorizing the Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity, the oldest predominately African-American fraternity in the United States, to establish without cost to the Federal Government a memorial to Martin Luther King, Jr., in the District of Columbia. 
Mr. Chairman, the Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity wishes to honor Dr. King with a memorial in the Nation's Capital as tangible recognition of his remarkable role in the history of our nation. Dr. King's message of nonviolence and freedom for all should be passed from generation to generation. A memorial in his name will be effective in helping us reach this important goal. 
The legislation establishes the memorial in Area I, which consists of the Mall and environs. As you know, the Department of Interior, after consult with the National Capital Memorial Commission, transmitted its formal recommendation that the memorial be located in Area I in a letter to the President of the Senate dated January 29, 1998. 
Requirements contained in the Commemorative Works Act stipulate that the Department of Interior's recommendation regarding location of a memorial in Area I shall be disapproved if not enacted into law within 150 days of its transmittal to Congress. Therefore it was critical that the Senate consider and pass this legislation prior to that deadline. 
I would like to add two personal reminiscences that I have about Dr. King. By coincidence largely, I was within the vicinity of the Lincoln Memorial when he delivered his historic address. I do recall vividly the long line of marchers coming to and from that historic event. 
Somewhat later in life, I was privileged to serve on the governing board of the Washington Cathedral. The subject came up as to whether or not he would be invited to preach in the Washington Cathedral. And I remember very well the board meeting. I was present and with others cast my vote such that he could come to that magnificent edifice which is on the highest promontory of the Nation's Capital to deliver his last and most historic sermon. 
So I am deeply moved. But I have played a modest role in seeing that another very fitting memorial be dedicated to that American of extraordinary accomplishment. 
I yield the floor.

 Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the vision, professional dedication, and public service of Mr. Mack R. Farr who will retire in July after thirty-one years of civilian service in the Department of Defense. During that time, Mr. Farr has become one of the preeminent leaders in the development and procurement of night vision devices for the U.S. Armed Forces. 
Mr. Farr has been instrumental in the development of night vision devices at all levels--from technician at the Army's Night Vision Laboratory to Technical Director for the Army's Project Manager for Night Vision/Reconnaissance, Surveillance, and Target Acquisition. The extent of his participation spans the development of two generations of image intensifiers, laser aiming lights, laser range finders, and laser countermeasures systems, as well as the recent development and production of second-generation thermal systems. These systems enable our troops to fight in the dark and represent one of the most profound improvements in military capability. 
Our ability to `own the night' was critical to the success demonstrated during Operations Desert Storm in Kuwait and Just Cause in Panama. Under Mr. Farr's technical direction, the U.S. military has procured $3.3 billion worth of night vision equipment, substantially improving the lethality and survivability of our Armed Forces. 
Mr. Farr began his career with the government as a technician for the Army's Night Vision Laboratory in January 1967, working to improve the operating life of image intensifier tubes. He then focused on miniaturizing this technology so that it could be utilized by the individual soldier. The products which evolved from this effort are now widely used by both ground soldiers and aviators alike, and have formed the foundation for such grand concepts as the Land Warrior program. The best compliment paid to Mr. Farr came from one of his colleagues who stated, `Mr. Farr brought night vision to the individual soldier.' 
During his career, Mr. Farr was the chief architect of omnibus style procurements for night vision devices. Omnibus procurements are designed to solicit multiple night vision systems which use common manufacturing processes and combine them into one significant multi-year contract. In addition, these procurements were one of the Army's first `best value' contracting efforts. Both concepts have become so successful that best value source selections are now the desired method of procurement for the Army, and four omnibus style contracts have been awarded over a fifteen-year period for 476,861 night vision goggles, sights, and driving devices. Mr. Farr's efforts in shaping these concepts have led to the continuous improvement of night vision devices over this period. Night vision goggle unit prices have decreased by seventy percent over this time frame, while the performance of night vision goggles has significantly increased. 
Mr. Farr has also led the Army's Project Manager, Night Vision/Reconnaissance, Surveillance, and Target Acquisition office in continued acquisition reform. His efforts in Image Intensification have resulted in a consolidated program which today is known as horizontal Technology Integration and Single Process Initiatives. Mr. Farr has worked with industry to develop innovative concepts such as establishment of the first swap out program which allows Army units to trade-in old image intensification systems for credit toward purchase of the latest high performance devices. Industry then recycles components from the old image intensifier systems for use in their commercial products. This process keeps industry prices low and Army capability high, at a reduced cost to the Government. 
Mr. Farr has also been instrumental in developing export policy for night vision devices. He has worked closely with the Army Materiel Command, Defense Technology Surveillance Agency, and Defense Intelligence Agency to develop a policy which is both fair to U.S. night vision manufacturers and protective of U.S. interests in this technology. Under this policy, U.S. manufacturers have become the desired suppliers of night vision equipment on the international market. 
Mr. Farr has received numerous awards during the span of his government career, however his preeminence in the electro-optics field is best demonstrated by his selection into the Association of Night Vision Manufacturers Image Intensification Hall of Fame for his long service and remarkable contributions to this technology. 
I know that Mr. Farr's wife, Nancy, his children, Shelly, Mark, and Robert, and the Department of Defense are proud of his accomplishments and contributions. Our Nation and our Armed Forces are indebted to him for his many years of public service. I wish him well in his future endeavors.

Mr. WARNER. I want to identify myself with the statements of my distinguished friends and colleagues from Arizona, Oklahoma, and New Hampshire on this matter. I have been privileged to have a long association with the Navy, an association that continues to this day in my capacity as Chairman of the Armed Services Committee's Seapower Subcommittee. 
Over many years, I have watched the AEGIS system develop and mature as a formidable fleet air defense capability. I am persuaded that even greater returns can be realized from the wise investment our Nation has made in this system by adapting it not only to provide defenses against relatively short-range ballistic missiles but against the long-range ones that threaten our own people, as well. 
I believe we need to receive the contents of the requested study of the AEGIS Option forthwith. I will be happy to work with the Chairman of the Committee, with the Chairmen of our Strategic Subcommittee and our Readiness Subcommittee and with others like the Senator from Arizona to ensure that we find out at once where this document is and, to the maximum extent possible, that we share its conclusions with the American people.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Subcommittee on Forests and Public Land Management of the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources be granted permission to meet during the session of the Senate on Thursday, June 25, for purposes of conducting a subcommittee hearing which is scheduled to begin at 2:00 p.m. The purpose of this hearing is to receive testimony on S. 2146, a bill to provide for the exchange of certain lands within the State of Utah.

Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise to applaud the passage of this important legislation authorizing the placement of a Martin Luther King, Jr. Memorial in Area I of the Capital. 
I would like to take this opportunity to recognize Senator Sarbanes and Congresswoman Morella for the leadership they have both shown over the years we have worked together on legislation authorizing the establishment of a Martin Luther King, Jr. Memorial. 
In 1996, Congress passed and the President signed legislation, also sponsored by Senator Sarbanes and myself, authorizing the Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity, the oldest predominantly African-American fraternity in the United States, to establish without cost to the federal government a memorial to Martin Luther King, Jr., in the District of Columbia. 
The Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity wishes to honor Dr. King with a memorial in the nation's Capital as tangible recognition of his remarkable role in the history of our nation. Dr. King's message of nonviolence and freedom for all should be passed from generation to generation. A memorial in his name will be effective in helping us reach this important goal. 
This legislation establishes the memorial in Area I, which consists of the Mall and environs. As you know, the Department of Interior, after consulting with the National Capital Memorial Commission, transmitted its formal recommendation that the memorial be located in Area I in a letter to the President of the Senate dated January 29, 1998. 
Requirements contained in the Commemorative Works Act stipulate that the Department of Interior's recommendation regarding location of a memorial in Area I shall be disapproved if not enacted into law within 150 days of its transmittal to Congress. Therefore it was critical that the Senate consider and pass this legislation prior to that deadline.

Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, in the course of the history of the Senate, there comes a moment whereby we recognize the extraordinary contributions of one of our Members. Tonight I rise on behalf of myself and others to recognize the services of the distinguished chairman of the Armed Services Committee, Strom Thurmond. I am pleased to introduce this amendment which would name the Department of Defense authorization bill presently under consideration after our chairman, Strom Thurmond of South Carolina. 
Very few, if any, persons in American history have made the contributions, in length and quality, to the national defense that Senator Thurmond has made. First commissioned a Reserve officer in 1924, he volunteered for active duty in 1941. He went into Normandy on D-Day, June 6, 1944, in a glider with the 82d Airborne Division, and fought throughout the campaigns in northern Europe. Transferred then as a volunteer to go to the Pacific theater following the surrender of Germany, he served then in the Philippines when Japan surrendered. 
Promoted to brigadier general in the Army Reserve in 1954 and to major general in 1959, Senator Thurmond remained on active status until 1965. He served as national president of the Reserve Officers Association, 1954 to 1955. 
Senator Thurmond first became a member of the Committee on Armed Services in January of 1959. He served as the committee's ranking minority member from 1993 to 1995 and as chairman from 1995 to the present. He has announced that he will step down as chairman during the course of the next Congress--or the completion of this Congress--and he will, of course, remain then the ranking member of our committee. 
Senator Thurmond's nearly 40 years of service on the Committee on Armed Services covers 75 percent of the time of the existence of that committee, which was formed by the merger of the old Committees on Military Affairs and Naval Affairs in 1947. Perhaps more remarkably, he covers over 20 percent of the time since the original committees were set up, since 1816. 
In view of his matchless contributions to the national defense, both on the battlefield and in the Senate Chamber, it is altogether appropriate that tonight the present bill, the last he will manage as chairman of the Committee on Armed Services, be named in his honor.

Mr. WARNER. Mr. President. I would like to comment upon Senator Mikulski's amendment to establish a Navy pilot program for ship scrapping practices. While I support Senator Mikulski's amendment, I would like to clarify some of the issues and concerns regarding this amendment. 
Worker safety and environmental issues related to the scrapping of the U.S.S. Coral Sea were raised. I would like to note that the contractor that conducted the scrapping work on behalf of the Navy received criminal sanctions for environmental violations. In turn, the Navy has worked very diligently to resolve and eliminate future contractor problems in this area by adjusting its contractor selection method to ensure that the contractor has the requisite technical, financial, environmental, and worker safety qualifications. Specifically, the Navy has replaced the lowest bidder methodology with the requirement that a determination of best value be made in contract selection. 
Finally, there has been reference to the overseas scrapping of Navy ships, as follows: `In India, 35,000 men scrapped . . . ships with little or more than their bare hands. They worked under wretched conditions. This is an international disgrace.' I have been informed that the Navy has not contracted to scrap ships overseas. I have been apprised of one incident in which the Navy transferred the title of one Navy ship, the USS Bennington, to a contractor that misrepresented its intentions regarding the use of that ship. That contractor subsequently arranged for the scrapping of that ship in India. The scenario that I have described involves one ship, not many, as suggested by some. The Navy has modified its contracting procedures to avoid that type of abuse in the future. 
I firmly believe that the Navy has worked to resolve the worker safety and environmental problems associated with ship scrapping, consistent with the recommendations of the Department of Defense Interagency Review Panel on Ship Scrapping, appointed by Mr. Gansler, the Under Secretary of Defense, Acquisition and Technology. It is my expectation that the Navy will continue to make progress as it continues ongoing ship scrapping operations and develops a credible pilot program that will ensure best value in the contract selection process. 
Under that pilot program, it is yet to be determined whether any particular shipyard or contractor has the requisite expertise and qualifications to conduct safe and environmentally sound ship scrapping. I have supported the current version of Senator Mikulski's amendment with the understanding that it allows the Navy the flexibility and time to conduct meaningful analysis and to develop a viable pilot program. 
I thank Senator Mikulski for her cooperation in ensuring that this amendment provides for a ship scrapping pilot program that encourages competition and discourages favorable treatment of any particular contractor or site. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. WARNER. I want to make sure. 
First, I think the thrust of the amendment is one with which I agree. I was part of the deliberations over a period of time. I certainly want to acknowledge the participation by the distinguished senior Senator from West Virginia, and the Senator from Texas, and the work they have done. 
But I want to make certain--I have read through this carefully a number of times--there is nothing in it that could be misinterpreted at this particularly sensitive point in time in the Kosovo negotiations with Ambassador Holbrooke--who is, I think, perhaps at this very moment trying to work with Milosevic--that nothing in this amendment indicates a lessened support of the United States, together with our principal allies, to try our very best to preclude a repetition in Kosovo of the tragedies that unfolded over the past years in Bosnia. It is my understanding that nothing in this amendment should be interpreted by Milosevic or anyone else that this is less than full support of the effort on behalf of the President and his designated Secretary of State and Ambassador to work on that problem.

Mr. WARNER. I thank my distinguished colleague. That was unexpected. I assure you that my very modest record of military service pales in comparison to yours, having been the only Member of the Senate to have landed on June 6, 1944, D-day. 
Moving on, this is a very important debate, if for only the reason here we have some of the most intelligent persons debating documents which read with clear English language, yet we can't seem to come to an agreement. That signifies the desperate need for clarity to our policy. That clarity has to come from the President of the United States. 
This debate was really fostered some months ago by the efforts of our distinguished colleague, the senior Senator from West Virginia, and the Senator from Texas, when they, consulting with members of the Armed Services Committee, and others, showed various proposals. Those proposals manifested, in my judgment, the unrest, certainly within the Senate and I think largely within the Congress, that we could not keep going on and going on as we have been, and that it was inflicting a very severe 
penalty upon research and development budgets, readiness budgets, procurement budgets, and that we must bring this debate to the floor of the Senate so that Senators can have expressions and perhaps pass a resolution and/or an amendment or, in whatever form, to manifest our great concern. 
I wish to compliment the Senator from West Virginia and the Senator from Texas for their efforts. The Armed Services Committee took into consideration their views. As a result, we have this amendment today by the distinguished ranking member and the Senator from Indiana, which I intend to support. 
My concern is that as I listen to this debate it is clear to this Senator that our American troops, particularly the combat troops, are simply hostage, I repeat hostage, to the uncertainty of what these goals are and what the time is within which they are achievable. As a consequence of this amendment, I am concerned that the President and others will take it into consideration and come back to the Congress with specificity and clarity. 
It will be, in my judgment, impossible for this Congress in the few weeks remaining, to make a decision on this subject. My concern is that we really not make a definitive decision other than this amendment, for the following reasons: No. 1, as the Senator from Michigan said, in the course of General Clark's appearance before the Armed Services Committee, which was a hearing dedicated to the subject of Bosnia and at which we received one of the most profound and eloquent dissertations by the Senator from West Virginia, expressing the responsibilities of the Congress of the United States as being parallel and equal in every precedent to those of the President--an excellent statement. 
But General Clark, when pressed--this Senator was particular in urging him to assess these goals, for General Clark to go back to the various individuals, government entities and the like, and to establish a timetable within which they could be achieved. Now, my understanding of his reply and my recollection was that he felt he could not provide the Congress, particularly the Senate, with that reply much before September. That was my recollection. 
Now, also in September are a very important series of elections that will take place in Bosnia. Step one is the Clark report. Step two are the elections in Bosnia. Hopefully, those elections will again point in the direction towards greater achievement of the overall Dayton accords. Then we have to recognize that this Congress ends and a new Congress will come in the January-February timeframe, and that they--possibly new Members, possibly different views--they will then have their opportunity to express their views. 
I think decisions by the Congress as to the future level of funding, which is pointed out by the Senator from Indiana, is our explicit authority here, will probably have to await until early next year. In that interim, we have called upon the President, subsequent to General Clark's announcement, to come forward no later than, I believe, December 31, of this calendar year and give us a detailed report. 
We are beginning to lay the foundation now, expressing to the President, and indeed to our allies, the unrest that exists in the Congress, which unrest is reflective of the people across the United States. And that time is running out. We have made a significant contribution in terms of our men and women of the Armed Services Committee working with our allies. We have made a very significant financial commitment of $9.5 billion. 
My concern at this particular moment is that we are walking something of a high wire, because as we are discussing, I think in a very responsible way, these issues, at the same time we have to take notice of the fact of the unrest in Kosovo. With all due respect for my colleague from Texas, I see there is a direct correlation between the actions we take in Bosnia and the possible consequences in Kosovo. I readily admit, as my colleague from Texas points out, the legalities--namely, that Kosovo is a sovereign part of the Serbian State and, as such, it is a civil war. But I say to my colleagues that if the continued criminal hardships being inflicted upon innocent people in Kosovo become portrayed in greater detail, and we experience greater and greater levels of suffering of those people, all those legalities go to the side. Once the pictures of the horror begin to emanate --and I hope they will not--in further amounts from Kosovo, everybody will recognize that there is a conflict that responsible nations of the world must participate in, in trying to bring about a cessation. 
I urge my colleague from Indiana--and I am certain my colleague from Michigan heard--I hope nothing we do here today can in any way be utilized by those forces trying to continue the criminal acts being perpetrated in Kosovo to give them any encouragement to continue those acts. What we are doing today is an important debate, but it is not to be construed in any other way but that the United States will assume its responsible role, along with our allies, in trying to stem the crisis that is developing in Kosovo. 
As we speak, the President has dispatched Mr. Holbrooke--soon, I hope, to be confirmed as our U.S. Representative to the United Nations--a man who had a great deal to do with reaching the accords in Dayton and who has had extensive experience in this area. It is our hope that he can bring about a strong message that will eventually bring stability in the Kosovo region. What we do today will have consequences, and it is walking the high wire that nothing be interpreted as lessening our intent to stop the killing, the rape, and so on taking place in Kosovo. 
I will return to the debate. It is clear that these Dayton accords, as pointed out by the Senator from West Virginia, the Senator from Texas, and others, are holding hostage the need for troops. I agree with the Senator. He said they are not achievable unless there is a military force in place, and the part that we play or do not play remains to be seen, be it combat or support in that continuing military force, because I am sure that the Dayton accords--no matter what time within which we will require their ultimate achievement--would require a security force, and that security force must perform only military missions. They cannot perform the missions to directly achieve the accords. But only by their presence and the infrastructure that they maintain in place--namely, some semblance of law and order--can we hope to achieve any of the Dayton accords. So I commend my colleagues. 
I intend to support this amendment. But I see a direct linkage between the problems in Bosnia and the developing problems in Kosovo. I hope that nothing as a consequence of this debate today will ever be construed by anyone as undermining the efforts of our Government, because I remember so well in the early debates--and this Senator was never in favor of sending in combat troops; the record is clear on that. But once that decision was made and once we have become a party and 
a partner--and I underline `partner'--with our allies and achieved the Dayton accords, then I feel we are there and we should not jeopardize the $9.5 billion and the personal sacrifices of our troops by doing something precipitous now that would undo the progress in Bosnia. 
But there is a direct correlation between Bosnia and Kosovo. We used to argue that we have to contain Bosnia so it doesn't spill over into Kosovo. The opposite could happen now. The problems in Kosovo could spill over into Bosnia and begin to undermine the progress we made in Dayton. We have to proceed with great caution.

Mr. WARNER. My question would be, we have our differences on the legal--clearly, the Senator is correct about Kosovo--independent and the like. But it just has been my experience that once the television pictures and stories come back across the ocean as to the horror and pillage, and so forth, that could take place in greater porportion than now, then this whole thing blends together, and I do see a direct linkage between the turmoil in one geographic area and turmoil in another just a bare few miles away. 
But my concern, and it goes to both my distinguished colleagues from West Virginia and Texas; I have followed and respect greatly their efforts here, but we are about to get a 
report from General Clark which will throw, I think, some very clear light on this otherwise unclear situation as the time within which the goals for Dayton can be achieved. We are about to experience the results of elections in Bosnia which we all hope, again, will move towards a more rapid resolution of the remaining problems in Bosnia. 
The distinguished Senator from Arizona--and I have read through his amendment, which I support--is going to list, I think, some very important analysis from the President, Secretaries of Defense and State, and then we have the fact that a new Congress is coming in. So my concern is what can we hope to achieve now were we to move along the lines of the amendment which I have seen from the distinguished Senator from West Virginia and the Senator from Texas, given that so much remains to be done, and those actions--the Clark report, the elections, the fact that we are going to have a new Congress--in my judgment, all have a direct bearing on what we can achieve by way of reductions in the specific numbers of troops over this period. So I thank the Senator. If the Senator cares to reply, I would appreciate it.

Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator, and I certainly associate myself with her concerns as to the overall posture of our own Armed Forces, which have been degraded, and I so stated in my opening comments, by the heavy expenditures associated with Bosnia. And you are quite correct; the India-Pakistan series of regrettable events has, I think, spurred other nations to look more and more to biological and chemical missilery and other weapons in the area of mass destruction and, indeed, we are all, I think, deeply concerned when we read the reports that, indeed, Iraq was preparing its weaponry to incorporate the biological material in its missile heads, and all the more reason to proceed with this missile defense program which for years the Senator from Texas, myself and others have been urging be adopted. 
I yield floor.

Mr. WARNER. For those who may be following this debate outside of the Senate, so to speak, basic training is just 9 weeks in each of the services. So it is a relatively short period of time. It is a brief period from when they leave the home environment, school environment, and other structured environments in their communities across America to come and undertake this important first phase of their training of a military career. 
It seems to me that what the Senator is asking is just the opportunity for the different sectors to go into this very intense period where the objective is to really transform them in many ways, as the Senator pointed out. First of all, it is a patriotic duty to be a member of the team. And all of the other important goals are in the first 9 weeks. To simply, at the end of the training, give them a little respite from all of the pressures which they are being subjected, give them a chance to kick back and rest on their own, among themselves, and then as soon as reveille the following morning, beginning with the mess facility, beginning the fallout, the grinder formation, as they march off to the rifle range, they are together, and it is joint in every respect. Am I not correct?

Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a colleague who serves with me on the Senate Committee on Labor and Human Resources and on the Armed Services Committee. This morning, at the Labor Committee's mark-up of S. 2206, the Human Services Reauthorization Act of 1998, I offered an Amendment to rename the legislation after the author of the bill, Senator Dan Coats of Indiana, which the Committee approved unanimously. As you know, Senator Coats will retire at the end of this Congress after serving in the Senate since 1988. Senator Kennedy, Senator Dodd, and Senator Jeffords, Chairman of the Committee, joined me in offering the Amendment. 
Senator Jeffords renamed the legislation the `COATS' Act--the Community Opportunities, Accountability, Training, (and Education) Services Act. S. 2206 reauthorizes and makes improvements to the Head Start program, the Community Services Block Grant program, the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program, and it creates the new Assets for Independence Act. 
In the past, legislation has often been identified by `legislative shorthand'--identifying legislation by the author instead of by the title. This began in the late nineteenth century with tariff bills named after either the Chairman of the Senate Finance Committee or the Chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, or whichever body would report and pass the legislation first. One example is the 1890 McKinley Tariff legislation, named after Congressman William McKinley, then Chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee and later President of the United States. 
In the twentieth century, naming legislation after a Senator became more commonplace and lent legislative standing and prestige to both the bill and to its author. For instance, in 1935, the Wagner Labor Act was named after Senator Robert Wagner from New York. Another Labor bill in 1947, the Taft-Hartley Act, was named after Senator Robert Taft from Ohio. 
Today, however, it is not as easy or as common to have a Senator's name formally placed on a bill. Only in cases of special recognition for service, or to honor an accomplishment is this done. Throughout his Senate career, Senator Coats has been recognized and identified as a leader on issues dealing with children and families. It is an honor for me along with Senator Kennedy, Senator Jeffords, and Senator Dodd to suggest renaming S. 2206 the COATS Act, and I am pleased the Labor Committee unanimously agreed. I cannot think of a finer Senator to name this legislation after than Dan Coats of Indiana who has worked so tirelessly on these issues.

I further ask that, at 9:30 a.m. on Thursday, Senator Wellstone be recognized to offer an amendment relative to DOD schools and there be 30 minutes equally divided; following the conclusion or yielding back of time, the Senate proceed to vote on or in relation to the amendment, with no amendments in order prior to the vote. 
I further ask that, following the disposition of the Wellstone amendment, the Senate resume the Inhofe amendment for 10 minutes of closing remarks, to be equally divided, and the vote then occur on or in relation to the Inhofe amendment, with no amendments in order prior to the vote. 
I further ask that, following the vote on or in relation to the Inhofe amendment, there be 10 minutes of debate on the Harkin amendment, and the vote then occur on or in relation to the Harkin amendment, with no amendments in order prior to the vote.

Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I have a few comments. 
Ironically, I was the author of the last base closure legislation. I saw right here just a day or so ago Senator Dixon of Illinois. He was my other principal author of that resolution. 
I think it is absolutely essential that the United States reduce its infrastructure and enable the Secretary today and the Secretaries of Defense thereafter to husband those funds from the reduction as best they can and channel those needed dollars into readiness and modernization, and all types of things that have a much, much higher priority than so much of the excess that we now have in the military structure. 
The last time we considered this BRAC concept in the committee, I voted against it simply because I was so disheartened by some of the procedures with regard to certain bases in California, and then subsequent revelation of letters from an individual in the Secretary of Defense's Office which clearly indicated to me a certain bias. 
We just have to get politics out of this process someday. I am not sure when that will be. But as soon as we can come up with some system which guarantees elimination of politics, then you can count on the Senator from Virginia supporting the BRAC process going forward. In the meantime, I register my opposition against my good friend and fellow Member. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. WARNER. I realize that. I am very humble about my small contribution to national security at the tail end of World War II and in Korea. But I was privileged, like so many others, 
to serve. My contribution was modest. The military did far more good for me than I was able to do in return. Therefore, throughout my career in the Senate, I have tried to look after the men and women in the Armed Forces and, indeed, the veterans, because I find as we grow a little older, we have friends who depart on a regular basis. 
There are some 300,000 men and women who served in World War II who consistently die every month now. It is an alarming fact, considering. I would like to ask my good friend a question or two. I studied the amendment. Your first version of the amendment says: 
The Secretary of Defense shall transfer to the Department of Veterans Affairs $329 million. 
The one that is before the Senate at this time appears to have been changed: 
The Secretary of Defense is authorized to transfer to the Department of Veterans Affairs $329 million. 
I am curious as to one of the reasons the Senator changed from a clear statement that it would be shifted as a budget matter, to where it now----

It puts the Secretary in a very difficult position. This concerns me.

Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, in my 19 years, I have heard that argument of inefficiency and waste in the Department of Defense. All of us recognize that, and I am sure our Secretary, our former colleague, Bill Cohen, is doing his very best to try to bring about every kind of efficiency he can to generate funds. 
Frankly, I say to my good friend, Secretary Cohen is desperate for money. So much of the funding that we have authorized for programs in the past has been diverted to take care of the fulfillment of military commitments as directed by President Clinton. Our military today has been deployed more times throughout the world than any other President has ever deployed them beyond our shores. The Bosnia commitment alone has absorbed some $9 billion. 
I ask my friend, I listened very carefully to your statement, and I am deeply moved by it. I really think this problem should be addressed, and you are saying that we haven't even covered for the modest increase in inflation the various costs associated with the care of our veterans?

Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I intend to study further the amendment by my distinguished friend. But I certainly agree with one thing you said, and that is, the manner in which the United States treats its veterans has a direct impact on whether successive generations will offer themselves to serve proudly in the uniform of our country. I know you are absolutely right about that. There are many, many cases where it is grandfather to father, father to son or daughter, as the case may be, that induces the current generation to proudly come forth and volunteer. That has really been the success of the All Volunteer Force. 
And what you point out tonight is a very serious situation. And it impacts directly on that argument. I would have to say to my friend, being a member of the Appropriations Committee, and knowing the chairman of the committee himself is a very distinguished veteran of World War II, an air corps pilot, has my distinguished colleague brought this to his attention? In other words, within the appropriations could this sum of money be found? 
My concern is that I am entrusted, and tonight representing the distinguished chairman of the committee, to manage this bill in such a way as we do not open up the opportunity for Senators to come in and take pieces of our authorized amount by the Budget Committee to spend and put it toward other accounts, because if we begin to do that--for instance, if we would accede here tonight to your request, I could anticipate a dozen colleagues coming to the floor tomorrow with requests which they conscientiously feel just as seriously about as you do about yours; and the next thing you know, it would be one after another, to take a piece here and a piece there, and suddenly it 
would become very significant--not that this isn't a significant sum of money. 
We will have to look at this. But I would have to say that I am concerned that we could start a raid on the defense budget here tonight. But I hope that this matter can be addressed here in the Senate somewhere, be it the Appropriations Committee or the Veterans Committee. I commit to you that if you bring this up in another piece of legislation, I will conscientiously see whether or not I can support it.

So that is a fairly significant increase that this communication indicates to me and that your committee got.

Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, it has been a long day. If you will bear with us for a minute--I appreciate the Presiding Officer. It has been a very good day, and the chairman of the committee, Mr. Thurmond, and ranking member and others, should be commended. I think we have handled the key issues that will require considerable time for debate. We had extensive debate on important matters. I am optimistic that this bill can be put in a status for final passage tomorrow. We are going to work hard, I say to my good friend.

Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, as one of the comanagers of this bill, together with the distinguished chairman of the committee, Mr. Thurmond, I receive that news as very disheartening. It is imperative that the defense bill go forward. As you know, Defense Appropriations is prepared to complete their work. And if you get out of sync the authorizations/appropriations cycle, it does not work to the benefit of the overall Department. 
On this issue, there is a bipartisan feeling. I am going to move to table, against the will of a considerable number of my colleagues, and I know that there are others here who are going to join me; I don't know what in number. So it is not, I think, quite the political structure as our distinguished Democratic leader has observed. 
So, Mr. President, what I would like to do is to ask unanimous consent that I be recognized in 5 minutes for the purpose of tabling, and that 5 minutes is to accommodate the Senator from California so that she might make her remarks. 
Mr. COATS addressed the Chair.

<TEXT>
Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today to offer an amendment which is designed to help find a solution to the recurring problem of the Pentagon paying exorbitant prices for spare parts that are readily available in the commercial marketplace. 
In March, we were subjected once again to troubling press accounts of excessive prices being charged the Pentagon for spare parts--in one case the Pentagon's Inspector General found that the Pentagon was charged 280 percent more for commercially available items than in the previous few years. While it is true that such instances of overcharging are now the exception to the rule, we must do everything we can to ensure that our limited defense resources are used wisely. This is essential if we are to maintain public support for, and confidence in, our military establishment. 
I commend Senator Santorum for the package of legislative reforms he has included in the bill before the Senate. The `Defense Commercial Pricing Management Improvement Act' will go a long way toward setting the Pentagon on a path to correcting the problems identified in the recent DoD Inspector General reports concerning the Department's errors with respect to these overpricing cases. 
My amendment will build on the legislation in the bill, but will focus on the responsibility of the contractor for providing adequate cost and pricing data to the government. Under current law, in the case of sole-source contracts for commercially available items, the government contracting officer `shall require submission of data other than certified cost or pricing data to the extent necessary to determine the reasonableness of the price of the contract.' Although it was the intent of Congress that the contractor should supply such data as might be requested, that was not explicitly stated in the law and has not always been the practice. In the Sundstrand case reviewed this past February by the DoD Inspector General, the Inspector General found that `Sundstrand * * * refused to provide DLA contracting officers with `uncertified' cost or pricing data for commercial catalog items.' Unfortunately, this is not an isolated incident. 
My amendment would clarify existing law to clearly reflect the original intent of Congress by putting a positive requirement on the contractor to provide cost and pricing data if such data is requested by the government contracting officer. If--as in the Sundstrand case--the contractor refuses to provide this information to the government, the contractor would be disqualified from the contract. 
If a government contracting officer is to accurately assess the reasonableness of a contract price for a sole-source commercial item, he or she must have access to information on prices previously charged both the government and commercial sector for such item. We must not allow contractors to refuse to provide such information to the government. My amendment will close a loophole in existing law by requiring the submission of such cost and pricing data as the government contracting officer determines is necessary. 
I urge my colleagues to support the amendment.

I felt it was the proper thing to do because I attribute to this particular bill, the underlying bill, the annual Authorization Act, the highest priority. It is for the benefit of those who serve in uniform all over the world. It sends a strong message to our allies and enables this country to maintain its responsibility as the sole superpower in the world today. And that is why I am going to do everything I can, together with our distinguished chairman and others, to see that this bill does move forward. 
Now that the matter has been divided, then I think I am free to vote my conscience as it relates to such votes as may be taken hereafter regarding the amendments. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield. I think there is some discussion going on now that would enable 10 or 12 minutes on this very important amendment. I would like to take 2 minutes to join with my colleagues who are opposed to it. I would like to speak to it a little bit.

Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I likewise ask to be made a cosponsor of this amendment. I think it is a very responsible effort by our distinguished colleagues, the principal sponsors, and I think the Senate will endorse this, as it will in a voice vote momentarily. 
But I would just bring to the attention of colleagues, if we do not handle responsibly this crisis--we, the United States--together with our principal allies, it will signal to other nations that they should begin to look towards the development of weapons of mass destruction. In all likelihood, they cannot afford the expense associated with nuclear weapons, but it will propel them into further areas of chemical and biological. 
So that, to me, is the seriousness of this problem, if we do not handle it fairly, evenhandedly, and with a note of understanding. And that brings me to my question, because section (b)(3) urges other nations to impose sanctions. I just wondered, listening very carefully to the Senator from Kansas, who said he is going to travel over there to try to work out greater confidence-building measures and also to try to increase engagement, am I misreading that section as being possibly in conflict with what I hear my two distinguished colleagues as saying?

Mr. WARNER. I would certainly urge that be done because, in reality, we are not here to say who is at fault; both bear a heavy sense of culpability. Unfortunately, India initiated it. I don't know--as time goes on, perhaps there will be an answer--what recourse Pakistan had. Had not the current leadership taken that action, they might well have been either run out of office or forced out of office. So we cannot be unmindful of the political instabilities in these nations and the reality that if one did it, what recourse the other had other than to do it. 
Now, two wrongs do not make a right, but I will listen carefully, and I hope that this section does not send a signal of any rigidity as we should be pursuing greater engagement. 
I hope the international community would offer to arbitrate 
the complexity of the Kashmir problem. It has been there for a long time, and very often, an outside, unbiased, objective collection of nations could come in and render some helpful assistance to alleviate that problem, which is an absolute crisis. Talk about human rights and suffering. There is a war taking place every day--shelling, killing--and it must be brought to a stop. 
So I wish to associate myself with the remarks of my two colleagues from Kansas and California. I congratulate them. I think it is a very important measure for the Senate to adopt. But I do hope that you will, on your mission, and others will do what we can to increase engagement and provide for solutions.

 Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, in considering the nomination of Louis Caldera before the Senate Armed Services Committee to be the Secretary of the Army, I raised the issue of the Washington Aqueduct--the public water system for the Metropolitan Washington area that is owned by the Federal government and administered by the Corps of Engineers. 
As my colleagues may recall, the conditions at the Washington Aqueduct gained national attention when the Environmental Protection Agency issued a `boil-water' order in December, 1993 for the metropolitan Washington region. There was significant concern that the water supply for the nation's capital was contaminated. This incident brought to light the significant capital improvements that are needed at the facility to meet current federal drinking water standards. 
In order to address the tremendous water quality issues that are facing the District, Arlington County, and the city of Falls Church, I included in the Safe Drinking Water Act Amendments of 1996, Section 306 entitled the Washington Aqueduct. I wrote this section so that the customers of the Washington Aqueduct would have a reliable and safe source of drinkable water. The Aqueduct is in need of many capital improvements to insure that the water remains safe and drinkable. Improvements to the Aqueduct are self-financed by the users. It is estimated that significant costs remain, between $250 and $400 million. 
To allow for these crucial improvements, Section 306 directs the Army Corps of Engineers to transfer the Washington Aqueduct, with the consent of a majority of the three customers, to a non-federal, public or private entity. Since this effort would be a significant undertaking, the Safe Drinking Water Act gave the customers and the Corps three years, until August 6, 1999, to gain consensus. Congress authorized the Corps to borrow funds from the Treasury during an interim three year period to begin the necessary infrastructure improvements. This borrowing authority totaled $75 million and would be repaid by the ratepayers. 
Recently, I learned that the Corps has signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the three customers for the Corps to retain ownership of the Aqueduct. 
There are problems with the Corps remaining the owner of the Washington Aqueduct, besides that this seems inconsistent with existing law. First and foremost, the Corps does not have the means to finance the capital improvements that are needed. Once the three year borrowing expires, the Corps only has means to finance daily operations at the Corps. Given the current condition at the Aqueduct, this is hardly the way to insure that the ratepayers have drinkable water. In addition, in the event of another boil water scare, the Corps would have no means to address the immediate problem. If the Corps does not have funding to perform needed upgrades to the Aqueduct nor have the financing to address an emergency situation, it seems to me that, consistent with current law, they should not retain ownership of the Corps. 
In questioning Mr. Caldera about this situation, I have received assurances that the Army will fully implement the provisions of the Safe Drinking Water Act. This Wednesday a meeting will be held with all the relevant parties to develop a course of action on this matter. I am encouraged by Mr. Caldera's attention to this important regional issue. He has pledged to work with me to resolve this impasse so that the region can afford to proceed with the necessary modernization plan for the Aqueduct. Without proceeding with privatization or the development of a new regional entity, I remain concerned that the schedule for improvements will be delayed or that the citizens of this region will experience severe water rate hikes.

 Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today to pay special tribute to the retirement of Robert V. Ogle, an extraordinary individual who has rendered thirty-five years of federal service not only to the Commonwealth of Virginia, but also to the nation. 
Mr. Ogle, who resides in Virginia Beach, Virginia, will soon enter into retirement after a lifetime of service in the Norfolk District of the United States Army Corps of Engineers. With the exception of a year of study in Washington and six months in the Naval Air Reserve, his entire career has been spent in the Planning Division of the Norfolk District Corps of Engineers. 
During his time in the Norfolk District, Mr. Ogle's expertise and professionalism facilitated his ascendance to the Chief of the Planning Division. His responsibilities included Reconnaissance Studies, Feasibility Studies, Limited Reevaluation Reports, and General Reevaluation Reports associated with the General Investigation Program. In addition to these responsibilities, Mr. Ogle's innovation was illustrated by his incorporation and development of a Technical Review process that serves to ensure sound decision-making practices. Preceding his duties as the Chief of the Planning Division, Mr. Ogle served within the Norfolk District as the Chief of the Plan Formulation Branch, the Director of Planning, and the Chief of the Hydraulics and Hydrology branch. 
Throughout his thirty-five year career as a professional engineer, Mr. Ogle has received numerous awards and distinctions in recognition of his exceptional career. Among them, Mr. Ogle has twice received the Commander's Award for excellent work within the Norfolk District. Mr. Ogle is also a member of the Virginia Society of Professional Engineers and the American Society of Civil Engineers. In addition, he has received the Exceptional Performance Rating eight times during his career, a distinction that exemplifies his commitment and service to our nation. 
Mr. President, Mr. Ogle's thirty-five years of federal service and his exceptional performance ratings serve as a testament of his dedication to the environmental improvement of the Commonwealth of Virginia and our country. I urge my colleagues to stand and join me in paying tribute to Robert V. Ogle, and in wishing him happiness and contentment in his well-deserved retirement.

Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, we are in the process of resuming consideration of S. 2057, the National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 1999. On behalf of Chairman Thurmond and the distinguished ranking member, I urge Senators who have amendments to the bill to bring their amendments to the floor. Last Friday, Chairman Thurmond, together with the distinguished Senator from Michigan, Mr. Levin, cleared some 45 amendments to this important bill. The majority and minority staffs of the Committee on the Armed Forces will continue to work today with others and Members to get further amendments cleared. 
I remind Senators that a cloture vote on S. 2057 will occur tomorrow, at a time to be determined by the majority leader after consultation with the Democrat leader. And if cloture is imposed, all nongermane amendments which have not already been adopted will be terminated. Therefore, I urge Senators to come to the floor. The bill will be up until 3 o'clock today, according to the previous order. Hopefully, we can conclude a profitable day towards further concluding this bill which must be concluded this week. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, while the Chair is seeking to consult with the Parliamentarian, I want to say that this is an effort to keep this very important bill moving. I feel very strongly that this is a limited opportunity for the Senate to consider the annual authorization bill. The majority leader, in consultation with the Democrat leader, has decided that we have the balance of this day. We hope to have votes at 5 o'clock on Monday. I will address that later. We will have Tuesday and such part of Wednesday as the leadership will give us to complete this very important piece of legislation. 
Given this extremely narrow window of opportunity, I hope that we can proceed today to have a parliamentary situation, which is in place and which will enable the distinguished majority leader and the Democrat leader, on Monday, to address the Senate and keep this bill active. 
It is so important because I had the opportunity last night to visit with the Secretary of State, as I had earlier in the day the opportunity to have breakfast with the Secretary of Defense. 
And our country is working with our principal allies in regard to the very serious issues and fractious situations surrounding Kosovo and the need for clarification of our position as it relates to Bosnia. 
Mr. President, It is very interesting. I remember the extensive debates here on the issue of Bosnia. This Senator time and time again was opposed to sending in the ground forces. But, nevertheless, that decision was made. It was always the thought that you have to contain the Bosnia-Herzegovina geographic area to preclude a spillover into the Kosovo region, a region which I visited at one point with the distinguished former majority leader, Senator Dole. 
Mr. President, I understand that I can at this time ask for the yeas and nays on the first-degree amendment.

It is a facility that is without comparison anywhere in the world in terms of its excellence.

Mr. WARNER. In today's Washington Post, on page 23, is a brief description of the historic work that has been performed by this laboratory. 
I say with a great sense of humility I was asked to speak because of the fact that I am a graduate of a school that was conducted at this laboratory during World War II. Young men, and to my recollection, a few young women, were trained as radio/radar technicians. It was a 15-month course. Barely a third of those who started this course ever completed it because it was 6 days and 6 nights, and those were not unusual hours during wartime, and then for the period after the cessation of the war in Europe and the Pacific, the momentum kept up, but they turned out remarkably trained young people, and I was privileged to be one of them. 
I remember on the day of graduation--and these are the basic remarks that I deliver today--an admiral stood up and addressed us, and he said, `You understand how to maintain,' which means fix, `every piece of equipment in the United States Navy through which an electron flows.' 
Thousands of young persons went through that program, then reported to the fleet, whether it was a ship or submarine or an airplane, and they were immediately able to go in and examine the most complicated pieces of equipment and repair them. And that was before the black box era, where today, if there is a malfunction of a piece of electronic equipment, by and large, the technician goes in and pulls the box, takes a spare box out and pushes it right in, and the equipment starts up. 
No, in those days we had to take the time to take off the covering, go in with electronic devices to try to find the faulty vacuum tube. We did not have solid circuitry in those days to any extent. It was vacuum tubes, great big capacitors. But that was the equipment that gave the eyes and ears to the U.S. Navy, and we shared it with our allies. 
I always believed that this laboratory contributed in a very significant way to the ultimate victory of the U.S. forces, together with our allies. Radar, which was a distinct advantage that the United States and Britain had, was basically developed simultaneously in Great Britain and at this laboratory. That gave us an enormous, what we called a force multiplier, over the axis forces, because we had the eyes and ears to project out distances which are small by today's measure but in those days very significant, and to detect the presence of ships and aircraft to give the American and allied forces early warning. I don't know how many lives were saved. 
This laboratory really was the vision of Thomas Alva Edison, who we all recognize as one of the great pioneer scientists in American history. He had an active role in this institution in 1923. Then for a while he phased out, and then he came back. 
I commend the tens of thousands of people who through the 75 years of history, both civilian and uniform, Navy and Marine, and, indeed, officers and enlisted of other services who have trained there and their contribution to world freedom. 
Mr. President, I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.

Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today to offer an amendment to the Defense Authorization Bill that will begin to address concerns that I have with regard to the ability of high technology, small businesses to compete in the defense acquisition arena. This amendment, I hope, will lay the groundwork for reforming the acquisition and budgeting process so that the Department of Defense can take greater advantage of technological innovations developed by small, high-tech companies. The amendment does not change any law or policy, it simply directs the Secretary of Defense to investigate ways that the Department of Defense could improve the acquisition process so as to enable the rapid incorporation of high technology innovations into existing defense programs. 
Mr. President, small businesses generate a disproportionately large share of the technological innovations in this country. Studies have found that small businesses originate more than two times as many innovations per employee as large businesses. 
The Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program was created by the Small Business Innovation Development Act of 1982. It is intended to stimulate technological innovation by using small businesses to meet federal research and development needs. The SBIR program has proven to be a highly effective way of leveraging the creativity of small, high technology companies. A 1997 Government Accounting Office (GAO) study of the Department of Defense's SBIR program concluded that `quality projects are being funded.' 
The SBIR program provides small businesses with the opportunity to demonstrate innovative ideas that meet the specific research and development needs of the Department of Defense. Under Phases I and II of the program--the research and development phases--small businesses can develop and prove their ideas. Phase III of the SBIR program is for the acquisition and procurement of successful projects. Due to the rapid pace of technological change, the innovative products developed under the SBIR program often have direct applicability to ongoing major defense acquisition programs, where incorporation of the product could immediately result in performance improvement and/or cost reduction. The problem lies in taking a worthy high technology project--one that could provide an immediate benefit to an ongoing defense program--and moving rapidly from SBIR's Phases I and II (R&D), to Phase III (acquisition). 
In the current environment, where major defense acquisition programs are often contracted with a single large contractor, it is difficult for a small business to get their high tech innovation inserted into the acquisition cycle. The amendment that I am introducing simply directs the Secretary of Defense to investigate and report on processes that would facilitate the rapid transition of successful SBIR projects into DoD acquisition programs. My goal is to lay the foundation for changes that will improve the incorporation of high technology innovation in defense programs. 
Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.

Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, since its enactment some 26 years ago, the Survivor Benefit Plan has been a source of financial security for military retirees and their dependents. Should the military retiree pre-decease his or her spouse, the plan allows for the spouse to continue to receive a percentage of the retiree's income benefit. This is a program that truly works for our retirees, those who dedicated a large portion of their lives to the service of their country, and I strongly support its continuation. 
In the past, Congress has understood that changes occur in the lives of military retirees and has tailored the Survivor Benefit Program accordingly. Retirement from the military is unlike retirement from any other type of employment. Military personnel generally retire in their late 30s or early 40s. They spend a large portion of their lives in military retirement. During this period, their lives can change significantly. The circumstances in which they found themselves at the time of their retirement may be dramatically altered over the years. Admittedly, this is more the exception than the rule, but for some retirees it is a fact of life. 
The Congress has previously offered limited open enrollment periods, or `open seasons' for retirees to participate in the Survivor Benefit Plan: once in 1981 and again in 1991. These open seasons are a recognition of the fact that some retirees who initially did not elect to participate in the Survivor Benefit Plan have found themselves in circumstances where they would welcome the opportunity to participate in the Plan. In the case of the first two open seasons, retirees who entered the program after their retirement date were required to pay a lump sum amount appropriate to what they would have paid since their retirement date. This ensured that the system was fair to those who chose to enroll upon retirement. 
I believe it is once again time to offer an open season to address the concerns of a small number of retirees who are interested in participating in the plan. The amendment that I am offering allows retirees who had not elected to participate in the Survivor Benefit Plan at the time of their retirement the opportunity to do so. The enrollment period would be limited to one year and would require a lump sum payment by the retiree in the amount that he or she would have paid in premiums, with accrued interest, since the date of their retirement. The amendment also allows the defense secretary to make adjustments to the retirees premium to ensure the actuarial soundness of the Plan's fund.

Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I have brief remarks in concluding today, a very productive day on the defense authorization bill. 
I wish to personally thank the distinguished chairman, Mr. Thurmond, and the ranking member, for covering a number of amendments today, including those of the Senator from Virginia while I was momentarily off the floor. Chairman Thurmond will bring the bill back up again on Monday. It will be the business. 
I will have further extensive remarks on Monday as regards the complex issue of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The American commitments there in connection with our NATO allies are very important commitments, and certain observations relative to Kosovo. 
Given the cloture motion, I am not sure whether our bill will have opened the opportunity for amendments on these issues. It is a subject that has been carefully considered by the Armed Services Committee in four meetings. We feel very strongly that there is an obligation in the Congress, which no one has spoken to with greater clarity and greater sincerity than the senior Senator from West Virginia, Mr. Byrd. He did so at a hearing of the Armed Services Committee on June 4 of this year. Senator Byrd and Senator Hutchison of Texas have worked very hard and diligently on this subject. But I am not sure as to what will evolve in the days to come on this bill. 
I wish to make several observations about this subject. I, too, have thought about introducing an amendment on this subject. But these are the concerns that I have. 
None of us could perceive with specificity what has happened in Kosovo, what is happening today, and what could happen in the future. That is a key that is directly linked to the continuing policies of the United States, together with our allies in Bosnia. 
Great progress has been made in Bosnia towards the Dayton accords. I was not in favor at any time and voted against the introduction of U.S. ground forces. Nevertheless, that decision was made and endorsed by the Congress of the United States. They have performed absolutely courageously, and have contributed to a measure of peace and stability that exists in Bosnia today. They have worked remarkably well with our allies. There are some 13 various allies which have contributed to this NATO-led force to bring about the current stability. I will speak further on Monday as to the details. 
But I want to comment on a couple of factors that I hope Senators will take into consideration should they want to go into further discussions of this area. 
First, there will be very important elections held in the political structure of Bosnia in September. Hopefully, the outcome of those elections, in terms of the candidates that succeed, will further move efforts towards achieving the Dayton accords. We cannot anticipate here in June what that situation will be, nor can we anticipate with any specificity the problems in Kosovo. Hopefully, the initiatives, indeed, by President Yeltsin, by President Clinton, and by many others in the United Kingdom and France will address that situation so that we will not witness further tragic displacement of people from their homes, communities, and to worsen the flow of refugees from that region. We simply cannot stand by and watch that persecution. 
I remember so well. We always talked in terms of Bosnia, that we have to contain that so it will not spill over into the Kosovo region. Now just the reverse has taken place. It is Kosovo which threatens to spill over, dislodge, and disrupt some of the achievements that have occurred so far in Bosnia. 
So the elections are important. The unfolding developments in Kosovo--we cannot predict today what they will be a month from now, or 6 months from now. 
Further, there will be a new Congress elected by the people of our country in November. They will take their seats, such Members as new Members who come and those who will depart. We will have a new Congress. 
It seems to me that the new Congress is entitled to take a fresh look at this situation. 
We also must take into consideration that we are working today with our allies on a variety of contingencies as they relate to Kosovo, and any legislation which is directed to the future of our commitment in Bosnia; that is, the extent the ground forces remain in place, the extent perhaps of their withdrawal and the force levels and the like, sends signals to people, particularly President Milosevic, who, indeed, is the prime perpetrator of the problems in that region, in my judgment, and we have to be very careful, because on the one hand if we address the future of U.S. commitments in Bosnia and at the same time we are trying to work out contingency plans with our allies, those two actions, in my judgment, have to go hand in hand. 
So it is terribly important that those addressing this issue take into consideration again the transitory nature of the Kosovo problem, the elections that are coming up, and the fact there will be a new Congress, and therefore any action that we take should not be taken--and I am hesitant to think we should take any action now--with regard to dictating in many respects to the Commander in Chief what is to be done in that region beginning, say, next spring. I think we have to be very careful to recognize the constitutional responsibilities of President Clinton in this area, and we should do nothing to abridge those constitutional responsibilities. 
So having said that, I will address this subject further on Monday, but I just wanted to lay down in today's Record some of my concerns about this very important issue. It is driven in large measure by the fact that the Armed Forces of the United States today have expended some $9.4 billion for the Bosnia action to date and through fiscal year 1998, and those dollars could, in my judgment, have been spent very wisely for modernization, for research and development, and for readiness. Those three areas are of prime concern as regards our military today, and they are very, very serious concerns. We will address those areas further as we consider the authorization bill. But it is an expensive commitment there in terms of dollars and U.S. troops, and it seems to me that we have to continually work with our allies so that those allies, particularly the European allies, take a greater percentage of this burden in the months to come. 
It is clear that we cannot hope to achieve the Dayton accords in a period of time, perhaps within a year or so. General Clarke, when he appeared before our committee, could not in any way--and we understand this--specify his estimate of time within which those accords of Dayton could be achieved. But nevertheless, it is the allied forces under the NATO in place today that have enabled the progress to date that we are all very fortunate to witness. 
Now, Mr. President, I will return now to the closing business of today's session of the Senate.

Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I wish to associate myself with the remarks of the distinguished Senator from Michigan and our great and courageous chairman of the Armed Services Committee, Mr. Thurmond. For all of us who have joined here today, and Senator Kerrey and others, to listen to those beautiful remarks, of course they evoke memories of our own parents. 
My father was a medical doctor who practiced surgery and gynecology in the greater metropolitan Washington area all his life. He was proud of his heritage from the central part of Virginia, from whence his father and mother came. I often think that no matter what riches there are available in the world, there is no greater gift of God or anyone else than to have loving and strong parents. To the extent I have succeeded modestly in life, I owe it almost entirely to a wonderful father and a wonderful mother, who lived to be 96 years old. 
Senator Byrd, you have left a profound mark on all of our lives. We visited momentarily here before those remarks about the birthday of West Virginia. I continue to make the offer to rejoin Virginia and West Virginia, bond them together as they once were, and I will yield the position of the senior Senator from Virginia and allow my colleague to be the senior Senator. Just how Senator Robb will fit into that, I am not sure.

Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today to express my strong opposition to the tobacco bill that is currently before the Senate. 
As you know, on June 20, 1997, a group of state attorneys general, plaintiffs' lawyers, public health advocates, and representatives of the major cigarette manufacturers announced a sweeping settlement that would restructure the tobacco industry and revolutionize the nation's tobacco control efforts. The agreement, reached in good faith among the parties, would settle lawsuits brought by forty states seeking to recoup Medicaid spending for smoking-related illnesses and ban certain class-action lawsuits against the tobacco industry. 
The only reason that the Senate is even considering the current bill is because the proposed settlement required the approval of Congress and the President before taking effect. This measure differs significantly, however, from the terms of the original settlement. Although the bill makes some progress toward the important goal of eliminating youth smoking, it has also become a vehicle for regressive higher taxes and a creation of more federal government. In fact, the attorneys general who negotiated the original settlement are opposed to this bill in its current form. 
Mr. President, S. 1415 contains over $500 billion in new taxes. By some estimates, as much as $800 billion in new taxes could be imposed on the American people as a result of this bill. But even more alarming than the sheer size of this tax increase is the fact that two-thirds of the tax burden would fall on Americans earning less than $35,000 per year. 
Indirectly, the bill `deputizes' tobacco firms as tax collectors. 
In view of our country's current economic prosperity and budgetary surpluses, I believe that the American people are entitled to forms of tax relief, not increases in taxes. 
The total result of the bill's proposed tax could, in my view, be disastrous. It would primarily burden lower-income Americans. It could create a new black market for cigarettes similar to the underground market that currently exists for illegal drugs. Canada has experienced this terrible problem as a result of its high taxes on cigarettes. Further, it could tempt children to obtain cigarettes illegally or to illegally or improperly obtain the funds to purchase cigarettes. There is simply no justification for imposing over half a trillion dollars in new regressive taxes on the American people. 
Traditionally, families and the states have been responsible for dealing with the legitimate and important objective of deterring youth smoking. Indeed, every state in the country has enacted laws making youth smoking and selling tobacco products to minors illegal. I believe that these laws should be vigorously enforced, both against adults who sell tobacco products to minors and against children who illegally attempt to purchase these products. Congress should not intrude on a responsibility that is properly and legitimately under the purview of the citizens of a state and their state governments. 
Many small family firms, indeed many businesses and communities throughout Virginia, depend on the cultivation, sale, and taxation of tobacco. They do so legally. In addition, Virginia's ports depend heavily on the shipment of tobacco and related products. The industry directly employs over 12,800 Virginians and supports over 150,000 additional jobs indirectly, generating more than $2.2 billion in payroll taxes annually. The bill before us would have unfair consequences on all of these thousands of honest, hard-working Virginians. 
I would remind my colleagues, however, that one need not represent a tobacco-producing state to represent a large number of constituents who would be adversely effected by this legislation. Indeed, thousands of Americans across the country work in other industries that interact with the tobacco industry, such as convenience stores, shippers, packers, suppliers of agricultural products and equipment and vendors. Each of these industries, and many others, are likely to suffer tremendously if this bill is enacted. Most of these enterprises, particularly convenience stores, are small businesses and are struggling every day for survival. 
I would further remind my colleagues that one need not represent a tobacco-producing state to stand for the principles of smaller government, lower taxes, and personal responsibility. 
Last Thursday, Virginia Governor Jim Gilmore convened the Tobacco Workers' Unity Summit. As a governor who is respected nationwide for vigorously enforcing Virginia's laws against the sale of tobacco to children while passing the largest tax cut in Virginia history, I consider Governor Gilmore's to be an important voice in this debate. In his opening remarks at the Unity Summit, Governor Gilmore said, `We will not be successful in combating youth smoking if we leave the matter to the tax commissioner rather than the law enforcement officer.' I agree.

Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, these are the people who have been left out of the debate in the Senate--the people who stand to lose their livelihoods if this bill is passed. 
The participants of the Unity Summit were universally opposed to the bill that is currently before us, and they all signed the following Tobacco Workers' Unity Pledge: 
We the undersigned urge President Clinton and the U.S. Congress not to forget the hardworking men and women whose livelihoods are linked to tobacco. 
These men and women include truckers and longshoremen, paper and steelworkers, machinists and growers, convenience store clerks and warehouse workers. 
These working Americans labor long and hard hours to pay their taxes and put food on the table for their families. 
These working families should not be forgotten by those who hold power in Washington. 
We urge policy makers in Washington to find ways to protect children from access to tobacco products that will not result in thousands of working men and women losing their jobs. 
We urge the Administration and Congress to remember that protecting our children is a vital law enforcement issue, not an excuse to raise taxes. 
We also urge the President and the Congress to remember that you will not protect our children by putting their parents out of work. 
The bill before us will create far more problems for the American people than it could ever hope to solve. The bill has lost sight of the important objective of stopping children from smoking and has fallen prey to a multi-billion dollar money grab. The bill has blinded us to the American tradition of insisting on personal responsibility from adults and protecting our citizens from government intrusion into their personal lives.

Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of this amendment. This effort on behalf of the U.S. Senate has a laudable and commendable goal to reduce smoking among teenagers. But I regret that I will not be able to support the bill for many reasons; foremost among them is the fact that we are trying to enable a certain class of lawyers who, in many instances, I am sure have rendered legal services of great value, but others of questionable value. We will set precedence for the collection of legal fees that have never, in my memory as a lawyer, been established in the history of this country. I joined the distinguished Senator in a similar amendment to curtail these fees. 
I feel that the people of this country will sit back in absolute stunned shock should legislation pass that did not in some way try to properly and fairly compensate attorneys, but not do so at the levels that have been discussed in the course of this legislation. 
I lend my strong support to this amendment. 
Mr. President, the other features of this legislation which trouble me greatly is the concept of passing on to a class of persons who still use tobacco, which is perfectly legal to do so, an onerous tax, particularly on a class of persons that really in many respects are least able to pay the tax. What we are doing is like the old days in the West. We are going out and deputizing sheriffs to be tax collectors. We are actually creating their own deputy tax collectors now to go out and collect this tax. We are scrambling around here trying to figure out how to spend it. 
I just cannot support legislation that increases, I think, in a most unfair manner a tax on this class of individuals. 
This morning I watched, as I am sure many do, the various shows, television and news reporting shows about the reaction of the American public to this legislation. They had a group of young people on. They all admitted to the fact that they smoked. Some said they wished they didn't and would like to get off of it. I also find disturbing that we are putting a tax on a number of people--I don't know how you calculate the number--who are smoking and would like to get off, but they simply cannot for various personal reasons muster the strength to do so. But they are going to get punished. 
But these young people are almost mocking the effort of the Congress thus far in dealing with this issue of smoking. Raising the cost of a pack of cigarettes is simply not going to, in my judgment, in any significant way curtail the smoker. It is just not going to do it. 
I am proud, like most in this Chamber, to have raised children who are grown now. We know the nature of young people. If we raise the price per pack of these cigarettes, it will almost be a challenge for them to go out and in some way find the money to purchase cigarettes and use them almost as a status symbol. Indeed, I think we run the risk--and others have discussed this in great detail--of creating a black market situation and almost induce criminality among the younger generation. 
For that and many reasons, eventually I will cast my vote against this legislation. 
But on this issue this is, I think, the best attempt that I have seen thus far to try and recognize the injustice we are inflicting on people through taxation and that a class of beneficiaries of lawyers will be unjustly enriched. 
Mr. President, I strongly support this amendment. I yield the floor.  
Mr. NICKLES addressed the Chair.

Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, there has been a concerted effort by the majority leader and the Democrat leader, Chairman Chafee, myself, and the distinguished ranking member, Mr. Baucus, to try and get a voice vote tonight on a technical corrections bill to the ISTEA legislation which was adopted by the Senate just before we went on recess. I regret that we are not going to be able to handle that matter tonight. 
But a part of that very important Technical Corrections Act would address an error that was made in the drafting of the bill which related to veterans. Being a veteran myself, and many others in this body, we were quite concerned about that mistake. And the purpose of my taking the floor now is to advise the Senate this matter will be corrected in the TEA-21 Restoration Act, which is a euphemism for the Technical Corrections Act, when we get to it. We will renew or efforts on Thursday. 
I think it is important to put in tonight's Record a little of the background how this mistake was made. 
The TEA-21 Restoration Act, which is, as I said, the Technical Corrections Act, corrects drafting errors to section 8201, also known as the Veterans Benefits Act of 1998. 
Specifically, the corrections to this subtitle of the conference report relate to using funds estimated for the veterans smoking-related disability benefits as a budget offset for transportation spending. 
The use of funds identified to finance the veterans tobacco-related smoking disability benefits for other domestic discretionary programs was first proposed in President Clinton's fiscal year 1999 budget request. 
The Senate budget resolution also identified these funds as potential offsets for transportation spending. 
During the conference on the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century (TEA-21), the Senate and House leadership and the Clinton administration agreed to use the funds estimated for the veterans smoking-related disability benefit as an offset so that transportation spending would equal gas tax revenues collected for the highway trust fund. 
The provision included in the conference report on TEA-21 to use the veterans smoking-related disability benefits for transportation was drafted incorrectly and had the unintended consequence of identifying smoking as an act of `willful misconduct' by veterans. 
That was a tragic error, drafting error, that took place in the legislative counsel's office. It was unintended. 
I have gone back and read the code, found the section from which this concept was withdrawn, and it was just one of those mistakes. There was a great deal of rushed effort toward the end of this bill and those types of mistakes happen. What is most regrettable, it has caused a great deal of emotional stress among veterans. For that, I and many others apologize. 
Today, at our midday caucus, Senator McCain raised this matter and spoke most passionately on it, about his concern to have it corrected. That is one of the reasons I have come to the floor tonight, to assure Senators if and when we get to this technical correction bill it will be corrected. 
The provision in the TEA-21 Restoration Act corrects any reference to smoking as an act of `willful misconduct' by veterans. 
This provision also clarifies that veterans who have filed claims for smoking-related benefits are grandfathered. 
The provision also makes clear that those active-duty service personnel who have a smoking-related illness will continue to qualify for disability compensation. 
Another correction in this bill relates to ensuring that survivors and their dependents will receive the increased benefits of the Montgomery G.I. Bill provided in the conference report. 
The offsets clarified in the TEA-21 Restoration Act remain those that were identified in the President's budget request and the Senate budget resolution.

Mr. WARNER. This afternoon, Chairman Chafee and the ranking member, Mr. Baucus, and myself had a meeting of the Committee on Environment and Public Works. It was well attended by Members. We explained this situation and how there were three committees working on this important piece of legislation. Of course, the committee of original jurisdiction, the Environment and Public Works, another committee of original jurisdiction, the Banking Committee, which dealt with the mass transit part of the bill, and also throughout Chairman Domenici and the distinguished ranking member, the Senator from New Jersey, Senator Lautenberg, worked with us from the standpoint of the Budget Committee, which had an important role, of course, in the offset issue. 
So many people were involved--three staffs, three committees. We regret sincerely that this error took place. We hope we have taken the appropriate corrective measures. 
This language has been submitted to the veterans committee for review. I understand the Senator from West Virginia, Mr. Rockefeller, will have some views to express on this matter, and also the Budget Committee. There is a report to the Senate and to those who are following this issue in hopes that we can put to rest a very serious problem which was accidental, I am convinced of it. We regret most sincerely, speaking to myself and I think many other veterans, that this caused such consternation among the veterans of the United States.

 Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, It was two years ago, in this chamber, that we recognized Senator Bob Dole for his tremendous contribution to the nation. I and many others stood and paid tribute to this great American for his outstanding career of Public Service, a career that spanned over fifty years. I rise today, to once again pay tribute to this great American. 
As I said two years ago, Senator Bob Dole's destiny was and is leadership. From the battlefields of World War II to the floor of the United States Senate, Bob Dole was worked tirelessly for a strong national defense. That hard work was recognized recently in a ceremony held at Fort Meyer, Virginia. The Secretary of Defense, joined by the Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, presented Senator Dole with the Department of Defense's highest civilian honor, the Medal for Distinguished Public Service. 
Senator Bob Dole, a man whom I am humbled to call my friend, is most deserving of the Medal for Distinguished Public Service and I wish to join our former colleague Secretary Cohen, in honoring Senator Dole. Mr. President, I send to the desk, copies of the fine remarks delivered by Secretary Cohen and Senator Dole at the April 29th award ceremony and ask that they be printed in today's Record of the body he loved--The United States Senate.

Mr. WARNER. I thank the Presiding Officer. 
Mr. President, while both leaders are present on the floor, as one who has been involved for a year and a half in preparing the legislation which now, hopefully, will be voted upon by the Senate, I thank my distinguished colleague, the majority leader, and my colleague, the distinguished minority leader. I just think of how many times during the course of this conference we have made calls to them to seek their guidance that both are entrusted to give as a consequence of their very important positions. 
I also have virtually over the last 7 days and nights worked at the side of my distinguished chairman, Senator Chafee, and the distinguished ranking member, the Senator from Montana, Mr. Baucus, as we prepared and then I think very fairly, forcefully and successfully advocated the Senate's position before the House of Representatives. 
The House was very ably represented by Chairman Shuster, ranking member Congressman Oberstar, Congressman Petri, Congressman Rahall--the four from the House versus the three from the Senate. 
It was a long conference. Not until late last night did we put in place the final decision for the foundation on which I believe this bill rests, and that is equity among the States. Fifteen months ago, as chairman of the subcommittee in the Environment Committee entrusted with this important legislation, we embarked on the hearing process for this legislation. We held hearings in seven different States because it was essential to go out and get the views of the people: The citizens, the supervisors, the State legislatures and, indeed, the representatives of their legislatures and the Governors themselves. Senator Baucus and I actually went to a joint hearing of the States of Montana and Idaho. Senator Chafee held hearings in other parts of America. So we didn't just sit in Washington, we went to where the problems are and to learn firsthand. 
Senator Baucus has been an absolute brick, as we say throughout my part of the world, as my partner, together with Senator Chafee, not only in the final hours, but throughout the 15-month process to bring this bill to fruition. 
The dollar value represents the largest increase in the history of America. Many people played a vital role in that, notably the senior Senator from West Virginia, the senior Senator from Texas, Senator Domenici and, indeed, Senator Stevens was very helpful, because this is a very complex series of votes and then adjustments to the various accounting principles and budget principles which we adhered to in the Senate. 
So many persons are deserving of a great deal of credit for providing this important conference report which will shortly be voted on by this body. 
The staff is extraordinary. In my 19 years in the Senate, I do not know of another instance in which I have seen more dedicated service. By my side here in the Chamber is Ann Loomis, who was the counsel for the subcommittee, who 15 months ago worked and traveled, as did I and others, to gain the very important information from across the United States to incorporate into this bill. Kathy Ruffalo of Montana was Senator Baucus' principal assistant on the committee. She also worked with us throughout this bill, as did Ellen Stein of my staff. Jimmie Powell, of course, is the staff director. Dan Corbett, Tom Sliter--and all too often we forget the many others who are back in the offices of the Senators, who represent those Senators on the committee in the long hearings and the workup of this legislation, and, most particularly, the support staff who are on the Environment and Public Works Committee--all contributed to making this, I think, the most significant bill in the history of the United States of America addressing transportation needs. 
How often has Senator Gramm or Senator Byrd pointed out that we are in a one-world market. To the extent that we in the United States can have an efficient and safe transportation system is to the extent we can compete with nations far beyond our shores. 
Our system was aging, continues to age; and this bill makes the necessary corrections. And through the leadership of Senator Byrd and Senator Gramm, we got the additional funds to make it the most meaningful transportation bill in America's history. 
Equity was the theme, the very theme that united all of us. While we incorporated many of the principles of ISTEA, the bill passed in 1991--and it was important to do so--there were corrections that, I can say, as softly, I suppose, as it can be expressed, were very definitely needed to correct what we felt were inequities in ISTEA. 
Mr. President, I see the distinguished leader. I will be happy to yield.

Mr. WARNER. Equity for the donor States. `Donor States' is a category created by ISTEA I. We never actually heard that 
term prior to ISTEA I. But generally speaking, what it represented was as a consequence of ISTEA I, a group of States, about 18 to 20 in number. Some were right on the borderline. Those States, when their citizens or visitors in those States went to the gas pump and paid this very significant Federal gas tax, those 19 States got back a very small amount in comparison to other States whose return, as a consequence of ISTEA, was far higher. 
My State got 79 cents on what we called the apportion dollar that comes back from the highway trust fund; other States had equally. Several had less than my State. And that was basically an unfairness to the citizens of that State, that those moneys that they expended in a Federal tax, and which was represented as to be for the purpose of highways, did not come back in what I believe was a fair formula. 
So the foundation in this bill was to change that inequity such that that class of donor States received no less than 90.5 percent.

Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the Senator is correct. There are certain programs, like the Federal Lands Program, certain environmental programs, to which all the States contribute. The Senator is correct. 
But the major achievement is the floor, which is a floor that puts us in range with almost all the other States of significant size. For instance, the smaller States, there are 13 small States. That was the second building block that the Senator from Virginia put together to formulate this bill months ago. It seems so long ago now. The distinguished Senator from Montana was a key player in that, 
Senator Graham of Florida, and we put this together. 
Indeed, I would like to acknowledge the participation by the Governors of these various States, the donor States, and the small States, and their various highway representatives. 
So that was the nucleus, the engine that began to take this bill down.

Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, referring to the bill, we have not discussed today the important strides made in safety of the traveling public. Nearly 440,000 persons a year, regrettably, lose their lives on highways and many more suffer incredible injuries. The bill includes four new and significant provisions which hold great promise to save lives. 
First, there is a new incentive program to give States funding based on each State's improvement in seat belt use. I want to particularly acknowledge the important contribution of public interest groups speaking on behalf of safety. Those groups indicated that this will greatly reduce highway deaths and injuries. 
Second, the conference report contains a new incentive grant program to reduce drunk driving by rewarding States who have passed .08 blood alcohol content law. 
Third, the conference report includes a new program to require States to adopt minimum penalties for repeat drunk driving offenders. 
I am privileged to say that was a conclusion that this Senator made after close consultation with many safety groups, and, indeed, acknowledgment should be to the other groups--restaurant groups and others who came in to see us on this issue. Statistics on drunk driving confirm that repeat drunk drivers represent one of the most significant parts of our tragedy on the highways today, as a consequence of alcohol. 
Fourth, another Senate provision requiring States to enact laws against open alcohol containers is included. Senator Dorgan was particularly interested in that, and he deserves much credit for bringing that to the Senate's attention. 
These four provisions, I believe, begin a new day in our efforts to improve the safety of our Nation's highways. The conference report contains a new title, championed by Senator Chafee, the distinguished chairman, and Senator Graham of Florida, to implement innovative financing techniques to leverage private dollars for transportation projects. 
The bill also recognizes the significant needs of our border States who have experienced significant transportation growth since the passage of NAFTA. 
There is a new $700 million grant program to meet the needs of our border States and those trade corridor States carrying significant traffic to those areas. 
Lastly, there is a provision in the conference report to provide $900 million to replace the aging Woodrow Wilson Bridge. I wish to express my appreciation to my colleagues from Maryland and my colleague from Virginia, Mr. Robb, and, indeed, strong assistance from the House. Chairman Shuster was very supportive, as was Mr. Oberstar. While they did not put it in the House bill, they recognized I would have it in the Senate bill, and at a figure considerably above the request by the President. 
The President took a personal interest in this bridge and summoned a number of us to the White House, to a very important conference presided over by the Director of OMB and his senior staff. There was a general consensus at this conference that the $900 million was as much as we could achieve under this particular piece of legislation, recognizing that these dollars were in competition with the other 48 States and Maryland and Virginia and, of course, the District of Columbia. 
Therefore, another piece of legislation will have to be carefully drafted by the White House, in consultation with the Governors of Maryland and Virginia and the representatives of the District of Columbia, to allocate the next financing package which could be as high as this one between the several States, notably Maryland and Virginia, and the District. I think they should bear a portion of it, and a further significant contribution, I presume the majority, coming from the Federal Government and how that would be financed. There were a number of schemes which I think were quite innovative and discussed, but I will leave it up to those drafters of the legislation to work out those details. 
I will be pleased, and, once again, together with our colleagues, to work towards passage of this legislation in a timely manner. 
Mr. President, I conclude my remarks on this bill, again, commending our distinguished chairman, Mr. Chafee, and the ranking member, Mr. Baucus--the three of us were the principal negotiators for the conference--and, again, paying great respect to my staff, and most particularly to this loyal one seated next to me, Ann Loomis. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation which would preserve a tract of land of legendary historic significance. Many of my colleagues have heard me speak on the importance of preserving the legacy of George Washington, and have joined me as cosponsors of Senate Resolution 83, to commemorate the bicentennial of the death of our Founding Father. We have the opportunity to protect the scene of George Washington's early life, the site at which young Washington undertook lessons that taught him the principles which guided his life. By extending the boundaries of the George Washington Birthplace National Monument to include the 85 acre area in Stafford County, Virginia, known as Ferry Farm, we may celebrate that expanse of land where Washington developed his extraordinary character. 
Ferry Farm was the childhood home of our first President. Lying across the Rappahannock River from historic Fredericksburg, Virginia, it is the site of the legendary cherry tree, chopped down by a boy who could not tell a lie. Here, a fable recounts, young Washington threw a stone across the Rappahannock, one of the last unspoiled scenic rivers in the country. And it was here that Washington developed those qualities of honesty, integrity, loyalty, perseverance, and devotion to public good which make him the indomitable role model for our country and the world at large. By preserving this site, we will sustain the environment in which our Founding Father grew into his role as a leader in military strategy as well as democratic principles. The exploration, research, and interpretation of this site will inspire and challenge all who visit to study the life of Washington, and his impact on our Nation. 
Yet this site, the tangled brush, the serene river vista, belies the intertwining of history which occurred here. Along the banks of the Rappahannock, site of the formative years of our distinguished First President, also became the site of carnage, as our country was torn asunder by the ravages of the Civil War. In late April of 1962, the Union Army established Ferry Farm as its strategic crossing point in order to advance against Confederate forces west of Fredericksburg. The soldiers stationed at Ferry Farm were not unaware of the irony of their position. As one soldier wrote from his post,  
Could George Washington have beheld * * * with prophetic eye, the havoc that was to be wrought by those mighty hosts of his countrymen in fratricidal strife on the very ground * * * which must have been familiar to him in his youthful days * * * his patriotic soul would have been overwhelmed with grief. 
It is our duty to recognize the history of this site--a reliquary for the memories of a man of great character and courage, as well as a melancholy field upon which our country struggled to preserve democracy. In saving this parcel of land, we venerate a leader whose principled life remains as model for us all, while consecrating land upon which our Union, for which Washington battled so courageously, fought for existence. 
We cannot forfeit such a landmark to the forces of development. Ferry Farm is where Washington learned the values that made him the Father of Our Country--values as important to our nation today as they were to its establishment more than two hundred and fifty years ago. I look forward to the swift passage of this legislation.

Madam President, the Senator brings to the attention of the Senate through this amendment a very important subject, one which is currently before the Senate in a number of committees--Foreign Relations Committee, Banking Committee, and in all probability the Commerce Committee has an interest in it. I say to my colleague that the Armed Services Committee, indeed, would have an interest, of course, because it goes to the fundamental proposition of national security. 
But I have to say in total candor that this amendment would require consideration by at least the three enumerated committees as well as ours. What I am asking of my colleague, and I want to ask a few questions about it, is that I hope the Senator would be agreeable to laying this amendment aside so that the Senate would proceed with other amendments, and within that period of time it would be the pending amendment, within that period of time, we will get the expression and the views of colleagues serving on those other committees.

Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank the manager of the bill. 
Mr. President, the world has been working in a responsible way for years to try to halt the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction--nuclear, biological and chemical. India's decision both yesterday and today to detonate five underground nuclear explosions has blown a hole in the dyke of the world's nonproliferation efforts. The flood waters are now running. This tragic development should bring into sharper focus both the threat that our nation, and indeed all nations of the world, face from the spread of weapons of mass destruction; and the need for defenses to protect us from that threat. The bill before us offers such protection. 
Mr. President, on April 21, the Senate Armed Services Committee voted to favorably report to the Senate S. 1873, the American Missile Protection Act of 1998. I am proud to be an original cosponsor of this legislation. This bipartisan bill, whose principal sponsors are Senator Cochran and Senator Inouye, currently has 50 cosponsors in the Senate. I regret to say that the vote in the Armed Services Committee was along party lines. 
The American Missile Protection Act which is before the Senate today is very simple. It states that, `It is the policy of the United States to deploy as soon as is technologically possible a National Missile Defense system capable of defending the territory of the United States against limited ballistic missile attack (whether accidental, unauthorized or deliberate).' 
This bill is a compromise--a step back from earlier Republican national missile defense (NMD) efforts in that it does not specify a date certain for deployment of an NMD system. As my colleagues will recall, the National Missile Defense Act of 1997, introduced last January by the Majority Leader, called for deployment of an NMD system by 2003. Many Republicans joined the Majority Leader in his effort last year. Would we still like to see a system deployed by 2003? Of course we would. But the intent of this year's legislation is to build a more bipartisan consensus for deploying a national missile defense system capable of defending the United States. 
I have long been a strong supporter of providing Americans here at home, and our troops deployed overseas, with the most effective missile defense systems possible. In my view, there is no greater obligation of a government than to provide for the protection of its people. The Persian Gulf War should have made clear to all Americans our vulnerability to the proliferation of ballistic missiles around the world, and the dire need to develop and deploy effective defenses as soon as possible. 
What are the objections to this simple, and seemingly obvious goal? The arguments we have heard from Members on the other side of the aisle are mainly three-fold: (1) a threat does not currently exist--and may not exist for the foreseeable future--that would justify the deployment of an NMD system; (2) we should not commit ourselves to the deployment of such a system when we do not know what that system would cost; and (3) we may be locking ourselves into a technologically inferior system by making a deployment decision today. I will respond to these arguments in turn. 
First and foremost, the threat. I respectfully disagree with my Democrat colleagues. In my view, the threat exists today and is growing. Recent events in India are but the latest proof. 
In my view, the biggest current threat we face is instability in Russia and the impact that instability could have on Russian command and control of the thousands of intercontinental ballistic missiles capable of reaching this country. A recent segment on ABC's `World News with Peter Jennings,' highlighted this problem. I quote one statement: `A crushing lack of funds means Russia's entire 30-year-old nuclear command and control system is becoming unreliable.' 
I remind my colleagues that with this legislation we are not seeking to deploy a Star Wars-type umbrella over the U.S. which would protect us from a massive strike by the Russians. We are seeking protection from a very limited, unauthorized or accidental attack. That scenario, unfortunately, could happen today. 
And what of threats beyond Russia? By the Administration's our admission, the North Koreans will be able to deploy--in the near term--a ballistic missile with a range capable of striking Alaska and Hawaii. And other rogue nations are clamoring to get this type of technology. According to a recent report by the Air Force, `Ballistic missiles are already in widespread use and will continue to increase in number and variety. The employment of weapons of mass destruction on many ballistic missiles vastly increases the significance of the threat.' 
I believe we have proof enough today that a threat exists which justifies deploying an NMD system. But what if--for the sake of argument--we are wrong? What if a system is not needed for many more years? I would rather err on the side of deploying defense sooner than they might be needed, rather than being caught defenseless if nations move even faster than the Administration expects to develop the capability to attack our shores. 
Many of my Democrat colleagues are--quite properly--very concerned about what an NMD system might cost. My reply to that is, what is the cost of not deploying a system? What if even one ballistic missile strikes the United States? What is the cost in terms of loss of life and damage to our nation? That is a cost which must be factored into this debate. That is a cost we should never have to pay. 
Who would we answer to the American people in the aftermath of such an attack when they ask why their government failed to provide them with any defenses? We know the threat exists--it will only grow in the years ahead. It is time to stop debating, and time to deploy systems to protect our people. 
And finally, the issue of technology. The argument has been made that we should put off a deployment decision until we have the best possible technology for an NMD system. Well, that is an argument that will result in putting off a deployment decision indefinitely. There will always be better technology down the road. That is true for all of our weapons systems. That should not be used as an excuse for not deploying a system which is needed. Our focus instead should be on designing a system which can incorporate technological advances as they become available. 
Another point which we must keep in mind as we debate this legislation is that we are not locking ourselves into a particular architecture or a deployment decision that will then just go on `auto-pilot.' We are making a broad policy statement that the U.S. should deploy a National Missile Defense system as soon as possible. That is our goal. Subsequent Congresses will decide--through the normal authorization and appropriation process--the details of the type of system to be deployed and the cost of that system. This bill is not the end of the process--it is the beginning. 
And finally, there has been discussion about the impact of this bill on arms control agreements with the Russians--particularly the 1972 ABM Treaty. Dire consequences have been predicted if we were to pass this bill which, according to one of our Committee Members, would `violate the ABM Treaty.' I would just point out that a statement of policy does not--in and of itself--violate a treaty. Until actual deployment of a system were to take place--which would be years in the future--no violation of a treaty would occur. In the meantime, the United States should be talking to the Russians about modifying the ABM treaty to deal with current realities. 
We are no longer living in the world envisioned by the ABM Treaty--a world with two superpowers with missiles targeted on each other. Russia is no longer the only threat we face. We are in a world where an increasing number of nations are acquiring the means to strike others with ballistic missiles. If the Russians would look around their borders they would realize that they have just as much, if not more, need for effective missiles defenses as we do. Regardless, if the Russians do not agree to modifications of this 26-year old treaty, we should not let this document stand in the way of protecting our people from attack. 
I urge my colleagues to join us in our effort to provide effective defenses for our country. 
Mr. President, in summary, the Nation owes a debt of gratitude to the Senator from Mississippi, Mr. Cochran, and the Senator from Hawaii, Mr. Inouye, for, again, showing the leadership to bring America closer and closer to a system which is absolutely essential for our defense. 
When the tragic news unfolded about the resumption of testing by India, I think in the hearts of most Americans two thoughts came about: First, `Well, that's far away, no threat to us;' secondly, `Well, we already have a system which will protect us.' 
Neither is true, and this tragedy brings into sharper focus the need for the U.S. Senate to move forward on this issue. I hope that sharper focus induces Senators to support moving this bill forward. 
Another argument that is frequently brought up is, `Well, what about Russia and the ABM Treaty?' The ABM Treaty in 1972 is against a background of two superpowers who possessed arsenals. That is not the case today. Unfortunately, as a consequence of proliferation, the arsenals that we find in many countries, and with the news in India, that could even expand now the number of countries. Why should not Americans have their prayers answered: Just give us what is necessary to protect against a limited attack from a single or two or three missiles as a consequence of terrorism, as a consequence of a miscalculation, as a consequence of failure of equipment? To me, that is a very reasonable request, and that is the essence of this legislation. I urge it be supported. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, during this past week, I and my colleagues have been working in committee on the defense authorization bill for the upcoming fiscal year. We have debated a host of issues of significant import to the national security of this great nation, among them the future of the BRAC process. 
Mr. President, a decade ago, I worked with my good friend from Georgia, Senator Sam Nunn, to formulate legislation that would guide this nation through the base closure process. We understood then that this would be a difficult and, for many communities across this country, a painful process. 
In this decade, each of us in this chamber has come to know how communities in our states had come to rely on the military as the mainstay of their economic livelihood. For many communities, a base closure would impart significant economic impact. In some communities a positive result, in others a negative impact. No two communities are the same. The challenge to these communities after a base closure was then to reorient their goals and to plan for continued growth and well-being, or plain survival. 
I learned a great deal from Senator Nunn during our discussions on planning for base closures. He is a man of great intellect and keen foresight and fully understood the possibility that this process could become politicized. Under our leadership, the committee went to great lengths to legislate the appropriate direction, responsibilities and necessary safeguards that might preclude either the executive or legislative branch from manipulating the process for political gain, rather than the collective gain of the national security of this country. 
The BRAC rounds in 1991 and 1993 were basically free from challenge, but 1995 was a different story--one with which we are all familiar. Like many of you, I was truly disappointed that we have come so far with such a degree of success only to have the process, under such a dark cloud, break down with confidence lost. 
So, it is under this cloud that we attempt to continue a discussion on the necessity of future base closures. The citizens of the Commonwealth and my colleagues in this chamber, know my position on this. Like Secretary Cohen and other experts on national security policy, I believe we still have work to do to reduce base infrastructure if we are to continue to meet the rising costs of national security challenges of the coming millennium, particularly modernization. 
The shadow cast on the process continues to grow--seemingly unabated by our remarks, and probably the counsel of Secretary Cohen. I am severely distressed by a recent Defense Department memo which, once again, puts in question the BRAC process. 
To get this process back on track, I am proposing legislation today to form a task force to revise these issues. This task force will be composed of experts chosen by both the majority and minority from both chambers in bipartisan spirit. The charter of the task force will be to investigate and report to the Congress by March of next year how we might efficiently achieve, without manipulation, the continued reduction in military infrastructure. 
I believe it is important that we assure the American people that a future base closure can be maintained in the spirit in which I and Senator Nunn and our colleagues on the committee has originally intended those few years ago. I invite members to join me on this legislation.

Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Liberty Dollar Bill Act. 
Recently, the eighth grade students of Liberty Middle School in Ashland, Virginia came up with an idea. The measure I introduce today simply implements their vision. This bill directs the Treasury to place on the back of the one dollar bill the actual language from the Constitution of the United States. 
Our founding fathers met in 1787, to write what would become the model for all modern democracies--the Constitution. 
Our Constitution is a beacon of light for the world. Shouldn't all people be able to hold up our one dollar bill as a symbol of there freedom of modern democracy worldwide. 
Washington, Madison, Franklin, Hamilton and many other great Americans met for four months in 1787 to ignite history's greatest light of government. 
They argued, fought, and compromised to create a lasting democracy, built on a philosophy found in the preamble of the constitution. And they protected this philosophy and these ideals by creating three branches of government and divisions of power between the federal and state governments found in the articles and the amendments of the Constitution. 
Three of the men mentioned are on our United States currency, but not the document they put their lives into--not the document they then asked Americans to ratify. 
While our currency celebrates the men who first wrote the constitution, it doesn't celebrate, their most noble achievement, the living document that has been so ably protected while it continues to evolve with each new generation. 
Shouldn't this greatest of American achievements be in the hands of all Americans? 
All Presidents, likewise all public officers, swear to `preserve, protect and defend' the constitution. 
No country can survive if it looses its philosophical moorings. The freedoms and liberties we enjoy give substance, value and meaning to the laws by which we live. Our Nation's philosophy can be taken for granted in the daily business of lawmaking. Yet we can hear in John F. Kennedy's inaugural address that we do not defend America's laws, we defend its philosophy--a philosophy embodied in the Constitution. 
Seventy-five percent of Americans say that `The Constitution is important to them, makes them proud, and is relevant to their lives.' 
So important is this document that we built the Archives in Washington to house and safeguard it. Hundreds of thousands go there each year to see it. However, ninety-four percent of Americans don't even know all of the rights and freedoms found in the First Amendment. 
Sixty-two percent of Americans can't name our three branches of government. 
Six hundred thousand legal immigrants come to America each year. Often their first sight of America is the Statute of Liberty, holding high her torch, symbolizing our light and our freedom. Many of these immigrants become American citizens by the naturalization process and learn more about the Constitution than many natural born citizens 
If America's most patriotic symbol--the Constitution--were on the back of the one dollar bill, wouldn't we all know more about our Government? And shouldn't we? 
Shouldn't it be where all Americans can readily read it. Shouldn't the Constitution be on the back of the one dollar bill? 
Today, I am proud to join my colleague in the House, Chairman Tom Bliley, and introduce the companion legislation in the Senate. The Liberty Dollar Bill Act directs the Secretary of the Treasury to incorporate the preamble to the Constitution of the United States, the Bill of Rights, and a list of the Articles of the Constitution on the reverse side of the one dollar bill. 
Mr. President, I agree with the students of Liberty Middle School. The Constitution belongs to the people. It should be in their hands. 
I want to commend the eighth grade students of Liberty Middle School and their teacher, Mr. Randy Wright for their contribution to our Nation. I hope all my colleagues in the Senate will see the wisdom of these students and join me as a cosponsor of this legislation. Let the nation hear that the younger generation can provide ideas that become the laws of our land.

Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I will take the time jointly of my colleague from New York. I am privileged to be a cosponsor of this amendment. Of course, I will grant the Senator the opportunity to speak, and then I will follow the Senator from Oregon. 
The point is, to Senator Biden's comment on the issue of the nuclear weapons. The Senator from New York and I are not rattling the nuclear saber and trying to utilize fear as a point. There is a very logical argument as it relates just to the Baltics, that that is part of the equation if indeed they are admitted, and indeed NATO has to become a part of the defense system. But let's put that to one side. What the Senator from New York was trying to say, and did say very eloquently, is that since 1992 the Russian military, across the board, with the exception of their nuclear arsenals, has suffered severe degradation. How well we all know, their officer corps has no housing, their military enlisted no pay, and they haven't put a surface ship of any significant numbers to sea in a long time. The one system that threatens the United States, and always will, is the strategic nuclear system.

Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I say to my good friend that he is quite right in his recitation. There has been an active number of steps taken by Russia. We are still in question as to whether the Duma is going to move and approve the pending arms control. I do not yield that point. In an hour or so, I will be addressing the moratorium of 3 years. Russia has more or less accepted the fact that, in all likelihood, these 3 nations will come in. But I say to my colleague, they may draw the line with those 3. That is why I am going to ask this body to consider very carefully a time period in which to assess the impact of the 3 before we move forward with further consideration. We will wait an hour or so to address that. 
I take strong disagreement with the fact that the Russians are going along with everything we are doing.

Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I want to follow along. The Senator from Oregon touched on the historical context of how nations are admitted into NATO, and there was some thought that Turkey--regrettably they are not a member of the EU, but we must remember that at the time Turkey was admitted it was really at the height of the cold war. NATO made the decision that it was imperative. In 1952, Europe was facing the pinnacle of that tragic period, and Turkey brought with them an enormous military strength which was proven.

Mr. WARNER. Madam President, the Senator is absolutely right. On the southern flank. It was in NATO's interest at that time to admit Turkey. Turkey, of course, throughout their participation in NATO, has been in the forefront of strength on the southern flank as it is today. It is my hope--indeed, my expectation--that someday the EU will have a realization of that contribution and consider their membership. But I don't think this argument that NATO has admitted nations without EU membership carries any weight in the face of the historical context in which Turkey was admitted. 
I wish to engage my colleague from New York. I am privileged to be a cosponsor. 
The struggle today of the three nations that we are considering for membership is not a military one. There is no threat. The administration candidly admits that. I think the Senator from Delaware would admit that there is no significant military threat. Russia today, in terms of its land forces, engaged them in the battle of Chechnya. That dragged on for an almost interminable period. It really ended by virtually exhaustion of both sides militarily as opposed to a military victory. Certainly they don't have the forces to mount any aggression in the context of a land attack on the three nations the subject of which we are discussing today. The military put it aside. It is an economic struggle all through the former Warsaw Pact to have their democracies, to have their participation in a free market system. 
Along comes the conferring of NATO membership, presumably, on these three nations. Immediately, in my judgment, that gives them a very significant advantage over the others who are waiting for admission into NATO and the world market. It is not unlike the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. You put your money in our bank. It is guaranteed by the Federal Government. They can advertise in the world market. We are now a member of NATO. You build your plant here. Invest your dollars in our countries. It is a lot safer than it would be in, say, Romania, Slovenia, Bulgaria, or other areas of the world. It is going to give them an enormous advantage economically over those nations patiently waiting in line. I think it will breed friction. That friction could, indeed, involve confrontation, hopefully not with the use of arms. 
But I ask my distinguished colleague if he agrees with that thought.

Mr. WARNER. We thank the distinguished Senator from Delaware for bringing up that point. 
But, if I may further engage my friend and colleague, if I had to list my concerns in this debate on this amendment and the others today, cost always comes back and rings in my ear, as well as the security of the men and women of the Armed Forces of the United States, who in years forward will be a part of our NATO force. But let's go to cost. 
I have said it before. The distinguished Senator from Iowa has said it. There is a blank check involved in these votes today. EU membership would be a way to evaluate the economic ability of these three countries to meet their financial obligations to NATO. Should those financial obligations fall short, Madam President, guess who is going to pick it up. The United States of America, in participation with nations and other countries, by virtue of the EU giving their imprimatur on these countries will be further assurance that they will have economic productivity and the like to generate the dollars to meet their requirements to pay the bill to upgrade their militaries, militaries which today are largely equipped with old Soviet equipment, which has to be replaced if you are to have interoperability with the NATO forces. All of that is going to be a very, very hefty bill. I would like to see the EU pronounce their economic viability as nations, which gives us a certain amount of assurance in return that the American taxpayer will not be picking up a greater and greater portion of their obligation to modernize their forces.

<DOCNO>105-warner-va-16-19980430</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I point out in the beginning that this amendment does not affect the decision with respect to Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic, nor does this amendment concede what I believe is the right thing to do in voting against the admission of those countries. But this amendment is sent to the desk simply because, in recognition of the reality, through conversations personally between myself and many, many Members of this Chamber, indeed, with the President and the Secretary of State and many others, the likelihood that the resolution of ratification will be approved. 
Given that reality, I think it is imperative that this body have before it an amendment, which has just been sent to the desk, which indicates there will be a pause, so to speak, a strategic pause of 3 years only before our country, our President, whoever will be President at that point in time, can agree to accession of additional countries. 
Mr. President, I established in my opening statement my strong allegiance to NATO in the past, and now and forevermore that I am privileged to be a Member of this body. I said the importance of America to have a voice, and how this treaty for 49 years has surpassed the expectations of all and remains the most important military document apart from our own Constitution in many ways, and that is why I ask for these 3 years. I will recite the reasons, one, two and three. 
Should not another President duly elected by the people of the United States have a voice in further modifications by virtue of further accession of additional nations to this alliance? 
If the Good Lord gives me the strength and the breath in the consideration of that next Presidential election, I will do everything within my power to make sure that is an issue that is debated among those candidates seeking that high office. Regrettably, in the last election very little attention was given to national security policy. But the world is rapidly changing. The world is becoming a more dangerous place. Indeed, in the next election I will do my part, as I am sure others will likewise, to see that the security policy of our Nation and the free nations of the world will be a subject of discussion in that election. 
I think the next President should be given the opportunity to assess the merits and such disadvantages as may arise by virtue of the accession of three more nations before we leap forward under pressure, which will be unrelenting. That pressure will begin the day 1 year from now when these three nations will be accessed. That pressure will begin the day after. The bugles will sound. The march will begin to bring in other nations perhaps numbering as many as nine. 
I say to my colleagues, should not the next President be given the opportunity to study the record, make an assessment, and then give his advice or her advice, as the case may be, to the people of the United States? 
That is my first reason for asking for reasonable delay of but 3 years. This amendment will avoid that stampede. This amendment in fairness will say to the other nations it is not only to the advantage of the NATO countries but, indeed, it is to the advantage of the other nations to let this experiment ferment for a period to determine the purity, or the lack thereof, of the decision. 
Then I turn to a second reason. That is the cost. Whether it is $1.5 billion over the next 2 years or $125 billion, there will be no piece of evidence before this body which has sound credibility as to the cost associated with accession of these three nations. 
This afternoon we will have further amendments on the question of cost. But we are dealing from an unknown. NATO is studying the question of cost, and is studying the question of the degree to which these nations must rebuild and modernize their military. But those studies will not be available until later this summer. Yet our vote will be taken before the sun falls on this day on two very vital pieces of information, totally lacking. We have, therefore, a blank check. We do not know the cost now. We will not know for months even the opinion of the NATO Council, which is really the organization that can best evaluate these costs. But there is credible evidence on both sides. The range of costs go from $1.5 billion over 2 years to $125 billion. 
I want to touch a sensitive nerve among my distinguished colleagues. Those listening and those advising Members might just take their pencil and put a little asterisk by this point. 
America is in its 14th year of decline of funding to the U.S. Armed Forces of the United States, a collective decision by a series of Presidents. This is not a political argument. We have irrefutable evidence that our Armed Forces today are behind in their modernization program. They are stretched too thin. They are over committed worldwide. We see that in the retention rates. There is all sorts of mounting evidence that we are asking our military to do the same as they have boldly and bravely for years with less and less--less in dollars, less time at home with their families, and with fewer and fewer pieces of equipment. 
Shipbuilding: A handful of combat ships every year in the budget. We are rapidly approaching a Navy that could be well below the 300-plus, a few ships of today, in the year 2000. We, a maritime nation faced with that small Navy. Dollars from the American taxpayer profits have been, are being, and will be committed to these three nations. 
We have been contributing money regularly to the establishment and refurbishment of their military at the same time we are denying to our military what, in my opinion, are the necessary dollars to perform their mission. We will be taking those dollars and putting them through NATO into other nations, the three that are our subject, for their military, to help them come up so that they have the capability to take on a full partnership commensurate with their size in the NATO alliance. Think about it. You are taking from your military and giving to another military. 
Now, as a part of the consideration of this year's military authorization bill, there will be discussion, indeed, there could be legislation, about a future base closure. That should ring a bell--a future round of base closures in the United States. That should get the attention of some Members. 
Secretary of Defense Cohen has made an admirable and, in my judgment, a credible appeal to the Congress of the United States to address that question and address it now. If we do not, he has little alternative but to literally starve a base, turn off the current, transfer the people, and leave the buildings standing unattended because he is properly exercising his judgment that the dollars are needed for modernization, the dollars are needed for the ever-rising number of commitments beyond our shores rather than keeping in place a base that no longer contributes to our overall national security. 
Tough decision. What do you say, colleagues, when you go home to defend a base closing in your State, as you will do and as you are duty bound to, and at the same time we are contributing money to build new bases in these three countries, and unless my amendment passes I daresay in other countries in a very short period of time. 
They have to modernize more so than the United States. They have to take their old infrastructure which was designed for Soviet military tactics, take their old tanks and artillery pieces which are, by and large, old Soviet weaponry and modernize so they have interoperability as a nation with NATO. 
That is a further drain on the American taxpayer at the very time when in your State the next round of base closures may have a potential impact. And you will be fairly asked by your constituents: do you mean to tell me they are closing our beloved hometown base that has been here defending America all these years and you are helping to build bases abroad? Do you not have a conflict? 
Those are questions that are fairly to be asked in the not too distant future if we allow a stampede of three now and three in the next 18 months and three thereafter, up to as many as 28 nations potentially to join NATO. 
We are also asked to approve this measure without full knowledge as to the strategic concept of what NATO is and is not going to do in the years to come. We are operating under a 1991 doctrine today. Listen to the Secretary of State, as the distinguished Senator from Missouri pointed out yesterday, who desires to expand the missions of NATO far beyond the borders of their nations, to be involved in the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. There may be some merit. But should we not fully have in mind before we begin to add country after country what is to be the mission of NATO? 
Ironically, it is not until 1 year from this month, April, at the summit at which these three nations will be admitted when NATO will finalize the doctrine for the future. Yet, we are asked to vote today to change the bases of this treaty by virtue of new membership not knowing the risks that will face the men and women of the U.S. Armed Forces as well as the other NATO nations. I ask you, is that the way to do business? Not in my judgment. And that is why I say if three are a reality, then we should stop and study a reasonable period of time. Let another President, let the American people in the context of the next election, let the American people at that time have a careful examination of what NATO brings forth a year from today as to the new mission and 
adoption. Those are just reasonable requests. And time, and time alone, can establish the record on which those important decisions can be made. Three years, in my judgment, is not an unreasonable period of time. 
Lastly, I refer to Russia, not in the sense that I fear Russia, not in the sense that Russia--and I have said this consistently--should have any veto power as to any decision which is in the security interests of the United States of America. The Founding Act was established, I think, as a quid pro quo for the accession of these three nations. Russia signed on. But there is mounting evidence that you cross over and begin another three, and particularly when you get to the Balkans, all the arguments which we have heard in favor of voting yea tonight will fall. I believe this Chamber will resonate with deep concern as reflected by the instabilities in Russia that could exist in the year 2000 when they are moving on possibly to another political structure, another President. There is a great deal of uncertainty in Russia today--economically, politically, and militarily--in their struggle to survive as a fledgling democracy, as they struggle to survive in a free-market world, and I think the next President should be given the opportunity to make an assessment as to the measure of threat posed by Russia in the context of any further accession of new nations to this most valuable of all treaties. Time and time alone can achieve that purpose. 
So they should not have a veto. We do not act out of fear. But we act out of reality, that that is the only nation that possesses weaponry which poses a direct threat to the United States of America; namely, their strategic forces. You cannot be unmindful of that fact. 
Therefore, I think a period of 3 years is appropriate to allow another President, to allow the studies to be performed, to allow the American people to better understand the value of this NATO alliance and what should be done for the future, and, therefore, I respectfully ask my colleagues to consider to vote in favor of the Warner-Moynihan amendment for a 3-year moratorium. 
Mr. President, other Senators have been waiting patiently. I wish to continue my remarks and will do so momentarily. I know the distinguished Senator from New Jersey has been here for some time. Therefore, I yield him 10 minutes off the time under the control of the Senator from Virginia.

Last night, in the course of deliberations on time agreement, that was stated, but there may be some feeling--if I could get the attention of the Senator from Delaware, I hope that we can have an up-or-down vote on my amendment. That would be my hope.

Mr. WARNER. I thank the Senator. I say to my distinguished colleague from Delaware, believe me, there has been no stronger supporter of NATO, I say with humility, than the Senator from Virginia throughout my 19th year in the Senate. I am sure that colleagues' comments were serious, but with a note of jest. 
NATO is so vital to the United States of America. It gives us the legitimate presence with our military in Europe. It gives us the legitimacy of a strong voice in Europe. Indeed, this country has responded, with others, in two major wars to preserve the integrity of Europe.

Mr. WARNER. Just one sentence and I will yield. There has been a historical--over a 100 years--inability of the major nations of Europe to live in peace with one another. Indeed that is the principal purpose of NATO--the U.S. presence, both with military there, with a strong voice so as to ensure the tranquility this treaty has preserved for 49 years. It has exceeded every expectation of the drafters of the treaty and those who promoted and supported it in these 49 years. It is a magnificent document. I have fought hard with others to preserve the integrity of that document. Does the Senator wish to say a word?

Should it be the wisdom of this body that if three additional members are admitted, article V becomes the very heart of the action that will be taken by this distinguished body before the close of this day.

Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, to accommodate the Senate on the schedule that Mr. Smith and I are working on, from the standpoint of the proponents of my amendment, following Mr. Dorgan, it would be desirable to have the Senator from Minnesota, Mr. Wellstone, follow for a period of 5 minutes, and then Mr. Smith would care for about 3 or 4 minutes. Now, there is time within which the opposition, of course, will want to intervene, and we certainly will go back and forth on this. 
We also wish to accommodate the senior Senator from Alaska. He has two amendments, is that correct, I say to the Senator?

Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, 19 years ago when I was privileged to come to the U.S. Senate, the leadership had just a year or so before passed from one of our most distinguished Members, the senior Senator from Montana, Mike Mansfield. A few weeks ago in the old Senate Chamber, at age 95, he held forth in a magnificent review of history of the Senate without a flaw, without a quiver in his voice, and with an expression on his face that conveyed the strength and the confidence that that man had. 
I missed the opportunity to serve with him. But one of his major goals in the concluding years of his distinguished career was to come to this floor, time and time again, and call for reduction of our commitment in troop size and financial commitment to NATO, saying that the job had been done, it was time to come home and to apply those dollars to the men and women of the Armed Forces of the United States. 
That was the majority leader of the U.S. Senate. I see my distinguished colleague from New York. He recalls those speeches very well.

Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, saying that he spoke from some experience--having proudly worn the uniform of all three branches, by the way. 
That could recur again in the minds of the American people, that we have spent enough, we have contributed enough, and the time has come for us to reduce our presence in Europe--which I think would be an absolute tragedy. I would fight against it, as I did in my earlier days in the U.S. Senate when, time and time again, Senator Jackson, Senator Stennis, Senator Tower, Senator Goldwater, Senator Thurmond would marshal the forces of those of us who had just joined the Senate on the floor to stop and ask the Senate not to cut NATO's budget. We felt it should be an orderly transition down in size. And that took place. 
I just bring up this history to say that once again the taxpayers of this country, when they begin to look at the cost attributed to the accession of these three nations, costs which will be diverted in dollars from our own needs of the Armed Forces today, costs for the refurbishment and building of new bases in these three countries at the very time when we are going to shrink and continue to shrink the base structure in the United States--all 
of this to say that the magnitude of the decision to access countries to this treaty is just an important one. We are acting without full knowledge as to the future mission of NATO. We are acting without full knowledge of the cost of having these three nations build their military up to where they are a positive--not a negative, a positive--contribution to NATO. 
I say with deep humility and respect of my colleagues, why not give America 3 years within which to study? Why not, I say to the leadership of the Senate, allow another President to give his or her wisdom to this question of whether additional countries should come in, preceded by, I hope, an active debate in the next Presidential election on the entire issue of the security interests of the United States using as a focal point NATO and the experience gained, in all probability, by accessing these three nations. 
We owe no less to that future President, for he or she will have to incorporate in their budgets the costs of new accessions, will have to incorporate in their budgets the diversion of such funds as may be allocated to additional nations. 
Furthermore, the changing face of Europe today from one of cold war to one our military leaders now refer to as instability--instability is the enemy in Europe and elsewhere in the world, largely because of the uncertainty associated with weapons of mass destruction and, in the wake of the new democracies, the instability as it relates to ethnic problems, religious problems and all those associated with these new nations trying to seek strength as democracies politically and strength economically in a one-world free market. But it is the whole range of instabilities and associated conflict with which we have had very little experience, other than Bosnia, possibly Kosovo. Should we not have the opportunity to study what are the requirements associated with these new instabilities? Learn from experience. Add up the costs in Bosnia. There have been many billions of dollars now contributed to bring about peace in that region. 
I listened to our distinguished senior Senator from West Virginia talk about the policy in Bosnia. In many ways, I associate myself with his remarks. But we need--we need--that learning curve to make such important decisions as would be involved in adding more nations as members of NATO. Indeed the other----

This 3-year moratorium gives a perfectly logical, understandable tool to the current President of the United States, indeed a future President, to withstand the stampede that I predict will occur if this is not put in place. Mr. President, I yield.

Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I addressed that on the floor of the Senate before. I think it was an unwise movement by the President. We all have great compassion for those three states, the courage of their people, their desire to affiliate more and more with the Western World. But to have held out that hope which, once it is translated from the United States across the ocean into the states and down to the people, almost is equivalent to an absolute commitment to see that it is going to happen. 
That is precisely why I am concerned about leaving open the opportunity for new accessions to begin tomorrow unless the 3-year moratorium, which is a reasonable period for study, is put in place. 
I close with, once again, do we not have that obligation to the American taxpayers who pay the costs associated, do we not have that obligation to the men and women of our Armed Forces who will proudly wear their uniforms as a part of the NATO force to have 
 clarity with respect to future missions, which we will not have until 1 year hence, April of 1999? 
I say to my colleagues, let's just pause and take stock and think about the seriousness of the decisions we are about to make and consider that it is not unreasonable to allow 3 years of experience to transpire to make future decisions regarding other nations. Mr. President, I yield the floor and yield back my time.

We do not have a firm estimate of the costs and therefore in all probability there will be an expense to the American taxpayer associated with including these three countries. Nothing in this amendment precludes the Senate acting on the three countries, the subject of this principal debate. It simply says let us wait a reasonable period, 3 years, to get an experience curve to make the subsequent decision if it is the judgment of the President at that time that we proceed with further Member negotiations, giving us firmer cost estimates, a clearer definition of the mission to be undertaken and the risk to be assumed by the men and women who wear the uniform of our country.

Mr. WARNER. First, I want to add a fact. I consulted with the distinguished Senator from Texas, and she said that she, in turn, has consulted with Ambassador Hunter, who preceded the Ambassador you just referred to, the incumbent--and, by the way, 
the incumbent, we all know, was associated with the Senate and was a staffer at one time. He has risen through the ranks and has now gotten due recognition and was given that very important post. He carries with him an extraordinary corporate knowledge of this institution and the general subject of NATO. So I think the appointment is a good one. 
But Ambassador Hunter gave some technical advice in the preparation of the amendment. I read the language in paragraph 1 down there, `between and among allies . . .' and so on. I sought clarification of one or two words, and I was advised Ambassador Hunter was the source of some of that language. I am not suggesting that Hunter said this is the right thing to do, but at least he gave some technical advice. 
The amendment is so straightforward. It simply says we will take--and many of us have grave concerns about the missions of NATO as they are now being formulated--and they, regrettably, will not be made known until a year hence, at the very time we are asked to vote. I have dwelled on that point and will continue tomorrow. 
The point is that I think the Senator is entitled to ask for the support of her colleagues, not to simply table it. If the NAC turns it down, so be it, because as this new definition of missions comes out, there could well be provisions--and I will not prejudge it--that deal with the ever-increasing number of ethnic, religious, and border disputes. Speaking for myself, I want NATO's participation, at the very minimum, in trying to resolve certainly by force of arms. So this seeks to have maybe some tribunal within NAC that listens to the parties and hears them out. 
Madam President, as the wise Senator from Delaware knows, Greece and Turkey have had some very fundamental disagreements for many years. As a matter of fact, one person whom I respect, with a corporate knowledge, told me that the reason they were given NATO membership was to avoid a conflict between the two of them. I am not suggesting the credibility of that statement, but it was made. And NATO has, in many ways, arbitrated through the years, and continues to arbitrate in some measure, this longstanding dispute as it relates to Cyprus. 
The point is, in that sense, NATO is arbitrating the very types of disputes that the Senator from Texas had in mind. I think it is within the purview of this very important deliberation we are having now to simply ask Senators to allow the amendment to be passed for the sole purpose of laying down a proposal.

Mr. WARNER. Madam President, if I could join this distinguished group and respond to everybody, the Senator from Texas is asking for a very simple procedural act. And I agree with my colleague from Delaware; when an ambassador goes in with a proposal, it has to have the force and effect of not a bad idea but that we conscientiously think is correct. 
Now, I remember Manfred Werner; we all do. What a magnificent person. He was NATO, and no one in this Chamber, particularly John Tower, the late John Tower, could express higher regard for Werner than yourself, myself, and others. But the point is, we don't know what NATO is going to look like after we accept 12 nations, going from 16 to 28, and bringing in a realm of geography. 
We understand the Cyprus dispute. It is age old. We understand how two senior military officers assigned to NATO could come into Manfred Werner's office and sit down and informally discuss it. But I look upon a proliferation of problems of unknown--of unknown description, and it seems to me that perhaps we should address the potential for far more problems than ever envisioned as we begin to access country after country after country. 
Therefore, I think it would be advisable to explore the possibility of having some procedure by which, hopefully, the use of arms could be avoided, or if arms were being used in a dispute, that somehow NATO, with a wrestful and forceful hand, could put it to rest.

Mr. WARNER. I thank my colleague. I am just going back to read the charter, article V, and this is the heart and soul of NATO. 
It says that parties agree that an armed attack against one or more of them in Europe or North America shall be considered an attack against them all, and consequently they agree that if such an armed attack occurs, each of them, in exercise of the right of individual or collective self-defense, recognized by article V of the Charter of the United Nations, will assist the party or parties so attacked by taking forthwith, individually and in concert with other parties, such action as it deems necessary, including use of armed force to restore and maintain the security of the North Atlantic area. 
Now, it was very clear when this was written that we envisioned the Soviet Union as the threat. That was the purpose of it. And now with the demise of the Soviet Union and the threats now being fractured into many places and of many types, we are trying to determine what is the future mission of NATO. 
One of my great regrets is that we are proceeding with this matter of including three new states at a time when NATO itself has not determined exactly what is to be the mission subsequent to the 1991 statement to that effect.

Mr. WARNER. I direct my comment to the distinguished Senator who is proposing the amendment, Senator Kyl, which will now be the subject of further debate. In particular, on page 1 entitled `common threats,' it says, `NATO members will face common threats to security in the post-cold war environment, including . . .'--and on page 5 it says--I guess that was 4. It says, `. . . conflict in the North Atlantic area stemming from ethnic and religious enmity, the revival of historic disputes, or the actions of undemocratic leaders.' 
I find that far afield from the NATO charter itself. Indeed, it is somewhat far afield from the 1991 restatement of the mission of NATO. Speaking for myself, I have grave concerns about NATO incorporating in any future document the fact that it stands ready to stamp out ethnic and religious enmities and the revival of historic disputes. That is the very thing we are involved in now in Bosnia. I just don't have time to get into it, but I would like to have a clearer explanation from the proponent of this amendment as to what he intended by the inclusion of this paragraph in this amendment. Basically, I wanted to support the amendment, but I cannot support a document that says NATO is going to take it upon itself to put out civil wars and religious enmities and ethnic disputes. I am concerned about the future of American servicepersons and that the men and women who will proudly wear the uniform of the United States and be an integral part of NATO would be subject, under NATO commanders, to go into these areas and meet such conflicts.

Mr. WARNER. The mix of NATO is the collective security of member nations and the collective security of the continent that they occupy. That has been the traditional mission. Now, you are recognizing these are threats, and I agree they are becoming more and more threats--religious and ethnic strife. But do you intend, by this document, to say that that should be written in as a mission of NATO, to stand ready to intervene in these types of conflicts? Or are you just recognizing them as potential threats and subsequently, depending on the magnitude of the threat, the NATO commanders, and the NAC, North Atlantic Council, can determine if in fact it threatens the collective security of a nation or the nations?

Mr. WARNER. The Senator from Texas and I wish to discuss the capacity to respond to common threats. NATO's continued success requires a credible military capability to deter and respond to common threats. And when you look at the definition of common threats, it includes historic disputes, religious enmities, ethnic and the like. I fear that, although the Senator in his statement seemed to clarify that this is not to be a mission, somehow the language, I believe, is somewhat tangled. I yield to my colleague from Texas.

Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield, I think we could settle this with two sentences. Do I understand from the sponsors--and you being a cosponsor of the amendment --that nothing in the amendment expands beyond what is stated in the 1991 doctrine, paragraph 10, which the Senator from Delaware just read? If it is to be interpreted as saying that remains as the goal, then I am comfortable with the amendment. But as drawn, largely due to the defining language, I have a problem with it in its present form. 
I agree with the Senator from Delaware, if that is to be the mission in the future, a consistent one with paragraph 10.

Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the Senator is a little swift in saying that is covered. Look, in paragraph 10, in referring to such disputes as ethnic and religious enmity, they say this response: `These tensions which may result as long as they remain limited should not directly threaten the security and territorial integrity of members of the alliance,' and therefore NATO stays out.

Your question is correct, but I say to my good friend that while there is no fixed-in-law obligation for an increased contribution on behalf of the United States to these three potential new members, there is, indeed, a moral, and it seems to me that that moral obligation will come into play very strongly. If for any reason their economies cannot support their quotient of final costs allocated among the three, I am certain the United States would be a participant in picking it up.

Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, if I might, if I could restate what the Senator is trying to achieve with his amendment, is simply to say when NATO establishes the military requirements of three new nations, the costs associated with each of the nations and their ability to reach that requirement, the U.S. States taxpayer will pay no more than 25 percent of that cost, and 75 percent is then to be allocated among the remainder of the nations. It is as simple as that in clear English language.

Mr. WARNER. I thank my distinguished leader and very dear friend for his kind remarks. But I would say that if the issue of sufficient time to debate was ever an issue, then it is long since to be put aside because, as the distinguished leader recited very carefully this morning, the Senate has given a lot of very conscientious deliberation to this issue, and now we have had a recess of some several weeks during which a number of colleagues, I say to the leader, and others, have had the opportunity to reflect adequately, in my judgment, on the seriousness of this question. It is time that we proceed today. I am confident at such time as the Senate reaches the vote this week, there will be no voice in opposition based on the absence of an adequate opportunity to consider it. So I thank the distinguished majority leader, and indeed the minority leader who collaborated in seeing that the Senate had adequate time. 
We have our differences, Mr. President. And I should propound a question or two to my distinguished colleague momentarily, the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee. But first I think it is important--Senator Moynihan and I have joined in our collaborative efforts to bring to the attention of the Senate our concerns in the form of two amendments. 
I will say, although not present at the moment on the floor, there are many others who have joined with us. Mr. Smith of New Hampshire, I spoke with him just moments ago. He will be joining in the debate this afternoon--Mr. Harkin. 
It is truly, Mr. President, a bipartisan effort of some Senators who spent many long hours working together and discussing this issue very thoroughly. There is not to be found in this debate, in my judgment, a single element of partisanship. It is truly a debate of conscience.

Mr. WARNER. I shall read briefly from it the cost estimate. 
The resolution would ratify protocols to the North Atlantic Treaty of 1949 that would admit Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic as members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). Expanding the alliance would require the United States to contribute additional funding for equipment or capabilities shared by members of NATO. CBO estimates that those costs would initially be in the tens of millions of dollars and would reach about $100 million a year after four or five years. Ultimately, the United States and its NATO allies have considerable discretion in how to implement the protocols and, therefore, in the costs that would be incurred. 
Mr. President, I think it is essential that the Senate spend a great deal of time during the course of this debate on costs. Right now, the United States spends about one-fourth of the costs of the entire NATO--let me repeat that--the taxpayers of the United States spend one-fourth of the entire cost of NATO, a membership of 16 nations, and now we are asked to add three more.

Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the Senator is so correct in his observation. 
In the course of addressing the press the other day, I said we are literally trying to create, through this expansion and the indefinite new missions, a 911 organization--`Call if there is a problem'--dial-a-cop, dial-a-soldier. 
Mr. President, the American public has no idea what is taking place with regard to the expenditure of their tax dollars, with regard to the commitment of their sons and daughters for future NATO service. That is why it is so important we focus on the very point the distinguished Senator from New York raises. 
There is an amendment to be considered by the Senate, I presume shortly, by the distinguished Senator from Missouri, Mr. Ashcroft. I am joined as a cosponsor. It raises the precise question with regard to the future missions--I think we should pass that amendment--the basis of which would be to reestablish the original purpose of NATO as a collective defense of the member nations and not to go beyond the border unless it is clearly a dispute that puts in jeopardy the security of one or more members of NATO. 
I hope the Senate will adopt that amendment, together with others, because we cannot allow this organization to become a response unit to any crisis in that part of the world. We will have lost its purpose, a purpose which has been magnificently served for over 50 years. 
I challenge any Senator to point out another military alliance, another military treaty, that has served the American people, that has served Europe, that has served the cause of peace in half the world better than this. If it works, it works well; why try to fix it? We would not turn our back on a clear act of naked aggression against these three nations that are being considered for membership. I am certain that there would be an alliance probably consisting of the principal members of NATO that would come to their defense. 
We see a similar alliance today in war-torn Bosnia. I, for one, feel that that is a conflict which represents the type of conflicts the world is most likely to experience in the years to come. I just made a trip to the Caspian Sea recently. That region has potentially one of the largest oil and gas reserves in the world, a world which is becoming desperate for more energy resources. But the nations that surround it are still embroiled internally, and with their bordering nations, in old ethnic and religious hatreds that go back, some, for centuries. 
If I may depart for a moment, when I look at the magnificence of the United States of America, just over 100 or so years ago this Nation was torn apart by a cruel, devastating civil war, but we put it behind us, we have gone on. We took a north and a south and brought them together and reestablished ourselves militarily and economically to where we are the strongest nation in the world today. And to the extent that we refer to that tragic period, it is done only now with serious, contemplative reflection on history, which remains perhaps the single most studied chapter in history in contemporary America. I know my State, in which the majority of the battles of this region were fought, is host to hundreds of thousands of visitors every year. But the point I wish to make is that we put it behind us, we reconciled our differences, and we went on to become the strongest nation in the world. 
Somehow, that is not an achievement that so many other nations of the world can seem to reach, and they still are embroiled in conflict. That is why I certainly am going to join in the debate and focus on this strategic concept of what the future missions of NATO are, and do it very carefully, and hopefully, even if these three nations are permitted to join, restrict it to what was a collective defense of the individual nations. 
Mr. President, I just want to ask my distinguished chairman here, the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, What is his view as to the costs and what are the basic facts on which he relies in bringing forth this treaty at this time to the Senate?

The Senator raised an issue that caused me great concern, and that is the nuclear aspect and how in his State so much valuable work is now being done and has always been done on this question. 
My understanding, having met with a number of Members of the Russian Duma--and I believe the Senator was present at the time that Members of the Duma came informally before the Armed Services Committee--there is a considerable doubt as to whether or not they will ratify the current arms control arrangements because of the question of NATO enlargement.

Mr. WARNER. If my colleague would allow me, first I wish to thank the Senator. He has been an absolute leader on this issue from the very beginning, and at the beginning there were fewer than there are now. We are fortunate there is a growing number beginning to look at it from the perspective that the distinguished Senator from New Hampshire and I have had for some period of time. 
Just today, I was privileged to have lunch with the mayor of St. Petersburg, Russia. I was on his right, and to my immediate right was the deputy chief of mission here of the Russian Embassy. Now, never should the United States allow Russia to veto any of our foreign policy. We always must do those things that are in our strategic interest. 
But I join the distinguished Senator from New Hampshire in his view that there is no rush to do this. It is a window of opportunity that Russia has seized upon to try to solidify their movement toward a solid democracy, try to solidify their struggle in the free market system of the world, at the same time they are dealing with tremendous political instability at home both in elective office and indeed in law enforcement. Both of these persons told me, formally in the discussion over luncheon not over 2 hours ago, it is of grave concern to them individually, of the timing of this move. 
I thank the Senator.

Mr. WARNER. I thank the Senator from New Hampshire because this is the type of debate the Senate should participate in and it is a good one. I will respond directly. The United States of America had to rescue Europe in 1917 and 1918. How well I remember; my father served as a doctor in the front lines of those battles. The United States came to the rescue again in World War II, and that is clearly in the minds of all of us. We have not had to respond with significant force in these 50 years for the very purpose that NATO has served as a collective defense, and to deter--to discourage, to put it in a layman's term--an attack on any of its members. 
Second, the United States is there because we need, as a nation, a presence in Europe, and that presence of leadership, both in a military form of NATO and an economic and every other way, gives us the justification for a strong voice of leadership in Europe--NATO. So it has served a purpose and will continue to serve a purpose if we do not dilute it, as the Senator from New Hampshire has ably said.

Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, if I can make a historical observation. You raise the passions by saying we didn't come to the defense of Poland. It was September of 1939 when Hitler directed his forces across the border with an element of surprise with the panzer divisions and went against the Polish cavalry, in large measure, with lances. If you have never seen the footage of that battle, it is extraordinary.

Mr. WARNER. Subsequently, Stalin and Hitler partitioned and cruelly crucified the Polish people. But at that time, I say to my good friend from Delaware, the United States was holding its maneuvers with dump trucks acting as tanks and with wooden rifles or broomsticks. We were not the superpower, nor the military strength, as we are today. 
I say to the Senator and my good friend, don't try to raise the passions that this country turned its back on Poland then and would now do so. The keyword that the Senator from New Hampshire used is `instability.' And where is that instability? It is not in Poland, it is not in Hungary, it is not in the Czech Republic, but with the Russian nation struggling to work with democracy and an economic free-market system and the problems at home of the succession of Yeltsin. That is the instability. And, I might add, if we are going to use the military argument, the Red Army barely put down a minor revolution in Chechnya, which it had to fight for over a year, using every piece of modern equipment that they have, and barely did they subdue that small segment of the former Soviet Union.

Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today to submit legislation to honor one of the greatest men in American history. Many of my esteemed colleagues have joined me in a resolution paying tribute to the life of George Washington. However, I believe the year 1999, the bicentennial of Washington's death, may be further consecrated. Therefore, I am introducing a Sense of the Senate Resolution calling upon the Citizen's Stamp Advisory Committee to issue a stamp which celebrates the leadership and courage possessed by Washington. 
The life of this great patriot is an extraordinary parable of nationalism and a belief in the power of a republican form of government. Upon emerging victorious in the Revolutionary War, General Washington laid aside the instruments of destruction to craft a young nation. Discarding any intimations of personal glory, Washington spurned the title of Monarch and instead chose to model the new country on the ancient principles of democracy. He was truly a `First among Equals'. Washington was very much aware of the momentous nature of the first presidential term for our emerging democracy. He wrote,  
I walk on untrodden ground. There is scarcely any part of my conduct which may not hereafter be drawn into precedent. 
We must, as a Nation, recognize the value of responsibility. Washington shouldered the responsibility of his two terms in office with grace and dignity, ever aware that he would be an example for countries around the world for time eternal. Through a heightened cognizance of the actions and beliefs of Washington, we can convey the true meaning of service to our Nation. I ask my colleagues what better way to honor such a man, than to devote a year to honoring his life. In this pursuit, it is fitting to request that a George Washington stamp be issued in 1999. Let us reflect upon the tradition of character of our Nation, inaugurated by our first President. Washington will remain, `First in War, first in Peace, and first in the hearts of his Countrymen.' I look forward to the swift passage of this legislation.

Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I am privileged to be the chairman of the Subcommittee on Transportation and Infrastructure of the full Committee on Environment and Public Works. I have been involved in the Patent and Trademark Office space consolidation for the past 4 years. However, this has had a much longer history of review. In August of 1995, GSA, the Department of Commerce, and the PTO negotiated with OMB on alternatives for proceeding to consolidation and the placement of the PTO's expiring leases scheduled for 1996. The administration determined that there were insufficient funds available in the President's budget for the foreseeable future to pursue these alternatives of direct Federal construction or an equity lease. 
Let me repeat, Mr. President: That history has shown that often construction is less expensive than the option of leasing. There is no mystery here. The problem is, we do not have $250 million to construct such a building. Budget constraints dictate a lease in this instance. 
For this reason OMB then authorized the General Services Administration to transmit a prospectus, pursuant to the Public Buildings Act, to the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee and the Senate Environment and Public Works Committees requesting authorization to acquire a competitively procured, 20-year operating lease for 1,989,116 occupiable square feet (osf) to consolidate the PTO on a Northern Virginia site within boundaries extending from the Potomac River along the Dulles corridor. Once again, let me stress that this is a competitively procured lease. 
Mr. President, the prospectus was approved by the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works on October 24, 1995, and the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure on November 16, 1995. The Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works carefully considered the need for the facility, various alternatives, and the costs of each approach before authorizing the lease procurement to be conducted by the GSA for the PTO. Further, both Committees directed GSA to amend its Source Selection approach to provide `that any evaluation used for such acquisition considers proximity to public transportation, including MetroRail, to be a factor as important as any other non cost factor.' 
I have been assured by the PTO, Senator Gregg, that prior to the issuance of the Solicitation for Offerors (SFO), the PTO undertook a detailed analysis and review of case law, news articles, and recent Federal acquisitions and leases such as: the Internal Revenue Service, the Federal Communications Commission, and the Ronald Reagan Building etc. to identify potential problems with the PTO procurement. 
In short, the analysis that the Senator seeks was performed by the Administration in developing the prospectus, was reviewed by both the House and Senate authorizing committees, and approved in 1995. Furthermore, as I have already stated, the PTO and the Administration are continuing to revalidate that analysis. 
Mr. President, to date, all analysis of this procurement has shown that under the current budget scenario, this procurement is needed by the PTO, and is in the best interest of the taxpayers. PTO currently 
resides in expired holdover leases. This is an untenable and costly situation that must be addressed immediately. 
Senator Gregg will now join in a colloquy. 
As we discussed, am I correct that the current language as drafted excludes comparison in the requested report between leasing and federal construction?

Mr. WARNER. Finally, I am concerned that the study comparing the cost versus the benefit of relocating to a new facility compares `apples to apples'. Therefore, it is important that such things as the cost of space required to accommodate new staff at the PTO's existing locations; the costs of bringing existing facilities into compliance with current, not grandfathered, codes for life safety and accessibility for the disabled, and the costs of providing amenities such as day care facilities be considered as part of the costs of PTO's remaining in its current space. Do you agree?

Mr. WARNER. I have taken a very active role in this matter because of the wonderful, loyal, dedicated service of the thousands of employees of PTO. I think our Federal Government owes them no less than the opportunity to have a new facility to perform their valuable work, and I hasten to say this building will largely be financed not by Federal taxpayers funds but by funds derived from the sevices performed by the people. 
I yield the floor.

The Senator from Michigan is present and I am perfectly willing to yield the floor should he desire to seek recognition. It would be my hope, Mr. President, that following the Senator from Michigan, the Senator from Virginia be recognized, and I make this unanimous consent request for the purpose of giving remarks.

Mr. WARNER. Now, Mr. President, as we all know, the President has announced his goal of welcoming these first three nations into NATO to mark the alliance's 50th anniversary, scheduled for April 4 of next year. Several weeks ago, the President submitted to the Senate the Protocol to the North Atlantic Treaty on the Accession of Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic. For the United States, under the `advise and consent clause' of our Constitution, two-thirds of this body must give their concurrence to the President's request. Likewise, the new admissions must be agreed to by the other 15 nations in NATO. Presently, Canada, Denmark and Norway have, in their respective Parliaments, ratified these Protocols. 
If the Senate agrees, this would be the first of perhaps many expansion rounds to include the nations of Central Europe and some of the nations of the former Soviet Union. Twelve nations have publicly expressed a desire to join the current 16 that comprise NATO. 
As I said yesterday--and I don't desire to be dramatic--I do believe this replaces, symbolically, the Iron Curtain that was established in the late forties, which faced west, with now an iron ring of nations that face east to Russia. That causes this Senator a great deal of concern. I have previously expressed my concerns here. I did so again today in the Senate Armed Services Committee, and I was joined in my observations on the floor yesterday by my colleague, the senior Senator from New York, who pointed out that such an iron ring, extending from the Baltics down to the Black Sea, would, in effect, take a present part of Russia and place it behind that iron ring. I refer my colleagues to the remarks of the senior Senator from New York of yesterday. 
In evaluating this issue of NATO expansion, I start from the basic premise that NATO is, first and foremost, a military alliance. It is not a political club, it is not an economic club; it is a military alliance to which members have in the past--I repeat, in the past--been invited because they were able to make a positive contribution to the overall security of Europe and to the goals of NATO as laid down by the founding fathers some nearly 50 years ago. 
Nations should be invited into NATO only if there is a compelling military need for additional members, and only if those additional members will make a positive military contribution to the alliance. That case, in my opinion, has yet to be made persuasively with regard to Poland, Hungary, or the Czech Republic. NATO has been, is, and will remain, with its present membership, the most valuable security alliance in the history of the United States, if not the history of the world. It has fulfilled, it is continuing to fulfill, and will fulfill the vital role of spearheading U.S. leadership on the European continent. 
Twice in this century American troops, in World War I and World War II, have been called to leave our shores and go to Europe to bring about the cessation of hostilities and to instill stability. That is NATO's principal reason for being, for which we now have that military presence in Europe today. It justifies an American voice on the continent, which history dictates is essential to maintain stability. My concern is, that U.S. military presence could be jeopardized by the accession of these three nations at this time. My reason for expressing this concern goes back in the history of this Chamber, when the distinguished majority leader at one time, Senator Mansfield, beginning I think in about 1966, came to the floor repeatedly over a period of 7 over 8 years urging colleagues to bring down the number of U.S. troops in Europe. And, indeed, in that period we saw the beginning of a force reduction, where today there is the phasedown from 300,000 to 100,000. 
Harry Truman, distinguished President of the United States--and, in my judgment, one of the greatest in the history of this country--cited NATO and the Marshall Plan as the two greatest achievements of his Presidency. NATO has unquestionably surpassed all of the expectations that President Truman had, and those associated with him, in founding this historic alliance. 
There is an old axiom: `If something has worked well, is working well, what is the compelling reason to try and fix it?' The burden of proof, in my judgment, is on those who now want to change this great alliance. 
American leadership has been, is, and always will be essential to Europe. History has proven that principle beyond any reasonable doubt. Now a heavy burden falls on those who support expansion--indeed, the Commander in Chief of our Nation, the President--to carry that burden through and to place before the American people a convincing argument that this alliance must be substantially changed by the admission of three new nations. And I predict, without any hesitation, the beginning of accessions periodically of other nations, perhaps to the point where 12 would join with the current 16. 
It is for that reason that I have filed with the Senate an amendment to require a moratorium of 3 years on future accessions, should it be the judgment of this body by a vote of two-thirds of the Senators to accede these three nations under this treaty. If this first round is approved, then I want in the resolution of ratification accompanying this protocol a limitation on this Nation not to involve itself in the accession of further nations for a period of 3 years. I do that because we don't know what the costs are of this first round. I will allude specifically to that momentarily. We don't know how quickly these three new nations can bring themselves up in terms of military interoperability with NATO forces today, in terms of other military standards, and how long it will take them to be a positive, full partner with NATO and not be what I would regard as a user of NATO security in that period of time until they can bring themselves up militarily to NATO standards. 
And, most importantly, given the significance of this treaty, why should we not let an important decision, should that be the result of two-thirds of our Members, for accession of these three nations--why should we not patiently wait 3 years so that the next President of the United States, whoever that may be, can have a voice to express his or her view that the vital security 
interests of this country dictate further accessions, or that the pause should continue for a period of time? I think we owe no less to our next President, who will be faced with a substantially different set of conditions, particularly, in my judgment, as it relates to Russia. 
I have great doubts that this burden of proof can be met in such a way as to prove that NATO expansion now is `vital' to America's national security interests, present or future. For nearly 50 years, the NATO alliance unquestionably has been vital to our security interests. To me, `vital' means that we will put--I want to speak very slowly and clearly--that we will put at risk life and limb of the young men and women who proudly wear the uniforms of the United States Armed Forces, our troops, as they are called upon to protect any member nation of NATO. We make that commitment today to the other 15. Now, if adopted, this treaty pushes the boundary of NATO another 400 miles towards Russia, taking on hundreds and hundreds of square miles of new territory. That is what we must focus on--our young men and women who wear the uniforms and who will be deployed for our contribution to the NATO force. 
Up front, this administration must explain to Americans that any country joining NATO will be extended protection of article V of the NATO treaty. That article V states: `An armed attack against one or more of them in Europe or North America shall be considered an attack against them all'--which means we put at risk our people who are sent as a part of the overall NATO force, along with their comrades, soldiers and sailors and airmen of the other nations. 
This is the most solemn commitment our Nation can make, particularly as NATO is in a transition phase now, performing a vital mission in Bosnia, a mission that was never envisioned under the original charter with clarity. I think the charter conceivably can be interpreted, as it has been, to embrace this type of mission. What about the next mission, and the next mission, and the next mission? What about border disputes between the two nations, three nations, and their neighboring countries? What about ethnic strife? What about religious strife? 
All of these problems are now manifesting themselves throughout this area as these nations struggle to accede to democracy in the former Warsaw Pact and other places in the world, and it is a NATO force that is looked to, to come to the rescue. Bosnia is a case in point. 
It is incumbent on the administration next year and the year after to face up to the request of some nine other nations at the moment who express a desire to join. If Congress is to concur now, it will have to justify to the American people, first, the extension of article V to these three nations, followed by perhaps as many as nine nations in the years to come. 
Let's step back. In the 19 years that I have been privileged to serve in this Institution, I have participated in all of the debates regarding the deployment of our troops. But I will bring one to mind, and that is Somalia. 
I was strongly in favor of President Bush deploying our forces in the cause, not so much because of the vital security interests of the United States, but for our troops to allow the measure of protection needed to distribute food and medicine and other benefits to a starving people, people who are deprived of food as a consequence of a series of droughts and civil strife in that country. 
Senator Levin and I wrote a very detailed report on behalf of the Armed Services Committee, which traces the entire history of that operation from the first day that the troops landed under President Bush as Commander in Chief to the troops withdrawing under President Clinton. And that mission went through a series of transformations, transformations that were not carefully observed by the Senate or, indeed, the Congress. 
There came a time when our mission involved what we would call `nation building,' and our troops were deployed in a combat role to 
try and achieve the goal of nation building. And we all know the tragedy that ensued when one of those missions resulted in the death of 17 or 18 and the wounding seriously of 70-plus other brave soldiers. We recall very well the absolute tragic abuse of the body of one of those brave Americans. This country rebelled. This Chamber rose up in contempt of what we saw before us, and the call was to bring them home--bring them home right now. And I felt that the decision having been made by one President followed up by a second President to deploy those troops, the decision as to when to bring them home should be made pursuant to the Constitution of the United States by the Commander in Chief, the President. I was among those Senators who said let the President make the decision rather than the Congress as to when to bring them home. But the Congress reflected the sentiment across America. 
I point this out to illustrate what I call the limited staying power of this country today. It is far different from what we saw in World War II, far different from Korea. But we saw the manifestations beginning in Vietnam--the limitation on the staying power to continue to accept casualties and losses by this country unless it is manifestly clear that those losses, be it their death or injury, are clearly identified with the vital security interests of the United States of America. I forewarn that with this expansion, our troops committed to NATO someday could be involved in missions which, in my judgment, would be very, very hard to justify as being in the vital security interests of this country, and at that point in time our Nation might focus on the continued contributions, be it financial or manpower, to NATO. And underlying that is the question of the possibility of once again America's presence in Europe, through its NATO association, being challenged by the American public. 
I see the Senator from Delaware. I will be happy to take a question at any time.

Mr. WARNER. I say in a very calm way, I listened carefully to my colleague. I take to heart what he has said. And I think it is very important. I don't question his generation in Vietnam. It was my privilege to be in the Pentagon at that point in time with the Department of the Navy. I went out across the country, spoke at the campuses, watched the extreme objection by his generation and, in hindsight, there was a lot of merit to that objection. 
I remember very well Secretary of Defense Melvin Laird, under whom I served as Secretary of the Navy, saying, we have to figure out how to withdraw the United States from Vietnam. That is history. But in World War II, during which I served a modest period at the very end, and my colleague from New York, a somewhat longer period, our generation marched off under the old refrain, `Ours is not to reason why, ours is but to do or die.' We simply went, never questioned it. And as the Senator from Delaware said, there was greater clarity as to the enemy, the cause, and we had absolutely magnificent support on the home front. 
When I returned from Korea, then serving in the Marines for a short period of time, there was a marked difference between the attitude in America for the returning veterans of Korea and the veterans of World War II. And then during the Vietnam war we all know full well the turmoil on the home front and the difficulty with which the brave young men and women who fought in that battle wearing the uniform of the United States had to cope with not only in battle in Nam but regrettably a battle of a different form at home. 
But I say to my friend, staying power in this Senator's mind is an important point, and that is why I brought it up because we no longer have the attitude: ours is not to reason why, ours is but to do or die. Every person in uniform reasons today. I don't suggest they question the orders, but they reason. 
The people at home reason. They want to know with clarity as to what the mission is, and whether or not it is in our vital security interests. 
I remind my good friend of the debate that took place on this floor before the Persian Gulf war. It was my privilege to have written the resolution authorizing the use of force in 1991, after President Bush had put in place, in the gulf, 500,000 American troops, had formed a coalition of 30-plus nations, and we were ready to do battle with Saddam Hussein, who had invaded Kuwait and perpetrated acts of criminal warfare that we had not seen for some period of time. 
Kuwait was aflame, the streets littered with the debris of war. In this Chamber we had an excellent debate as to whether or not we would allow the President of the United States to use force by the men and women already in place to repel that invasion. It went on for 2 1/2 days. And by a mere five votes, only a five-vote margin, did this Chamber agree with that resolution. How well I remember that event.

Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I brought this up because this Senator feels differently. I think the American people in their heart of hearts want to go to the defense of human beings wherever they are in trouble in the world, irrespective of race, color or creed. But they must apply a standard because it is their sons and daughters who go, and that standard should always be: Is that 
deployment and risk of life in the vital security interests of our Nation and/or our allies? The NATO treaty, as it has been drafted and utilized these nearly 50 years, has had clarity on that point. We have now gotten involved in an internal conflict in Bosnia, and we thank the dear Lord that we have not experienced in that ravaged nation the casualties that could have come about. And the staying power of the American people, had we experienced over the past year a considerable number of casualties--I am not certain what that staying power would have been. I really am not certain. But I want to make it very clear it is the vital security interests that should always underlie any deployment. 
I brought in Somalia because I was greatly disturbed by the debate. Some of my most respected colleagues said, `Bring them home tomorrow,' irrespective of the President's, the Commander in Chief's prerogatives to decide when to deploy and when to bring troops back, absent the Congress of the United States speaking through its power of the purse. I think we should always defend that executive prerogative. 
So my concern is just to raise the article 5 commitment clearly, that `an attack on one is an attack on all,' and away we go. And now, as we are broadening the basis for NATO military actions, as we have in Bosnia, to involvement in a clear, historical conflict rooted in the diversity of religions and ethnic differences, we have to be ever so careful, as we add nations into the NATO alliance.

Mr. WARNER. I thank my colleague. I just wanted to reaffirm what the Senator has said. But I want to make it clear that the Senator listed 74 Senators by count who have dealt with the issue. But let us not infer from that that that is the count at the present time that favors this. I just wanted to make that clear because I am a member of the NATO observer group. It has been a vital organization. Seventeen times we have met. And under the leadership of Senator Biden and Senator Roth, I think we have done a lot of valuable analysis which is shared with the rest of the Senate. 
In our weekly luncheon we had some 35 to 40 Republican Senators. We had Peter Rodman, of the Council of Foreign Relations in New York City, and the privilege of debating with him in New York on this issue on Monday. We had Michael Mandelbaum, and the Presiding Officer will recall here in the last hour we had a heated debate in our caucus on this issue. So this vital issue has now gained the momentum that I think it deserves and I believe in the ensuing days--and our leader, Senator Lott, just spoke with us and wants to move along in an orderly process but no way attenuate the ability of the Senate to give this question every bit of attention it needs. 
I think it is important that our distinguished colleague has brought up chronologically exactly what has been done by the Senate thus far, and now we embark on the debate that I think will be an excellent one. 
Momentarily, I will deliver some general remarks on this subject, but at this time I cannot resist the effort, since we have had such a pleasure debating, to give to you once again the opportunity to answer the question I think I posed in our last debate. And I will be but a minute posing the question. 
That is, Mr. President, this NATO alliance is perhaps the most valuable alliance in the history of the world, when nations came together in a period of uncertainty, under the leadership of one of the greatest Presidents, greatest Presidents this country ever had, Harry S. Truman. He listed in his biography his two proudest accomplishments were the Marshall Plan and NATO. At that time the President and others, the founding fathers of this alliance, made clear that it was a military alliance, it was for a military reason that we put this there, to deter any further aggression in Europe. 
Today, in my judgment, I do not see any military threat to the three nations under consideration. What I do see is that that arc of nations, beginning with Poland going down through Bulgaria on the Black Sea, are in a struggle for economic survival, making the transition from the Warsaw Pact to a system of competition, not only among themselves but worldwide, to establish a free market economy, to establish the political democracies and the like. 
That is the focus of their attention. That is where all their resources for the time being should be applied. And now we are considering the admission of three. I say to my distinguished colleague that, should the Senate in its wisdom vote to affirm the ratification and the status of NATO is given to 3 of the 12, are we not singling out 3 of these countries and giving them a tremendous lift in that competitive field among the 12 nations for economic competition? They can put in their brochures as they go throughout the world, come, invest, put your investment in our country, because you have the security of the NATO alliance, the security of knowing that, if anything were to threaten our nation, your investment will be protected. 
Whereas, if you go next door to Romania, if you go next door to Slovenia or the other nations, they pose some doubt as to whether or not, if a problem arose which was in the circumference of the obligation of the NATO--primarily article 5, but at a later time I will explain where I think NATO is moving in terms of a broader issue of responsibilities, Bosnia being the case in point--if that threat comes, your investment is protected in the three countries. And we question whether or not it will be protected as well in other nations not now being admitted to NATO. 
Suddenly you begin to breed a friction and a concern amongst these countries, side by side, border by border; and that friction alone could spell trouble. I ask my friend.

Mr. WARNER. While I do have a statement I wish to deliver, I will pick up on several of the themes by my distinguished colleague from Delaware and we would go right into a colloquy on concerns that I have, and perhaps others have. 
First, I say we are fortunate in the Senate to have had the strong participation by the Senator from Delaware. This is my 19th year of service in the Senate. We have traveled together to many places in the world, and we are fortunate that he has chosen to be the distinguished ranking member of the Foreign Relations Committee. 
It is appalling to me today to see the decline in the interest in strategic issues, be they foreign affairs or security issues all across the country, and to some extent here in the Congress of the United States. Year after year, Senator Biden has been right there in the forefront on this floor as one of the most vigorous and enthusiastic debaters, albeit somewhat long-winded on occasion, but nevertheless, solid in his enthusiasm. 
So with that modest background, I pick up on the theme, why NATO? I say to my good friend, as he well knows, in 1917 we responded and the Yankees crossed the oceans in response to the plea, `Come to save us.' The great powers of Europe and Great Britain were locked in a war of static dimensions, devouring tens upon tens of thousands of lives every day, and we went, and I think all the world acknowledges we were the power that tipped the balance for the allies in that struggle that enabled victory and to have peace return to Europe. And, again, as the clouds of war over the world in 1939, September, when Hitler invaded Poland, and we watched Great Britain heroically trying to put its thumb in the dike, and France and the Maginot Line was overrun in just a matter of days or weeks, and Europe was in the palm of Hitler's hand. 
Once again, this country, which had really bordered upon isolationism in 1939 and 1940, suddenly after Pearl Harbor stood united, under a courageous President's leadership and once again returned to Europe. 
We are there in Europe today because of the classic, historic instability among those major nations. Our presence in Europe is essential to its long-range stability. No one puts that upon the billboards, nor should they. But that is understood subliminally by those who have studied that history and, indeed, the European leaders today. 
NATO gives the United States the legitimacy to be in Europe. We are now considering the NATO treaty which has made possible that legitimacy for over 50 years. That is the most fundamental reason why I oppose enlarging it at this time. It puts in jeopardy the ability of the United States to have that strong voice that is so essential in Europe. 
I ask my colleague a question or two before I go on in my statement. He made the statement that Russian leaders have more or less tacitly accepted the expansion of NATO. I want to be accurate in my rendition of his words, but I seek clarification of his statement, because on my recent trip to Russia with Secretary Cohen we had the opportunity to visit with the Sergeyev, Minister of Defense and with Primakov, the very able Foreign Minister. I really think that Primakov is the second coming of Gromyko. This man has enormous potential and possibility to become a future leader of Russia. 
My point to the Senator is, as I listened to those two members of the Yeltsin Cabinet address the issue of expansion of NATO, it is true that they have reconciled themselves to these first three countries, but I clearly came away with the impression that that is the line that is to be drawn. I want to make clear to my colleague that it is those three countries, and once another step is taken to access others, then I think there will be further instability in relationships between the United States and Russia. 
Now let me make it clear, and I will yield for the answer, at no time should this country ever consider Russia in terms of making those decisions which are important to our vital security interests--at no time. We should always put our vital security interests first. But we cannot be unmindful of the fact that on a broad range of fronts we are engaged with Russia today, not the least of which is further reduction of the ever-present nuclear threat. We are assisting, through the Nunn-Lugar funds, the dismantling of their weapons. We are assisting them with downsizing their military because this is the 14th consecutive year of the downsizing of the American military. We have a lot of experience in dealing with downsizing. 
I am not sure that it has been that wise, that decision, and I am one who wants to see what we can do to start that curve back up. That is a separate issue for another day. 
I want to ask my good friend to clarify, when he said Russia has accepted it, whether or not it is limited to the first three and the balance of the nine that wish to join--and I don't think in the current rhetoric we are using, Ukraine is within that nine. You might wish to clarify that. That would be 10 according to my calculation.

Mr. WARNER. Madam President, at some point in our debate, maybe the Senator would opine as to how long before that fourth country, who just missed this round by a hair, might be considered for admission, and whether or not this second round will come far more swiftly than anyone at the present time expects. It is for that reason that my good friend, the senior Senator from New York, and I have an amendment, which at some point we will call up, suggesting that this body ought to go on record and have a moratorium attached, whereby a 3-year period will elapse, should this body vote this treaty accession, before the next round.

Perhaps during the course of this debate he might comment on why did the President of the United States then encourage the Baltics and have this agreement--whatever that agreement is called--issued here, to the astonishment of many of us just a matter of 2, 3 months ago. Why did he throw that lifeline out?

Mr. WARNER. Madam President, if I might remind my colleague, we are having a colloquy, and he is responding to questions. I appreciate the enthusiasm. 
I simply say, Madam President, that the Baltic charter--while it has a lot of verbiage in there, I never said it was a commitment. Let me tell you, Senator, with that, our President slipped the engagement ring on. I don't know how long it will come before that issue is squarely before this Chamber to the effect that now the time has come to admit those nations. If my good friend will look at the map of Europe, as he does, I think, on a daily basis, and see that arch from Poland down through Hungary, the Czech Republic, on down through the next nations to be admitted, Romania and Bulgaria, it's an arch. And just as the Iron Curtain was dropped in the late 1940s by the Soviet Union facing west, that ring of countries constitutes an iron ring now, encircling much of Russia.

Mr. WARNER. I have said, Madam President, an iron ring has now replaced the Iron Curtain. It flashed into my mind as I was debating with my distinguished colleague here that while the Iron Curtain faced west, the ring now faces east. I will deal with the Russian planners who have to look at this force that has moved now a border 400 miles east, with the accession of these three nations, closer to Russia. Every military planner has to look at that force and advise the Russian President today, tomorrow, and in the future, as to what the capabilities of that force are, no matter what the intentions may be. I will return to that. 
I yield back to my colleague for a question.

Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I thank my colleague. 
Now I proceed to another question to my colleague from Delaware. 
Madam President, for some reason we have decided to go ahead. I am not here to argue on the question of timing. But one of the most valuable resources to this debate is the studies undertaken in the past by the NATO staff, and which are still being undertaken. NATO cannot tell us with certainty what the costs are going to be. They are going to issue another report in the June timeframe, long after this debate will be concluded and this body will have made its decision. But in the current NATO studies--again, they are all classified, so I can't bring them out. But I think without breaching any classification, I ask my good friend: These studies are predicated on a 10-year cost analysis and timeframe, but it is a period of 10 years that NATO is looking at for these three nations and the subject of this accession. It is 10 years before they can bring the level of their military professionalism, the level of their military interoperability--and for those following the debate, I would say that is so we can talk on the same radio and have commonalty among our weapons systems, command and control, and the like--10 years before that level will be brought up to the standards that will be acceptable to our NATO forces. 
I say to my good friend: What are his estimates of the cost? What cost estimates is he now putting to this Chamber, to this U.S. Senate, on which we can rely with that degree of certainty as we undertake to commit the United States, in our military budget, to future costs associated with this expansion of three nations? 
And, as a subset to my question, will he comment on France's statement to the effect that they will not bear any added costs associated with this expansion. Do I and do others interpret that as saying that we are paying--the United States of America today--26 percent of all the costs of NATO, and that that will be a further added cost to the American taxpayer occasioned by the sustaining of France and meeting whatever level of cost the Senator is about to exchange with us for the NATO expansion?

Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I am sure there will be further debate. But I also point out that the Congressional Budget Office came up with a figure of $125 billion. The Senator is familiar with that. Of course, we recognize that embraces some other aspects of the cost, but, nevertheless, I think in fairness to all parties, we are handing out blank checks. That is in the words of my able colleague, Senator Smith, who used that phrase first as we began to proceed on this thing.

 Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Mr. Leonard Grove Campbell--one of our federal government's finest public servants and a distinguished son of the Commonwealth of Virginia. At the end of this month, he will retire from a truly distinguished career of over 37 years of exemplary service to his country. 
Mr. Campbell was well-prepared for his distinguished career. After graduating from the University of Virginia with a degree in economics, he entered Officer Candidate School in 1963 and began his first career with the United States Navy. Mr. Campbell served as a weapons officer aboard the USS Iwo Jima in the Pacific--service which included tours in Vietnam. He completed his active duty service in the Navy in 1967, and retired from the Naval Reserves in 1983 as a Commander. 
After completing his active duty service with the Navy, Mr. Campbell went to work for the Department of Commerce as a senior economist in the Balance of Payments Division. In 1973, he began a remarkable 25-year career with the Department of Defense. 
I am proud to honor him today for his tremendous accomplishments, and to recognize the support and sacrifices of his wife, Lois, and his daughters, Lisa and Kristin, who wisely followed in their father's footsteps as UVA graduates. 
The quality of Mr. Campbell's work has been recognized by every Administration he has served. He has received the Presidential Rank Award for Meritorious Service, the Department of Defense Distinguished Civilian Service Award, the Department of Defense Meritorious Civilian Service Award, and the Department of Defense Exceptional Civilian Service Award. 
Mr. Campbell has served as the key advisor on budget issues for nine Secretaries of Defense and nine Department Comptrollers. His recommendations on a wide range of vital issues were constantly sought by the Pentagon leadership and greatly helped the Department robustly defend the funding requirements which support U.S. forces and missions. Year in and year out, his sage counsel and sound advice produced the best possible, yet fiscally responsible, spending plans to satisfy the nation's national security needs. 
Mr. Campbell always brought exceptional insight and skill to the many diverse challenges presented to and undertaken by him. He is one of the few individuals in the Department who understands and can explain succinctly the complexities contained in numerous legislative proposals. On many occasions, his advice assured the adoption of sound spending decisions that supported major Defense Department requirements while remaining consistent with the President's budget priorities and prevailing perspectives in the Congress. His comprehensive knowledge, the consummate clarity by which he explained issues, his exceptional skill in guiding senior officials through the intricacies and restrictions of legislation, and his tireless dedication were immensely valuable to a whole generation of Department of Defense leaders, to our armed forces, and to U.S. national security. 
The ultimate result of Mr. Campbell's performance within the Department of Defense over the last 25 years was that senior U.S. leaders, both in Congress and in the Defense Department, benefited enormously from his extensive knowledge, exceptional dedication, superb political sensitivity, and wise judgment. His invaluable contributions allowed our nation's leaders to make the wisest possible allocation of declining defense resources while maintaining America's future security. 
Mr. Campbell has had a career of singular merit and has earned the profound gratitude of the American people. I wish him well in his future endeavors.

 Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, on Saturday, January 17, 1998, I had the privilege of joining other members of the Virginia Congressional delegation in Richmond for the inauguration of James S. Gilmore III as the sixty-eighth Governor of the Commonwealth of Virginia. 
In the weeks prior to his inauguration, Governor-elect Gilmore crisscrossed the state and captured the confidence of Virginians who embraced his initiatives to revamp education and roll back the car tax. He returned to the State Capitol to issue this challenge to every Virginian: `Now we stand at the end of one century, and the beginning of another, and--in the life of man--the end of one millennium and the beginning of another. Can we in Virginia, the home of the American idea of the rights of man--can we set the course for the future? If we do, we can make Virginia's future worthy of its great past.' 
I am convinced, and there should be no doubt, under Governor Gilmore's stewardship, the future of Virginia is as bright as ever. On a historic day last November, Jim Gilmore was overwhelmingly elected as Governor after proving to a vast majority of Virginians that he has the character and distinct qualities necessary to guide our state well into the 21st Century. In his inaugural address, which I will enter into the Congressional Record today, Jim Gilmore remarked, `I am a common man with an uncommon chance to serve the people as Governor.' I rise today to pay tribute to this self-described `common man' as he embarks on the most important endeavor of leading our great Commonwealth. 
Over the years, I've had the great opportunity and privilege to work with many Governors of Virginia. I am extremely pleased with the decision the citizens of this Commonwealth have made in choosing Jim Gilmore to steer Virginia into the next millennium. Governor Gilmore will, undoubtably, prove a worthy resident of the Governor's mansion in Richmond and I look forward to working closely with my good friend in the coming years. 
Mr. President, I ask that Governor Gilmore's inaugural address be printed at the appropriate place in today's Congressional Record. 
The address follows. 
Inaugural Address James S. Gilmore, III, January 17, 1998 
Mr. Speaker, Mr. President, Members of the General Assembly, My Fellow Virginians, 
Virginia's march into the 21st century begins today. Virginians have energized me with a contagious spirit and common purpose. We again unite to make history. 
It is incumbent upon us to pause and pay tribute to the great Virginians who nurtured our unique heritage. We recognize the awesome responsibility of our inheritance. 
We can focus our vision on the next millennium because of the leadership provided by Governor Allen. Governor Allen, your leadership and reforms, have, as you said Wednesday evening, made this a great time to be a Virginian. Governor, Virginia thanks you and your family. 
I am humbled to stand in the shadow of Virginia's great Governors. It seems appropriate that I begin my service as Governor by asking you to join me in prayer for wisdom and guidance. 
Let us pray. 
Almighty father, we thank you for the many blessings bestowed on us as individuals, families, and Virginians. As we move into a new millennium, we ask you most of all . . . to unite us as one Virginia. A Virginia where no one is left out. A Virginia where all families will experience renewal in values and commitment of service to our fellow man. 
I ask for your guidance in leading the Commonwealth of Virginia over the next four years. We look to you for constant inspiration. May our debates be characterized by civility, fairness and justice. May we govern with long term vision. 
Help me to be open to the ideas of others while adhering to the fundamental belief that your will is done when the people are free to achieve their hopes and to follow their faith and their dreams. 
With your blessing, we devote ourselves to the goal of improving the lives of all Virginians. Amen. 
I have been blessed by parents who instilled in me the values of hard work, honesty, and service. Together, with Roxane, we have done our best to pass these values onto our sons, Jay and Ashton. To my family, to Roxane, to Jay and to Ashton, you give me continued strength. 
I am a son of Virginia. Born here in the Fan District of Richmond--attended William Fox Public Elementary School. I went to Public Schools in Henrico suburbs; I attended a great Public University of this state; as well as its law school. I have worked in grocery stores, I've been a bank teller, and I have practiced law. I served my country when it needed me in the U.S. Army. 
My home has been Virginia all my life, and my life has been the same experience of my fellow Virginians, from all walks of life. Abraham Lincoln said, `God must love the common people because he made so many of them.' Well, God has blessed this common man with a truly uncommon chance to serve the people as Governor. 
Over the past week, we crisscrossed the state making this a time for all Virginians. We celebrated this inauguration in Abingdon in Western Virginia and in Northern Virginia with a technology showcase and in Hampton Roads home of our great Port. 
And we have renewed our heritage of freedom at Gunston Hall, the home of George Mason, and Raleigh Tavern in Williamsburg, where the patriots met, and at Mr. Jefferson's Rotunda at the University of Virginia; and at the place of Patrick Henry's `Liberty or Death' speech at St. John's Church here in Richmond. 
It is good to remember on this day these great Governors--Patrick Henry and Thomas Jefferson, and their historic leadership of our state and our nation. 
Now we stand at the end of one century, and the beginning of another and--in the life of man--the end of one millennium and the beginning of another. Can we in Virginia, the home of the American idea of the rights of man--can we set the course for the future? If we do, we can make Virginia's future worthy of its great past. 
We live in a day of great cynicism; which endangers the American spirit. Let us as Virginians reaffirm our commitment to live as a free people--empowered to do what is best for our families, committed to building a more perfect democracy where our votes and voices genuinely affect the course of our public affairs--that we not be frozen by our fears, but enabled to reach for our hopes and dreams. 
Virginians from all walks of life have told me that they want their government to empower them to meet their needs. This should not be a request any citizen has to make. But too many citizens feel forgotten and isolated as they pay their income taxes, sales taxes, utility taxes, meals taxes, gas taxes and car taxes. Certainly the people responded to this concern when they voted--concern that their families were not being full considered in the halls of government. 
Today we live within a political culture where people are expected to pay and pay taxes, yet feel detached from the expenditure of their money. Today some in government view citizens as nothing more than a source of revenue--some glory in the growth of government revenue because it means more and more can be spent, without considering the impact that taxation has on the lives of people. 
Let us never allow the complexities of billion dollar budgets and highly technical new issues to cloud our minds and prevent us from remembering that it is the people who ultimately pay every dollar. 
The young woman working the drive-through window at our local bank should be the light casting common sense on our decisions. 
The grandmother whose fixed income doesn't allow her enough money to buy each grandchild a Christmas present sheds light on why we need to give her a tax cut. 
The father commuting from Dale City to Dulles with despair in the little time he spends with his children is reason enough for us to make his commute as easy as we can. 
Individual Virginians, their daily lives and problems are a light too often dimmed by the process of government. Let their lives guide us to a better Virginia. 
Unlike the nation, Virginians have not been complacent in the face of tax increases. Through their votes, our citizens delivered a strong message, not of selfishness, but of an insistent demand that their ability to make decisions over their own lives must be just as important as someone else's decision to spend tax money for someone else's priority. 
In the spirit of Patrick Henry, Virginians are saying we don't work for the purpose of funding government. We work to provide for ourselves and our family. We have the right to decide how we spend our own money. 
Virginians are generous people, and over the next two years, 40 billions of dollars of the people's money will be spent for public purposes, and most often the spending is needed to lift up the quality of life for all Virginians--but the spending goals of the influential must not overbear the capacity of everyday Virginians to lift themselves up to independent lives. Who speaks for these Virginians? The Governor of all the people must--and I will! 
Since the first Virginians settled at Jamestown, Virginia has been a shining example of the right way to govern. To be that beacon for our nation and the world is our aspiration and our fate. I believe at the end of this century and the beginning of another, history looks to us again. As with every generation we are challenged to prove that government can be the servant of the people and not their master. 
Let there be no doubt, I am here because working Virginians embraced this very message. They delivered a clear mandate. Now we must deliver on our promise to the people. 
The `No Car Tax' pledge grew from the understanding that working families would no longer allow themselves to be left out while watching government prosper. 
We have a moral obligation to help families by eliminating this harsh tax on the mobility of people in a modern mobile world. I do not care how they spend their tax savings. It's not government's business how private citizens spend their earnings. My desire is to give them the opportunity to make that decision. 
My determination to make government work for the people is just as intense as my determination to provide tax relief. 
As we improve government services, I will have the honor and privilege of working with one of Virginia's most valuable assets. Our state employees need to know that they march by my side as we lead Virginia into the next century. 
State employees must have the resources to perform their job. Experience in managing public servants has taught me many lessons. I know productivity requires an atmosphere of high morale. Ours is a united mission. 
We have an ambitious agenda. On Monday night, I will outline that agenda before the Joint Session of the General Assembly. However, some key items deserve mention today. 
Welfare reform is working. We will fully implement these reforms. I will veto legislation to weaken current reform in any way, shape or form. 
Violent crime continues to decline but we will not stop strengthening criminal laws and punishment until it can be declared that the war has been won. Our administration commits to protect natural resources, build a better transportation system, and serve Virginians who use state health and long term care services. 
I am passionate in my love for Virginia. With this passion, I will recruit new jobs to Virginia to give new opportunities for our young people, and to improve their quality of life. 
We have exciting plans to bolster our growing information technology industries. The economic return these efforts generate will benefit every single Virginian. Virginia is the Information Technology state! 
Education requires urgent attention. 
I have yet to meet the first public official who is not sincere in support for public education. Virginians are united in support for public education. With all of us seeking the same goal, we can certainly do more for the children of Virginia. 
My vision is to demand no less than excellence from our public schools. 
No goal could be more noble as we advance into the 21st Century than making Virginia's system of public education, from Kindergarten to post graduate, the very best. 
Virginians gave us their strong endorsement to move forward on two fronts that will have significant impact as we strive for excellence in education. Voters told us to implement the Standards of Learning and hire 4,000 additional teachers. We are well prepared to move forward. 
While raising expectations for Virginia's public schools, more teachers must be hired. No student should be shortchanged in the instruction required to master the Standards of Learning. 
Crowded classrooms test the limits of even our best teachers. We are going to reduce class size! 
While higher education has become the topic of healthy public debate, global leaders recognize Virginia as home to some of the world's best colleges and universities. 
Higher education faces new challenges in the 21st Century because Virginia lacks a formal policy or direction on higher education. We need to chart our course for the future and give direction to our Colleges and Universities. A Blue Ribbon Commission on Higher Education in Virginia will help us chart that course. I am going to sign an Executive Order creating such a commission right now! 
Let us advance into the 21st Century united, leaving behind the 20th Century barrier of regionalism. 
The success of Northern Virginia depends on the success of Southwest Virginia. 
The prosperity of Hampton Roads depends on the prosperity of Southside. 
The standard of living in Central Virginia depends on the standard of living in the Shenandoah Valley. 
We are one Virginia. Let us forever be united in common purpose. 
At every juncture in time, issues come and go. We must be ever mindful of our obligation to lead, fully focused on our vision for the 21st century. 
Governors and legislators are citizens temporarily given power to perform the awesome requirements of self Government. Governors make mistakes and so will I, but be sure no mistake will be of intentional origin. 
Democracy is a fragile institution. I am intent on strengthening that institution, so when it passes to Virginia's next Governor, it will be a little less fragile. 
Let no person underestimate our commitment to the vision of a prosperous Virginia filled with strong families and optimism. We march united as one Virginia into the 21st Century. We go forward with the idealism that people can define and control their own lives, and live independent lives which is the essence of free men and women. 
As we go forth, into this new century and millennium--we can have courage and confidence that we can fulfill our hopes and dash our fears, and we can control change, and make it our servant and that the ideals and lessons of our great past can light the way for the future in an even greater Virginia. 
May God bless the Commonwealth of Virginia and the United States of America.

Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, first, I thank the Senator from Texas. He was very modest in his remarks recounting the history of how we got from the very beginning to where we are today. 
Yes, he did refer to the sage in the Senate, Senator Robert Byrd. I, like the Senator from Texas, am privileged to be part of that team. I had an opportunity to work many times with Senator Byrd, and there is not one of us in the Senate of the United States who cannot learn and benefit from his wisdom. 
Indeed, the Senator from West Virginia and the Senator from Texas took on a battle that the Senator from Montana and I started and lost by one vote. The rest is history. 
As I talk to so many Senators--and will continue to do so for the next hour about this bill--I think there is a feeling in the Senate that we have really done a very significant piece of legislation and we have corrected the inequities of the past. 
All of us know that fighting for our individual States is that responsibility which is foremost, but there comes a time when we have to reconcile our differences and recognize that each of the 50 States has its own particular problems as they relate to transportation, whether it is in the far reaches of Alaska, the northern tier, or down on the border where the distinguished Senator from Texas works so hard on behalf of his constituents. 
We are there and we have tried and will continue to try through conference to keep that 91 percent as the target goal for all States. The donor States have now been recognized through the efforts of many. I was privileged to be a part of it. They have at long last pulled alongside so that they are getting an equitable and fair distribution with the other States. I thank the Senator from Texas. He is a bulldog to work with. I tell you, I would rather be on his side than opposing him. 
This is the last amendment that we are working on. I have a few small items which I will move to momentarily. Then, in conjunction with the distinguished floor manager on the other side, I will ask unanimous consent that there be no further amendments and we begin to vote on final passage about the hour of 2:15. That is just preliminary for Senators who might have an interest so they can attend to those interests between now and the hour of 2:15. 
I see my good friend and colleague in so many joint ventures--a travel partner recently to the gulf States and Russia--on the floor. Therefore, I yield the floor.

Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, this amendment has been carefully considered on this side. For purposes of proceeding, we are going to adopt it. 
However, I have to say that we will have to readdress the amendment in the conference--I think my distinguished colleague understands that--because it affects the plan process and relationship between the States and local governments. 
From the very inception of this legislation, in the subcommittee of which I am privileged to be the chairman, we have been very careful to maintain the balance that was developed in ISTEA I. That has worked, we believe, quite well over this period of 6 years. We will make certain in the conference structure to maintain this balance, and we will look at the amendment in that context. 
Mr. LEVIN addressed the Chair.

Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I urge that the Senator, between now and the conference period, allow the various representatives of AASHTO to discuss it. I have found through many years of working on legislation for our highways, AASHTO is an organization that has a lot of credibility and lot of knowledge. It is composed of the various highway officials of our 50 States. They have given effective and balanced and credible advice to the Senate on many, many occasions. For the moment, they express some discomfort with this. And we want to make sure that the Senator has that opportunity. 
Is the Senator ready to adopt the amendment?

Mr. WARNER. Momentarily, I will seek unanimous consent regarding the bill, but I will take this opportunity to express my profound appreciation to so many persons who were instrumental in achieving this landmark piece of legislation, which originated in the subcommittee on which I am privileged to chair, and with the help of the distinguished ranking member of the subcommittee and ranking member of the full committee, Mr. Baucus. I think we can say with some immodesty that we achieved the goals we set out to establish months and months ago when we started hearings. 
Indeed, we held hearings in many places in the United States to get the input of various Governors and other State officials and people across our country as we were putting together this legislation, which I am confident will enable not only the lifestyle of individuals to improve, to eliminate hours, endless hours on the highways in traffic congestion, but to improve safety. 
I see the distinguished ranking member has just arrived. I was about to extol the Senator during his absence, but I will continue. Those goals--we sat down in the subcommittee and in the hearings that we had--we had a hearing in Montana, as well as Idaho, and produced the various principles we have incorporated in this bill. There came a time when Senator Baucus and I believed we needed added dollars. We made that effort. We lost by a single vote on the floor. 
But I think we understood at that time that the leadership, both Republican and Democrat, needed more time. I say throughout this bill we have received the strongest support from the majority leader and the distinguished minority leader, Mr. Daschle. As a matter of fact, the majority leader presided over a series of meetings we had in connection with the Byrd-Gramm-Baucus-Warner amendment. I can see Senator Lott in his private office now patiently listening as we advocated the need for additional funding and the chairman of the Budget Committee, Mr. Domenici, in a very pragmatic and straightforward way, explaining the various priorities of many programs, but the willingness on behalf of the majority leader to listen and the chairman of the Budget Committee to finally accept the consensus of that. 
Mr. Chafee worked with us throughout. There was a time when he was not entirely in favor of what Mr. Baucus and I were trying to do, then a little less disfavor with the Byrd-Gramm-Baucus-Warner amendment. I remember him walking out of here at one point late in the afternoon and he said he was going to put a shield on and take out a sword and this measure would not pass. He, too, came to recognize the need for additional funding. 
I think, indeed, the consensus of the Senate as a body--both sides realized, fully bipartisan--was that additional highway funding was needed. Senator Chafee, together with Senator Baucus, in markup in the full committee, got the unanimous adoption of the subcommittee bill. Then when there was reconciliation on the Byrd amendment, again, Mr. Chafee took the leadership in our committee and received unanimous support from all Members and eventually brought to the floor the Chafee amendment which added those funds. 
Mr. President, we have come a long way. We are here, and within a short period I hope this measure is voted on final passage. 
I want to thank Ann Loomis of my staff. I have never in my 19 years in the Senate witnessed a higher dedication and commitment by any person serving in the capacity of the staff than this fine person, together with her assistant, Ellen Stein, in helping me. We were joined by Dan Corbett, Kathy Ruffalo of Senator Baucus' staff, Jimmie Powell, the staff director, Thomas Sliter, the minority staff director, as well as Cheryl Tucker, Abigail Kinnison, and Linda Jordan. What a marvelous group. We have worked together in a bipartisan way to achieve this legislation. I hope other members of the staff and the Senate recognize how their peer group throughout the Senate worked--those assigned to the highway responsibilities and the legislative offices of every Senator--to bring about this bill. We thank all of you. We really got a remarkable piece of legislation and here we are. 
I think there is one matter still remaining. I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.

I further ask unanimous consent that immediately following the adoption of Senate amendment No. 1676, S. 1173 be read the third time and the bill be set aside upon receipt of the House companion. I further ask consent that at that time the Senate proceed to the House companion and all after the enacting clause be stricken, the text of S. 1173, as amended, be inserted in lieu thereof, the bill be considered read the third time, and passed, and the Senate insist on its amendment and request a conference with the House.

Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the chairman, Mr. Chafee, when the time came to develop this legislation, reposed his full trust and confidence in the subcommittee to draw up a bill. And that we did. And, indeed, that bill, with the exception of the additional money, remained intact throughout this deliberation. 
I want to pay special tribute to the members of that subcommittee who worked with me and Senator Baucus, the ranking member, through the period of a year's time. Many of them traveled with us when we went to various places in the United States. That is Mr. Smith; Mr. Kempthorne; Mr. Bond; Mr. Inhofe; and Mr. Thomas, who just spoke; Mr. Moynihan; Mr. Reid; Mr. Graham; and Mrs. Boxer. 
As I said earlier, Mr. Graham of Florida worked with me on STEP 21, which was the foundation group that we eventually went into partnership with on Stars 2000, under the leadership of Mr. Baucus. So I want to pay special tribute to each of these individuals who worked so hard on this bill. I yield the floor.

Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank my colleague, but I also thank him for the opportunity to learn. I remember one time we were in a hearing, I believe it was in Idaho, if I am correct in my recollection. You and I were chairing it with Senator Kempthorne. You pointed out the technical problems in many of the roads in the West, where they have to traverse such long distances and it is very expensive, given the weather; therefore, through the years they have shortchanged the sides of the road, the unpaved portions, and how that has contributed to a number of accidents. 
I just point out that one technical thing because throughout this bill it has been a great learning process on the particular needs of the individual States as they relate to their geographical locations, temperatures and weather conditions that they have. The Senator fought tenaciously for the West. Now he goes in to meet his greatest challenge in the House where there are far fewer Members of the House of Representatives representing the West. I know that the West can count on the Senator for upholding their position in this bill, which he has fought for and achieved, together with Senator Kempthorne, who I think was a partner in this endeavor. I thank the Senator for his kind comments but also for a learning curve that taught me a lot about things, like the shoulders of the road. Now this bears on your shoulders, to protect them in the West.

Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I have paid compliments to some who have worked on this bill. I want to add the name of Lee Brown. 
Lee Brown has the current title of assistant editor of morning business, and he is soon to be, I am told, elevated to the position of editor. Now, those who watch the floor proceedings of the Senate on occasion see Mr. Brown, in his usual quiet manner, come up and take from a Senator a document which he has asked unanimous consent to have placed in the Record. Lee Brown and his associates in this Institution somehow find where to put it in the Record, match it up with the statement, and get it correct. That is not an easy job. 
So I want to express my appreciation to Mr. Brown for his effective work and efforts on this bill, which has had a very significant amount of inserts.

Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I send to the desk an amendment on behalf of both Senators from Alaska and ask for its immediate consideration. 
This amendment, offered by Senators Murkowski and Stevens, eliminates the redundant provisions of the law by integrating the so-called major investment study, MIS, requirement into the overall transportation planning process. 
Under current law, States are required to conduct a major investment study when there are high-cost and high-impact transportation alternatives being considered. There have been many concerns raised that the MIS requirement duplicates other planning and project development processes already required under ISTEA. 
This amendment would eliminate only those elements of the MIS that are duplicative of other transportation planning requirements. It would integrate those elements of the MIS requirement which are not duplicated elsewhere in the law into the larger transportation planning process. This amendment has been cleared on both sides.

Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, as an author of the underlying bill, before we had done such valuable work in the Senate to amend it, I would have to say, with the greatest respect to my colleague, while philosophically I align myself with his view of giving the States and the people of those States the greatest say over their tax dollars and the wisdom of having those dollars at their discretion--and if several States do go through the legislative process, putting a replacement tax on the books, there is a question and doubt about that, I am sure the Senator will agree with me--but with due respect, this amendment, were it to be adopted by the Senate, would be literally destructive of this bill and the work that the committee, under the leadership of the distinguished chairman and ranking member and myself, have provided these many, many months to get where we are. 
I think we have at long last, Mr. President, reconciled many, many differences to try and bring back a feeling of credibility in the principle of equity of distribution among the several States. 
The needs for the highway system are clearly in the minds of all Senators, as well as, I am sure, the Senator from Florida. There is no dispute there. So we are down here in the final hours of this bill now faced with an amendment which would, in my judgment, simply be destructive and would result in the unraveling of the bill as it presently is before the Senate. 
At this point I am perfectly willing to yield the floor if other Senators wish to speak to the issue. I see the distinguished chairman of the Finance Committee and my distinguished chairman of the Environment Committee.

I will make a motion at an appropriate time here on the Budget Act, just to inform Senators, but I remind Senators we are ready to move on this amendment. If any Senator desires to speak, he or she should make that known to the managers of the bill. 
I agree with my colleague from Montana. I am prepared to yield back the time in opposition.

Mr. WARNER. I might say we have a basic disagreement on the likelihood that the States would all enact the tax promptly, but that certainly is an issue to be understood by all Senators. 
As to the funding, yes, the Senator is correct. The underlying bill which came out of the subcommittee, which I am privileged to chair, of which the distinguished Senator from Montana is the ranking member, did not have these funds. I and, as a ranking member, Mr. Baucus, joined Senators Byrd and Gramm, 
and the rest is history. This amendment was adopted very strongly in the Senate. 
I have to say as to the bill as it has been amended under the leadership of the distinguished chairman, the Senator from Rhode Island, we have had to make some modifications to the allocation in the underlying bill as we placed on top the Chafee amendment which added the funds derived from the Byrd-Gramm-Warner-Baucus amendment. 
I assure the Senator that with the funding profile in this bill of equity among the States, where we had a 90 percent return in the original bill out of subcommittee and now we have achieved, I think, in many instances a 91 percent return in the combination of the underlying bill and the Chafee amendment, such amendments as we put on, some today, are--I use the word not `killer' but `destructive,' out of my respect for my good friend.

Just prior thereto, I shall make the following motion, 
which I do not make now but I state for the Record and for the information of all Senators: 
The amendment offered by the Senator from Florida, Mr. Mack, repeals 4.3 cents of the Federal gasoline tax. This amendment would result in a loss of Federal revenue of nearly $6 billion for the first year and $30 billion over 5 years. The loss of revenue will cause a breach of the revenue floor established in the budget resolution. Therefore, I raise a point of order under section 311(a)(2)(b) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 against the pending amendment. 
I will ask the Chair at the appropriate time that that be stated.

Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I will take about 2 minutes, and then I will yield the floor. 
First, I say to our distinguished colleague from Florida that, while we, first, disagree on this issue, he, indeed, has been a partner. He is a very valued member of the Environment and Public Works Committee. He has been in the forefront of this legislation beginning back in 1991 when there was a recognition that the donor States were simply not getting an equitable allocation. Under his leadership, we put together step 21, which was the coalition of the various highway officials in the several States that were donor States who worked for years on procedures by which to correct the inequities that were placed on the donor States in 1991. We should always remember, it was that group that was the foundation group of the legislation that we now are considering here in the Senate. Eventually that was joined with a group under the leadership of the distinguished Senator from Montana, Mr. Baucus, Stars 2000, and it was that coalition that began to move this legislation. I shall always be grateful. Also, the Senator from Florida was very helpful, drawing on his experience as Governor, in streamlining this procedure so the various highway projects, once authorized, funds appropriated through the States, were started, and you could expedite the Federal Highway Administration and the like to get them done on time. 
We shall always remember with great respect the contributions of the distinguished Senator from Florida. I point out both Senators from Florida. I notice that under ISTEA I, since 1991, you received 81 cents on the dollar. Under this bill before the Senate, Florida will receive a 52 percent increase, approximately. That is quite an achievement which the two Senators from Florida have made. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. WARNER. I wish to thank the distinguished Senator from Georgia. He worked long and hard on this amendment. It involves a lot of small--five States are touched by this amendment--small rural areas. Without his leadership on it, it is not likely this matter would have been incorporated in this bill. I thank the Senator.

Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation which will preserve a site of great historical importance. The legacy of Civil War battlefields must be perpetuated, not only to commemorate those who lost their lives in this tragic epoch, but also to consecrate land upon which some of our country's finest strategic maneuvers occurred. On the hallowed land of Wilderness, VA occurred one of the greatest tactical stratagems in military history. Snatching the initiative to turn the tide of battle, Lt. Gen. James A. Longstreet, under the command of Gen. Robert E. Lee, forced back Union forces directed by Gen. Ulysses S. Grant, in an advance known as `Longstreet's Flank Attack.' 
Mr. President, this legislation will allow the Park Service to acquire this stretch of land, which will serve to complete Wilderness Battlefield. The legacy of the Civil War is far-reaching. A war which wrought such destruction has been the source of much fascination for scholars and amateur historians. The Battle of Wilderness is legendary for the tactical skills employed and the caliber of the soldiers who fought. There, among the tangled forests and twisted undergrowth, the Union Army, numerically superior and well supplied, were forced into confrontation with General Lee's hardscrabble Confederate troops. It would be one of the last battles in which Lee's incomparable martial machine would force Grant's Army of the Potomac to withdraw. It is also the site of the wounding of General Longstreet, who, like Gen. Stonewall Jackson, was wounded by friendly fire. Though Longstreet's injury was not mortal, the genius of the cadre of officers under the command of Lee dwindled. Thus would begin the twilight of the Confederacy. 
Legislation passed in the 102d Congress would have allowed the Park Service to acquire this land by donation. Despite numerous efforts, the Park Service has been unable to accomplish this. The legislation at hand would amend Public law 102-541 to allow the Park Service to procure the land by purchase or exchange as well as donation. The heritage and history which dwell amongst the interlaced undergrowth of this land deserve our recognition. I look forward to the swift passage of this bill.

Mr. WARNER. Mr. President I rise today to offer legislation to commemorate the 200th anniversary of the death of our Founding Father, George Washington. 
The legacy of Washington cannot be overestimated. Noble in spirit, honorable in deed, George Washington was a just leader, whose firm moral character provided an enduring example for the young nation he had fought so courageously to win. Over the past two centuries, the traditions Washington set forth for his country--patriotism, generosity, honesty, and diplomacy--became the paragons for countries attempting to inaugurate democracy throughout the world. Perhaps President Lincoln, an ardent admirer of Washington, said it best in his remarks,  
Washington is the mightiest name of earth . . . To add brightness to the sun or glory to the name of Washington is alike impossible. Let none attempt it. In solemn awe pronounce the name, and in its naked deathless splendor, leave it shining on. 
Despite his role in the founding of our Nation, and the high esteem in which all Americans hold our first President, less and less in known about this great leader. Educators lament that history textbooks are woefully inadequate in documenting the strong and engaging constitution of Washington, and the many lesser known aspects of his life. Washington was an innovative farmer, a skillful surveyor, a gifted debater and orator, as well as a courageous and indeed visionary soldier and President. In an era when role models in the United States and the world at large, possessing good judgment and character, are in decline, let us further examine the life of one so fervent in his convictions. 
As the bicentennial of Washington's death approaches, I ask the Senate to join me in celebrating the life of our distinguished first President, and dedicate this year long commemoration to learning more about his fascinating life and career. On December 14th, 1999, let flags throughout our great Nation be lowered to commemorate this life of this heroic man. Let bells everywhere extoll his steadfastness. Let the entire year of 1999 be the year in which we rediscover the legacy of the man who is still `First in War, First in Peace, and First in the Heart of his Countrymen.'

<TEXT>
Mr. WARNER. This will be a very thorough debate because it is a serious issue. It seems to me there are many facets to this debate. One is the important one raised by my colleagues who have just been speaking as to the constitutionality. Then each Senator has to reach his or her own opinion on the constitutionality. Then there seem to be other factors that have to be taken into consideration. 
I rise to alert Senators to take a look at the importance of this amendment. It so happens this bill is mine. I was the author of it as chairman of the subcommittee. We considered this issue, and I determined we should keep this provision in, despite the Adarand case and the development of the law in the course of the writing of the bill. 
I urge Senators to begin to study, as a part of their preparation for floor statements and decisions, the important aspect of this amendment on the growth of the participation by women in this country in their ability to compete as professionals in this area of work. 
There are charts available; for example, in Virginia, the percent of growth since 1987 in firms of women, an 84 percent increase in the number of firms that are managed, owned, and operated by women in my State. Each State is on this chart. I urge Senators to look at that. 
Then the department of Federal highways, DOT, has prepared for each State a chart showing the percentage of these DBE highway contracts that go to women. Particularly in my State, 44 percent of these contracts under the DBE Program go to firms that in this instance are nonminority women--a very significant amount of work. 
Another chart that Senators should look at is a comparison of the Federal highway programs that have been since 1983 subject to the DBE provisions, and the participation by the minority firms in the Federal program as compared to the participation in State programs. My State is not on this particular chart, but, for example, I will take Connecticut, 15.7 percent participate under the Federal program; 5.2 percent under the State program. Arkansas, 11.9 percent under the Federal programs; 2.9 percent under the State programs. I will let the distinguished Senator from Rhode Island address this chart; 12 percent in Rhode Island under the Federal program; 0 percent under the State program. Maybe there is some explanation. 
I just rise to alert Senators to include this as part of their study. 
Mr. President, some have made statements to the fact that the DBE Program has not been effective. I want to address--and indeed rebut--that point. 
Let's look at the effect on women-owned highway contracting businesses. The effect has been dramatic. Since 1987, when women were added to the DBE, women-owned highway contracting businesses increased in number by 157 percent. 
And women-owned businesses get a significant portion of the DBE funds. Here are some examples: 
Alaska: 75 percent of DBE funds go to women ($11.8 mil. of $15.7 mil.) 
Indiana: 68 percent of DBE funds go to women ($21.5 mil. of $31.5 mil.) 
Mississippi: 87 percent of DBE funds go to women ($19.5 mil. of $22.4 mil.) 
New Hampshire: 63 percent of DBE funds go to women ($6.0 mil. of $9.6 mil.) 
and in my State of Virginia 44 percent of DBE funds went to women ($14.1 mil. of $32.6 mil.). 
In sum, the DBE Program has helped promote women's participation in the construction industry, and will continue to do so under this bill and the new regs. 
Without this program, it is questionable that women would have this opportunity. Let's compare some State programs--without DBE--and their Federal aid programs:  ---------------------------------------  Federal (DBE) State (No DBE)  --------------------------------------- Arkansas 11.9 2.9  Louisiana 12.4 0.4  Missouri 15.1 1.7  --------------------------------------- 
I believe data like that shows that DBE plays a critical role in allowing women to compete. This is not a giveaway; they must still be the low bidder, obtain bonding, and perform the contract according to its terms. 
The case for opportunities for minorities is equally clear. Thanks to the DBE Program, persons of all race and ethnicity have had the opportunity to compete for federally assisted State highway contracts. 
With regard to the debate about the constitutionality of this program, I reviewed what the Supreme Court said in the Adarand case. 
Justice O'Connor, for the majority, made it clear that the Federal Government may undertake affirmative action programs as long as they meet the `strict scrutiny' standard. The Court did not outlaw Federal affirmative action. 
Indeed, Justice O'Connor stated: 
When race-based action is necessary to further a compelling interest, such action is within constitutional constraints if it satisfies the `narrow tailoring' test . . . 
As for the district court, to which the case was remanded, Judge Kane's decision did not ban affirmative action either. 
When Judge Kane looked at the program, he said: 
I conclude Congress has a strong basis in evidence for enacting the challenged statutes, which thus serve a `compelling governmental interest.' 
In other words, the program achieves one of the two `strict scrutiny' requirements. 
As for the second requirement of `narrow tailoring,' U.S. District Judge Kane stated the program's regulations did not meet that requirement. 
But given that the Department of Transportation is readying new regulations that are specifically designed to meet the narrow tailoring requirement, it seems to me that that problem is going to be taken care of. 
In sum, the DBE Program will be in full compliance with Adarand. Indeed, as the chairman of the Subcommittee on Transportation, I intend to make sure of that and hold the Department to that standard. 
Therefore, I believe that the DBE Program in this bill is both critical to opportunities for women and minorities in the highway construction industry, and constitutional. It is a program important to a wide range of socially and economically disadvantaged persons, including many in the State of Virginia. Thus, I will be supporting the committee bill and opposing the pending amendment.

Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I want to defer to the distinguishing ranking member. Then I shall follow dutifully the seniority of our committee. 
First, I thank the chairman, and I will include those remarks. 
But we have on the floor here the distinguished senior Senator from South Carolina, the President pro tempore, who has counseled with me, and other members of the committee, on a regular basis concerning this. The distinguished Senator represents South Carolina, which is in the category of a donor State, as is the State of Virginia. I wish to assure the senior Senator from South Carolina--and perhaps the chairman can join me--that his State will receive an allocation of 91 percent under the formulation that I and others have worked out. We, in the course of the recalculation, specifically asked the chairman and the distinguished ranking member, as, over the weekend, we reworked the formula. It was my desire to raise the level from 90 to 91 percent with respect to as many donor States as we could achieve. But according to my calculations, I represent to the distinguished Senator from South Carolina that his State has achieved a 91 percent mark.

Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I wonder if the Senator will engage in a colloquy? As subcommittee chairman--fortunately, I have had as my ranking member the distinguished Senator from Montana from the very first day of the consideration of this bill in the Environment Committee, and of course we initiated the work in the subcommittee. The Senator from Montana and I decided that we were not going to seek retribution for some of the inequities in the 1991 ISTEA, but we were going to try to establish a formula and other provisions in the bill which brought about the greatest equity achievable, in a bipartisan way, in this piece of legislation. I feel that we have remained true to that fundamental principle that the Senator from Montana and I laid down on day 1. 
Do you share that view?

Mr. WARNER. I thank my colleague, because I felt as a trustee of these funds--and when you and I, for example, joined on the first amendment to try to add additional funding, we were going to win that when, obviously, leadership was able to persuade one or two colleagues and we came within one vote, to my recollection. 
Then along came the distinguished senior Senator from Texas and our distinguished former majority leader, the distinguished Senator from West Virginia, and you and I joined in that effort, even though we were at odds with our distinguished chairman and other members of the committee. We felt it was imperative to add these funds. With the add-on, I want to make clear, we left the basic formula intact, 90 percent intact, and simply superimposed this amendment on top. 
Again, under the guidance of the distinguished chairman of the committee and yourself--and I had a voice in it, of course--we again tried to achieve equity. I specifically asked the chairman to make certain that in the recalculation, over the weekend, we get as many States as possible above the 90 to 91 percent. I think we have done that. There may be some 90.8, some fraction. But in order to achieve the fundamental equity, we did our very best in superimposing this add-on, on the undisturbed basic bill, as the allocations were made up in that bill.

Mr. WARNER. Now with Senator Chafee's leadership, we got another unanimous vote in our committee. But I have felt the will of the entire Senate was represented in various groups on our committee. We listened carefully, took things into consideration, and did the best we could. I am urging Senators to support this amendment. But I caution those who want to come and perhaps give their own proposal, be careful, because once you take one part of this formula and move it, you will be surprised how all the States begin to go up and down in other areas of the calculations. 
So, I think the Senate will have to repose a lot of trust in our committee. But that trust is predicated on the principle of fairness that we started with when the first word of this bill was placed down by the subcommittee, and it has transcended--that concept of fairness is throughout our work. 
I thank my distinguished colleague.

Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished senior Senator from Texas for his remarks, personal and otherwise, directed at those who put together this amendment. 
But now I say to all colleagues, we are entering into that phase which I have called in previous iterations of the highway bill, the `battle of the charts.' And the charts are coming over the transom, under the transom, and from all directions. And it comes down to whether or not someone can put up a matrix which benefits their State a little bit more. But I assure you, it is at the detriment of someone else. And you have to at some point, when the votes come, decide: Did the committee or did not the committee try and do an equitable distribution of the funds? 
The basic bill reported out by the subcommittee, then by the full committee, is unchanged. But in working out the most equitable distribution we could under the add-on, as a consequence of the Byrd-Gramm-Baucus-Warner amendment, you could figure it several different ways. And therein I presume the debate will focus in just such time as we proceed to vote on this amendment. And there are means by which you could calculate it in a different way. 
I think Senators are perfectly entitled to fight. And they should. But it all comes back to, will their formula be viewed as an equitable distribution of the funds? 
And I say that when the final vote is taken it is my hope and it is my expectation that the Senate will express its confidence in the ability of the committee--under the guidance of the distinguished majority leader, and, indeed, with the valued input of Senator Byrd, Senator Gramm of Texas--that we did the best we could to make equitable distribution of the apple. 
So let us now engage in the `battle of the charts.' I hope Senators will come to the floor and express their views with respect to their individual States and their own view as to whether or not equity was achieved. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Texas. It has been interesting. I may have made a mistake. Perhaps I should have taken the block of money that was to correct the inequity of the donor States and put it up there above the line as one of those programs. But it was a program. While not clearly identified above, it was a program. Let me give you some examples. 
In the 1991 ISTEA I bill--I was a conferee and I was in the second row and was told to be quiet while the dominating chairmen, predominantly from the Northeast, controlled it. That bill came out, and Massachusetts got $2.45; Connecticut, $1.92; New York, $1.25; Maine, $1.23; New Jersey, $1.09; Pennsylvania, $1.16. The donor States: South Carolina got 72 cents; Missouri, 85 cents; Michigan, 80 cents; Mississippi, 83 cents; Virginia, 79 cents; Florida, 82 cents. 
You bet I took a block of money and I straightened it out, together with the support of my distinguished ranking member, the senior Senator from Montana. We straightened it out. We took a chunk of money and balanced that thing out so that now, with the underlying bill, they get 90 cents--not these egregious disproportionate sums, but 90 cents. 
With the amendment before us, we tried to allocate the dollars so the donor States came up--as many as we could--to 91 cents. Maybe one or two were a fraction under, about 90.8 cents. But that's what we tried to do under this bill. There it is. 
I am going to put into the Record at this point a chart, in the battle of the charts now, to show all of the States and how they fared under the 1991 bill compared to the underlying bill at 90 percent.

Mr. WARNER. Before we invoke too much history here, it wasn't just the South; it was Michigan and some other States that were in the donor category. But I am going to put this on the table. So, when the call up yonder is taken here shortly on this amendment, you can see exactly where you fared under the 1991 bill compared to where you fare under this bill. And it is absolutely striking. 
Again, I am back to try to be helpful among the several States. There stands 90 like a stone wall. We tried to get above 90 as best we could for as many donor States. And I think when the final charts come out, I can show you exactly where the donor States went under the recalculations that we get under the amendment. 
But I thank the Senator from Texas. It was very interesting to listen to his rendition, which was accurate, or I would have interjected. It was accurate as to how these bills have been put through, through the years. And you can fault the ARC. My State happens to be a beneficiary. Therefore, when I speak in support of ARC, I do so think that Virginia is a beneficiary. It is proudly in the Appalachian corridor. But that program has been there since 1965. It was enacted by the U.S. Senate in conjunction with the House. As a matter of fact, I think it was William Jennings Randolph who was then chairman of the committee on which I am proudly serving, and now under the leadership of Senator Chafee and Senator Baucus. But that was at that time. And it is a program that is unfinished, as Senator Byrd pointed out, and hopefully this will take it almost to completion under this bill. 
So I thank the Senator from Texas. 
Mr. President, if there are other Senators desiring to speak, I will yield the floor.

Mr. WARNER. Mr. President I wish to associate myself with other colleagues who have risen today to address the importance of the issue of NATO expansion. For almost a year's time now, I have expressed publicly, both in this country and in Europe, my deep reservations about the proposed expansion of this alliance. I listened carefully to a briefing about the remarks of my colleagues today, and I wish to associate myself with their remarks because I think this body must spend whatever time it feels is necessary to carefully analyze this question. 
NATO was put in place at a historic moment in our history. I always credit President Harry Truman for his foresight, together with that of others, regarding the importance of this wonderful, absolutely magnificent, military alliance that has exceeded, in every way, the expectations of its founders. Unquestionably, in this Senator's mind, and I think in the minds of many, we averted a military confrontation with the former Soviet Union as a consequence of the NATO treaty. I think that the basic tensions that existed in Europe at that time exist today, although not at the same level of intensity. 
There has always been a measure of instability between the major powers on the continent and indeed with Great Britain. The United States has fulfilled, I think, quietly, nevertheless effectively, a strong, steady hand on those competitive forces amongst those very ancient nations--certainly ancient in terms of the 200-plus-year history of this country--as they have struggled in terms of economic competition and, indeed, tragically in military confrontations in years past. 
My father served in World War I in France as a doctor. That was the first time that the United States really responded militarily by going to that continent. And then, of course, World War II is very clear in the memories of all. So those are just two examples.

Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I would like to thank my distinguished colleague, Senator Moynihan, from New York from being my principal co-sponsor. Throughout he has been a consistent supporter of this objective and will be the principal Member from the other side of the aisle as I work this amendment among our body. 
Let me also say thanks for the very important contributions of Senator Bingaman. He serves on the Senate Armed Services Committee with me. He is a broad-based thinker on national security issues, and he will be joining us as we seek to get the support of our colleagues. 
As I stated throughout last year, 1997, and continuing this year, I publicly have spoken here and in Europe regarding my deep concerns over the proposed expansion of NATO by admitting Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic, which is the current proposal. 
I believe these accessions are not in the security interests of the NATO alliance. My detailed reasons against are to be found in earlier statements. 
In the course of the ratification debate, I will work with colleagues in opposition to the ratification of these three nations. I view my amendment, however, as supportive of our shared goals, and in no way should it be viewed as a concession on my part in my opposition or an indication that I accept the accession of Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic as a fait accompli. But I have had this amendment in mind, and I have spoken about it. I discussed it at length at the Wehrkunde conference a few weeks ago when I was privileged to be in the company of the Secretary of Defense and the delegation from the Senate that was headed by Senator McCain, one of our most valued Members in areas of national defense. I am not suggesting that either of those persons share my view, but I did at that time express it very clearly to a number of persons attending that conference. 
This condition does not affect the three nations currently under consideration for NATO membership--Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic. Rather it focuses on the future by requiring a `strategic pause' of 3 years before proceeding with any further expansion of NATO membership. 
As to my reasons for opposition to NATO expansion, I start from the basic premise that NATO has been the most successful military alliance in the history of the United States, perhaps, in the history of the world. NATO has surpassed all of the expectations of its founders, keeping peace in Europe for almost 50 years and emerging victorious in the cold war. In my view, NATO remains a vital, effective military alliance which will continue--in its present form--to be the bedrock of U.S. security policy in Europe. 
In his biography, Harry Truman cited NATO, together with the Marshall plan, as the greatest achievements of his Presidency. The Senate should not do anything to undermine his legacy or the effectiveness of this great alliance. 
The condition I am introducing today is straightforward. It requires the President to certify `that it is the policy of the United States not to encourage, participate in, or agree to any further expansion in the membership of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) for a period of at least three years' beginning on the date of entry into force of the last of the Protocols of Accession of Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic. 
Why is this condition necessary? Assuming the Protocols of Accession are approved by all 16 nations, this condition would give NATO an opportunity to begin to integrate the first three new members and assess the impact of this first round of expansion before proceeding to any future rounds. 
There are many unanswered questions concerning this first round of expansion. 
What will the true costs of expansion be for current and new members? Estimates have ranged from a low of $1.5 billion over 10 years to a high of $125 billion over the same timeframe. What is the U.S. share of this cost and will our current allies fairly share the burdens of expansion? 
How long will it take for these new nations to modernize their militaries to the point where they can make a positive contribution to the security of the alliance? NATO's 10-year cost time line indicates that NATO is planning on at least a decade of modernization and integration efforts. Do we really want to add additional burdens to that ambitious plan? 
On a related issue, Thursday's `Washington Post' carried an article entitled, `Poland Unable to Perform All NATO Tasks.' Citing `budgetary shortfalls,' the Polish Defense Ministry announced that Poland would only be able to meet 70% of its expected military roles within NATO upon accession. What is interesting about this story is not the military shortfalls--which many of us anticipated--but the fact that these shortfalls are being revealed as NATO is currently going through the process of assessing the military capabilities of these three nations and establishing force goals for them. This is a process which will not be completed until late spring or early summer--months after the Senate is being asked to act on these Protocols. 
I am led to the inevitable conclusion that we are being asked to act on the vital issue of NATO expansion in an information vacuum. In an October 1997 statement to the Senate Budget Committee, Susan Eisenhower addressed this issue with a frightening analogy: `If ratification is to be voted on now or in the next session, it would be as if an air traffic control agent had cleared a plane for take-off, knowing full well that the crew on board had filed several contradictory flight plans, didn't know when or if they'd pick up other passengers, and weren't even sure that their landing gear worked.' 
Returning to my series of questions: How will the Russians react to the reality of NATO expansion eastward? While I agree that the Russians should not be placed in a position of dictating United States or NATO policy, we must factor into this equation the reaction of the only nation on earth that possesses the military capability to destroy our nation. 
Will the American people support the use of U.S. troops to defend Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, and possibly more nations in Central and Eastern Europe? Or are our security 
commitments being stretched too thin? 
Time alone will answer these questions. We should not rush forward with a follow-on expansion round beginning in April 1999, immediately after these first three new members take their seat at the table. We need to know the impact of this first round on the alliance and not allow ourselves to be swayed by political reasons to rush ahead, uninformed. 
I well remember the NATO debates of the 1980's when Senator Mansfield, former majority leader, led the charge to withdraw our troops from Europe. Other picked up his mantle when he departed the Senate. Almost annually, those of us who supported NATO were summoned to come to the floor and defend the U.S. troop commitment to NATO. I fear that we could see a repeat of those times if we do not proceed cautiously with NATO expansion, and ensure that any expansion has the full support of the American people who will ultimately bear the burden for these added security commitments. 
In a June 1997 report entitled, `NATO Expansion: A Bridge to the Nineteenth Century,' Professor Michael Mandelbaum expressed these concerns in the following way:  
When the American public decides that an international commitment has been extended under false pretenses, or that such a commitment is more expensive than its government has promised, or that whatever the government has promised the cost of the commitment is too high, it tends to withdraw its support, which causes the commitment in question to collapse. 
That is my biggest fear with NATO expansion--that it could undermine the American public's support for NATO itself. 
I believe the 3-year timeframe contained in this condition is a reasonable one. It is long enough for NATO to have made a reasonable assessment of the impact of the first round, but it is not so long as to remove hope from future aspirants to NATO membership. Many have advocated a longer moratorium. My good friend and former colleague Sam Nunn, when he was still in the Senate, recommended a 10-year pause between rounds. 
Senator Nunn recently joined with Senator Baker, General Scowcroft, and Alton Frye in an excellent op-ed regarding NATO expansion entitled, `NATO: A Debate Recast.' They join me in a call for caution on any further rounds of expansion. According to this article, `NATO should be the cornerstone of an evolving security order in Europe . . . But a cornerstone is not a sponge. The function of a cornerstone is to protect its own integrity to support a wider security structure, not to dissipate its cohesion by absorbing members and responsibilities beyond prudent limits.' They recommend a `definite, if not permanent, pause' in the process of expansion. 
Former Secretaries Perry and Christopher also recently joined the ranks of those urging caution regarding further expansion of the alliance. I do not want to misrepresent their position--they clearly state that the door should remain open to membership for all Partnership for Peace nations. However, they argue that `no additional nations should be designated for admission until the three countries now in the NATO queue (Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic) are fully prepared to bear the responsibilities of membership and have been fully integrated into the alliance military and political structures.' While they do not endorse the idea of a mandated pause, they clearly believe that the process should be slowed down. I agree. 
I urge my colleagues to join me in this endeavor to inject an element of caution into U.S. policy on this important issue. 
I also want to add that in the course of my trip to Europe two weeks ago with the Secretary of Defense, we visited Russia. We visited with the Defense Minister, Marshall Sergeyev, and the Foreign Minister, and we had a very valuable session with about eight members of the Russian Duma. NATO expansion was their No. 1 area of concern regarding the relationship between the United States and Russia today. That relationship, in the minds of many, is deteriorating--deteriorating at the very time when we are making a number of collaborative efforts to try to lessen not only tensions that still remain between our two nations but in furtherance of the recognition that the world can become a more peaceful and a more secure place if Russia and the United States join in many areas to provide that peaceful security. 
For example, Bosnia. Today there is a contingent of professional Russian military serving alongside U.S. forces and those of our allied nations. That is a most historic first. 
While in Russia with the Secretary of Defense, we went to visit facilities which are utilizing moneys authorized and appropriated by the U.S. Senate, and Congress as a whole, again directed towards lessening the tensions between these two nations in the area of nuclear weapons. 
We saw, for example, where American taxpayer dollars paid for equipment which the Russians are now using to dismantle, in accordance with framework of treaties, nuclear weapons in a safe manner using technology which originated here in the United States and supplemented by technology in Russia. There is only really one major threat to the security of this country that always hangs above all others; that is, that Russia still possesses, and for the foreseeable future will possess, a nuclear arsenal that could devastate our Nation. I am not suggesting in any way that we are not making progress toward the lessening of tensions, but it remains there. Of course, beneath that is the threat of spreading knowledge relating to weapons of mass destruction. Much of that knowledge is leaking out of the former Soviet Union, today Russia, as to how to manufacture those weapons. 
I think that we should address in the context of the expansion argument the concerns of the Russian Duma, or the Russian leadership, regarding this expansion and how it might affect our relationship with Russia at this critical point in time. 
This valuable NATO alliance has been with us for over a half a century. I don't suggest that we spend the next half century considering this expansion issue, but certainly the several months that we need can be allocated to the important debate that will take place in this Chamber, maybe a time less than several months, but certainly not this rush of schedule that we are on now. 
So I raise these issues today because the distinguished chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, I understand, intends to have a markup next week. I think, in fairness to him and to the colleagues on that committee and to other Senators, I and others should express these concerns in a timely fashion today. 
Mr. President, that concludes my remarks. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished colleague. And indeed the Senator from Montana and I have been partners on this throughout. There was a time when it was just the two of us together. And we stood steadfast and put together the basic coalition of States that gave us the nucleus of concepts and ideas which were incorporated in the subcommittee bill, of which I am privileged to chair and the distinguished Senator from Montana is not only ranking on the full committee but he is ranking on the subcommittee that drew up this bill. 
I thank him because there were some lonely days in the course of the development of this bill, and we stood together as we have throughout. He has quite properly acknowledged the important contributions of Senator Byrd and Senator Phil Gramm of Texas. And we have been meeting together with the distinguished majority leader, the chairman of the Budget Committee, chairman Chafee, Chairman D'Amato, as we try to work through a solution to the timing and the presentation of that amendment. 
So, Mr. President, I want to give a statement on behalf of the bill. But two of our colleagues have time constraints, and if it is agreeable to the distinguished floor manager here on the Democrat side, I would like to yield at this point in time the floor such that these Senators can get recognition and do their important work. 
I yield the floor. 
Mr. HUTCHINSON addressed the Chair.

Mr. WARNER. I was not able to be here when our distinguished colleague from West Virginia spoke, but I am sure the Senator got the assurance of our colleagues to work this problem out, together with the Republican leader, and I am sure, shortly, the Democrat leader, will likewise join. I think it is in the interests of the Senate that this legislation move. That was very definitely Senator Lott's principal motivation to try and assemble this meeting today. We would not have reached this meeting today had it not been for the leadership shown by the distinguished Senator from West Virginia and the senior Senator from Texas. 
Here we go. Let's hope for the best.

Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I say to my distinguished colleague, you will recall Senator Baucus and I had an amendment early on in this procedure. It failed, by my recollection, by one single vote. I believe the distinguished Senator from West Virginia joined in our amendment urging the Senate for a greater allocation of spending. 
I do believe, however, there is considerable momentum not only within the 53 Senators who have joined in this Byrd amendment but other Senators who are hearing from their respective highway constituencies, and that is not just the road builders, that is the citizens that use the highways. 
As the distinguished Senator from West Virginia pointed out in our meeting with the majority leader this morning, there is one-third growth in the use of highway structure, which in and of itself is perhaps only one-third to 40 percent in top shape. So it is essential for America that this is truly a bipartisan effort, for America to move ahead to improve its infrastructure transportation. 
I thank the distinguished Senator.

Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise in support of the nomination. If my colleagues will permit me to tell a short personal story, my father was a medical doctor and he practiced the last half of his career in the greater metropolitan area of the Nation's Capital, largely in Virginia. He was a marvelous man. His whole life was his family and medicine. He was sort of in that vintage of the old timers who, when you called, he got in his car or he walked or whatever the case may be, and he went to the homes and the hospitals and tended to the sick and the needy. 
I can remember in the Depression days, people would come to our front door and he never hesitated to give his God-given brains and expertise to the assistance of others. I have to tell you, Mr. President, I have said this before, if I had half the brains of my father I would have gone to medical school but I came up short and had to sort of accept the lot that was cast me.

Mr. WARNER. That letter, together with the endorsement of other recognized medical organizations and physicians in my State, corroborated my own findings. For that reason I am privileged and pleased to cast my vote for the nominee. 
I regret, however, that he does not hold all the views that I hold. Particularly, I am opposed to partial-birth abortion and have consistently and will consistently vote to try to end that tragic practice. But we cannot expect this nominee or the nominee for Secretary of State or Defense to hold views which are consistent in their entirety with the views of individual Senators. I have been here, this is my 19th year now. I have cast many votes for nominees, and often you do so based on the totality of the credentials.

Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I have listened very carefully to the senior Senator from West Virginia, Mr. Byrd, as he has every day taken the floor regarding the need for the U.S. Senate to address S. 1173, a bill that I named the ISTEA 2 authorization bill, since it came through my subcommittee on the Environment and Public Works Committee. 
I joined with Senator Byrd, the senior Senator from Texas, Mr. Gramm, and the senior Senator from Montana, Mr. Baucus, who is the ranking member on my subcommittee and the full committee, in an amendment which will ensure that a greater amount of funds will go to the Nation's infrastructure of highways. 
Under the leadership of Senator Byrd, the four of us on this particular amendment have been talking to a number of Senators. We are very pleased to announce that we are up to 52 cosponsors. I met earlier today with a group of Governors who have an organization termed `trust,' and they have visited the Nation's Capitol to speak particularly with Senators on the urgency of addressing this bill and passing the needed legislation so funds can flow to the new construction programs for this calendar year. 
The most fervent appeals for prompt consideration of this bill understandably come from the States in the northern tier of the United States of America, because they have a very short season within which to do the needed construction because of the severity of the weather. The distinguished Presiding Officer has some specific knowledge about the needs based on his own experience in this field. We have talked about it many times. It is my understanding he is also a cosponsor of the Byrd-Gramm-Warner-Baucus amendment. 
The Senate has very few legislative days comparatively this session, perhaps as few as 100, given that we, by necessity, must leave early in the fall given the elections this year, and, therefore, it would be my hope that the leadership could judge this period within the next few weeks as a suitable time within which to bring up this very important piece of legislation. 
It had been my hope and understanding based on commitments made last fall that the Senate would be debating this bill at this time. 
I want to share with my Senate colleagues my strong concerns about the impacts of a prolonged delay in considering this bill on our state transportation partners and on employment in many industries engaged in highway and bridge construction activities. 
This important legislation to reauthorize our nation's surface transportation programs was reported unanimously from the Committee on Environment and Public Works on October 1, 1997. 
We all know of the difficulties that delayed consideration of this bill last October. Because of this, a short-term extension of ISTEA was enacted to provide a modest amount of funding to our states to keep our safety, highway construction and transit programs going. 
Many expressed reservations about the wisdom of providing a brief extension of ISTEA funds for fear that Congress would not promptly consider the full reauthorization bill early this session. Regrettably, those concerns appear to be coming true. 
Mr. President, since October 1, our states have been struggling to manage their safety, highway and transit programs on a temporary, stop-gap basis. The ISTEA Extension Act provided only approximately six-months worth of funds--enough to last from October to this March. So, in approximately 7 weeks, our states will have exhausted the funds released in the short-term ISTEA Extension bill. 
I want to be sure that my colleagues also understand the impacts of the May 1st deadline provided in the ISTEA Extension bill. That provision prohibits states from spending any federal highway dollars after May 1st. So, states who want to prudently manage their federal dollars are prohibited from stretching them out to last during the summer construction season. 
During consideration of the short-term extension bill last October, this May 1st limitation was viewed as a way to ensure that all states would be in a similar position--absent passage of a new surface transportation reauthorization bill. 
It was my view that based on the assurances that S. 1173, the ISTEA II reauthorization bill, would be the first order of business this session, the May 1st deadline seemed appropriate. 
If the Senate does not turn to consideration of this critical legislation until after the Budget Resolution, as some of my colleagues are requesting, the entire highway construction season for many states is in jeopardy. 
Waiting for the completion of the Budget Resolution before proceeding to ISTEA is an irresponsible course of action, especially since the estimated completion of the Budget Resolution varies greatly. 
Mr. President, according to AASHTO, the Association of State Secretaries of Transportation, approximately 70 percent of all road and bridge construction, including critical maintenance work, occurs during the peak summer months of June, July and August. 
States must be able to plan today for that work to occur this summer. Projects must be advertised, contractors selected and bids awarded before projects are ready for construction. This process takes months to complete. Our states today are not proceeding with this planning because there is no certainty as to when new transportation funds will be forthcoming. 
We already know that many states are beginning to severely cut back on their construction schedules. 
For these reasons, I believe the Senate must move promptly to consider this legislation. Time is slipping by and millions of jobs are hanging in the balance--awaiting our action. 
These jobs are not just road builders and contractors, but thousands of suppliers of asphalt, stone, steel, and heavy manufacturing equipment. All work will be idle this summer unless we take action soon. 
Mr. President, it is also important to note that delay in considering this legislation not only impacts highway construction activity in our states, the delay also puts our nation's safety and transit programs in jeopardy. 
Highway safety grant programs received only half a year funding in the ISTEA extension bill. Without additional funds major safety initiatives involving safety belt use, child seat use, drunk driving prevention and motor carrier safety programs will cease. 
Mr. President, we must make every effort to ensure that these serious disruptions in our nation's highway, safety and transit programs do not occur. Let's move forward today to consider legislation that was unanimously supported by the Committee on Environment and Public Works. 
I thank the Chair.

Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for his remarks. I wish to add, it is not only the short season but the funding profile. In a number of these States, the reserves are going to expire in that period of time. It is my judgment that we cannot pass an extension in order to allow them a period within which to have these expenditures beyond May 1. So that is a second reason. I thank the Senator for his kind remarks.

Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, today I introduce the Constitutional and Effective Reform of Campaigns Act, or `CERCA'. This legislation is the product of 2 years of hearings in the Rules Committee, discussions with numerous experts, party officials, and candidates, and nearly two decades of participating in campaigns and campaign finance debates in the Senate. Many of the proposals in this bill have been made in some form by several of my Senate colleagues and by Members of the House, and I readily acknowledge drawing on their expertise. Most particularly, the important discussions during the meetings of this year's task force headed by Senator Nickles, at the request of Majority Leader Lott, were invaluable. 
This legislation offers an opportunity for bipartisan support. It is a good faith effort to strike a middle ground between those who believe public financing of campaigns is the solution, and those who believe the solution is to remove current regulations. It offers a package of proposals which realistically can be achieved with bipartisan support and meet the desire of the majority of Americans who believe that our present system can be reformed. In my judgment, we will not succeed with any measure of campaign reform in this complicated field without a bipartisan consensus. 
In drafting this legislation, I began with four premises. First, all provisions had to be consistent with the First Amendment: Congress would be acting in bad faith to adopt provisions which have a likelihood of being struck down by the federal courts. Second, I oppose public financing and mandating `free' or reduced-cost media time which in my mind is neither free nor a good policy idea. Why should seekers of federal office get free time, while candidates for state office or local office--from governors to local sheriffs--do not receive comparable free benefits? Such an inequity and imbalance will breed friction between federal and state office seekers. Third, I believe we should try to increase the role of citizens and the political parties. Fourth, any framework of campaign reform legislation must respect and protect the constitutional right of individuals, groups, and organizations to participate in advocacy concerning political issues. 
This bill is designed to be a `bilateral disarmament' on the tough issues of soft money and union dues: each side must give up equivalent ground. The Republicans should give ground by placing a cap on soft money which has tended to favor our side. And Democrats should give ground by allowing union members to decide voluntarily for themselves whether to contribute the portion of dues which goes to political contributions or activities. 
Specifically, on the issue of soft money, no reform can be considered true reform without placing limits on the corporate and union donations to the national political parties. This bill places a $100,000 cap on such donations. While this provision addresses the public's legitimate concern over the propriety of these large donations, it allows the political parties sufficient funds to maintain their headquarters and conduct their grassroots efforts. In addition, the current limits on `hard' contributions must be updated. The ability of citizens to contribute voluntarily to a wide range of candidates and to their parties is fundamental. 
At the same time, the practice of mandatory union dues going to partisan politics without union members' consent must end: it is counter to all the political freedoms that make America a true democracy. The concept of `paycheck protection' must be included in any campaign finance reform, so that these deductions are voluntary, whether these dues fund direct contributions to candidates or parties, or pay for undisclosed spending on phone banks, get-out-the-vote efforts, literature, and television ads. 
Under this legislation, unions would be required to obtain advance, written consent before deducting money for political activities from union members' paychecks. The present state of the law requires most union workers to give up their rights to participate in the union if they seek refunds of that portion of dues going to politics. In addition, this section would strengthen the reporting requirements for unions engaged in political activities and enhance an aggrieved union member's right to challenge a union's determination of the portion of dues going to political activities. 
In the Senate debates thus far, there has been much discussion about whether corporations should be required to obtain shareholder approval to make political contributions. This is an issue which warrants consideration. My proposal not only limits these corporate and union contributions to $100,000, it also includes a requirement that companies disclose their donations to federal political parties in their annual reports. And under current policies of the Securities and Exchange Commission, shareholders have the same rights to make recommendations to boards of directors on the propriety of political donations as they do on any business issue related to the company. 
In addition, the SEC is in the process of making it easier for shareholders to raise questions related to social policy matters at annual meetings. I am monitoring how these changes are implemented: if they are insufficient to guarantee adequate rights to shareholders, I will consider amending my bill to protect these rights. 
As an aside, I reject the notion that the status of union members is similar to those who belong to groups such as the National Rifle Association or the Sierra Club. Nobody is compelled to join these types of organizations, and those that do, know or should know that their dues are going in part to political causes. 
Furthermore, I considered including in this bill a narrowly-tailored disclosure requirement for individuals and groups spending large sums on public advertising affecting the public image of candidates during election seasons. However, in keeping with my first basic premise that reforms must pass the federal court test of constitutionality, I concluded that such a provision, in view of a long line of Supreme Court cases, likely would be declared unconstitutional, and thus I did not include the provision. 
The McCain-Feingold bill was thoroughly debated in the Senate, and any objective observor of the Senate would agree that we are genuinely deadlocked. This body needs to move beyond the debate of McCain-Feingold. I hope that all Members will review my bill as an objective and pragmatic approach to current problems with our campaign system. I encourage other Members to come forward, as I have, with proposals which objectively represent pragmatic approaches to what can be achieved. I do not claim to have the only solution: those with other ideas should come forward. 
In addition to the issues of soft money and union dues discussed above, nine other fundamental problems--all of which can be solved in a constitutional manner--are the most pressing. Here are these problems, in no particular order, and my proposed solutions: 
Problem 1: Politicians spend too much time fundraising, at the expense of their legislative duties for incumbents, and, for both incumbents and challengers, at the expense of debating the issues with voters. 
Solution: The current individual contribution limit of $1,000 has not been raised, or even indexed for inflation, for over 20 years. This fact requires that candidates must spend more and more time seeking more and more donors. The limit should be doubled, as well as indexed for inflation. 
Problem 2: The influence of voters on campaigns has been diminished by the activities of political action committees and interest groups. 
Solutions: I propose a $100 tax credit for contributions made by citizens, with incomes under specified levels, to Senate and House candidates in their states: this credit should spark an influx of small dollar contributions to balance the greater ability of citizens with higher incomes to participate. 
In addition, the increased individual contribution limit should balance the activities of political action committees. 
Problem 3: The influence of voters on campaigns has been diminished by contributions from those not eligible to vote. 
Solution: If you are not eligible to vote, you should not contribute to campaigns. My bill would prohibit contributions by those ineligible to vote, including non-citizens, children, and persons under felony convictions. It also codifies current regulations concerning political donations by domestic subsidiaries of foreign companies. 
Problem 4: Compared to incumbents, challengers face greater difficulties raising funds and communicating with voters, particularly at the outset of a campaign. 
Solutions: This legislation will allow candidates to receive `seed money' contributions of up to $10,000 from individuals and political action committees. This provision should help get candidacies off the ground. The total amount of these `seed money' contributions could not exceed $100,000 for House candidates or $300,000 for Senate candidates. To meet the constitutional test, this provision would apply to both challengers and incumbents alike, but in the case of an incumbent with money carried over from a prior cycle, those funds would count against the seed money limit. 
Second, Senate incumbents would be barred from using the franking privilege to send out mass mailings during the election year, rather than the sixty day ban in current law. 
Problem 5: Candidates with personal wealth have a distinct advantage through their constitutional right to spend their own funds. 
Solution: If a candidate spends more than $25,000 of his or her own money, the individual contribution limits would be raised to $10,000 so that candidates could raise money to counter that personal spending. Again, to meet constitutional review, this provision would apply to all candidates. 
Problem 6: Current laws prohibiting fundraising activities on federal property are weak and insufficient. 
Solution: The current ban on fundraising on federal property was written before the law created such terms as `hard' and `soft' money. This bill updates this law to require that no fundraising take place on federal property. 
Problem 7: Reporting requirements and public access to disclosure statements are weak and inadequate. 
Solutions: Under this proposal, the FEC would be required to post reports on the Internet for all to see, and to require that candidates, and groups making independent expenditures, make faster and more complete reports. In addition, registered lobbyists would be required to report their campaign contributions and those of their employer on their lobbyist disclosure reports. 
Problem 8: The Federal Election Commission is in need of procedural and substantive reform. 
Solutions: This legislation contains a number of procedural and substantive reforms of the FEC, including term limits for commissioners, and increases in penalties for serious violations. 
Problem 9: The safeguards designed to protect the integrity of our elections are compromised by weak aspects of federal laws regulating voter registration and voting. 
Solutions: The investigations of contested elections in Louisiana and California have shown significant weaknesses in federal laws designed to safeguard the registration and voting processes. The requirement that states allow registration by mail has undermined confidence that only qualified voters are registering to vote and only registering once: states should be allowed to decide whether to allow mail-in registrations. In addition, states should be allowed to require proof of citizenship when registering and proof of identification when voting: we require a photo ID to buy beer or cigarettes and can certainly allow states to protect the voting process by requiring a photo ID. Lastly, this bill would allow states to purge inactive voters and to allow state law to govern whether voters who move without reregistering should be allowed to vote. 
These are the problems which I believe can be solved in a bipartisan fashion. Attached to this statement is a section by section review of the legislation. I look forward to working with my colleagues to enact meaningful campaign reform, by looking at reform beyond the usual soundbites and addressing the real problems with our present system of campaigns.

 Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, this week our nation bowed in humble appreciation and respect to all who have worn the uniforms of the U.S. military in recognition of Veterans' Day. 
Today, family and friends gathered in Arlington Cemetery to give our final salute to one of those veterans--Brigadier General Richard Augustus Edwards, Jr. 
Brigadier General Edwards was born in Smithfield, Virginia and graduated from the Virginia Military Institute in 1939. He joined the Army in 1940 and during World War II served in Burma, India and China with a mule-drawn artillery unit. He became an expert horseman, and competed for the Army in stadium jumping and polo. 
After the war, he attended the Field Artillery School, the Command and General Staff College, and the National War College. He served in various assignments in Japan, Southeast Asia, Europe and the Middle East. His final combat command was the First Field Force Artillery in Vietnam in 1968 and 1969. He retired from military service in 1972 after serving in the Pentagon as head of officer assignments in the Army's Office of Personnel Operations. 
His honors included the Distinguished Service Medal, three Legion of Merit awards and the Bronze Star. I was honored to call him my friend. 
At the Virginia Military Institute, which he loved as dearly as his family, there is an archway through which he passed daily in his formative years as a cadet. It bears this quote attributed to General Stonewall Jackson, C.S.A.: `You may be whatever you resolve to be.' 
General Gus Edwards resolved to be his very best for his country, and his life showed that he achieved that goal. How proud the General would have been today of his son Richard Augustus Edwards, III as he was at his very best and delivered these stirring, heartfelt remarks at his father's funeral. 
`I confess I was taken aback when Dad asked me to say a few words at his funeral. His funeral wasn't something we talked about very much. He wasn't particularly enthused by the topic. But I think his request had something to do with the fact that he was unable to attend his own father's funeral. At the time my grandfather died, we were steaming across the Atlantic to an assignment in Europe. Dad felt he never really got to say goodbye, and I believe it was something that haunted him; something that he didn't want me to experience. But for my part, I was--and am--daunted by his request, especially in this company. What can I possibly say that will be adequate to encompass or define our fifty-two year relationship? How can a son try to impart, in any consequential way, the meaning of a father's lifetime of lessons and love in just a few short minutes? 
I've concluded that, for now, the best thing is to be brief. I will say that my father was a man of many parts; like all of us, simple and complex at once. I think he showed us his simple side most of the time. By simple, I mean unfettered, unaffected and straightforward. 
He had a simple faith. He believed deeply and unequivocally in his God. 
He maintained a strong and simple belief in the rightness of truth and honor. 
He placed a premium on fidelity, and insisted that loyalty is a two-way street. 
He lived always by the VMI Honor Code, never to lie, cheat, or steal nor countenance those who do. 
He despised expedience and had no patience with the cynicism of modern deconstructionists. 
There were not many gray areas in his life. 
He loved his country. He loved his home state of Virginia and he took reasonable pride in his roots, which reached back to Jamestown. 
And most of all, he loved his family. Family was everything to him. He adored and revered his parents. His brothers, their wives and children; my mother's sisters, their husbands and children, all were sources of endless interest, enjoyment and satisfaction to him. He shared forty-eight years with my mother, and they were totally devoted to one another. 
And how he loved his girls: Augusta, who he was so proud to have bear his name; Christine, in whom he took such delight as his first grandchild; Annie, the only woman I know who he genuinely didn't mind losing arguments to, and Babs, who gave so much of herself to him, especially over the last few months. He was one lucky guy. And now he's come full circle. As a newly minted second lieutenant in 1940, he arrived here at Fort Meyer, his first duty station. He lived just a few steps away from this chapel at Quarters 201-A, and he buried old soldiers. Now the time has come to return the honor. 
God bless you, Old Soldier.

 Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, on Tuesday, I was privileged to attend the dedication of the National D-Day memorial. Located in Bedford, VA, among the grandeur of the Blue Ridge Mountains, this memorial truly dignifies those who participated in the historic military operation of June 6, 1944. 
As many of my colleagues may recall, there had not been a national memorial honoring those who served in the D-Day operation. Last year, I offered legislation to establish the National D-Day Memorial and, again, I thank my colleagues for supporting that legislation. 
Gov. George Allen of Virginia, Col. Robert Doughty, and Col. William McIntosh each spoke eloquently on the D-Day operation and the importance of the National D-Day Memorial. I am submitting the text of their remarks and the schedule of the ceremony for the Record. 
I invite my colleagues to review these remarks.

Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the U.S. Marine Corps will be marking another one of its historic birthdays, No. 222. I have been privileged to have worn the Marine green, together with my distinguished colleague here, Senator Chafee. We both served in the Korean war. 
The point of my remarks, Mr. President, is that we have a most unfortunate and, indeed, I think, unforeseen dispute between the U.S. Marine Corps and the Air Force over the location of the memorial which, in every respect, the Air Force deserves and has earned through the sacrifices of its men throughout its history. I remember very distinctly in World War II, it was referred to as the Army Air Corps. And then when the Department of Defense reorganized, they created, quite properly, in recognition of the enormous sacrifices of the members of the Air Corps in World War II, which suffered, then, the highest per capita casualties of any of the combat units. Mr. President, cooler heads have to be brought to bear on this dispute. I am hopeful that can be done. 
The purpose for my seeking recognition today was to recognize the Marine Corps birthday. But into this dispute has come a very solid, fair-minded, and I must say objective person, a former Secretary of the Navy, James Webb.

Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I have known Jim Webb for many years. When I was Secretary of the Navy, he was a young officer on my staff, having served with great distinction, for which this Nation awarded him the highest in military honors and heroism, which, due to his humility, he rarely, if ever, refers to today. But that is so true of many of the men and women who have received those honors. 
Jim Webb has a way of standing back, as he is today, in his various professions, and looking at a situation and carefully and in a balanced way, analyzing it. I urge all those who desire to acquaint themselves with this dispute--particularly those in the Department of the Air Force--to read this article with great care, because he reasons well as to why the Marine Corps Memorial in Arlington, which depicts the raising of the flag on Iwo Jima, which is visited each year by hundreds of thousands of persons from all over the world, has a very unique spot in history and a unique location. 
It is, in my judgment, and the judgment of others, not in the best interest of this country, or our armed services, to dislodge in any way the mystique that surrounds that piece of hallowed ground, as it is referred to by all marines, past, present and, I'm sure, those in the future. 
So, therefore, I urge that all who are interested in this and wish to apply their own sound judgment examine the article of the former Secretary of the Navy, James Webb. 
I yield the floor.  
Mr. KERRY addressed the Chair.

While I philosophically differ from the senior Senator from Massachusetts, I will say he is one of the hardest working Senators that I have ever observed in every respect for those issues for which he fights. That fight comes from the heart. I just wanted to commend the junior Senator for speaking so eloquently about our mutual friend.

Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I have known Senator Chafee since 1969, when we served together in the Department of the Navy. One of the hallmarks of this great American is humility, and he always displays it. But we know that in the final few hours here it has been our chairman, John Chafee, who has struck the final chords of negotiation and coordinated with our distinguished leader, Mr. Lott, and was able together in consultation with Senator Baucus, myself, and Senator Bond to fashion the final portion of this interim highway measure. 
So we thank the chairman, indeed, the staff and all, and again our distinguished leader. I have now served under three leaders, and Senator Lott has the ability to tell a chairman to go get the job done. If necessary, you can contact me. Otherwise, I trust you. He effectively runs the Senate, certainly on our side of the aisle, with that type of strong leadership and confidence in which he imposes on chairmen and members to do the job. 
I think we have done the job for both sides. It has been a bipartisan effort. As a committee chairman, it is a privilege for me to have the distinguished senior Senator from Montana [Mr. Baucus], as my ranking member on the subcommittee which he takes on in addition to his overall responsibilities as ranking member on the full committee. 
It is interesting; the three of us, in guiding through the principal bill, ISTEA II, the 6-year bill, have been really working in concert as a triumvirate all along in fashioning this important piece of legislation. 
Mr. President, the distinguished chairman went over the various provisions here--flexibility whereby the States are allowed to spend unobligated balances for highway construction, highway safety and transit projects, and, second, continues transportation programs. Every State will have 50 percent of their 1997 allocation to continue highway spending. This is a unique formula. Recognizing that this Chamber was not going to pass a 6-month bill as sent over by the House, Mr. Bond, of Missouri, came forward with this basic blueprint which then the four of us crafted, and it took a lot of give and take to craft it in such a way that we did not restore the formula--no formula fight at this point in time. 
I do not call it a formula fight. I just call it a formula resolution because eventually we are going to have to resolve this formula thing, and we will do it. But thus far this bill, this particular Bond bill preserves the flexibility for the Senate to continue with the ISTEA II bill which is a bill that I term fair. Fairness is the hallmark of all of our work that has gone into the ISTEA II 6-year bill which hopefully we will pass in large measure as currently structured by our committee, but it is a formula which is fair, and that is the thing that was so lacking in ISTEA I. 
New funds for critical programs; continues funding the Federal Government for 6 months for essential safety, transit and Federal highway operations. Three thousand five hundred jobs were held in abeyance and still are until the President's signature is affixed to this piece of legislation. 
Now, they are the persons not only here in the Nation's Capital but each of the 50 States, in the highway offices, who day in and day out through good weather and bad weather, through one administration in the State and the next administration, are there as professional advisers on the very important obligation that all of us have to modernize and to continue to improve America's highway infrastructure. 
A major change from the Bond bill provides $5.5 billion in new contract authority to the States using the Senate's approach. Now, that is a large measure we should acknowledge came from the House of Representatives under the leadership of their chairman and ranking member. And Mr. Chafee, Mr. Baucus, Mr. Bond, and I have met with them the past several days. That was something they felt very strongly about, and it is the result of a compromise. They fought very hard in some instances to make some modifications for States which deservedly should have some additional recognition. It was the judgment of those of us certainly on this side that we could not in this bill at this time begin to single out some of those hardship cases, but their rights to reassert those hardship cases for several States are preserved under this bill for the 6-year bill next year. These funds are an advance to the States. These funds will be counted as part of each State's formula until the final bill is done. 
So that in substance concludes my remarks, Mr. President. It is really just so pleasing for us, after such a long struggle, to preserve this infrastructure so that the jobs can continue. All over America, literally millions of jobs depend on the passage of this piece of legislation. And the several Governors I think can say to themselves that they have had a strong influence on this bill, all 50, one way or another together with their respective secretaries of transportation and the officials in that State who have in them the responsibility for transportation. 
I think, all in all, we have done a good job.

Mr. WARNER. Only insofar as the fiscal year 1997 allocations are a reflection of the formulas that were operating in the final year of ISTEA. However, this bill is formula neutral. We are simply allowing States to use a portion of their unobligated balances with a nominal amount of new contract authority. This will not and should not change any States' relative bargaining position when we finally act on a longer-term authorization bill which provides new obligation authority to the States for fiscal year 1998 and beyond.

Mr. WARNER. No. This is simply a stopgap measure to allow Federal Highway Administration, safety and transit programs, and to distribute limited highway obligation authority to the States so these important transportation programs can continue, albeit at a minimum level. Formula changes could occur next year and it is our intent they be retroactive.

 Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, as part of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1998, the conferees included a provision (sec. 1083) authorizing the Secretary of Defense to begin to plan, coordinate, and execute a program to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the Korean war. 
The Department of the Army--under the able leadership of retired General Kicklighter--has been designated to carry out this 50th anniversary program. A good friend of mine, Mr. Roy Martin, former mayor of Norfolk, VA, and currently chairman of the Gen. Douglas MacArthur Foundation in Norfolk, has taken the lead in planning a series of commemorative events for this very special anniversary. 
As a veteran of the Korean war, I was disappointed to learn--the day after the defense authorization conference report was approved by the Senate--that the provision we included in our bill to commemorate this historic event was inadequate. The conferees acted in good faith to authorize a program worthy of the event. Unfortunately, new information came to light after the conclusion of our conference which revealed that the $100,000 we had authorized would not be sufficient. 
In an effort to correct this oversight, at my request Senator Thurmond introduced S. 1507, a bill making technical corrections to the defense authorization bill, to provide $1 million for the Korean war celebration. That bill passed the Senate last evening, and the House has indicated that it will pass this legislation before the end of the current session. 
While I understand that this will not be enough to fund the entire Korean war commemoration program, it will solve the immediate problem for fiscal year 1998. 
I pledge to my follow Korean war veterans that I will work with the Department of the Army in the coming fiscal years to ensure that adequate funding is provided by the Congress to fund a commemoration that is worthy of the brave men and women who served so well on the battlefields of Korea.

Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise as an original cosponsor of this legislation that will authorize the Architect of the Capitol to construct a Capitol Visitor Center under the direction of the U.S. Capitol Preservation Commission. 
The construction of a Capitol Visitor Center is a matter that has been discussed and contemplated for many years. In fact, both the current and the preceding Architect of the Capitol have reviewed and supported the project. Over the years, I have personally been involved in numerous Rules Committee hearings and briefings on the subject. 
In my view, the time has come for Congress to move ahead with this project. This legislation is an important step in that direction in that it directs the Capitol Preservation Commission to develop a detailed financial plan for constructing the project, largely with funds donated by the American people. 
The Capitol is the second most visited building in the entire Washington, DC area, having nearly 35,000 visitors pass through its doors every day. For many visitors there are long lines and waits in hot sticky weather, or cold wet weather, as there is no place for visitors to gather in preparation for their tour through the Capitol. 
The Capitol Visitor Center will have a tremendous, positive impact on the informational and educational experience afforded visitors to the Capitol. It will provide information regarding the history and role of Congress, along with additional information about the visitor's Representative and Senators 
But for me, the most compelling need for the Capitol Visitor Center is to add a major element of enhanced security for the entire Capitol building and environs. During the recent Capitol security hearings held in the Senate Rules Committee, the security benefits that a Capitol Visitor Center will provide were outlined clearly by the Capitol Police Board. I strongly believe that the security benefits provided by a Capitol Visitor are not to be taken lightly. 
I hope all Members will support this important legislation that will greatly enhance the experience visitors receive when visiting our Nations Capitol.

Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, as chairman of the Committee on Rules and Administration, it is my job to ensure that our colleagues have the support services they need to perform our constitutional responsibilities. Almost all of those services rely on information technology which must be coordinated between various authorities in the Senate. Ultimately, however, it is the Rules Committee that sets the overall policies for these services and remains responsible for ensuring that the needs of Senators and committees are met. 
With the explosion in information technology, and the increasing sophistication of our user community, it is almost a full time job to ensure that the Senate keeps up with changes in technology in a timely manner. To assist in our responsibilities, the Committee sought the advice of outside experts with considerable experience advising both governmental entities and private industry in making the information technology and infrastructure support delivery decisions. 
The consulting firm of Booz-Allen & Hamilton thoroughly reviewed our service delivery systems in the Senate, with considerable cooperation and participation by members' offices and the officers of the Senate. Booz-Allen has advised the Committee that the implementation of a strategic planning process for reviewing and coordinating the information technology and infrastructure support services of the Senate would enable us to make more cost-effective decisions about how to deliver those services. 
The ranking member, Senator Ford, and I agree that this is a business practice that can prove very beneficial for the Senate. The resolution that we offer establishes that strategic planning process. I urge the adoption of the resolution.

Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, in my capacity as chairman of the Rules Committee, I rise to introduce legislation that will authorize the acquisition of property for use by the Library of Congress. This legislation will allow the Library of Congress to take advantage of a unique opportunity to advance the preservation of the Library's motion pictures, recorded sound, television and radio collections, a unique record of American life and history in the 20th century. 
The Library of Congress is clearly facing a crisis in fulfilling its statutory--and I underline, Mr. President, `statutory'--obligations to preserve, maintain and make available these national collections. The Library must vacate its Suitland, MD, storage location by next May 1998. Facilities in Ohio at Wright Patterson Air Force Base are beyond cost-effective repair. This has created an urgent need to find a new facility. 
The former Richmond Federal Reserve facility in Culpepper, VA, is currently available for purchase on the open market and it already has many of the attributes, that is, the physical attributes, the construction and the like, needed to consolidate the Library's collection in a single, efficient facility for conservation, storage and access. That facility in Culpepper, VA, is reasonably accessible from the Nation's Capital for scholars and others to work on this material. 
The staff of the Rules Committee has reviewed an extensive financial analysis the Library provided us, showing alternative arrangements and sites for creating an audiovisual and digital master conservation center. The analysis concluded that Culpepper, VA, by allowing consolidation of various storage and Library sites into a single facility, is the most cost-effective option that they have found to date. We can increase the cost-effectiveness of this proposal for the taxpayer even further by taking advantage now of a generous offer by a nationally known foundation to provide up to a $10 million donation for the purchase and initial modifications of the Culpepper property. 
However, it appears the gift will only be available if Congress passes legislation as incorporated in this bill and in this session to authorize acceptance of the building by the Architect of the Capitol. 
I stress, Mr. President, that this $10 million gift to the American taxpayers for preservation of this very important collection--and I participated somewhat in the discussion of this with the chairman of the board of the foundation together with the Librarian of Congress. We have reason to believe that if we do not act in this session, this gift might not be available at the time the Congress resumes its work next year. Congress clearly has responsibility to enable the Library to fulfill its statutory mandates to preserve these collections, and these urgent storage and access needs must be addressed both from an oversight and an appropriations viewpoint. We now have an opportunity to meet these needs in a cost-effective manner, which takes advantage of a significant private donation. 
In my view, moving forward with the Culpepper option at this time is in the best interests of the Library and the American taxpayers. Therefore, I hope all Members will support this legislation promptly, that it can be cleared on the hotline here within the next 24 hours, and that this body, the Senate, will act. I have reason to believe, having had consultations with my colleagues in the House with comparable responsibility as the Rules Committee, that the House will quickly accept this bill. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I certainly want to commend our distinguished chairman and distinguished ranking member. The senior Senator from Montana is also ranking on the subcommittee. We express a particular appreciation to the Senator from Missouri, Senator Bond. He seemed to have had an understanding of how we could best and most equitably adopt this short-term provision. I wish to commend him for his special efforts. 
I wish to also commend the staff, Mr. President. We have had extraordinary staff participation on this. I have a small piece of paper here signed by the principal Senators expressing our appreciation.

Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I would also like to express our appreciation to Senator Byrd who was very actively working with us this evening. And I want to associate myself with the remarks of the distinguished Senator from Montana. 
Many States have a very short period within which they can do this vital work. The Governors appeared at the hearing of our committee just a few days ago, and expressed a similar interest. It is imperative that we keep this highway program moving ahead until such time as the Congress can pass what I hope will be a 6-year bill.

Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I will proceed momentarily to the Executive Calendar. 
But first we want to thank the Chair. The Chair has been very indulgent, and indeed, the staff of the Senate. 
But I want to further say that I hope tomorrow that the infrastructure that follows this type of legislation--the contractors, the secretaries of the various organizations throughout the States who are entrusted with the very important highway construction--would immediately look at this effort by the U.S. Senate, and bring to bear their judgment tomorrow on the other body in the hopes that we can pass this. 
I particularly call on the National Governors' Association. They came forward in a hearing that I chaired last week, and were very explicit on this whole matter. It was made very clear by the contractors who also appeared at that hearing that there is a short period for certain States for construction. It is imperative that this matter go forward. We have made, as I say, in a bipartisan way, our best effort. Now, with the help of the infrastructure, I am sure that the other body will see the wisdom in this measure, and pass it.

Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished chairman of the committee. I wish to join other members of committee in indicating to our distinguished chairman and to the ranking member, Mr. Levin of Michigan, our commendation for their work over these many months on this bill. 
Mr. President, in the limited time I have I wish to turn immediately to the subject of the welfare of the men and women of the Armed Forces. 
This past few weeks we have seen a good deal of tension increase in various parts of the world. In fact, that tension prompted the President of the United States to convene a very important meeting. The Presiding Officer was in attendance, as was the chairman and ranking member of the committee, myself and others, at which time the President in consultation with the Congress, the leadership, reviewed the various problems facing the United States and our allies today--and the possibility that we may once again call on the men and women of the Armed Forces of the United States, together with our allies, to go into harm's way in an effort to stabilize these situations. 
Mr. President, I say that we cannot as a Congress--as a Nation--say to these men and women, `You once again will respond to the Commander in Chief' and not pass this bill, which gives them a very modest and well-earned increase in their pay and allowances to compensate them for inflation--particularly in specialized areas of service: Aviation, submariners, and others where we have to have additional compensation in order to enable them to perform their services, and we retain sufficient numbers of aviators and submariners. 
So, Mr. President, I deem this bill absolutely critical. I also wish to commend the chairman and ranking member and other Members who have individually, as have I, petitioned the President to give this bill the most serious consideration and hopefully to affix his signature so that it can become law. 
Mr. President, to go into those areas, which as chairman of the Seapower Subcommittee, I have special responsibility, together with the distinguished senior Senator from Massachusetts, [Mr. Kennedy], who is my ranking member, and our subcommittee recommended to the full committee the following, and the full committee basically adopted it. 
We authorized the Secretary of the Navy to enter into a contract for the procurement of four new attack submarines under the terms of a teaming arrangement that was submitted to Congress by the Secretary of the Navy between the two contractors involved in submarine construction. This arrangement will save taxpayers over $1 billion in the next 6 years, and ensure the continued viability of two nuclear capable submarine yards. 
I thank my distinguished colleague from Virginia, Mr. Robb, who worked with me on that, a member of our committee, as well as the distinguished colleague, Mr. Lieberman, from Connecticut. 
Further, our subcommittee authorized an increase of $720 million for the procurement of a fourth Arleigh Burke destroyer. By buying this ship early, we will save approximately $230 million on the marginal cost of this ship. 
Those are savings that are passed on, of course, to the Department of Defense, but to the American taxpayer. 
As relates to the aircraft carrier, the CVN-77, the next in the series of our carriers, we authorized $50 million to accelerate the advanced procurement and construction of components for CVN-77. 
I particularly want to thank the distinguished chairman and ranking member of the Appropriations Committee, Mr. Stevens, and Mr. Inouye. They accommodated this Senator, personally allowing me to come into literally the closing few minutes of their conference with the House in order to ensure that this $50 million be included in the appropriations. 
We authorized the Secretary of Defense to reprogram up to an additional $295 million in fiscal year 1998 for the advanced procurement of CVN-77. I am now working with the Chief of Naval Operations and the Secretary of the Navy to ensure that the Navy takes advantage of this important opportunity to get the `smart buy' proposal fully utilized within the Department of Defense, as well as the Department of the Navy. Acceleration of funding for this ship offers an opportunity for potential savings of $600 million for the American taxpayer. 
I urge my colleagues to support this conference report. The House has already spoken resoundingly in favor--with 286 Members voting in favor of the conference report last week. We must follow their lead with a strong vote in favor of this conference report. Let us not allow a full year's worth of work to be squandered. 
I also urge the President not to veto this important measure. This President has deployed our troops into `hot spots' in record numbers. Our troops have answered these many calls to duty and performed admirably. They stand ready today as new missions in Bosnia and Iraq are being discussed by policy makers in Washington. 
Do not send a signal to those troops that you do not support their efforts. They should not have to worry about whether or not their raises and bonuses will be there in January. They should not have to question the commitment of politicians in Washington to provide the best equipment and quality of life possible for our troops and their families. I call on you, Mr. President, to show your support for our troops by signing this very important conference report. 
Mr. President, I wish to commend the distinguished chairman and ranking member for their personal intervention with the President along with my own and others to see that this bill merits his signature in a prompt way. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

 Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, across our great Nation in the 50 State legislatures, we find true public servants who receive very little remuneration, but dedicate themselves to the challenge--the pain and the joy--of representing at the grassroots of American citizens. They are the first line of defense and offense for our citizens. 
I rise today to pay tribute to one who quietly and humbly personifies the best qualities of these public servants. Delegate Lacey Putney of Big Island, VA, is the most senior member of the Virginia House of Delegates and the only Independent. When he is re-elected today, he will tie with former speaker John Warren Cooke's record for the longest service in Virginia's General Assembly--38 years. 
Delegate Putney and I were classmates and close friends as students at Washington and Lee University a half century ago. I have been privileged to count him as a valued advisor since that time. 
As this month's `Virginia--Capitol Connections' magazine states: `Lacey Putney: The Democrats Want Him, The Republicans Want Him, But the People of Virginia Have Him.' 
I ask unanimous consent to place in the Record at this point two tributes to Delegate Putney.

 Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today to thank Dr. Mary Lynn Tischer, who leaves my Washington office after almost a year of ceaseless effort as a Transportation Fellow. As we sought to develop consensus on the ISTEA II legislation, Mary Lynn provided superior analysis and assistance, working extensively with her counterparts to gather a large coalition of support for this complex piece of legislation. 
Mary Lynn worked with Virginia Secretary of Transportation Robert Martinez and Virginia Governor George Allen as they sought to steer the Step 21 legislation at the State level. In her role as the Administrator of the Office of Policy Analysis, Evaluation, and Intergovernmental Relations at the Virginia Department of Transportation [VDOT], Mary Lynn served the Commonwealth of Virginia admirably. She has worked on travel forecasting, analysis of travel behavior and mode choice, model development, goods movement, and trucking issues. Mary Lynn was chosen to manage the congressionally mandated Heavy Vehicle Cost Allocation Study, the Study of the Feasibility of Designating the Interstate for Larger and Heavier Vehicles, and several studies on state regulation of motor carriers. 
Mary Lynn received her Ph.D. in political science from the University of Maryland, with an interdisciplinary major in social psychology as well as a specialty in American government and public policy. Dr. Tischer also serves on the Group I Council of the Transportation Research Board, and is active on several committees and task forces of TRB and AASHTO, including the Reauthorization Task Force. 
Mary Lynn is widely recognized as an expert in her field. She was chairman of the International Association of Travel Behavior, editor of Transport Reviews, and on the editorial board of Transportation. Her proficiency has led to her participation on steering committees for national and international conferences, most recently for Household Travel Surveys and Uses of the Decennial Census. She has given numerous papers, and is extensively published in the transportation and marketing fields. 
Mary Lynn has been tireless in her work here in my Washington office. Her cheerful demeanor, quick wit, and skillful assistance and intelligence will be sorely missed. I extend my warmest regards to Mary Lynn, and wish her all good luck in her future endeavors.

Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, my remarks this morning go to the need for this body to begin to address the substantive provisions of the highway bill, S. 1173. As the Senate full knows, I am privileged to be the chairman of the subcommittee which, over the course of a period of the year, developed this piece of legislation. Many Senators have traveled great distances. We had hearings in several places throughout the United States and a number of hearings here, of course, in our committee room. But a lot of hard work went into this bill. 
Now, the question on cloture involves the Senate consideration of the campaign finance bill. I leave to the respective leaders who, as nearly as I can determine, are trying to work diligently to resolve the procedural conflict involving that piece of legislation, campaign finance reform, as it relates to this bill. But as I read through the order that was prepared by the leader's office this morning reciting other pieces of legislation to which this body will turn, the question, of course, rises, why can't we go ahead with the ISTEA bill? 
Again, I leave that to the leaders. They have worked on this diligently and indeed there are developments every hour on the hour. So it is difficult for any of us not involved in the negotiations to explain the exact reasons. 
But the reason I asked to take the floor this morning is that we are witnessing here in this country, in the past week, and particularly yesterday, a very precipitous decline in our stock market, commodity markets, and the like. It clearly manifests an instability. 
As I look at this piece of legislation, this is an absolute building block of stability for America's economy. This bill has literally millions and millions of jobs related to it. Now, highways, bridges, and other infrastructure requirements take months to plan--engineering, financial, consideration by the respective legislative bodies and highway commissions of the several States. It is a process which was carefully crafted in the 1991 bill over a period of 6 years. The reason we put in a 6-year bill was to provide the type of stability that enables those from the Governor and State legislatures to the various highway boards and commissions to do that type of planning. 
All across this country today, in the wake of the instability of the marketplace and other economic indicators, millions and millions of men and women are dependent for their livelihood on this program going forward in an orderly way. Highways can't be built overnight. Weather has a very definite impact on the ability of the hands of these laboring people to build these highway systems. In some States, that envelope of weather is a matter of several months, primarily because of the weather conditions. But indeed during the course of the intense heat of summer, again, there are restrictive periods in which roads and highways can be built. It is for that reason that I ask this morning that we cannot be oblivious to what is taking place in the marketplace of our country and all over the world, this instability, at a time when this bill will be a very steady building block to add stability. 
This vote will be the fourth to invoke cloture so that the Senate can proceed to the consideration of this legislation to reauthorize our Nation's surface transportation programs. This is needed because of the intent regarding campaign financing. 
Mr. President, the funding level is $145 billion. Stop and think about that--$145 billion. That would benefit every single State. We have tried in this bill to equitably and fairly distribute these funds that would go from the State in the form of gasoline taxes, petroleum taxes associated with trucks, and diesel, and so forth--up to the highway trust fund and revolve and come back. We have tried to equitably distribute these funds, more so than in the 1991 ISTEA. The funding level in ISTEA II, which is the present bill, is $145 billion. It is a 20-percent increase in funding over the 1991 ISTEA I. 
This funding level, if I may say, is significantly higher than recommended by the administration in their proposal that came to the Congress. The United States has the largest transportation system in the world, with 170,000 miles of National Highway System routes, 900,000 miles of other Federal aid roads, and 3.7 million miles of other public roads. Our national network of highways carries 136 million cars, 58 million light trucks, 6.9 million freight trucks, and 686,000 buses. In 1995, cars and light trucks, mostly personal vehicles, were driven 2.2 trillion miles. 
What is alarming to learn, however, is that nearly half of our major road system is in mediocre or fair condition. I will repeat that. Half of this vast communications system is in mediocre or fair condition. This lack of investment clearly jeopardizes safety, the individual personal safety of those on the highways, and the mobility of the traveling public, as well as our economic competitiveness. 
Now, I don't presume to give the causes for this problem in the market today, but anybody who wishes to be informed can certainly listen carefully, as I have done in the last 24 hours, to others who presumably have a better knowledge. But this problem is precipitated less by the U.S. economy, if at all--because that economy is relatively healthy--but more by the world marketplace, and primarily in Asia. It is a one-world competitive market, and the ability of this Nation to compete in that market is very, very significantly dependent on the efficiencies, the safety of this infrastructure of highways and roads and bridges. Mr. President, again, it is the competition in the world financial markets, primarily the deterioration of the situation in Asia that is causing the precipitous decline in our markets. I subscribe that that same competition exists in every other walk of life relative to the ability of the American working men and women to compete with their hands and their minds with others throughout the world. It is a one-world market. 
I remember so well visiting, in Luray, VA, a plant that manufactures blue jeans. Now, blue jeans are almost a language in the world over today in many respects. I saw Virginians down over their machines sewing the particular garments being made that day. 
I turned to the plant manager, who was escorting me through and I said, `How can we compete with the blue jeans manufacturers elsewhere in the world?' It was very interesting. I said, `We are complying with all the environmental requirements, with the wage laws, the workers are well paid, well cared for, with health programs; how can we compete with those plants that are operating while we are sleeping in the Asian market?' 
He said, `Come with me.' 
We walked down and I saw a bank of computers that take the orders in, relay the orders to the workbench, products are manufactured, put on a conveyor belt, and then he beckoned me and we went outside. There were a half-dozen semi-trailers being loaded, box after box. He said to me very simply, `That order came in this morning, that garment was manufactured to the specifications of the merchant that placed that order, and the finished product is put in that truck and that truck travels overnight and that pair of jeans is on the store shelf the following morning.' 
Asia cannot compete because of the infrastructure of transportation, the ability of this plant and other plants all over America to, within 24 hours, turn around an order and have that product on the shelf. 
That is what is at stake, the ability to turn around these products in the face of a deteriorating infrastructure all across this country. 
Mediocre and fair condition. That is half of the Nation's road system. That extrapolates into jobs, millions and millions of men and women of the United States ready to go to work provided in this bill and provide the needed stability that we are lacking today in view of these tragic declines in the world markets. 
Transportation provides the link between business, industries, and consumers. Transportation and related industries employ 9.9 million people in the United States, slightly more than 7 percent of the total work force in this Nation. According to the Department of Transportation, for every $1 billion invested in highway and bridge projects, over 42,000 new jobs are created. As one of the largest sectors of our economy, transportation represents nearly 11 percent of the gross domestic product. It is just behind the basic services of housing, health care, and food. 
Another compelling statistic confirms that transportation remains a sound investment for the American taxpayers. For every dollar spent, there is an economic return of $2.60. 
Mr. President, I therefore urge my colleagues to consider these facts and let us not bring upon this institution that old adage that while Rome burned, Nero fiddled. We have to come to grips with this procedural question on campaign finance reform, but this type of legislation must go forward to provide the economic stability that is necessary at this very hour in America. 
So I close, Mr. President, by urging all Senators who will be coming to the floor very shortly to express their views to perhaps take a look at what is happening in the international financial markets. It is impacting this country. Take a look at what is happening because while campaign finance is an important issue, it could really be perceived in the workplace by those who carry the lunch buckets, those who bend and sweat and toil to build America's roads and bridges, as the ant that toppled the mountain of jobs that are involved in this bill. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, on September 30, our Nation witnessed a changing of the guard with the retirement of the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. John Shalikashvili. 
General Shali, as he is affectionately known, served this country with honor and distinction for 39 years, rising from the rank of private to the top military post in our Nation, a record that will inspire the next generation. 
For the past 4 years, as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, he has been the principal military adviser to the President of the United States and the Secretary of Defense during a period when we witnessed a proliferation of new and unknown threats throughout the world. 
Those in the Senate who have had the privilege of working closely with him during these years of new challenge will always remember and admire his honesty, his sound judgment, and--most importantly--his concern for the men and women of our Armed Forces and their families.

Once a quorum is established, the Senate will proceed to a cloture vote on the modified committee amendment to S. 1173, the highway legislation. Following that vote, the Senate will begin approximately 90 minutes of debate on the Interior appropriations conference report. If all of that time is used, Members can anticipate a second vote at approximately 12:15. 
Under the previous order, at 12:30, the Senate will recess for the weekly policy luncheons to meet. Hopefully, when the Senate reconvenes at 2:15, the Senate will begin consideration of either the Amtrak legislation dealing with the pending strike, or Amtrak reform which would address the strike. 
In addition, the Senate may begin debate on Senator Coverdell's education IRA legislation, H.R. 2646. Therefore, Members can anticipate rollcall votes throughout today's session of the Senate.

Mr. WARNER. Madam President, if I might just enter into a colloquy here with our distinguished former Senate leader and now the distinguished ranking member of the Appropriations Committee and reflect a little on the very important work which the Senator has led on this amendment, together with Senator Gramm, Senator Baucus, and joined in by myself. 
I think it is important to share with our colleagues what this amendment does not do. It doesn't break the budget. We have reviewed that in the number of sessions that the four of us have had. 
I wonder if my colleague would recount some of the things to dispel, if I may say, some rumors that seem to be circulating at the moment.

Mr. WARNER. If I might follow along, in drafting this bill we have made it very clear that any additional funds next year would be subject to a budget resolution, but they would flow and be distributed precisely as provided in the committee bill, which I hope will eventually become law. 
So there would be a law in place next spring by which those funds as designated in this amendment would flow immediately pursuant to the terms of the committee bill. 
Now, the key point, Madam President, is that it would not require the Senate to have another bill, but alternative measures that I have heard about, Madam President and colleagues, that may be offered in the second degree to the amendment we are now discussing would require a new bill. 
Now, that, to me, is very important because we would take an existing law, move the funds through it under a formula, hopefully, that Senators will find equitable and not have to revisit in an election year. Madam President, those of us who have been here a while know--and I certainly defer to the experience and knowledge of the former majority leader of the U.S. Senate--in an election year, the chances of getting through a bill of this nature, allocating funds, is exceedingly difficult. I ask my colleague, does he not agree with that observation?

Mr. WARNER. The distinguished Senator brings up a key point. I hope each Senator will consult with their respective Governors and highway officials on this matter, because particularly in the Northeast States and the Far West, Madam President, weather will close in. There is a shorter period within which to do the vital construction for surface transportation. And unless there is in place a piece of legislation that gives the certainty of 6 years, then they are put at a severe disadvantage. I think that is key to this bill. 
One last thing and I will yield the floor. Another situation that is being discussed, should we say, in the hallways, is a means to stop the amendment we are discussing by repealing altogether the 4.3-cent gas tax. Now, Madam President, if that measure is brought forward, that is a very significant step that I think we should give a great deal of consideration to before anybody takes that initiative. 
So, Madam President, I conclude by putting a question to the ranking member of the Appropriations Committee, the former chairman and former majority leader, what would be the consequences, in his judgment, if such a measure as repealing the 4.3-cent tax were to be brought before this body--with the extensive debate that we have and the unlikely nature of it being accepted--but in the event it were?

Mr. WARNER. We clearly looked at our amendment to make certain it would be operative irrespective of the Senate and, indeed, congressional action on such a proposal as to repeal the 4.3-cent gas tax. 
So, again, Mr. President, I join my colleagues, Senator Byrd, Senator Gramm, and Senator Baucus, to increase the authorization levels in ISTEA II using funds generated by the 4.3 cents per gallon gas tax. 
Along with the support of many of my colleagues, we have waged strong efforts this year for higher funding levels for our nation's surface transportation programs. 
I initiated that effort and my amendments to spend additional revenues from the highway trust fund earlier this year failed by 1 vote. 
Later, during the debate on the conference on the budget resolution, 85 Senators urged--by letter--the conferees to raise the allocation to the highway program so that a portion of the 4.3 cents Federal gas tax could be spent. That effort received no response. 
Once again, with the amendment we offer today, we have another opportunity to ensure that additional funding is made available to modernize and expand our nations surface transportation system. 
I continue to believe that investments in our transportation system--highways, rail and transit--are a wise and essential investment for the American taxpayer. 
Almost every economic effort by the U.S. private sector is met by competition worldwide. Mr. President, for every dollar invested in transportation, there is an economic return of $2.60. Transportation dollars are, in military terms, a strong force multiplier. 
The Department of Transportation also confirms that transportation spending is important for American workers. For every $1 billion spent on transportation, there are 50,000 new jobs. 
Only with such forces can we survive in this one market world. So, Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to carefully consider the amendment we offer today. 
The Byrd-Gramm, Warner-Baucus, amendment is the most realistic chance for us to provide needed funds for transportation based on actions by this Congress in future budget resolutions. 
I have joined this amendment because it ensures that the underlying formula, for distribution of funds, of the 
Committee bill remains intact. 
For donor states, this is critically important because every state will continue to receive 90 percent of the funds distributed based on each state's contributions to the highway trust fund. 
Ninety percent of the additional funds, provided under this amendment, will likewise be apportioned to each state. Apportioned in the same manner as the formula provides under the committee bill. 
Simply stated, this means that no state's percentage share of the program will change with the additional funds provided in the Byrd-Gramm amendment. 
Ensuring that every state gets a fair return of 90 percent of the funds sent to the states under the formula is a fundamental principle of ISTEA II. 
It is a principle that I will not abandon. 
I am satisfied that this amendment is compatible with the formula revisions established in the committee bill. 
For this reason, I am pleased to join my colleagues in support of this amendment. 
My colleague from New Mexico, Senator Domenici, may offer a different approach that makes it very difficult for more funds to be directed to our nation's highways. 
The amendment which may be offered by Senators Domenici and Chafee will provide an expedited process to pass another bill to allow for more transportation spending following action on next year's budget resolution. 
That expedited process, however, requires the Senate to pass a new bill. No additional funds that may be provided in a future budget resolution can be released unless we enact a new bill. 
Mr. President, the benefits of the Byrd amendment ensures that our states will not have to wait again for the Congress to act. If any additional funds are provided in a budget resolution, they will go out through the normal process in an appropriations bill and then be allocated by the provisions, then in law hopefully, in this committee bill. 
As a result, America's transportation system will benefit. Americans will not be left stalled in gridlock waiting for the Congress to pass another bill in an election year.

Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I know there are others who are anxious to speak, so therefore I will not go over the points that were very clearly enunciated by the distinguished senior Senator 
from West Virginia, my colleague from Texas, and my partner, Senator Baucus, who worked with me throughout the formulation of the underlying bill together with our leadership, the committee chairman, Senator Chafee. Senator Baucus has worked with me throughout this process. 
As subcommittee chairman, I started with a group called Step 21 and then eventually we joined forces with a group headed by Senator Baucus--Stars 2000 is my recollection--and eventually our distinguished chairman joined us. We were able to craft a bill which became the subject of a markup and then gained full support of the committee. 
It is, I must say, of some personal and professional concern that for the moment I am at odds with my distinguished lifetime friend and chairman, Senator Chafee, on this matter, but I hope that in due course I and others can persuade him to the wisdom of this amendment. He will speak for himself, I hope, momentarily. 
As Senators Byrd and Gramm and Baucus have said very clearly, when I met with them last night, I was given the assurance we did not break the budget, and I think the Senators have gone through that very clearly. 
We assure that every State gets a fair return, and 90 percent of the funds sent to the States under the formula is a fundamental principle of ISTEA II. And to give absolute credence to that statement I have just made, which was the basic criteria for my joining in this effort, I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record statistical tables prepared by the Federal Highway Administration at my request.

Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, throughout this debate of many, many months on the highway bill, I have expressed the need to raise the amount of money that had to be put forward to replenish America's infrastructure. And together with Senator Baucus, we cosponsored an amendment which lost by one vote in this Chamber to augment the spending under this bill. I felt a certain loyalty to that coalition which had joined with me and had fought so hard to get additional funding. 
Second, the formula that we devised in the underlying bill, ISTEA II, I now recognize, while it was essential in my judgment we establish that 90 percent return--thereby eliminating the donor-donee distinction that existed, I think most unfairly, for these 6 years, and we achieved that result--but I find, in consulting with many of my colleagues, that the transition is very abrupt to their States, those donee States in particular. This amendment, as proposed by the four of us, will help ease that transition. 
That point I want to make very clearly, it will help ease that transition, because Senators in clear conscience on both sides of the aisle have come to the members of the transportation committee and said please, we must have some relief as we begin to transition into ISTEA II. This bill provides the added funds to give that needed relief, badly needed in many instances. I think now with this important amendment as part of the bill if so adopted--the Senate will adopt an ISTEA II bill. 
I am reasonably confident it will be along the lines of the committee bill. But there have been reports from the other House, and they may be rumor but I think there is some documentation, all the way from, `We are not even going to conference. There won't be a bill this year.' Or it will be just a 6-month bill. And I have heard a 90-day bill. 
At another time I will explain why, in my judgment, that is not good for the United States of America. Our transportation infrastructure and the need for upgrading is critical for this Nation to remain competitive in a one-world market. A 6-year bill has always been the format, beginning with ISTEA I, by which the Governors and the respective highway authorities in the several States have done the long-term planning necessary to improve their own State transportation systems. They need 6 years to develop the contracts which must be guaranteed to have a flow of funds over that period of time. They are not simple contracts, they are very complex contracts. 
I can go on, on that point. But we will be strengthened, the U.S. Senate will strengthen its bill to the point where I think the House will see the wisdom of the course we have charted in this body for a highway bill which is anxiously being awaited by the 50 States. This amendment, I think, will ensure the ability of the Senate to go in with a strengthened position and persuade the House to the wisdom of having a 6-year bill, and hopefully along the funding profile as outlined in this amendment. 
The House was deeply concerned, as was the Senate, that next year, with the forecast and projections of additional revenues, that they could be forthcoming for transportation. What this amendment does is literally solidifies--no longer `bet on the come'--that next year we will have additional funds for highways. But this amendment in a sense puts that certainty into this legislation, which will enable the several States to do their planning. 
So, those are the three basic reasons and I shall add further, such that other Senators can have an opportunity to speak on this, and I yield the floor.

Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, it is my privilege to recognize this morning the Reverend C. Edward Pruitt as our guest Chaplain for today. We particularly welcome his words of assurance to give strength to all of us in the discharge of our duties. 
Reverend Pruitt serves as the pastor of the Burke United Methodist Church in the Commonwealth of Virginia. He has been in that post for 3 years and has ministered to the people of Virginia and Maryland for the past 30 years in his distinguished career. A graduate from the Wesley Theological Seminary here in Washington, Reverend Pruitt has a very unique background. 
If one detected a slight accent in the Reverend Pruitt's words this morning, it might be because he grew up as a waterman's son--that's a fisherman's son--on the small island named Tangier in the middle of the Chesapeake Bay. Here the islanders still speak with great pride with a lingering trace of the Elizabethan English dialog, reflecting the historic settlement of that island by the English Captain John Smith in 1608. 
I do not know how many of my colleagues know that Tangier Island in Virginia exists, but it does. I have been privileged to be there many times. It is noted for one other thing: There is not a single automobile for transportation. 
Again, we welcome Reverend Pruitt, and the Senate is particularly grateful to Bill Hoagland, chief of staff to the Republican Senate side of the Budget Committee for bringing to the attention of the President pro tempore and the leadership the availability of this distinguished pastor. 
Thank you. I yield the floor.

Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I commend the leader because there is no more essential thing in America than our freedom. It is written into every important document. It is the very foundation upon which our Republic was formed, yet we have turned aside and winked at this process whereby the American worker is penalized in that he or she cannot exercise his or her own free will in making the most fundamental of decisions: Whether or not to have his or her paycheck involuntarily docked for a sum of money for which in most instances they have no idea to what uses it will be put by people who make decisions for them. 
Then that same worker will exercise his or her right of freedom to go to a polling place and write in a check or pull a lever or whatever the procedure may be by which he or she will exercise his or her freedom to select that individual, Democrat or Republican, independent, whether it is for chairman of the board of supervisors in the hometown, President of the United States, or whatever the case may be. To me it is a total anachronism to say that you cannot make a decision with regard to your paycheck, yet you are free to go into the polling booth and make that decision. 
This amendment is referred to as a poison pill.

Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I remember a famous poem written years and years ago, and I will insert in the Record portions of it. But it related to military people around the turn of the century. It says: `Yours is not to reason why; yours is but to do or die.'

Mr. WARNER. That is the philosophy behind this automatic deduction-- yours is not to reason why; you just do as we tell you. That is antithetical. It is not a poison pill to correct that and have maybe six simple words which say, I hereby consent to have my paycheck deducted in a certain amount. How can anyone in good conscience call that simple one sentence a poison pill? It is the exercise of the very essence of democracy in this country and no longer adheres to the refrain `yours is not to reason why.' 
The American worker is quite different in profile today than when this statute, which they predicate the automatic deduction, was put in. Given a few gray hairs and a few years, I bridge back to those thirties when so much of the labor legislation was enacted. That laboring person was drawn from a segment of society that was struggling for its very existence, would take any job, would follow any order, would accept any working condition just to have enough of an opportunity to provide for his or her family. 
Fortunately, this country has progressed today to where that is gone, and today that working person is of an entirely different profile. They have had the opportunity to get education, and many are still seeking to augment their education. They have the opportunity to think for themselves. We are in a society today dominated by all sorts of opportunities, be it on television or in schools or otherwise, to enhance one's level of education and to develop, Mr. President, a thought process by which the American worker can make many, many more decisions for himself or for herself than at the time of the origin of these very oppressive statutes that we still struggle with today. 
So I commend the distinguished majority leader. It seems to me anyone who wants to call this a poison pill should hold up that simple form, point to it and say that the exercise of the right to simply say that I consent is a poison pill. I call it, Mr. President, a `freedom' pill, if you want to use that phraseology. This is a `freedom' pill for the ability of the American worker to begin to think and exercise his or her own judgment. I commend those who support this measure. I yield the floor.

Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, earlier I talked in support, the strongest support, of the distinguished majority leader's amendment. 
Mr. President, I rise today to address the issue of campaign finance reform. As chairman of the Committee on Rules and Administration, I have spent a great deal of time with these issues over the past 2 years. I appreciate the effort by the majority leader to bring campaign finance reform to the floor for debate, and I welcome the opportunity to join in this important debate. 
The Rules Committee has held 10 hearings in 1996 and 1997 concerning campaign finance reform issues. Many of these hearings dealt with the specific issues contained in the legislation commonly known as McCain-Feingold, such as soft money, free television time, regulation of issue advocacy, and spending caps. The committee has compiled a detailed record on these issues for the Senate. During these hearings, we have heard from many noted experts in this field, including many of the same witnesses who appeared before the Committee on Governmental Affairs last week. 
My view of how the campaign finance debate will evolve is as follows. Democrats argue that the Republicans must rely even more on contributions from individuals--hard money--and less on large soft money contributions. Republicans argue that the Democrats, who have relied heavily on the involuntary confiscation of the dues of union members, must agree that union members must give their advance, written consent before a part of their paycheck should go to partisan political activities. 
I received a letter from President Clinton last Tuesday in support of McCain-Feingold. He added that `any attempts to attach amendments that would make it unpalatable to one party or another are nothing less than attempts to defeat campaign finance reform.' I understand that latest version of McCain-Feingold does not include a requirement that union members give prior, written consent before their dues could be used for partisan purposes. This Senator will support an amendment to add this requirement, and I say that if the Democrats decide to filibuster campaign finance legislation because it includes this provision, then it is they who are blocking true bipartisan reform, not the Republicans. 
In the Rules Committee we have held a series of hearings on these issues that are being discussed here today. I want to focus on one particular hearing where we allowed both sides to come in and discuss compulsory deduction by unions. And we held this hearing. We had as a witness David Stewart, a member of the Transport Workers Union of America, local 514, located in Tulsa, OK. 
I remember him very well. He was proudly in the hearing room in his basic working uniform. He testified, and I have extracted some of that testimony to read in this debate today, this very important debate. This is what this American worker said:  
* * * I really do not agree with some of the Agendas and the Candidates that the union endorses. Yet, we are all required to fund these agendas and campaigns just by virtue of our membership in the Union. 
This is a union man, Mr. President. 
As I searched for relief from this unjust requirement, I found out about the `Beck Supreme Court Decision,' which in effect gives a Union Member the right to a refund of the Non-Bargaining expenditures of the Union. The problem is, I must relinquish my Union Membership and the rights associated with that Membership to seek this refund. It is absurd to require me to fund the Contract Bargaining, Contract Enforcement and Administration of the Local, yet require me to forfeit my rights to a voice in these affairs, only because I oppose the Political Expenditures of the Union. I am not opposed to my requirement to belong to the Union. I still attend the Union meetings and enjoy having a voice in the affairs of the Union and my career, I am not willing to give up this activity to receive the refund afforded me by the `Beck Decision.' 
We also heard from Cindy Omlin, a former teacher from Washington State. She described the schemes by which her union illegally used her dues--that mandatory deduction--for 
political contribution. The unions got caught, but nonetheless they upped the amount of dues teachers were required to contribute for partisan activities. Our committee listened to these workers and they came forward at some risk to themselves to give this important testimony. 
At the appropriate time I hope to ask the sponsors of this legislation whether or not they have taken it upon themselves to go out and talk to the workers and find out exactly how they feel about this onerous requirement of mandatory deduction. I will await the opportunity to talk to one or more of the sponsors or both on this point when they have that availability. 
Now I have read that the new version of McCain-Feingold may include a provision to enforce the Beck decision and require posting of notices that employees can receive refunds. This idea, although certainly better than the status quo, is not nearly good enough. 
Effective enforcement of Beck is difficult at best. The posting of a small sign or a small note in a union magazine will not do. Many employees will never learn of their Beck rights, and unions will no doubt continue to set up substantial obstacles to exercising these rights. In our hearing, we heard how unions make the window for objecting very brief and it changes every year, with the notice often buried deep within lengthy union magazines. 
Moreover, single employees are very poorly equipped to challenge accountings provided by union officials as to the breakdown of chargeable and nonchargeable activities. Also, an employee wishing to appeal this determination would need to hire his or her own attorneys and accountants for an arbitration run under rules established by the union. The financial disclosure forms filed by unions with the Labor Department, the LM-2, are notoriously useless in actually assisting employees to determine what percentage of their dues go to political activities. 
All of these procedural hurdles are in addition to the stigmatization of objectors, officially called agency-fee payers. Often lists of objectors are published in union literature and cases of threatened violence are common. 
I believe the only solution, and one that is not contained in the McCain-Feingold legislation, is to require prior, written consent before dues are confiscated. I am a cosponsor of Senator Nickles' bill, the Paycheck Protection Act, which would rectify this egregious situation. Without this provision, we will not have fair campaign finance reform.

Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished colleague. Indeed, we have not fully agreed on all provisions that are options throughout this whole realm of campaign finance, but fundamentally we certainly agree on the question of the mandatory deduction. 
We went to the difficulty of finding witnesses and brought them to the hearing room and listened to their testimony. 
It is ever so clear to this Senator, and I am sure the other members of the committee, that throughout America the workers want to be recognized for their ability to think for themselves and their ability to make decisions for themselves. This whole idea of mandatory deduction is against free will--I think, indeed, against the very essence of what freedom is all about. 
I commend my distinguished colleague from Kentucky. Let us fight on in the cause of freedom.

 Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, as we are all well aware, sustained military operations around the world, coupled with declining numbers of active duty personnel, have required the Defense Department to rely more and more on the National Guard. Guard units and air assets have been called to active duty by the President and deployed throughout the world with increasing frequency. Serving directly with their active duty counterparts, National Guard units today are in every military theater. Theater commanders have continually stated that it would be a challenge to efficiently execute their operations without the Guard. 
Two weeks ago, I had the privilege of attending a parade in honor of Virginia National Guard soldiers who have been recalled to support Operation Joint Guard, the ongoing NATO mission in the former Yugoslavia. The unit is Company C, 3-116th Infantry Battalion from the 29th Infantry Division and their mission will be to secure the base camp and Sava River bridge in Slavonski-Brod, Croatia. The 129 soldiers of this company will be deployed for up to 270 days. This is the first time an infantry unit has been mobilized under a Presidential callup for the Bosnia operation. I am very proud of this unit and all of the Commonwealth's National Guardsmen. 
With the expanded role of the National Guard, I personally support greater recognition of the National Guard chief. Guardsmen from the Commonwealth and across the United States require strong leadership which can make their concerns known to the active duty military and ensure that the Guard is ready to perform its important missions. As always, these citizen-soldiers have committed themselves to be ready on a moment's notice. They must have a leader of sufficient rank and stature to effectively advocate their cause. 
Recently, Senator Stevens delivered remarks to the National Guard Association on the role of the National Guard Bureau chief. Senator Stevens' remarks highlight the important issues facing the National Guard today and why it is necessary for their chief to receive a place at the table with his active duty counterparts. I am submitting Senator Stevens' remarks for the Record and I encourage my colleagues to take a moment and review his thoughtful comments.

Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I wish to associate myself with the distinguished Senator from Arizona and his remarks and, indeed, those of the distinguished Senator from Texas [Mrs. Hutchison]. I have worked with them on this very issue. 
Mr. President, I commend the Appropriations Committee for the language which is contained in their bill, but I would like to urge that this whole analysis be taken a step further. 
During the course of the confirmation hearings on General Shelton, I said that it is time for the United States to exercise the leadership to reconvene the principles, the very principles that laid down the Dayton accords, assess what has been done, what has to be done and, most significantly, the realistic chances of the balance being done.

Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I think it is imperative we take the steps outlined in this amendment and add additional steps so that this country does not drift into a new policy along the very lines that the Senator from Arizona has so eloquently stated. 
I was privileged, on behalf of the Armed Services Committee, to write the committee's report on Somalia, with the distinguished Senator from Michigan [Mr. Levin]. I well understood how we got into it, what the problems were. And, once again, we are in the business of nation building as we interpose ourself amongst the several political factions fighting in that country. 
I voted consistently against putting ground troops in. Therefore, I can stand here with a clear conscience today and say, once they are in, we have to assess what is that exit strategy. We are going to have $7.3 billion of American taxpayers' money expended if we go through June 1998. There is no way of assessing the price tag of the risks of our men and women of the Armed Forces of our Nation have taken during that period of time. Therefore, this policy has to be rethought, and I think no less a reconvening of the Dayton principles is a measure we need to do to get to the right result in this situation. 
Mr. President, I thank the distinguished manager for my few minutes here.

Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I was particularly moved by the remarks of the Senator from Utah and decided I would come to the floor at this time and add my own thoughts, which are in support of the funding for the National Endowment for the Arts. 
Mr. President, support for the arts and the humanities, in my judgment, characterizes a civil society. It establishes in many respects that Nation's place in history. We read so much about wars and politicians, but I find that the search for the arts is what really leaves the strongest impression about a Nation's contribution to mankind. 
Throughout our Nation's history, the arts have held a very valued place in our country. I listened earlier to our good friends and colleagues speak, and I went over to my reception room and lifted this volume entitled `The Art in the United States Capitol.' Would it not be hypocrisy for those who feel so inclined to no longer help the communities have their own arts, would it not be somewhat hypocritical for us, since we live in and work in this collection of buildings, amidst one of the greatest collections of art in the world, and we are so proud that we put this book out? 
Let me read the preface. It is 1976, the year of our bicentennial. 94th Congress of the United States, concurrent resolution. 
Resolved by the House of Representatives, the Senate concurring, That there be printed with black and white and color illustrations as a House document, a volume entitled `Art in the United States Capitol,' as prepared under the direction of the Architect of the Capitol; and that there be printed 36,400 additional copies of such document, of which 10,300 will be for the use of the Senate, 22,100 copies will be used for the House of Representatives, and 4,000 copies for the use of the Architect of the Capitol. 
It is a beautiful volume, Mr. President. I urge those who enjoy, as I do, these magnificent paintings in this great institution to get a copy, if we can find it for them, and place it in their reception room. As the visitors come from all across my State, and indeed from other States, this is the volume which they pick up and go through with great pride. I am astonished we would enjoy what we have and at the same time not try to take the proper steps to provide for the rest of the country a comparable enjoyment. 
As my distinguished colleague said, while we may not have, thus far, with the NEA created a Michelangelo, perhaps we have instilled in men to study his works. I often take time to go through our galleries and museums all across this country to enjoy the great contributions of those in our Nation who have placed in history this Nation's contribution to the arts. 
I feel it would be a sad contradiction were Members of Congress to turn their back on funding for the arts at the same time we work among this marvelous collection of art and buildings, some of the most priceless pieces of art work in the country and enjoyed by millions of visitors every day to the Capitol of the United States. 
The Rules Committee, of which I am a member, has oversight responsibility for these buildings and the works of art proudly displayed. We have a curator, a very knowledgeable individual with whom I have had many, many, enjoyable conversations. Each day our own collection is checked. Often it has to be refurbished. The Capitol Building itself is one of the finest examples of 19th-century neoclassical architecture, and it is noted in the hallways and throughout some 540 rooms of the 
Capitol that there are over 677 works of art, including portraits, major paintings, statutes, reliefs, frescoes, murals, sculptures, and other miscellaneous items. 
The National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities were founded some 30 years ago with the passage of the National Foundation on the Arts and Humanities Act of 1965. Since their inception, the NEA and the NEH have funded numerous museums, symphonies, and projects of historical and cultural significance. 
In my State, the economic wealth of Virginia has been the beneficiary of many of those contributions. 
In addition, the NEA and NEH grants served as a catalyst for organizations by assisting them in fundraising efforts in their own communities. 
How often have I attended these events. And the fact that the National Endowment for the Arts in Washington, DC, recognizes that this particular entity in Virginia is eligible for a grant has enabled them to raise additional funds. It is a force multiplier in the all-important work of raising private contributions. 
Have the NEA and the National Endowment for the Humanities made mistakes? Oh, yes, Mr. President, very, very serious errors in judgment and mistakes. But show me any other department or agency of the Federal Government that has not likewise made serious mistakes in the course of their history. We learn by our mistakes. I was here at the time a very serious problem arose with the National Endowment, and I say to my good friend from North Carolina--and I am privileged to sit in front of his desk, a dear and valued friend--how properly he brought that to the attention of the American people. That was a serious example. But I am convinced we have learned from these mistakes, and they shall not be repeated. Fundamental change, nevertheless, is needed, Mr. President. 
In July, the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee, of which I am privileged to be a member, had the opportunity to review, mark up and report legislation reauthorizing the NEA and the NEH. 
This measure, the Arts and Humanities Amendments of 1997 (S. 1020) makes progress toward the structural reforms many of us believe need to be made. It focuses the mission of the agencies, while broadening the populations served. It reduces bureaucracy, while increasing accountability. And it sets in motion a process by which a true endowment can be established. 
This reauthorization bill represents the bipartisan work of the committee with jurisdiction. During markup, there were three areas of the measure that I believed merited the committee's attention. I put forth three amendments, all of them being adopted. 
First, I expressed concern with the authorization levels contained in this bill. Given the current climate, working toward a balanced budget, which I support, we need to provide a realistic authorization level for the NEA. I offered an amendment to reduce authorization level for the NEA from $175 to $105 million, which was successful. Granted, I recognize that permanent reauthorization of these agencies is unlikely at best. But we must be realistic. 
I am pleased that the Appropriations Committee has likewise come to a similar level of funding. 
Second, I stated that the NEA's advisory panels need to be more geographically representative. Currently, membership on the panels is concentrated in two States: New York and California. Again, I offered an amendment to ensure that no more than 10 percent of panel members were from one State. We need to ensure that America's geographic diversity is represented on these panels, for it is they who determine which works are funded. 
Finally, I remain convinced that administrative costs must be limited. Every dollar saved on administrative costs is another dollar available for grantmaking activities. This panel recognized that fact last Congress, when it favorably reported a reauthorization bill with a 12-percent cap on administrative expenses. We need to get to that level. I outline these points simply to illustrate that the reported measure, represents, in my 
 view, a balanced, thoughtful approach to the dilemma of the NEA. As I said, at the hearing before the Labor Committee nearly 2 months ago, I want to express my support for the arts and the maintenance of a national presence. But I also wish to express my strong support for a thorough review of the agency policy. 
The Labor and Human Resources Committee put forth a bipartisan consensus predicted on the hearing and amendment process. The framework of S. 1020 represents a solid basis for handling these issues on this bill. I hope that the leaders of both committees of jurisdiction can set forth a consensus that builds on the work done in the Labor Committee and can come together and craft a measure to be put in this bill that reflects and takes into consideration, I think, the very constructive considerations that have been offered by many of my colleagues this afternoon, and can put together a framework predicated on the foundation set in S. 1020. 
I understood the desire to report from the Senate Labor Committee and from the Senate the most favorable bill possible from the agencies' perspective. However, presenting the most realistic measure possible will ensure that our priorities are preserved. 
As a new member of the Senate Labor and Human Resources, I was pleased to work with Chairman Jeffords and other members of the committee to craft this proposal. This measure meets the need for structural reform, provides appropriate funding levels, and maintains our commitment to the arts. 
It is my hope that the work of the committee will be recognized and incorporated in the final legislation funding these agencies. 
One thing that this debate makes clear is the need for a thorough revamp of this process. I would support funding for 1 more year with the commitment to evaluate, through hearings before the Labor Committee, appropriate policy changes. It is my hope that a comprehensive review of Federal funding of the arts and the proposed alternatives--several of which have been offered on the floor--will resolve this annual debate. 
The United States is the world's leading economic and military superpower, and as we enter the second millennium, I believe we have a special obligation to ensure that the arts are not neglected. 
Mr. President, we are approaching the millennium. It would be tragic, I think, for the United States of America to begin to celebrate the millennium having abandoned public support for the arts and, yet, we in the Capitol will still remain in this magnificent set of buildings containing this magnificent art, which were contributions of previous generations. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I am going to momentarily send a bill to the desk which will prohibit the use of F-117 aircraft and B-2 aircraft in public shows. 
Madam President, I was stunned to learn last night of this tragic accident, and in no way does my action reflect any discredit on the pilot or in any way prejudge the outcome of this tragic accident. Indeed, there are facts at this moment which indicate this pilot took a risk of life to possibly avoid a greater degree of risk to others. As I listened to that report, I thought back to my own experience in Korea in 1951. My commanding officer--I remember him very well--Lt. Col. Al Gordon, U.S. Marine Corps, took off in his AD-1 bomber, and he experienced fire over a community. He stayed with his aircraft in order to avoid that aircraft going into a community, and as a consequence it lost altitude. When he finally bailed out, there was insufficient distance between the aircraft and the ground. His chute streamed and he lost his life. I remember it so well because I was detailed to go out into the mountains and collect that brave officer. 
I believe that we as a nation should not be using this type of military asset in this type of show. This airplane, on a unit program cost, costs the taxpayers $100 million a copy. We only have 53 remaining, and they are needed for special missions in the national security interests of this country. I just do not believe that type of asset can be put at this type of risk. The B-2 bomber is $2 billion a copy. 
Madam President, I stand with some embarrassment because I realize my office and others are besieged with requests from communities and constituents to provide these aircraft for air shows. The aircraft do enhance an air show a great deal, but I feel it is a matter of principle that this Nation cannot subject that costly an aircraft, one that is essential to the performance of specialized missions, in this type of circumstance. As a result, I will submit this bill. Further, I am going to consider this issue in the course of the conference between the House and the Senate on the 1998 authorization bill. It will undoubtedly provoke some comment which I will listen to very carefully. I just wanted to express the heartfelt feelings of one Senator that we have to look more carefully at the use of these very costly systems in connection with public air shows such as this. 
I yield the floor and thank my colleagues.

Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank my colleague. As the distinguished ranking member of our Environment and Public Works Committee, Senator Baucus was instrumental from the very beginning. I think his presence and his comments reflect the truly bipartisan nature in which we, the members of the committee, have forged this bill. Indeed, under the leadership of our distinguished chairman, the senior Senator from Rhode Island, we have been able to achieve this piece of legislation, which although receiving, understandably, early criticism from some few quarters, those quarters are fewer than I had anticipated. I thank my distinguished colleague. I shall have further comments about his contribution as I proceed, Mr. President. 
I should also like to acknowledge the presence on the floor of the distinguished Senator from Florida. He, Mr. Graham, has been instrumental from the very first in working this bill toward a balanced piece of legislation which we feel it represents. I was extraordinarily heartened by the fact that nine members of our committee have joined and I think others will soon join as cosponsors. Our list of cosponsors now as of the introduction totals some 12, in addition to Senator Chafee and Senator Baucus. 
Mr. President, also it is traditional around here to acknowledge the participation of staff, and all too often that is done at the end. I want to do it at the very, very beginning, because the contribution of the staff in the preparation of a 400-page bill, a copy of which I will momentarily have in my hands and present to the Senate--400 pages--you can imagine the staff was absolutely instrumental. 
We have the staff director, Mr. Jimmie Powell, Dan Corbett, Kathy Ruffalo, who works for Senator Baucus, Tom Sliter, Linda Jordan, Ellen Stein, and, above all, my distinguished chief counsel of the subcommittee, Ann Loomis. This is my 19th year in the Senate, and I say unequivocally, Mr. President, I have never seen an individual work harder on a piece of legislation than Ann Loomis, proudly of the Commonwealth of Virginia. 
We go into the final review by the Senate, which is scheduled, I believe, in the last week, according to Senator Lott who is very enthusiastic about the Senate moving forward expeditiously on this bill, in September, or thereabouts. So we will consider it at that time. 
Mr. President, I introduce the Intermodal Surface Transportation Act of 1997. There have been many names given to this. There was ISTEA which was passed by the Congress in 1991. I think for simplicity I will refer to this as ISTEA II, as I am sure there will be an ISTEA III and an ISTEA IV. There is no more important function of the Congress of the United States than to address our transportation needs. So there will be a succession of bills, but I am hopeful that this bill, which is of 6-year duration, in contrast to the House of Representatives which is 3, will, again, sequentially follow on from ISTEA I as ISTEA II. 
This 6-year bill represents a hard-fought set of negotiations. Again, I most sincerely express my appreciation to the leadership 
and the wisdom contributed by our distinguished chairman, Mr. Chafee, and Mr. Baucus, the ranking member of the committee and also the ranking member of the Subcommittee on Transportation--which was given the principal responsibility for drafting the bill--of which I am privileged to be the chairman, together with Mr. Baucus in his dual capacity as ranking on the subcommittee. 
Balance and fairness, those are the two words that will enable the supporters of this piece of legislation to have it passed by the Senate--those two words--because those are the principal goals that I sought and others who worked so hard on this bill, and also to preserve those parts of ISTEA that have served the Nation well. 
In 1991, ISTEA represented a landmark piece of legislation, unlike anything that had ever been passed in the history of the United States, other than perhaps the significance of the original interstate system. But ISTEA I was landmark. It embraced the need for an intermodal concept. It embraced the need to preserve our environment as we, indeed, paved America to meet our transportation needs. Therefore, I would like to recognize the principal author of that bill, Senator Moynihan, the senior Senator from New York. He has been referred to as `the father of ISTEA.' His duties on the Finance Committee did not enable him to have as active a role as I am sure he wished to have had in the preparation of this bill, and he also recognized in the passage of these 6 years that there are other factors that have come to the forefront that were going to guide ISTEA II. But nevertheless, I think today in the New York press, it is reported that `Senator Moynihan states New York has been treated fairly.' 
I thank `the father of ISTEA' for that first statement because it comes from one who is well informed as to this Nation's requirements on transportation. In his capacity as a senior member, indeed ranking member, of the Senate Finance Committee, he will have a very active role in fulfilling that committee's responsibility with respect to this bill, as will two other committees: The Banking Committee and the Commerce Committee. So this legislation eventually embraces the work of four Senate committees. 
This bill addresses the unique transportation needs in the different regions of the country. The congestion needs of the growing South, the aging infrastructure needs of the Northeast and, indeed, the unique, the very unique requirements of, we call them the Western States, primarily those in the Northwest corridor of the United States--Montana, Wyoming. Mr. Thomas, a member of our committee, and Mr. Kempthorne were very active, together with Mr. Baucus, in bringing to the forefront the special requirements of those States. 
It was the judgment of myself and Mr. Baucus that we should have a hearing, which we indeed did, hosted by Mr. Baucus, in Idaho with officials both from Montana and Idaho testifying before our committee. I learned things like, given the extensive mileage and the sparse settlement of houses, farms and cities and factories, the shoulders of those roads need some special attention; the speeds at which they travel are somewhat different than in other parts of America. 
So the rural West--I think they look with pride on still being referred to as `rural.' In my few moments of vacation, I tried to spend a little time in that region, but it is one of the most well-preserved, most magnificent parts of our great country. This transportation bill takes into consideration their special needs, their special environmental concerns so that America can continue to enjoy the bountiful natural resources we have in that part of the country. 
So I am pointing out that we very carefully took into consideration--and I shall not further enumerate--all of the unique parts of each of our 50 States, and particularly as they are located in certain geographic locations. We have carefully preserved the principles of ISTEA. We have proven so successful by hard experience, practical experience, practical application in our several States. 
Examples. Ensuring that transportation contributes to preserving our environment. The President of the United States acknowledged some months ago in a speech that this piece of legislation--not referring to the specific bill, although I hope this bill meets the requirements of the administration. Indeed, I have, just moments ago, finished another lengthy conference with the Secretary of Transportation who visited my office. And we talked about the President's desire to make sure that this legislation preserved the best parts of ISTEA as it related to the environment and, indeed, built on that foundation. And I think, Mr. President, largely under the leadership of Senator Chafee, we have done that. 
But that is an example of how we took the best of ISTEA and preserved it in this bill. We built upon the shared decisionmaking that was in ISTEA I between the Federal, State, and local governments, and most importantly ensuring that the public, I mean right down to townhall meeting, the public continues to participate fully in the transportation planning process. 
The experience, over 6 years, of ISTEA I has shown that local governments contribute positively to setting transportation priorities. I look forward to working with my own local governments and projects of significance to them. For example, I have spent so much of my life down in the rural part of Virginia, primarily in the Middleburg, Upperville areas. 
I first started down there working on farms in the middle 1930's. I remember the farms did not even have tractors, and it was all horses. But through the years this small section of my State has been able to preserve the qualities of this rural community. We have Route 50, which is a winding road. It was actually an oxcart road cut by the need to move west from Alexandria, which was a major port, surprisingly a major port on the east coast at one time, and Georgetown. And they gathered there and then moved on `westward ho' down Route 50. 
Route 50 winds and twists through the lovely hills and the valleys and crosses the streams. We want to somehow keep that for future generations, keep it in place. There are some people with considerable vision as to how to do it, yet still meet the needs for modern transportation. Anyway, I hope to incorporate in this bill certain legislative provisions which will foster the ability of the local governments and local leaders to preserve the best, not only in the community in which I grew up through these many years, but elsewhere in America. 
Also of profound importance to the Greater Metropolitan Washington area is the Woodrow Wilson Bridge. In this legislation, we have more than doubled the administration's $400 million proposed level of funding for the bridge to $900 million, thereby elevating the significance of the bridge. We have however provided that before any funds can be spent on construction of the bridge, either an authority or agreement between Maryland, Virginia, or the District of Columbia must be made as to who will take title of the bridge. 
We have also carefully preserved those principles of ISTEA which have again a proven record of success, an absolute proven record of success. 
The heart of this piece of legislation again is fairness and balance. There is no more dramatic provision to document that goal than the equitable fair funding of return of the tax dollars. 
ISTEA failed--and I have to criticize ISTEA--it failed to provide funding to our States based on current data that measured the extent and the use of our transportation system. It contained five equity adjustments, yet still the formula did not equitably 
treat all States with the fairness based on their contributions to the highway trust fund. 
Our bill today ensures balance and fairness. This one does what we possibly set out to do--I will attribute the best of intentions to the crafters of ISTEA I--but I assure you the drafters of ISTEA II have locked in a formula, predicated on modern, up-to-date factors, and it cannot be twisted and bent or changed in such a way as to deny to every State a 90-cent return on each dollar of taxes sent from a State to Uncle Sam's Treasury in the highway trust fund wherever the depository may be in Washington, DC. 
Our bill today ensures this balance and fairness. Every State will receive a minimum return of 90 percent of their contributions to the highway trust fund. This guarantee is very different from the so-called 90 percent minimum allocation in ISTEA I. This is a real guarantee, not to be readjusted by any further actions. I would not have supported anything that did not give every State a minimum guarantee of 90 cents on the dollar. 
Mr. President, we have listened to our colleagues and made our best attempt to be fair. Either this bill succeeds on the doctrine of fairness or it will fall victim to politics, not Republican versus Democrat politics for this is a bipartisan bill. You need only look at the list of cosponsors. You only need to heed the remarks of the distinguished Senator from Montana. No, it will not fall victim to politics as we recognize them, but will fall victim to literally civil strife between big States, industrial States, small States, and the whole thing can be torn apart, and I doubt that Humpty Dumpty could ever be put back together again if they pull this apart in a way that any Senator could stand on the floor and say each State is treated equally and gets 90 cents back on the tax dollar. 
I ask my colleagues, who understandably have concerns about this legislation, to consult with their respective highway officials. STEP-21 was put together, again, as a consequence of a group of these well-experienced individuals in a number of States; Stars 2000, likewise, which was put together by a number of expert highway officials in the several States. They understand the problems. I hope that our colleagues will seek the advice and counsel of their respective highway officials before they decide exactly what they are going to do on this bill. 
At the outset, again, my highest priority was to improve the mobility of people and goods. The biggest threat to the United States today comes from the growing competition around the world, all throughout the world. It is a one-world market. While we sleep the other half are busily engaged in their activities. Those economic activities are to meet us at our very doorsteps with competition in their products and in their services. It is an extraordinary world in which we live today compared to just a decade ago. 
How do we compete in this market? America very much wants to keep our wages, our lifestyle, our environment at the very best. The standards of those factors in other nations in many instances are far less. Those priorities are not sought by the central governments, indeed, the governments of those States. So what do we do? 
How do we beat the marketplace sale on a pair of blue jeans manufactured in the Far East versus a pair of blue jeans manufactured in the United States? Well, I have a dramatic experience I remember. I went to my State to a blue jeans plant, and I talked to the workers. I watched them make a quality product that would match any product in the world, in fact, in my judgment, is better. I may have a slight prejudice. It was better. 
But I asked them, `How do you beat the low wages, the marginal environment, and lifestyle in faraway lands, but when your product reaches the store shelf right beside them is a product from a foreign land?' 
He said, `Come with me.' 
We went to the back of this plant where every hour big trucks 
backed up and loaded on the products. He said, `We get an order in in the morning. That order is filled. And overnight it is delivered right to the store's shelf.' 
We can beat them because of America's transportation system. And that is what this bill, Mr. President, is designed to do, to thrust America ahead in the competitive economic market by virtue of a modern, efficient transportation system, to cut down the time of Mr. and Mrs. America behind the wheel getting to their place of work, getting to the school to drop off the children, and returning safely at home. Every minute wasted behind that wheel in gridlock is a wasted moment from work, from family, and such leisure time as we may have. 
This bill is directed to make America more competitive in that one-world market. How do we achieve these goals? We streamline ISTEA's five programs into three programs: The National Highway System, NHS; the Surface Transportation Program; STP; and the Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality Program, CMAQ. Those are the three. 
By condensing five into three, we build in efficiencies. We have given more authority to the Governors, to the various highways and boards and commissions. We have given more authority down to the boards of supervisors and to the mayors and to other local authorities to make the decisions that are best for their community, nevertheless, maintaining the Federal focus on our most important network of roads, the National Highway System, which indeed now embraces the historic interstate system. 
While I started with a goal of a 95 percent return for every State--I see on the floor my good friend, the Senator from Florida [Mr. Graham]. He will address this momentarily because he was a real fighter, not only in ISTEA I but throughout the drafting of this bill. It had been our hope to reach 95 cents, but we soon recognized that we could not do it if we were to build a successful coalition and to properly recognize the individual requirements of certain geographic regions of the United States, primarily the Western States. 
They require certain augmentation of their financial status under this legislation because they recognize from experience, not only on this bill but on other bills, that when western interests go into a conference between the House and the Senate, they have far fewer Members of the House of Representatives from those States. 
It goes back to the very fundamental principle, Mr. President, the very fundamental principle that when our forefathers laid down this Government and fashioned this Republic, the oldest surviving democratic form of republic on Earth today, the United States with its Constitution and Bill of Rights, when they fashioned that, they recognized letting the States have equal representation in the Senate because in the House of Representatives that representation is recognized by virtue of the population. 
So we strengthened the financial position of the Western States, recognizing historically that strength has been diminished from the Senate position as a consequence of fewer Members in the House. 
We are going to hold and protect our Western States in this bill. That is why we had to drop from 95 cents to the 90 cents. 
Many, many of the donor States are now recognizing that 90 cents is an enormous increment from where they were. In my State, we got 79 cents on the dollar. There is relative joy in my State as we move to 90, and indeed, six donor States got a small fraction or so above 90 as a consequence of a small application of the formula, not through selectivity. 
This bill will use the most currently available data to achieve a fair distribution fund. That will include factors that represent the divergent transportation needs of our Nation. There will be no surprises. We will use lane miles which represent the extent of our highway network, vehicle miles traveled or VMT's, which measure the volume of traffic on the system, bridge measurement based on the number of structurally deficient and capacity limited bridges, and diesel fuel consumption that represents the freight traffic. 
I look forward to continuing the Senate's work on this vital legislation and am proud today to have brought to the Senate a balanced, fair, and solid proposal. This highway transportation proposal, in terms of spending is second in size only to the defense bill, and its significance to the American economy is similar. The bottom line is this bill is a regionally balanced, multidimensional plan that will establish transportation policy for the 21st century. It carves a big role for public input, respects the environment, and in a broader sense empowers States and local governments. 
We have at long last abandoned the archaic measurements of postal route mileage and other outdated measurements used in ISTEA.

Mr. President, in accordance with section 318 of Public Law 101-520 as amended by Public Law 103-283, I am submitting the frank mail allocations made to each Senator from the appropriation for official mail expenses and a summary tabulation of Senate mass mail costs for the second quarter of fiscal year 1997 to be printed in the Record. The third quarter of fiscal year 1997 covers the period of April 1, 1997, through June 30, 1997. The official mail allocations are available for frank mail costs, as stipulated in Public Law 104-197, the Legislative Branch Appropriations Act for fiscal year 1997.

Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise to thank the managers of this legislation for including language offered by myself and Senator Kennedy that will provide the Department of Education with $1.1 million to begin planning efforts for the Nation's celebration of the millennium. These funds were requested by the Department of Education and will be offset within the Department. 
The Clinton administration recently established the White House Millennium Program to coordinate the Nation's efforts to celebrate the millennium. Having served as Administrator of the American Revolution Bicentennial Administration, I know the importance of advance planning and preparation for national events. While not comparable in historic significance to our bicentennial, the millennium is, nevertheless, an event many Americans will wish to recognize and to participate in. To the extent there is national governmental participation, it should be to focus on dignity and quality. These funds will be critical to that effort. 
It is my hope that the White House Millennium Program will work closely with an organization I have been affiliated with for a number of years--the Millennium Society. This respected international organization has been in existence since 1979 and is devoted to organizing a global celebration of the millennium. Most importantly, the Millennium Society has focused much of its efforts on establishing and administering the Millennium Society Scholarship Program. 
I would like to particularly recognize Cate Magennis Wyatt, a founder of the Millennium Society, who was instrumental in building the organization. Her dedication and hard work have focused international attention on this issue in a positive manner. 
Over the past several years, along with much support from Senators Dodd and Stevens and others, I have worked closely with the firm of Alcalde & Fay and, in recent months, Tommy Boggs, a volunteer counselor. All of us have worked with one goal in mind--ensure that the millennium is celebrated in a proper and dignified manner. Providing adequate planning funds will help us achieve that goal.

Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I was distressed yesterday to hear comments on the floor relative to the duty of the U.S. Senate under the U.S. Constitution to determine--and we have the sole authority under the Constitution to determine--the issues as relating to the presence or absence of that degree of fraud or other conditions that would affect the outcome of the election in Louisiana. The subject has been discussed many times on the floor. 
As chairman of the Rules Committee, I have overall responsibility for the direction and the daily conduct of this investigation. I will later today either address the Senate or put in the Record a detailed accounting of everything that I, the staff of the committee, and others have done since the last time I reported to the Senate with regard to this very important case. But I wish to assure my colleagues that while I regret that the Democrats decided to walk out on the investigation that the Republican majority of the committee, and specifically myself, we have continued to fulfill what I and others regard as the bottom-line responsibility of the U.S. Senate, and that is to go and look at every reasonable source of potential evidence as it relates to fraud in this election. This has taken a great deal of time. I recognize that it has stressed the patience of many. 
But if you look historically, as I have done, at comparable situations when the U.S. Senate has been faced with the election problems, this case thus far is relatively short in duration. Many have gone for as much as 18 months to over 2 years. 
It is my hope and my expectation that we can conclude this work in a reasonable period of time. Under the leadership of our distinguished majority leader and, indeed, some on the other side of the aisle, we were very near to an agreement whereby both sides concurred that this matter could be concluded before late September--this month. That fell by the wayside, and I was then given the authority at long last, although I had asked a number of times--it had been denied by the Democrats--the authority to issue subpoenas. I received that authority from the committee. Subpoenas were promptly issued. And I went to Louisiana on two occasions and each time conducted 2 full days of hearings. I repeat, 2 full days; 4 full days thus far of hearings in Louisiana. 
In response to those subpoenas, individuals without exception came in, some voluntarily. Those individuals responded in large measure to the best of their knowledge to each and every question. Some equivocated. That is true in any trial. I used to be an assistant U.S. attorney for 4 or 5 years, and I have tried many cases. But I can judge witnesses fairly well based on that experience. I say on the whole the witnesses were forthcoming in their oral testimony. 
Likewise, we issued subpoenas duces tecum for records. We have in the possession of the Senate now some four to six cartons of records as a consequence of those subpoenas issued in August. Most of those records relate to the gambling industry, which, according to official records, put anywhere from $10 to $15 million into the elections taking place on December 5 or 6 of 1996 because there was a referendum that affected the gambling industry. They had a right to participate and contribute money to foster their interests in certain votes as related to the referendum. 
But anyway, that is a voluminous amount of record material that must be gone over carefully by Senate staff and such other adjunct support as we can get from the GAO. Much to my disappointment, and despite the efforts of the distinguished majority leader, myself, and others, the FBI pulled out when the Democrats left. That left us short-handed in the nature of support. But we are doing our best. And despite the efforts of majority leader, myself, and others, the FBI still has not come in to give any further help. 
All of this is to say the buck stops with me as the chairman. And I can, in clearest of conscience, report to my colleagues that I feel that the Rules Committee, its staff, and the Republican Senators participating are fulfilling the exact requirement placed upon us by the U.S. Constitution. 
I urge that the Members of this body continue to allow that work to be done in an orderly fashion as best we can, given the extraordinary handicaps we have, both financial, time and staffwise, to do our work, to go over the records we have. 
I announced in Louisiana it would be my judgment, subject to concurrence of other members of the committee, to have at least one more hearing, this time here in the Rules Committee room, at which time the gambling industry would be subpoenaed to come and explain in detail the voluminous amount of records we now have before us. We need to ascertain whether or not this sum of money, ranging from $10 million to $15 million, was expended in a proper way in accordance with Federal and State law, or in fact did some of it slip into areas which could have generated fraud and, indeed, affected the outcome of this election through fraud. 
So, Mr. President, I see the majority leader now at this time and I, due to time constraints, have to stop my remarks, but I will put in the Record today, either orally or insert a more complete dissertation, exactly what we have done. 
Mr. LOTT addressed the Chair.

Mr. WARNER. I want to assure the Senate that I said in Louisiana, as I concluded the second hearing--and we had a total of 4 days of hearings--it would be my intention to come back and recommend to the Rules Committee and the leadership of the Senate that I have another hearing, at which time we will assess in specific the voluminous amount of record material now in our possession from the gambling industry and that within a period of perhaps a week after that I would schedule a second meeting, at which time I would give to the full Committee on Rules all of the evidence, my own assessment, and then entertain such resolutions as I or other members may wish to submit. 
That I think can be done within a 3-week period of time, as I roughly outlined this morning to my distinguished leader. But I decided on that schedule 10 days ago. 
Now, I say to you that thus far there has been no evidence which, in the judgment of this Senator, has impugned Senator Landrieu, but that is not the underlying issue. It is whether or not there were other factors in this election which could have affected the outcome as a consequence of criminal fraud. And I have said, much to the discouragement of many, that thus far, after the first hearing in Louisiana, there was no body of evidence which I felt could meet that burden. 
I cannot make the same statement after the second hearing in Louisiana, because I haven't had the opportunity to assess four boxes of information. But we are proceeding, although handicapped, as expeditiously as we can. I have always been absolutely objective and fair about my pronouncements in this case and my assessment of the evidence. But until such time as we have looked in every area where potentially that quantum of fraud which could have affected the outcome of the election might have occurred, I cannot say this investigation would be complete. I do believe the work that needs to be done under my leadership can be concluded in the third week of September.

Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, periodically, I report to the Senate on the work of the Rules Committee investigation into alleged fraud and irregularities that may have affected the outcome of the 1996 Louisiana Senate election. Our committee is conducting this investigation under the authority given the Senate pursuant to article 1, section 5 of the Constitution of the United States. 
Briefly recapping, I reported on May 8 of the committee's efforts to secure a bipartisan investigation. On May 23, I reported our efforts to obtain the detail of FBI agents to the committee and the agreement to issue over 130 subpoenas, although for election records only. Then, on June 26, I reported that the Rules Committee Democrats had, unexpectedly, withdrawn from the investigation--after only 2 weeks of committee action in the field. FBI support, likewise, was terminated by the Attorney General. 
I also reported that the results of the investigation had revealed a significant failure, by election officials, in numerous Louisiana statutory provisions designed to safeguard the election from voter fraud. Given these numerous breaches of law, although many appeared to be unintentional, I believed the Senate had an obligation to examine a broad number of areas where the potential for fraudulent acts and voting could have occurred. 
On July 31, the committee authorized me to continue the preliminary investigation and granted me, by resolution, the authority to issue subpoenas. To date, I have issued 38 subpoenas, in addition to the 134 Senator Ford and I jointly agreed to issue, which have resulted in thousands of pages of documents as well as the appearance of numerous witnesses at 4 days of hearings held in New Orleans. We have received testimony from officials in the LIFE [Louisiana Independent Federation of Electors, Inc.] organization, as well as the owners of Carl Mullican Communications, Inc. [CMC], organizations prominently mentioned in the Jenkins petition and supporting documents. 
We have received testimony from representatives of gambling-related companies, witnesses who have voted more than once or had knowledge of those who had, van drivers on election day, and election officials, including one who worked on election day as both an election official and as a canvasser for a gambling company. 
Our investigators have also interviewed hundreds of people, regarding allegations of: mismatched signatures, precincts closing beyond the prescribed closing hour, multiple voting, noncompliance with State voting laws, and involvement of gambling industry in the election. 
On August 29, GAO detailed three persons to the committee to assist in the examination of election documents received as a result of subpoenas. We are now negotiating for an additional detail of qualified accountants to help examine the subpoenaed gambling industry documents. 
We also have requested the Department of Justice to reconsider its withdrawal and to return this case with added support. To date, we have been met with their continued resistance. 
As I concluded the second series of Louisiana hearings, on August 27, I stated that further hearings were needed. In consultation with the committee, I will soon set our next hearing. 
The pullout of the Democrats. and resultant loss of FBI support have complicated our task, but we are continuing to make progress in this investigation. My goal remains to ensure that the committee's work is performed in keeping with the precedents of the Senate in past election cases and to give the full committee my honest judgment of the established facts. The committee will then report to the full Senate its honest judgment of these facts respecting the Senate's duty under the Constitution of the United States. 
Suffice it to say, the results of this investigation to date are as yet incomplete. We do not have that body of facts to convincingly state that fraud or irregularities did, or did not, affect the results of the 1996 election for the U.S. Senator from Louisiana. 
As developments occur, of such significance as to inform Senators, I again will give a timely report.

 Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, over the past 2 weeks, and culminating with ceremonies this past Sunday, the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority opened the new terminal at National Airport. 
This $450 million state of the art facility is just one element of a $2 billion capital development plan at both Washington National and Dulles International Airports, made possible by the creation of the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority only 10 short years ago. 
To understand the significance of this achievement, one only needs to recall what it was like to use either Washington National or Dulles International during the late 1970's and early 1980's. 
Both airports were owned by the Federal Aviation Administration, and Congress was absolutely unwilling to appropriate more than the bare essential amount necessary to operate either facility. 
National Airport was in a grave state of disrepair, and Dulles was called the great white elephant. 
Looking upon these airports as integral parts of the areas economy was unfathomable, and the notion of customer service was even more unimaginable. 
Then, thinking in the region began to change. 
Encouraged by the desire of the Reagan administration to re-examine the proper role of Federal Government, area business leaders and members of the Virginia congressional delegation started asking the question: Why not divest the Federal government of these two airports, and let them be run like a business? 
Fortunately, there was a Secretary of Transportation whose response to the question was: Why not indeed! 
Not about to be discouraged by enormity or ambitious nature of the task, that Secretary of Transportation, Elizabeth Hanford Dole, enlisted the assistance of a very able and influential statesman, former Virginia Governor Linwood Holton, who worked tirelessly to help mold both a plan, and the consensus to transfer ownership of the two airports to a non-Federal authority. 
This authority was authorized under an interstate compact to operate the airports and to raise the money necessary to renew National Airport, and to make Dulles the economic dynamo its creators once envisioned. 
Following a very tortuous and uncertain course through the legislative process, a bill was finally placed on President Reagan's desk for signature, and in 1987, the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority took control of the two airports. 
Under the stewardship of James A. Wilding, and the leadership of a ten person board comprised of appointees from Virginia and Maryland and the District of Columbia, the Airports Authority designed a capital development plan which relied on the sales of bonds financed by future revenues. 
This capital development plan became the catalyst enabling the Metropolitan region to achieve its dream. 
Today, Dulles International Airport is a major force in the growing hightech and biotech economy of the region, and with the opening of the new National terminal last Sunday, the region now has a world-class dining, shopping, and transportation facility to welcome the more than 15 million passengers who come to the Nation's capital from cities within a 1,250 mile perimeter of the airport. 
In fact, it is this perimeter, combined with a limitation on the number of flights that can arrive and depart from National Airport each hour, and a curfew on stage two aircraft after 10 P.M., that maintains the political and economic balance enabling National Airport to serve short-haul passengers, while Dulles International serves long-haul passengers from across the United States and around the world. 
Without these tools, the community would be in a literal uproar over the noise and volume of air traffic at Washington National Airport, and Dulles would still be the white elephant it was in the 1970's and early 1980's. 
Needless to say, the region's economy would be nothing like it is today had the vision of Secretary Dole, area business leaders and Virginia's Congressional delegation not been realized. 
So, Mr. President, it is with gratitude that I salute all the thousands of people who helped make this dream come true. 
Especially I thank the present and former members of the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority board of directors including Linwood Holton, Ron Linton, and Robert Tardio; the staff and management of the Airports Authority including James A. Wilding, general manager, August Melton, manager of Washington National Airport, and Keith Merlin, manager of Dulles International Airport; and architect Cesar Pelli and all the construction personnel who turned Mr. Pelli's designs into a living, working masterpieces. 
Congratulations to all. Job well done.

Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I am privileged to join my friend from Iowa, Senator Harkin, in putting in the Senate's recognition of John Berg--an institution himself. 
His service to Americans was his life. No task was insurmountable; no task was performed with less than all-out dedication. 
My most memorable among many trips to Paris was during the bicentennial of the Treaty of Paris in 1983. President Reagan had appointed me as his representative to the many events the French hosted to honor the first treaty to recognize, in 1783, a new Nation--the 13 colonies as the United States of America. John Berg was my aid-de-camp throughout that visit. I should add to that official visits to the 40th and 50th recognitions of D-day, June 6, 1944. 
And so it goes for all of us in Congress as we salute John Berg. Well done, sir.

 Mr. WARNER. Mr President, I rise today to recognize an historic event in our relations with our erstwhile cold war enemy, Vietnam. On May 7, 1997, that country and our own great Nation exchanged defense attaches. Senior Col. Vo Dinh Quang of the Vietnam Army was accredited as the defense, military, naval, and air attache to the United States. He is the first defense attache from Vietnam since 1975, when the South Vietnam attache positions dissolved by default with the collapse of South Vietnam. 
The Corps of Foreign Attaches is a distinguished group of foreign senior officers who are accredited to the Department of Defense and the Department of State to officially and personally represent their defense secretaries in the United States with regard to military matters. Eighty-one countries around the world, allied and nonallied, are represented by over 100 navy, army, and air force officers living in the Washington, DC, area. Historically, this prestigious assignment has produced many flag and general officers who have subsequently become the equivalent of our service chiefs or Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. 
A primary responsibility of the foreign defense attache, as recognized by the Vienna Convention, is to collect information and learn about the services of the United States. To assist in this effort, the U.S. service chiefs sponsor an aggressive information program which includes orientation tours to commands and related industrial facilities; service chief counterpart and other delegation visits; intelligence and operations briefings; and document dissemination. In turn, the attache provides Department of Defense decisionmakers with perspectives on developments within the attache's country and armed services. 
This is the office in which Senior Colonel Quang finds himself today. Born in 1932, Colonel Quang served in the North Vietnamese and Vietnamese Armies for a total of 27 years before being assigned to the Department of Foreign Relations within the Vietnamese Ministry of Defense. While serving in that capacity, Colonel Quang was a staff member of the Vietnamese Office for Seeking Missing Personnel. His responsibility was to interface with the United States concerning our country's servicemen who were still missing in action. 
Once a sworn enemy of the United States, Colonel Quang became a man who searched for the remains of our soldiers, sailors, and airmen. Now he serves here in Washington, representing his country as Vietnam's first post-war defense attache. 
In commemorating this historic event, I pray that this new relationship with Vietnam continues to prosper.

Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I am very pleased that my distinguished friend and colleague approached me to form a partnership for the purpose of this amendment. In different ways and at different times both of us have worked closely with Pakistan. As a member of the Intelligence Committee for 8 years, and then as vice chairman, I worked very closely during the war in Afghanistan, and through the years have come to know many of the distinguished persons from that nation who have come to the United States either in an official capacity or indeed many, many who have a heritage in Pakistan who have come to reside and take up their responsibilities in America. 
And that is why I agreed to be the principal cosponsor with my distinguished colleague. 
Specifically, the amendment would allow the United States to provide OPIC financing for United States companies operating in Pakistan; would allow the resumption of the IMET program to train Pakistani military officers in the United States; and would allow assistance for activities to promote the development of democratic institutions. 
This limited economic and training assistance to Pakistan will ensure that the United States will remain constructively engaged with a nation that has a long history as a friend and ally of the United States. 
Almost from its creation as a nation in 1947, Pakistan has assisted the United States in containing Soviet expansion in this critical part of the world. In 1954, the United States and Pakistan signed a mutual defense assistance agreement which, over the following 10 years resulted in the United States providing Pakistan over $700 million in military grant aid. United States economic aid to Pakistan was even more generous--this Nation provided over $5 billion to Pakistan from 1951-82. 
This close relationship was of great benefit to the United States following the December 1979 Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. Pakistani cooperation was critical to the success of United States operations related to Afghanistan. 
The amendment before the Senate today does not call for a full resumption of United States assistance to Pakistan. Most importantly, the existing prohibitions on providing military equipment would be retained. The programs we are talking about--particularly OPIC and IMET--are of great benefit to the United States, as well as Pakistan. OPIC financing will allow United States businesses to successfully compete for business opportunities in Pakistan; and IMET will allow the next generation of Pakistani military leaders to be exposed to our values. 
During today's debate on this amendment, we will likely hear discussion about Pakistan's nuclear activities. While I share the concerns of my colleagues with the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction in South Asia, this amendment does not undermine our nonproliferation goals. To the contrary, I believe that we may be better able to influence developments in Pakistan if we remain engaged with that nation. 
I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. 
I compliment Senator Harkin for his hard work on this amendment. We have talked with a number of our colleagues. We have talked with the administration. Former Ambassador Pickering, now a senior official at the Department of State, of course had written us. Those letters are now in the Record, to my understanding. 
I rank him among the most knowledgeable of our present-day persons in the Department of State, indeed throughout the administration, and value his judgment greatly. I have worked with him for some 15 to 18 years now. And therefore, Mr. President, I strongly urge the adoption of this amendment. 
At this time I yield the floor in recognition of my colleagues.

Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today as an original cosponsor of an amendment which expresses the sense of the Senate that: `The Administration should consult closely and in a timely manner with the Congress on the NATO-led Stabilization Force's mission concerning the apprehension of indicted war criminals, including any changes in the mission which could affect American forces.' 
From the beginning of the NATO mission in Bosnia, particularly the ground element--a mission which I have consistently opposed--the administration has been clear that U.S. forces would be used primarily to implement the military aspects of the Dayton accords, and assist in limited civilian missions at the discretion of the local IFOR or SFOR commander. 
On the specific issue of apprehending war criminals, the administration has been unequivocal--NATO troops are not charged with hunting down war criminals. The specific, detailed mission statement is set forth in a classified document; therefore, I can only use as a resource statements made by administration officials on this issue. The following is a compilation of such statements: 
Secretary Cohen, before the House National Security Committee, March 20, 1997, in response to a question from Congressman Lantos: `Why aren't we apprehending war criminals? Well, that's not the mission of SFOR.' 
Ken Bacon, DOD Spokesman, July 3, 1997, in response to a question about whether or not the administration was considering expanding the authority of NATO troops to arrest war criminals: 
There's been no change in our procedures. And those procedures are, first of all the Dayton accord makes it very clear that the formerly warring factions are responsible for turning in war criminals. 
And second, our job, because the collection and detention of war criminals is an act of law enforcement for law enforcement activities, our rules have been clear from the beginning, which is that if we encounter war criminals in the course of our patrols, we would detain them and turn them over to authorized law enforcement agencies. There's been no change in that rule. 
Sandy Berger, National Security Adviser, July 10, 1997: 
Under SFOR's mission they may apprehend indicted war criminals encountered in the course of its duties and if the tactical situation permits. This was such a situation (British action on July 10) . . . SFOR concluded that they could detain these individuals. NATO political authorities agreed with that view. SFOR acted within its mission and mandate. 
Background briefing by senior administration official, July 10, 1997. 
Rules of engagement and the authority of the SFOR forces permit the commander in a particular situation when he encounters or is encountering war criminals and believes that he has a tactical capacity to apprehend in a way that is not unduly risky to exercise that authority. That continues to be the authority. 
The authority here is to apprehend war criminals who are encountered by SFOR where the commander makes the tactical decision that he can do so. 
From the above, it is clear that war criminals are to be apprehended only if IFOR or SFOR forces encountered these war criminals, and only if the local NATO commander determined that the tactical situation allowed his troops to safely apprehend the war criminals. 
Now that understanding seems to be changing. We hear press reports of the Secretary of State urging for a more proactive role for our troops in hunting down war criminals in Bosnia. We also hear that the Secretary of Defense is opposing this policy change. What is the accurate situation? 
Before it is too late, and the policy is changed, it is imperative for the Senate to express its judgment on this important issue. 
I strongly support the apprehension of the indicted war criminals so that they may be brought to justice. 
The policy of `how'--working with all of the member nations of SFOR--must be carefully coordinated. The current policy, as enunciated above by administration officials, if it is to be changed, such change should beforehand be the subject of the most careful consultation with the Congress. 
In the case of Somalia, the Congress witnessed mission creep without taking any action to try to stop it. The results in that case were disastrous--18 dead, over 70 wounded. 
We should have learned from history that the military is not an appropriate force for tracking down and arresting individuals. There is no question as to their capability--but how would that detract from their primary mission? What are the personal risks? 
What will be the consequences of an expansion of the SFOR mission to include actively seeking out and apprehending indicted war criminals? While I share the hopes of all that the war criminals in Bosnia will be brought to justice, I question the wisdom of seeing the lives of United States or allied troops jeopardized in an effort to hunt and arrest these individuals. Both IFOR and now SFOR have been able to achieve a measure of success in Bosnia because they have been perceived as even-handed. That will all change if we use our troops to aggressively pursue indicted war criminals. Rightly or wrongly, we will been seen as taking sides. Our troops will become targets, the success they have achieved thus far will be jeopardized. 
As I said earlier, I opposed the President's decision to send United States ground troops to Bosnia in December 1995. But that decision is behind us, and the American people have invested $7 billion into the operations in Bosnia. Precipitous action in this area could well put at risk that investment. As I stated last week, that investment could likewise be jeopardized by Congress forcing a specific withdrawal date. But these are separate issues. 
Our request of the administration is simple. Do not allow a significant change in the mission of our troops in Bosnia without first coming to the Congress.

Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished colleague for his remarks. 
I was simply acting on behalf of the distinguished chairman in putting this matter together and reconciling the differences. But I wish the Record to reflect that the Senator from Virginia, on the voice vote, voted in the negative. 
Mr. President, I have consistently opposed the deployment of United States ground troops to Bosnia. In December 1995, prior to the initial deployment of U.S. ground troops, I voted against the deployment on three separate occasions. I have stated repeatedly that, in my view, there is no vital United States national security interest at stake in Bosnia that justifies putting United States ground troops in harm's way. 
Having said that, I do not believe that the Bosnia amendments that we are voting on this afternoon are the right way to send the message to the administration that we do not support its Bosnia policy. 
As a general matter, I do not believe it is a good idea to set deadlines for a military operation. I have criticized the administration for setting Bosnia deadlines, and I do not believe the Congress should now validate that approach. 
I also feel very strongly that it is the President's constitutional right and duty to decide when U.S. troops should be deployed on a military operation, and when those troops should be withdrawn. 
Although I do not support the President's Bosnia policy, and I remain of the opinion that that part of the world is not in the United States vital national interest, we have made a $7 billion dollar investment in Bosnia. A precipitous withdrawal could jeopardize that investment. 
Mr. President, last evening I had the opportunity to engage in a colloquy with the Senator from Michigan on this issue. I wanted to take this opportunity this afternoon to further explain the reasons for my votes on these Bosnia amendments.  
I urge other Senators who are anxious to speak, if we could be brief. I believe I am authorized to say on behalf of the distinguished chairman of the committee and the majority leader, indeed, the ranking member, that we are very close to final passage. It is our hope and expectation with the resolution of one matter, which the leadership of the Senate is now addressing, that we might be able to proceed to final passage within maybe 30 minutes.

Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the Chief of Naval Operations has described the smart buy proposal as a proposal which has great merit. Both the Navy and the Rand Corp. have verified that the savings claimed by the contractor under this plan can indeed be achieved. 
However, these savings will not be achieved unless the funding profile outlined in the smart buy proposal is carried out, as follows: fiscal year 1998, $345 million; fiscal year 1999, $170 million; fiscal year 2000, $875 million; fiscal year 2001, $135 million; and fiscal year 192002, $3,075 million. Therefore, the Levin amendment before us is based on the strong expectation that the administration will provide funding in its annual budget submissions to fully fund CVN-77 in accordance with the smart buy proposal, and that the Congress will support those budget submissions with annual appropriations. 
Without a firm commitment to this program by the Navy--as evidenced by including funding for this program in the SCN account for each year from fiscal year 1999 to 2002--the $600 million in savings to the American taxpayer could well be lost. We expect the Navy to follow through on its commitment and to achieve the savings it has represented to be possible. 
Likewise, I know my colleague agrees with me that the savings cannot be achieved if the Congress does not authorize and appropriate the amounts set forth in the smart buy proposal. Although the amendment before us contains a mechanism to deal with the failure of the Navy to provide the appropriate funding, there is nothing to address problems caused if a future Congress fails to provide adequate funding for this program. If at some point the Congress does not provide the necessary funding, we will have to revisit the limitation contained in this amendment and adjust it accordingly. Does the Senator agree that this is the course we will follow?

First, having worked on the committee some 18 years, this is an issue that has been visited and revisited very carefully through the years. I am not here to criticize, but I assure you that the Armed Services Committee reviews this matter with great care each year. But the benefit to the American defense system is for a lot of small, independent private-sector companies to come to the marketplace and offer what is known as their best practices. I feel that this is going to be a disincentive. I am sure my distinguished colleague from Pennsylvania, the chairman of the subcommittee, is going to touch on this. I ask this question of you because I am going to ask it of him. Would this not be a disincentive and thereby deprive the Department of Defense, and the overall American defense system, of some of the best technology and best management practices being offered?

Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I will take 3 or 4 minutes to pose questions to the Senator. It seems like here in the legislative bodies, whether it is tax, capital gains, or anything else, we are out to penalize a certain class of individuals who, by and large, have worked hard all their life, beginning in the educational system, to equip themselves with the knowledge, through a series of degrees, to take on the responsibilities of leading our corporate structure. 
Whether they are scientists or financial managers, or whether they are just entrepreneurs, they make sacrifices often to start these businesses with their personal funds working long hours and giving up vacations. 
So here we go again. But I would like to just sort of sketch a profile of a company that, say, is doing $100 million worth of business, and, say, 80 percent of it is pure private sector--nothing to do with Uncle Sam. But Uncle Sam would like to have a piece of the brain trust in this company, and, therefore, it comes around and the contract is theirs. In the first place, say that CEO is making $500,000 a year; well deserved. If he gets caught up in the indirect costs he is banged into the Boxer-Grassley cap, is he not?

Mr. WARNER. Then he will sit down. And he has to decide. `Do I apply my brain power?' Suppose he somehow is able to draw a firewall in the company, and the CEO and a lot of the other top people stay out of the contract. Does that not deprive the government of the benefit of the experience and the brain trust at the top salaries?

Mr. WARNER. Therefore, the board of directors and the CEO of this company are going to say, We are doing fine with 80 percent private sector. Too bad, national security. You are on your own. Of course, I recognize in most instances for patriotic reasons they will step into it. But nevertheless I think this is the wrong approach. 
I say that with a great deal of empathy for my distinguished colleague with whom I have worked these many years. He is sort of a watchdog. I commend him for such innovation. But I suggest that our committee has done its work, and I strongly urge the Senate to back the solution to this problem as devised by our distinguished colleague from Pennsylvania for the Armed Services Committee. 
I thank the Senator.

Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I find myself in something of an awkward position. I will address it in greater detail momentarily because I have been opposed to the utilization of our ground troops in this region of the world, namely Bosnia, for many years. I have so spoken and I have voted that way. Only once was I faced with a vote that had I not supported it would have been construed as not supporting the troops, did I cast a vote which could be construed, in any way, as supporting the use of ground forces in this region. But at this time I am acting on behalf of the distinguished majority leader and the chairman of the Armed Services Committee, and in that capacity I send to the desk an amendment in the second degree in the nature of a perfecting amendment.

<DOCNO>105-warner-va-27-19970710</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
Mr. WARNER. Very well, Mr. President. We will see what we can do to untangle this situation in the morning. 
So, for the moment I will just speak to the amendment offered by the distinguished Senator from Wisconsin and the second-degree amendment of my good friend and colleague, the distinguished ranking member of the Armed Services Committee, the Senator from Michigan. 
My concern is as follows. It is twofold. 
One, there is a long history of the President exercising his role as Commander in Chief and the Congress exercising its role primarily through the power of the purse. And for the 18 years I have been privileged to serve in this body I have participated in many, many debates on this issue. Now we are confronted with the fact that the American taxpayers have invested up to $7 billion, I am told, in this conflict in this very troubled part of the world, a part of the world in which historically troubles have existed from almost the beginning of mankind. I have always been of the opinion that it can never be settled. I have made many trips to this region. As a matter of fact, I was the first Member of the U.S. Senate to go into Sarajevo--my recollection is about 3 1/2 years ago. I have been back on a number of trips with other colleagues. And the underlying problem of these people in terms of their ethnic conflicts and religious conflicts is just beyond me to comprehend. I have seen ravages of this war firsthand both on people and property. But I am going to put that to one side for the moment. 
Two things concern me: one, the President has the right as Commander in Chief to give the orders to the troops to go in, and really we authorize as the Congress to give him every right to decide when those troops are to be withdrawn. I fully recognize that in this debate. Particularly over the last 6 or 7 months there have been many signals from the administration that this general timeframe of June 1998 is when the ground elements are to be pulled out. 
Indeed, when the Secretaries of State and Defense appeared before the Senate Armed Services Committee, I think one of the first times, if not the first time in history, my recollection is that I asked the question that prompted the answer from Secretary Cohen that he stood firmly behind the policy to pull the ground elements out in June of 1998. 
It has been interesting to observe since that time the posturing, particularly by the Secretary of State, and to some degree by the President, in my judgment, trying to distance themselves from that statement by our former colleague, and, indeed, my good friend of many years, the current Secretary of Defense. 
I anticipate that the President and his Cabinet officials and others will soon come to the Congress to try and explore the common ground in which we can recognize that the President under his constitutional powers should be given the maximum latitude in deciding when to bring troops, whether it is ground, air, or 
otherwise, out of the situation into which they have been deployed. 
I footnote my remarks again by saying I voted against it. I was opposed to it. I do not think today, or yesterday, or, indeed, I don't think I will ever be convinced that this part of the world is in the vital national security interests of the United States. But nevertheless the President has the power under the Constitution as to when to deploy. I think that power also is the power to determine when to extract. And I am one that wants to give the maximum latitude to any President to exercise rightfully his constitutional powers. 
I also recognize that we have, as I said, invested upwards of $7 billion. 
I want to ask my good friend when he returns here momentarily, could not such a statement as we are debating tonight--although it is the sense of the Senate, sometimes those communications as they cross the ocean are misinterpreted or not fully understood. And how can we have asked the American taxpayers, even though I and others voted against, to have contributed this extraordinary sum of money? And, indeed, this sum of money has been taken from the procurement accounts, from the readiness account, and the R&D accounts. It has literally starved the defense budget. And those effects are being felt today. 
Nevertheless, how can we jeopardize that investment with stating that no matter what happens--this says, `United States ground forces should not participate in a follow-on force in Bosnia and Herzegovina after June 1998.' It doesn't really have any contingencies. Just today we learned that elements of the NATO forces went in to try to capture war criminals. I have great concern--perhaps next week after I receive a briefing, and hopefully so will other Senators--on exactly what was the change of policy. What was intended to be done? Here we are, Mr. President. We are looking at a rapidly changing situation. If we are going to allow the NATO forces to go out after some 50 war criminals--these were low-level in terms of the hierarchy--I think in a geographic location where certainly it is less troublesome to have a military operation get them than many of the others, the principal ones. 
But my point is this is a changing situation. And to say that June 1998 all ground forces must be withdrawn, in my judgment, is unwise from a constitutional standpoint. And I question whether or not we have acted in good faith with the American people to say now we are going to put that arbitrary limitation on our President. 
Then I ask of my colleagues--and I hope that they take the floor and perhaps ponder my questions. And I will direct them in a moment. Our allies have said, `You pull out, we are pulling out the next day. You pull out, we will pull out.' So this is going to trigger a precipitous withdrawal of those forces which have basically secured this situation. So that there has been a situation of comparative peace now for some considerable time. 
So I would like to ask first of my distinguished colleague from Michigan, what is likely to be the allied reaction to a sense-of-the-Senate resolution by the Congress of the United States that we think these troops--no matter what the situation--that maybe our ground forces should be withdrawn no later than June of 1998?

<TEXT>
Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I value the views of my good friend. We have served together side by side for the 18 years that we have been here together. We made many trips together. As a matter of fact, Mr. President, the chairman of the Armed Services Committee entrusted us with doing the official report for the committee as it related to Somalia. 
The Senator spoke of the NATO forces today who tried to apprehend--I think in one instance did apprehend one, and a second alleged criminal was killed. I am all in favor of somehow capturing these criminals. But I want to visit it another day at another time about how that is to be done. Because I, drawing on the lessons of Somalia, which the Senator and I experienced and wrote about in some detail, I am very concerned when the United States in this type of situation is involved in nation building and going into situations like this; but another day; another time. 
But I come back to the Senator's statement about the Dayton accords. That was a historic achievement. It really was. As a matter of fact, I was pleased to see the Armed Services Committee and the Senate back the rapid promotion of one of our members, General Clark, to the position of NATO Commander. He was deputy to Ambassador Holbrooke throughout that period. And true, that framework, no matter how we valued it, is not being accepted today by the parties and really enforced in the manner we had anticipated, and certainly not on the timetable. 
If we send a message that we are going home June of 1998, what does that do to induce them to finish it? I think it could be just the reverse. Those opposed to following through on the accords will dig in and will say, `Wait them out. Wait them out. Let them go, and then we can take this situation perhaps into our own hands.' Who would come into the vacuum? What nations, what troops, what forces could come into that vacuum at that time? 
It seems to me that it is not right in the first place to go in there with these ground forces. But that is history. Now the American taxpayers and our brave servicepersons have gone over there and have taken a great deal of personal risk. And they have made the Dayton accords as it relates to the security policy work. 
To jeopardize that whole thing, put it up for failure, it just to me is a very risky and unwise course of action. As I look through the amendment, which I forwarded, and now regrettably the tree is completed, I hope tomorrow morning in the dawn of a new day we can work it out so those on our side who hold views possibly which are parallel in many respects to the distinguished Senator from Michigan and the Senator from Wisconsin can sit down and work out a common position which can be reviewed by the Senate and voted on by the Senate. In all likelihood, this Senator would vote against it, but that is not a controlling fact. 
But I would be interested in the Senator's view on the Dayton accords. The Senator said that they were not being fulfilled. How does this policy, in the Senator's judgment, prompt a greater degree of compliance?

The United States may decide to appropriately provide support to a Western European Union-led or NATO-led follow-on force including command, control, intelligence, logistics, and, if necessary, a ready reserve force in a neighboring country. 
Is that ready reserve force ground troops? I think it is.

Mr. WARNER. Well, Mr. President, the Senator says they are a target, and I share that with the Senator, and I am concerned now as a consequence of this mission to capture the war criminals that there is probably going to be a heightened alert and a heightened degree of risk. 
So the Senator seems to think that if they are moved some distance across a border into another country--I do not doubt that there would be diminished personal risk to those troops. What does that say to the troops that are left back there from other European nations? The United States has withdrawn to a safe haven, yet we are left out here to take the risk. 
I somehow find this all incongruous. I really do, Mr. President. If we are a part of NATO, we are going to pull our share, and that is financially, it is in terms of risk, it is in every other way. That is the way NATO was set up. We are proud to be the leader of NATO. We have as the senior officer, an American officer as the commanding general of NATO forces, and yet you are going to say we will now have a policy when there is a risk, our people are going to a safe haven some distance away in another land and let the chaps and ladies or whatever the composition of that force may be stay in harm's way in Bosnia. I find this all very difficult.

Mr. WARNER. Well, Mr. President, if there are others who wish to speak, I will be happy to yield the floor. But I want to return--I am familiar with the European Security Defense Initiative, and I am not so sure that I am here tonight prepared to go into all the ramifications. But we are the leader of NATO, and I think if there is going to be a pattern where we do not get involved and share the risk, I question how long we can retain that leadership role. 
I seem to be in opposition to a number of things. I am not in favor of the expansion of NATO. It seems to me that the actions taken in Madrid are not in the best interests in the long term of NATO. 
I have gone back and read the debates. Remember 10, 12, 14 years ago when there were tremendous debates in the Chamber of the Senate: Bring them home--debates before we arrived led by the very able majority leader, the Democratic leader of the Senate, the distinguished Mike Mansfield of Montana--bring them home; NATO has finished its mission. 
There may be a degree to which our tinkering with NATO and changing it in concept could begin to undermine American public support, and I think that would be a terrible loss--NATO, the greatest alliance in the history of mankind, the most effective, the alliance that fulfilled its goals, exceeding every expectation of those who laid down the original charter. Indeed, NATO should be credited, rightfully, for such victories as we attained during the cold war period for the demise of the Soviet Union. NATO was instrumental. We will debate that another day. I see other Senators wishing to speak, so for the moment I will yield the floor, Mr. President.

What has your subcommittee's research shown regarding the foreign availability of computers in this range (2,000-7,000 MTOPS)?

Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, on April 17 the Committee on Rules and Administration voted, along party lines, to conduct an investigation into allegations that fraud, irregularities, and other errors affected the outcome of the 1996 election for United States Senator from Louisiana. The vote was taken after a very thorough discussion. Periodically I have reported to the Senate with floor statements; today is my third. 
On May 8, I reported that the committee was about to embark on a bipartisan investigation, as a result of efforts by both the majority and minority to agree to a `Investigative Protocol' regarding the joint conduct of the investigation. From the inception, I have believed a joint investigation could better serve the Senate. 
On May 23, I provided a second status report to the Senate on the following: on efforts to secure the detail of FBI agents to the Committee, on assurances of cooperation by Louisiana officials, and on my agreement with Senator Ford, the ranking member on the Committee, on the issuance of over 130 subpoenas. 
Last evening, Senator Ford announced that the `Rules Committee Democrats will withdraw from the investigation of illegal election activities in the contested Louisiana Senate election'. Further, he asserted that the `investigation was over budget, it's exceed the time frame agreed to, and none of Mr. Jenkin's (sic) claims have been substantiated by any credible witness.' 
Since last Friday, Senator Ford and I had been working to resolve differences and develop a written outline of the work we jointly could agree on to complete our investigation. I had good reason to believe we had made progress, but I learned at approximately 6 p.m. yesterday that the minority had decided to terminate their participation.

Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, on June 5, 1947--50 years ago today--Gen. George Catlett Marshall, delivered remarks at Harvard University's commencement exercises which would change the course of history. In that speech, General Marshall outlined the necessity for and goals of what would later be known as the Marshall plan. 
In 1947, 2 years after the end of World War II, Europe was struggling to recover from the devastation of the war. Millions were dead, 5,000 cities had been destroyed, and countless industries laid in ruin. Yet, while recognizing the very apparent physical destruction, Marshall remarked during his speech that, `this visible destruction was probably less serious then the dislocation of the entire fabric of European economy.' 
Marshall continued, `It is logical that the United States should do whatever it is able to do to assist in the return of the normal economic health in the world, without which there can be no political stability and no assured peace.' 
In the following years, over $13 billion in economic relief and technical assistance was provided to the 16 European nations which chose to participate in the program. From 1948 to 1951, the 4 years of the Marshall plan, industrial production in Europe increased 36 percent. 
With the return of economic stability, political stability throughout Western Europe soon followed. As a result, Europe--and indeed the entire Western World--has enjoyed an unprecedented period of peace and prosperity. 
For his vision and commitment, General Marshall received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1953. 
Several years after the enactment of the Marshall plan, Winston Churchill wrote, `Succeeding generations should not be allowed to forget his achievements and his example.' I am proud to say that two organizations in the Commonwealth of Virginia are dedicated to preserving and promoting in society Marshall's ideals and values of disciplined selfless service, hard work, integrity and compassion. They are the George C. Marshall Foundation and the George C. Marshall International Center. 
The George Marshall Foundation, located in Lexington, VA, overlooks the campus of Marshall's alma mater, the Virginia Military Institute. In addition to a memorial to a great American leader, the George Marshall Foundation building contains a museum, archive and library for research concerning his life and times. The foundation's programs include scholarly publications and conferences and public education on U.S. military and diplomatic history in the 20th century. 
The George C. Marshall International Center is located in Leesburg, VA, at the Dodona Manor, the home of George Marshall. The George Marshall International Center seeks to ensure that Marshall's vision and legacy are not forgotten by preserving Dodona Manor for posterity and fostering educational programs. `The Marshall Plan: Against All Odds,' a documentary film underwritten by the center will air on PBS on Saturday, June 6 at 9 pm. 
Tonight, the George Marshall International Center and George Marshall Foundation will host a gala dinner honoring the Soldier-Statesman and his influence on the 20th century. 
On April 23, 1997, I introduced Senate Joint Resolution 27 to designate the month of June 1997, the 50th anniversary of George Marshall's speech, as George C. Marshall Month. The resolution recognizes the efforts of the George Marshall Foundation in Lexington, VA, the George Marshall International Center in Leesburg, VA, and the Friends of Marshall in Uniontown, PA, to continue in American life the values for which Gen. George Catlett Marshall stood. 
Further, this resolution calls upon all Americans to rededicate themselves to the ideals of public service, hard work, integrity, and compassion which General Marshall represents to this day in American society. 
Senate Joint Resolution 27 was favorably reported out of the Judiciary Committee on June 3 and is before the full Senate today. I ask my colleagues to support this important resolution today as a fitting tribute to an extraordinary American.

Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, much has been said, and I have listened with great interest, as have others. I could summarize my brief remarks in two words: Thank you. Thank you, Senator Thurmond, for your service to this country, for your service to South Carolina, for your service to the Senate, and for the privilege, I thank you, Mr. Thurmond, of being a colleague who has served with you these 18 years. 
Senator Thurmond was the first U.S. Senator to greet me when I came to the U.S. Senate. We had known each other because I had the privilege to serve for 5 years as Under Secretary and Secretary of the Navy and testified before the great Senator on many, many occasions and received his counsel and wisdom during those really tragic and difficult times of the Vietnam war, from 1969 through 1974. He encouraged me in that period of time to someday seek elective office. I counseled with him, and, indeed, I am here today in part because of his wisdom and foresight to encourage young persons like myself, men and women, to come and serve in the Congress of the United States. 
Thank you, Senator. Thank you for the opportunities that you have given me, and I would like to say, and maybe selfishly, thank you for a great deal of personal attention. When I joined the Armed Services Committee in my first year in the Senate, there were four individuals on that committee referred to as the Four Horsemen. There was John Stennis, there was Scoop Jackson, there was John Tower, and there was Strom Thurmond. Those four individuals together, in many respects with others--I do not mean to slight anyone not mentioned--but those Four Horsemen struck the maximum possible bipartisan relationship because of their sincere belief that the interests, the security interests, of the Nation always came first and such partisanship as we indulge in from time to time has to be relegated to second. 
It was his leadership on our side--in the committee, seniority, of course, prevailed. When it came time for the opportunity for Senator Tower to take the leadership role of the Republicans, Strom Thurmond once again yielded the seniority so that Senator Tower could have that very proper recognition and give the strong leadership that he did--followed by Senator Goldwater. Likewise, Senator Thurmond yielded the seniority that was rightfully his so that Senator Goldwater, one of his closest and best friends, could have that opportunity. Then I say quite humbly, he yielded again so the Senator from Virginia, for 6 years, could be the ranking member. 
But it was always made clear to every member of that committee that, at some point in time, Strom Thurmond would cap his distinguished career by serving as chairman of the Armed Services Committee of the Senate of the United States. 
That he has done for these many years and given that committee the forceful leadership that it deserves. 
Indeed, the last bill last year, he set a record in terms of the time to complete the committee work and to bring the bill to the floor. How well I know because it was late into the night we had the markup sessions. But he was always there, always present, and giving us his leadership. 
If I may say, with the deepest of respect, I look upon him as a brother, the big brother that I never had, but he fulfilled that role in my life, not only here in the Senate, but in many ways outside of the Senate. 
Today, Senators have shared personal recollections of times spent with Strom Thurmond that they remember with great fondness and respect. Mine was the 40th anniversary of the landing of our forces on Normandy Beach. Senator Thurmond was asked by President Ronald Reagan to lead a delegation from the Senate. I was privileged to be with that delegation. 
I remember as if it were yesterday when we arrived in Normandy, President Reagan had helo No. 1, Senator Thurmond had helo No. 2. He sat right up there with the pilots. For 3 days we toured the entire area. I remember one afternoon the helos landed in the vicinity of Sant Mera'anglis where they reenacted that famous drop by our courageous parachutists in the history of recounting the tragedy that befell those airmen that parachuted. 
But we sat there with three of the senior officers that participated in that battle. I remember one very vividly. His name was `Lightning' Joe Collins. We sat on old ammo boxes propped up and watched the drop. Senator Thurmond recalled his own recollections throughout our trip of that historic chapter in the march for freedom of the allied forces to fend off Adolph Hitler. 
Senator Thurmond's helicopter, when we went back, malfunctioned and we could not take off to go to the next spot. So the President went on, and they sent in another helo. Senator Weicker, who was with us, knew a great deal about that part of the country of France because his father had been chief of the Army Air Corps intelligence. Senator Weicker said to me, `Let's not stand here and wait for this other helicopter to come in. Let's walk off into the countryside, and perhaps we can knock on the door of a French farmer and get a little cheese and a little wine.' We did just that. We found in abundance the provisions among the Frenchmen. All of a sudden the Senator's helicopter arrived, and two of his party were missing. He sent out the gendarmerie to find us, and indeed they did, and they hauled us back. What a scolding he gave us for delaying his departure by some 20 minutes. But, boy, we emboldened ourselves with the finest from a French cellar of their wine and their cheese. 
Those are just moments that we have shared together. And now I look forward to serving with him throughout his career here in the U.S. Senate and particularly sharing with him, as do all members of our committee, the responsibilities to keep America strong. 
I close with one other recollection. That is his great fondness for children, not only his own, but he never fails to ask me about mine. As I watch him go through the Halls of Congress, there is one Senator who will stop and take whatever time is required to greet every child. His parting words are, `Someday you can be a U.S. Senator.' 
I yield the floor.  
Mr. MURKOWSKI addressed the Chair.

<TEXT>
 Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I am introducing a bill today to designate the U.S. Bankruptcy Courthouse, at 200 S. Washington Street in Alexandria, VA the `Martin V.B. Bostetter, Jr. United States Courthouse.' 
I authored previous legislation which is now law, authorizing the transfer of the Albert V. Bryan U.S. Courthouse building name from 200 S. Washington Street to the new Alexandria U.S. Courthouse. Since that time the old Albert V. Bryan Courthouse has remained nameless, while still serving the U.S. Bankruptcy Court. I can think of no better person to name the bankruptcy court after than Chief Judge Bostetter given his long service to the bankruptcy court in Alexandria. 
Chief Judge Bostetter is currently the Chief Judge for the Eastern District of Virginia. He was appointed to the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in 1959, and appointed Chief Judge on February 1, 1985. He has the longest tenure on the bench of any bankruptcy judge in the country, a record he will probably hold for sometime. 
Born in Baltimore, MD, on March 11, 1926, Judge Bostetter, has spent most of his life in Virginia. He attended Mount Vernon High School in Fairfax County, VA, and, after serving in the U.S. Navy during World War II, attended the University of Virginia where he obtained his B.A. Degree in 1950 and his law degree LL.B. Degree in 1952. 
I might add that I attended the University of Virginia Law School entering in 1949, then serving in the Korean war and returning for completion of my degree in 1953, 1 year after Judge Bostetter. 
Since 1952, Chief Judge Bostetter's entire legal career has occurred within an 8 block radius of Old Town Alexandria. He began his practice of law in the city of Alexandria, and, in 1953 he was appointed special assistant to the city attorney, serving in the capacity of city prosecutor. Judge Bostetter resigned that position in 1957 to become associate judge of the municipal court of the city of Alexandria, where he served for a period of 2 years, resigning in 1959. 
In 1959, Chief Judge Bostetter set up the first Bankruptcy Court in Alexandria at 200 S. Washington St: the very building which he now occupies as Chief Judge of the Bankruptcy Court for the Eastern District of Virginia 38 years later. 
Over the last 38 years Judge Bostetter has seen the work of the Bankruptcy Court for the Eastern District of Virginia grow from 9 filings per month to more than 2,600 filings per month and its personnel requirements increase from 1 clerk to three divisions with 5 full time judges and an administrative staff of 90 employees. The Alexandria Division where Judge Bostetter serves now has 2 full time judges, 22 employees and averages 790 filings per month. During much of his career, Judge Bostetter has, by necessity, handled this increasingly heavy case load of approximately 2 1/2 judges. 
During his tenure as a bankruptcy judge, Chief Judge Bostetter has been a dedicated and loyal public servant serving the people of Virginia faithfully with honor, integrity and distinction. Chief Judge Bostetter has fulfilled his duties as a bankruptcy judge with a strong sense of fairness and pragmatism while at the same time adhering to the constraints imposed by the Bankruptcy Code and related caselaw. In addition, Chief Judge Bostetter has set very high standards for the lawyers who practice before him making those lawyers better prepared and more effective advocates for their respective clients' interests. 
Mr. President, in addition to being an accomplished jurist, Judge Bostetter has also held several other distinguished positions. In 1957, he was appointed by the city of Alexandria as one of the original commissioners to serve on the Juvenile Detention Commission for Northern Virginia and served as its chairman from the inception of the commission until 1974. In 1959, the Alexandria Junior Chamber of Commerce awarded him the Distinguished Service Award as the `Outstanding Young Man of the Year 1959,' and the Kiwanis Club of Alexandria designated him as an honorary member for his civic contributions to the city. In 1960, he was nominated by the Alexandria Junior Chamber of Commerce as 1 of the 10 outstanding men of the United States for his work on the Juvenile Detention Commission. 
Along with his responsibilities as a bankruptcy judge, Chief Judge Bostetter served as a member of the Committee on Court Administration of the Judicial Conference of the United States from July 1, 1982, until it was dissolved by reorganization of the Judicial Conference in 1987. On October 16, 1984, he was elected by the Judicial Conference of the United States to the Board of Directors of the Federal Judicial Center, serving in that position until September 1987. He is a former member of the Transition Advisory Committee on Bankruptcy to the Director of the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts. In 1986, he was appointed by Chief Justice Warren Burger as chairman of a committee to expand and improve the educational programs for all bankruptcy judges. Justice Rehnquist, upon assuming the position of Chief Justice of the United States, reappointed Chief Judge Bostetter to continue as chairman of that committee until his term expired in 1989. In addition, Chief Judge Bostetter was appointed to the State-Federal Judicial Relations Committee of the Commonwealth of Virginia in 1991. 
In addition to his significant public service as a judge, Chief Judge Bostetter has a strong record of civic contributions as well. He has served as president of the Alexandria Bar Association, president of the Alexandria Junior Chamber of Commerce, president and chairman of the Board of the Alexandria Sertoma Club, president of Alexandria Mental Health Association, and has also served on the boards of the Alexandria Hospital Corporation, the Alexandria Mental Health Clinic, the Alexandria Community Chest, and the Alexandria Boys' Club. 
Mr. President, I can think of no better tribute to Judge Bostetter than to name the U.S. Bankruptcy Court, at 200 South Washington Street, Alexandria, VA the Martin V.B. Bostetter, Jr. U.S. Bankruptcy Courthouse.

On May 8, I advised the Senate that the Committee on Rules and Administration was working on a bipartisan investigation into allegations that fraud, irregularities, and other errors affected the outcome of the 1996 election for U.S. Senator from Louisiana--the first such Senate investigation into alleged vote fraud since the early 1950's, almost 45 years ago. 
Since that time, the committee has secured appropriate office space in New Orleans to meet the needs of the investigation. Our committee counsel, majority and minority together, have also been to Baton Rouge, where they were joined by our investigative teams, headed by Richard Cullen and George Terwilliger from the law firm of McGuire, Woods, Battle & Boothe, and Robert Bauer and John Hume of the law firm of Perkins Coie. 
While in Baton Rouge our teams met with Gov. Mike Foster--a Republican, the President of the Senate Randy Ewing, and the Speaker of the House `H.B.' Hunt Downer, Jr: both Democrats, each of whom expressed their full cooperation in the conduct of the Senate's investigation. 
Meetings were also held with the Secretary of State Fox McKeithan, the Commissioner of Elections Jerry Fowler, and others, and again full cooperation and assistance as needed were offered.

Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, this past Wednesday, May 21, I met with the Deputy Attorney General, Seth Waxman, and the Deputy Director of the FBI, William Esposito, and later spoke by telephone with the Director, Louis Freeh. The Deputy Attorney General has advised me this morning that our request for FBI investigators has been approved. 
The arrangements between the Rules Committee and the Department of Justice parallel those between the Justice Department and the Governmental Affairs Committee. As detailees, the FBI investigators will report jointly, through Committee staff, to myself and the ranking member. 
In addition, two accounting specialists, including a Certified Public Accountant, will be detailed to the Committee from the General Accounting Office to assist in the review and assessment of a considerable volume of election documents. This important phase of the investigation will begin next week. 
Finally, Senator Ford and I have agreed on the issuance of the first round of subpoenas to State officials for numerous election documents. 
I close this sequential report to the Senate with the same two statements I have made in the past. First, there has been no allegation, thus far, in this case of any illegal actions on the part of Senator Landrieu. 
Second, the goal of this investigation is to fulfill the Senate's duty under the U.S. Constitution, article I, section 5. Pursuant to this duty the Senate Committee on Rules and Administration authorized this investigation to: determine the existence or absence of a body of fact that would justify the Senate in making the determination that fraud, irregularities, or other errors, in the aggregate, affected the outcome of the election for U.S. Senator in the State of Louisiana in 1996. 
As developments occur, of such significance as to inform Senators, I will promptly speak on the floor.

Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I am pleased to announce today that the Committee on Rules and Administration will be holding two additional hearings on the issue of campaign finance reform after the short recess. 
On June 18, we will be honored to have as witnesses two of our former colleagues, Vice-President Walter Mondale and Senator Nancy Kassebaum-Baker. They will be speaking on their work as cochairs of a committee formed by President Clinton to generate public support for campaign finance reform. We anticipate that the other witnesses will concentrate on the difficult legal and policy issues involved with regulation of issue advocacy and independent expenditures. These two phenomena grew sharply in importance in 1996 and deserve a thorough review by the Committee. 
The other hearing, scheduled for June 25, will address the issue of whether certain campaign contributions are indeed voluntary. I plan to focus on union dues and Senator Nickles' Paycheck Protection Act, which would require a union member to affirmatively give the union permission to use his or her dues' money for partisan political activity and would make sure that no person is compelled to contribute to a campaign without their consent. 
It is my understanding that Senator Ford, the ranking minority member, will invite witnesses to discuss political activity by corporations and tax-exempt organizations, and the effect of such activity on the shareholders and donors to these organizations.

Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the Congress, being an integral part of the greater metropolitan Washington area, will soon enact legislation impacting this area, from law enforcement to economic growth. Through my years in the Senate I have worked with community leaders from Virginia as well as Maryland and the District of Columbia. 
John `Till' Hazel, Jr., is one with whom I have had a long personal friendship--as did our fathers, both medical doctors. 
But transcending friendship, we have had our full measure of agreements, and disagreements, on issues affecting this area. 
This month the State of Virginia Chamber of Commerce honored `Till' Hazel by inviting him to give his report on the State of the Union of this greater metropolitan area. 
I was present as the audience received with great respect his strong, outspoken, message. 
Since it bears on our present and future responsibility as an integral part, and voice, of this area, I ask unanimous consent that his statement be printed in the Congressional Record.

Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to The American Medical Association [AMA] and to submit a resolution to commemorate its 150th Anniversary. 
The American Medical Association was founded by Nathan Smith Davis, M.D., in 1847 when he was 30-years-old. At that time, the field of medicine was still based on apprenticeship programs and very little education was required to become a physician. Nathan Davis recognized the need to establish a code of educational principles to elevate the standard of medicine by eliminating quackery and other nonscientific forms of medicine. Through standardized medical education, students trained in the field of medicine now have unified course work and training. The accreditation process also guides curriculum development in order to ensure that core ethical values and beliefs are instilled in the physicians of the future. 
Today, the American Medical Association continues to hold high its standards and remains dedicated to maintaining the sanctity of the patient-physician relationship, upholding the ethical standards within the medical profession that lead to a better, stronger, house of medicine. 
Mr. President, the American Medical Association's contribution to the health of our country has been a fixture of American culture. Indeed, even their symbol has long served as a sign of high quality health care materials. We have come to expect quality in every endeavor from the American Medical Association as they have built a 150-year reputation of caring for our country. 
For example, the American Medical Association's Journal of the American Medical Association [JAMA] has long contributed to the positive reputation of the association through the distribution of peer reviewed health information. Another example of caring for our country, JAMA, founded in 1880, expanded the dissemination of scientific data and health policy information among physicians and other health professionals. JAMA 
serves as a respected voice in the areas of clinical science and disease prevention. In addition, JAMA has contributed a great deal to the area of public health, an area in which the AMA continues to be vitally involved, as it strives to prepare patients and physicians for the 21st century by promoting the science and art of medicine. 
Mr. President, I would like to congratulate the American Medical Association on its 150th anniversary and all its accomplishments and I encourage the AMA to continue caring for our country into the next millennium. 
On a personal note, I wish to acknowledge the lifelong contribution of my late father, Dr. John W. Warner 1883-1946, to this organization. Starting his career as a frontline, decorated combat surgeon in the U.S. Army during World War I, he served the needs of the greater Washington metropolitan area as an attending physician until his death in 1946.

Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the shortage of skilled workers is one of the most critical issues facing the U.S. information technology [IT] industry today. Our position as world leader in this industry is threatened--not by technology--but by a shortage of necessary labor. 
This issue is underscored by what we see in the want-ads every week: thousands of high-paying jobs unfilled, because there are not enough skilled applicants. 
There is a shortage of nearly 200,000 workers nationwide. The economic impact of this shortfall is being felt in every State and congressional district across America. 
Virginia, with its growing high-tech industry, is particularly hard hit--it is currently estimated that 18,000 jobs are currently unfilled. Technology-based businesses in Virginia number over 2,450, employ more than 290,000 workers, and contribute more than $13.8 billion in wages to the State's economy. At current rates of growth, by 2002 these numbers are expected to jump to over 4,000 companies, employing about 330,000, with $22 billion in wages. The average technology sector worker in Virginia earned $45,288 in 1996, compared to an average wage of $26,608 in the Virginia economy as a whole. By 2002, the average technology sector wage could grow to over $63,000. 
By any measure, these are the jobs of the future. But unless our workforce is educated and trained properly, these jobs will remain unfilled or, worse yet, move to countries with the necessary qualified people. This 2-5-million-person industry is projected to nearly double in size by the year 2000. But its growth is being stunted by the inability of firms to hire the talent that they need to expand. 
Let me be clear: this problem is not confined to just high technology companies and it is not limited to one region of the country. It extends to any firm that depends on information technology employees to expand its markets, reach its customers, or improve its products. 
Education is a key component of the solution to this problem. However, schools are not graduating enough qualified individuals to meet the need. From 1986 to 1994, the number of bachelor degrees in computer science, for example, fell 43 percent from 42,195 to 24,200. As the Senate begins the reauthorization process for the Higher Education Act of 1965 and the 
formulation of job training legislation, I hope we will give particular emphasis to the impact that the shortage of skilled technology workers is having on the economy, and recognize the need to ensure that our work force is prepared for the next century. 
As cochair of the Senate Information Technology Caucus and a new member of the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee, I want to bring this matter to the attention of the Congress and the public, to demonstrate the far-reaching implications this crisis will have on the IT industry and the American economy as a whole. 
We need to look at all options for addressing this problem. That is why I am introducing legislation establishing a National Commission on the Information Technology Worker Shortage. The Commission will be comprised of industry leaders, educators, and government officials who will study this issue and provide Congress with potential solutions. The Commission will draw on the brightest minds and the best ideas to craft the solutions necessary to encourage more students to enter technical fields, to ensure that teachers and schools are equipped to train them, and to incorporate the best private sector initiatives. The Commission will report concrete legislative and administrative recommendations to the President and to Congress within the year. 
Mr. President, the Commission will provide the national focus and attention that this problem demands. I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting this initiative.

Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the Senator from Virginia, throughout my career in the U.S. Senate, has fought for the balanced budget as hard as anyone. I say that with humility. I am sure the distinguished Senator from Montana has a like record and a like commitment. 
We are also entrusted with the responsibility, in my case as chairman and the Senator from Montana as the ranking member of the Subcommittee on Public Works and Environment, to see that our Nation's infrastructure of highways, and to a certain extent mass transit--although that is primarily in another committee--constantly is administered in such a way as to promote growth in this country. 
Talk about a balanced budget. That balanced budget is dependent on the ability of Americans to get to their place of work, to return safely, to provide for their families, and every Member of this body knows that we are falling behind every minute in our ability to keep in place the infrastructure of roads and bridges, much less modernize it to make it safer and more efficient. We are steadily falling behind. But as we fall behind in providing the necessary dollars, the dollars that they are paying in the tank are accumulating in the Treasury in an account called the highway trust fund. 
Now, Mr. President, I like to do homework. I learned it as a child under the supervision of two good, strong parents. So I went back to 1955 when in this very Chamber resonated the voices of the chairman of the Environment Committee, Mr. Chavez, and incidentally, the chairman of the subcommittee, Albert Gore, Sr., the father of our distinguished Vice President. When they came forth with the legislation to establish the highway trust fund, they picked the name `trust.' They could have called it the highway fund. They could have said there is a line in the Treasury for just where to put the tax dollars, but they called it a trust fund. 
Today the Congress, together with the executive branch, are using it as an escrow account--not a trust fund, but an escrow account--to hold these dollars almost as if they were poker chips to play with them as we see fit, not in keeping with the intention of the founders of this piece of legislation. 
I read from the 1955 Congressional Record, page 6716, of May 20--is that not interesting, May 20, coincidental in time, Mr. President, 42 years ago--in which Senator Gore concluded by saying, `Had the committee thought it advisable to recommend a more vigorous program than that which is contained in S. 1048, I am sure it would have done so. The sentiment in the committee, if I interpret it correctly, was to act as fast and as energetically as we could while still ensuring that the taxpayer received a dollar's worth of road for his [and I insert her] tax dollars.' There it is, a commitment by the U.S. Senate, right in this Chamber, the origin of that legislation, and we are breaking that trust, that fiduciary relationship today. 
Mr. President, 18.3 cents is paid by every American and all those using petroleum at the local gas station; 4.3 is taken out for the deficit. That is another argument. We are not dealing with that today. Fourteen cents remains, of which 12 cents is for the highway and 2 cents for mass transit. 
We have another piece of legislation under the auspices of Senator Bond and Senator Chafee, which I support, saying a dollar in, a dollar out. That is what this does. This amendment is designed to put every Member of this body on record when he or she goes back home that, `I fought to see that your tax dollars that you pay are returned to you and you can apply them to improve that infrastructure to strengthen America's economy.' 
Critics say, well, Senator Warner and Senator Baucus, you did not provide offsets. Well, we did not have to provide offsets, I 
say to my colleagues, because the offset is there in the word `trust.' That is what it means--trust means exactly that. The people of this country trust the Congress of the United States, and in this instance, more specifically, the Senate, trust them to find the necessary means to balance the budget without a breach of trust to those who contribute at the gas tank, consistent for 42 years, given by the U.S. Senate. 
I say to my colleagues, weigh heavily when you cast this vote. Put this amendment on. Let it go to conference. Let the distinguished chairman and the distinguished ranking member in the context of a conference decide how to continue the preservation of the balanced budget but at the same time keeping trust with the American people to return their dollars, their hard-earned dollars, submitted at the gas tank. 
I yield such time as my distinguished colleague desires with the caveat that I would like to reserve for the Senator from Virginia 2 minutes at the end and 2 minutes for the distinguished Senator from Montana.

Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, first, I commend my distinguished colleague. We worked together as a team on this. He has spent a good deal of his career in the U.S. Senate fighting to improve America's infrastructure and transportation. 
I am going to place at the desk at the time of the vote a letter signed by 66 Members of this body supporting precisely what it is we have before them today in this amendment, together with letters from each of the Governors. All 50 Governors support a higher level of funding for our highways. 
Senator Baucus and I, as we worked on this amendment, decided not to take the top dollar. As Senator Baucus clearly said, $17 billion remains in the trust fund. We tried to take a reasonable amount of increase. 
This chart shows the green line of what this budget resolution does in terms of highways--flat. Our amendment takes this up at a gradual increase to where we reach the $26 billion, that figure subscribed to by 66 Senators, that figure subscribed to by all 50 Governors. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. WARNER. I thank him for the courtesy. Let's clarify a little bit just how the Senator as chairman of the Budget Committee--and certainly we commend him for the hard work he has done. What is the meaning of a trust fund? 
Let's be honest. You are keeping $26 billion, according to my calculation, holding it back, of the revenues paid at the gas tank, as if it were poker chips to play where you so desire elsewhere in the budget. We specifically did not put in offsets because the offset is there in a trust fund established 42 years ago with a legislative history which clearly said that it belongs to the people and should be returned to the people. 
That is why we did not have an offset. The offset is there in the form of the money in the highway trust fund. Shall we rename that budget deficit fund?

In other words, you are saying to the Senate, in a cosponsored piece of legislation together with the distinguished chairman of the committee, you want $26 billion. Now you stand on this floor and talk in direct opposite. That is what leaves me at a loss. So the question is, you are a cosponsor and----

There are three bills pending before the Senate relating to the reauthorization of ISTEA. I mentioned that. Seventy-four colleagues have signed one of those three bills. Each one of those bills has the higher level of $26 billion. I say to my colleague, he also is a cosponsor of the Bond-Chafee/Chafee-Bond legislation.

What we have left out, my distinguished colleague and myself, are pages and pages of added requests by our colleagues. I totaled over $7 billion in addition to what is to be allocated under the formulation for superb programs that are badly needed by the country: Appalachian highway system; for the Indian reservation roads; for expansion of the intelligent transportation system; for innovative financing initiatives; for new funding to meet infrastructure--on and on it goes. 
We want to, Senator Baucus and I together with other members of our subcommittee and full committee, try and do this, but those we haven't even discussed today. We will never get to one nickel of this unless we are given some additional flexibility. 
So we say, with all due respect, we are simply asking a voice mandate in support of our constituents to the Budget Committee, `Go back and reexamine the desperate need of America for these dollars.' 
I thank the Chair. I yield back all time.

 Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to George J. Collins, a resident of Springfield, VA, who died March 23, 1997. Mr. Collins had a distinguished career of public service at the Government Printing Office [GPO]. At the time of his death, Mr. Collins was manager of the GPO's Quality Control and Technical Department, with responsibility for the development of product standards and quality attributes, testing, and inspection, as well as the supply of inks, adhesives, and other materials used in Government printing. 
A native of Springfield, OH, Mr. Collins served in the U.S. Marine Corps. He received his bachelor of arts degree from Wittenberg College and pursued additional studies at the University of Cincinnati, Pennsylvania State University, North Dakota State College, the National Cash Register [NCR] Co., and with international correspondence schools. He earned certification in a variety of technical specialties, including high polymers, paint technology, water and waste treatment, industrial chemistry, and statistical methods. 
Before entering Government service, Mr. Collins worked at NCR as senior research chemist in charge of their polymer group. Earlier experiences included service as a research chemist with the Commonwealth Engineering Co. of Ohio, the Chadaloid Corp., and New Wrinkle, Inc. He also worked for the city of Springfield, OH, and the Oliver Corp. as a laboratory technician. 
Mr. Collins began his career at the GPO in 1963 as supervisory chemist in the ink and reprography division of the Quality Control and Technical Department. He was promoted to deputy manager of the department in December 1974 and to manager in 1982. During his service with the GPO, Mr. Collins contributed to the development of plastic printing rollers, automated bank checks, and U.S. mail processing based on tagged inks. He chaired the interagency task group that developed the Federal Information Processing [FIPS] Standard for optical character recognition [OCR] form design, which proved to be the most popular FIPS standard ever published. 
Mr. Collins initiated the GPO's environmental testing and control program. He established the organization that promulgated the GPO's Quality Assurance Through Attributes [QATAP] Program. The QATAP Program was a singular achievement that resulted in the use of quantifiable attributes for measuring quality in Government printing, and it is central to the GPO's program of procuring more than 75 percent of all printing annually from the private sector. 
Mr. Collins served on the Joint Committee on Printing's Advisory Council on Paper Specifications, which establishes standards for the acquisition of printing and writing papers for Government use, including recycled paper. In 1994 he assisted the enactment of legislation requiring that all Federal lithographic printing be performed utilizing vegetable oil-based inks.

Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank my friend and colleague, the senior Senator from North Carolina. May I join others in urging that the Senate give its advice and consent to this very important treaty, a treaty brought forward by the leadership of the chairman and the distinguished ranking member at a critical time in the ever-increasing debates regarding Europe, whether it be NATO expansion or other issues. 
I was prepared today to go toe to toe with my good friend, the ranking member of this committee, the Senator from Delaware, on the question of condition 9. I have spent a good portion of my career in the Senate on the question of the ABM Treaty. I think it was a very wise addition to this particular resolution of ratification, a provision, condition 9, that addresses the issue of the multilateralization of the ABM Treaty. 
I go back to the Fiscal Year 1995 Defense Authorization Act, section 232. It was my privilege to introduce that provision as an amendment to that bill. That provision provided: 
The United States shall not be bound by any international agreement entered into by the President that would `substantively' modify the ABM Treaty unless this agreement is entered [into] pursuant to the treaty making power of the President under the Constitution. 
That is section 232 of the Fiscal Year 1995 Defense Authorization Act. That is precisely, really a recitation, of what 
condition 9 requires--follow the law of the land. President Clinton signed section 232 into law, and yet, time and again, this President claims exemptions from the requirement to submit to the Senate agreements which clearly change the rights and obligations of the United States under the ABM Treaty. 
For years, I have joined a number in this Chamber, primarily the Republicans, in insisting that the `demarcation' agreement, which the administration is currently completing in negotiations with the Russians, represents again another `substantive' change to the ABM Treaty that must be submitted to the Senate. I am pleased that the administration has at long last acknowledged that very fact and has agreed to bring that demarcation agreement before this body for the advice-and-consent responsibility entrusted to the Senate by the Constitution. 
I, like the Senator from Delaware, was concerned about the use of the word `prerogative' in condition 9. I view the advice and consent role as an obligation of the U.S. Senate under the Constitution of the United States. It is an obligation that we must exercise in cases such as the demarcation and the multilateralization of the ABM Treaty. 
I ask my colleagues to indulge me just for a minute. I go back to May 1972, a quarter of a century ago. As a much younger man, I was privileged to be a part of the delegation, headed by the President of the United States, that went to Moscow for the summit which culminated in the signing of SALT I, the ABM Treaty and other agreements. The particular matter for which I had primary responsibility was the Incidents at Sea Executive Agreement, which was also signed at that time. 
I had been in the Pentagon as Secretary of the Navy during the course of the negotiation of the ABM Treaty. As such, I have spent a good deal of my career, beginning with the inception of that treaty to date, in trying to analyze it and defend it. I think it is a valuable part of our overall arms control relationship with the then-Soviet Union and today Russia. But there is a limit to which that treaty should be applied to other activities that this Nation must now undertake--activities that were not contemplated at the time the treaty was negotiated. 
One of those activities--and I do not know of a more important one--is to protect the men and women of the Armed Forces when they are deployed abroad, and any number of civilians in their positions abroad, from the ever-growing threat of short-range ballistic missiles. 
Hopefully, this year we will forge ahead and finally clarify--clarify--the misunderstandings about what the ABM Treaty was intended to do and what it was not intended to do on this issue. I have talked to so many of my colleagues who were in that delegation a quarter of a century ago who had a primary responsibility for the ABM Treaty. One after one they will tell you that they never envisioned at that time, from a technological standpoint, this new class of weapons, namely, the short-range ballistic missiles, and that that treaty was never intended to apply to those missiles. 
As the Senator from Delaware said, there will be another day on which we can have that debate on the issue of that treaty's application to the current research and development now underway to develop and deploy those systems desperately needed in the Armed Forces of the United States to protect us from the short-range threat, an ever-growing threat, which is proliferating across the world. 
The Foreign Relations Committee did precisely what it should have done: included in as condition 9 the protection of future debate on the ABM Treaty such that the U.S. Senate can make the decisions as to whether or not there are successions to the ABM Treaty by other nations. 
The ABM Treaty was contemplated, negotiated, and signed as a bilateral treaty. It was approved by the Senate as a bilateral treaty. It strains credibility for the administration to now argue that the conversion of that treaty from a bilateral to a multilateral treaty is not a `significant' change to warrant Senate advice and consent. 
At the time this treaty was negotiated, no one involved in the negotiations could ever have envisioned the dissolution of the Soviet Union in their lifetimes--much less within 20 years. Likewise, technical advances in the areas of both strategic offensive and defensive systems could not be adequately anticipated. That is why the treaty has provisions for amendment to adapt it to changing times circumstances, and technologies. I am personally of the view that this treaty should have been--and still needs to be--amended to allow the United States to protect its citizens, stationed abroad from short-range ballistic missile attacks which were not contemplated 25 years ago. But I also strongly believe that any amendment which alters U.S. rights and obligations--any substantive changes--must be submitted to the Senate for advice and consent. 
We could argue for days about the international legal principles and requirements in this area. But one thing is clear--domestic law on this issue is unambiguous. Section 232 of the fiscal year 1995 Defense authorization bill, which I referred to earlier, clearly requires the President to submit for Senate advice and consent any international agreement which substantively modifies the ABM Treaty. 
It is clear that multilateralization would constitute a substantive change to the ABM Treaty. For 25 years, this has been a bilateral treaty. If new parties are added, the geographic boundaries, which govern many aspects of the treaty, would be changed. Existing U.S. rights under the treaty to amend it by bilateral agreement would be lost. The draft memorandum of understanding on succession, the three new states parties will be given full voting rights in the Standing Consultative Commission [SCC], the body which supervises treaty implementation and negotiates amendments to the treaty. According to the guidelines of the SCC, changes to the ABM Treaty can only be made through a consensus of the parties. That means that any one of these three new states parties could block United States efforts to amend this treaty to allow for effective missile defenses to deal with current threats--even if the Russians agree to the changes. 
The succession issue with the states of the former Soviet Union has been handled on a case-by-case basis. In the case of the CFE Treaty and the START I Treaty, the Senate specifically addressed the succession issue during consideration of the resolutions of ratification for those treaties. INF succession was handled without Senate involvement. It is clear that the matter of succession--far from being a legal absolute--is, at best, a murky legal issue. 
The unique status of the ABM Treaty was highlighted in the 1994 legislation requiring Senate advice and consent of any international agreement that `substantively' modifies the ABM Treaty. This is not the case for the hundreds of other treaties we had in effect with the former Soviet Union. 
Since the ABM Treaty reinterpretation debate of the late 1980's, the Democrats have insisted that any change to a treaty that differs from what was presented to the Senate at the time of ratification must be resubmitted to the Senate or the Congress for approval. Multilateralization of the ABM Treaty is not simply a reinterpretation of the treaty, it is a substantive change to the treaty text. By the Democrats own standards, such a change should clearly require Senate advice and consent.  
Mr. HELMS addressed the Chair.

<TEXT>
Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask the indulgence of the Senate. I have a little hoarseness this morning, but I will do my very best. 
Mr. President, this is an amendment offered by the Senator from Virginia, together with the Senator from Florida [Mr. Graham]. And we entitle it simply a `fairness amendment.' 
I hesitate to take on the wisdom of the distinguished chairman and the distinguished ranking member of the Appropriations Committee, but I do so out of a sense of fairness toward all 50 States. 
Mr. President, the amendment relates to the bill's provision affecting the distribution of $933 million in additional--I point out, additional--obligation authority in the Federal Highway Program to the 50 States. A small part of this funding is fully justified. It provides to correct the mistake made by the Department of Treasury in 1994 in underestimating gas tax receipts into the highway trust fund. 
As a result of this mistake, 10 States did not receive their correct apportionment of Federal highway dollars in 1996. And I fully agree and commend the Appropriations Committee in its efforts to make whole these few States, 10 in number, who received less than they should have in 1996 dollars. 
The amendment offered by Senator Graham and I, however, ensures that these 10 States are compensated as was intended by the Appropriations Committee and as they are legally entitled to be compensated, and in the amount of funds that they should have received in that fiscal year. 
The Appropriations Committee, however, then provides an additional $793 million for this fiscal year and directs how these funds should be distributed among the several States. The distribution of these additional funds--$793 million--is in direct conflict, Mr. President, direct conflict, with the distribution formulas contained in the current law that is ISTEA passed in 1991, the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991, and amounts to nothing more than changing the rules right in the middle of a very--and I emphasize, a very--conscientious, bipartisan effort by the U.S. Senate to rework a future piece of legislation to succeed the 1991 ISTEA Act. 
The amendment Senator Graham and I offer is very simple, Mr. President. Our amendment states that the $793 million in obligational authority provided by the Appropriations Committee will be distributed according to current law, ISTEA 1991. I just wish to repeat that. We have a law carefully crafted in 1991. And all that we ask in this amendment is that this $793 million be allocated to the States in accordance with existing law. 
Mr. President, as the chairman of the Transportation Subcommittee of the Environment and Public Works Committee, I am leading a bipartisan effort--Senator Max Baucus is the distinguished ranking member of that committee--working together with all of the members on the committee to achieve a successor piece of legislation to ISTEA 1991. 
We have held 10 hearings this year on various issues relating to ISTEA. Four major bills--I repeat, four major bills--have been introduced regarding the successor piece of legislation to ISTEA 1991, including one that Senator Graham and I are cosponsoring. Certainly establishing fair distribution formulas that recognize the differing regional goals of the country will be a matter of extensive discussion. It will not be an easy task to provide adequate funding to address the many legitimate transportation needs that exist today. 
I stipulate, Mr. President, there are many, an overwhelming number of needs in transportation today. And it is very difficult for Senators to reach their determination as to how to vote on this knowing that in every Senator's State there are crying needs for money today. But what Senator Graham and I are doing is asking that the Senate stick with its process, respect the authority given to the authorizing committees to work through legislative matters in a conscientious, bipartisan way, which we are doing, to try and reach and craft a bill to succeed ISTEA 1991. 
A part of that consideration will be whether or not we do change the very formula that I am recommending to the Senate in this amendment, the very formula in ISTEA 1991. I happen to be on the side that thinks changes should be made. But there is honest difference of opinion among the 50 States. But let us leave it to the process that is underway--with 10 hearings--in an effort to resolve those disputes. 
Mr. President, I have been one who has been critical of ISTEA 1991's formula. I believe they fail to reflect the current use or demands of our current transportation system. There are many archaic base points on which that formula rests. And we hope to change that. It is my hope that during the reauthorization of ISTEA, the subcommittee will devise a more fair distribution of Federal highway dollars based on needs and use of our transportation system. 
At this time however, when our States are in the last year of the 1991 ISTEA, it is not in the best interests of the U.S. Senate to set a new distribution formula. And that is precisely what the inclusion in the bill does by the Appropriations Committee. 
I know that my colleagues on the Appropriations Committee will try to persuade Senators that the bill's provision only attempts to ensure that each State's 1997 funding level is equivalent to what each State received in 1996. They claim that somehow the distribution of funds in 1997 is a mistake that must be corrected in this bill. 
Mr. President, the distribution of highway funds for this fiscal year is no mistake. For the first time, the allocation of funds in 1997 comes closer to providing States with a true 90-percent return on every dollar sent to the highway trust fund, a commitment made to every donor State when ISTEA was passed in 1991. 
Mr. President, this is 1997. Why should funding in this bill be distributed based on 1996 factors? It does not make good common sense. The provision in the bill will produce a major change in the way ISTEA 1991 distributed funds at the beginning of this fiscal year. 
Our States already have received funds for this fiscal year based on the current law, ISTEA 1991. I see no reason why we need to set new formulas to distribute this additional funding to our States, to change the rules in the middle of the game. 
Mr. President, I urge our colleagues to adopt the Warner-Graham amendment. Our amendment is simply fair play. It compensates those States who lost funds due to a clerical error, and more importantly distributes the balance of $793 million according to the current law, ISTEA 1991. 
Let us save the formula debate for where it belongs, and that is in the careful consideration being given in the course of deliberations of the authorizing committee. And eventually 
our bill will come to the floor. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I want to assure the distinguished manager of the bill, it is not the intention of this Senator nor the cosponsors of my amendment to unduly delay the very important work that remains to be done on this supplemental appropriation, but to enable Senators to focus in on the narrowness of this issue. I wonder if I might ask a question or two of my distinguished colleague from Alaska, and then I would hope my cosponsor, the distinguished Senator from Florida, could have the opportunity to address the Senator. I will be brief in my questions. 
First, Mr. President, I ask the distinguished manager of the bill, what was the dollar figure, in your estimate, of the needed amount of money to correct an error by the U.S. Treasury? We all acknowledge this existed. It is the estimate of the Senator from Virginia that it was $139 million.

Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, we have an honest difference of opinion. It was clear it was a $139 million error that needed adjustment. I commend the Appropriations Committee for seeking that adjustment. 
I then asked my distinguished colleague, was there any request from the administration for dollars over and above the $139 million, and was not the addition of $700-odd million simply a discretionary decision made by the Appropriations Committee?

Mr. WARNER. There was a clear error of $139 million that had to be corrected. The Appropriations Committee did it. Then they 
went on their own initiative to add a very substantial sum of money and devised an entirely new formula--an entirely new formula--which brings further inequity between the donor-donee States. 
I wish to conclude that I do not suggest that this debate engulf the latitude of all the arguments on donor-donee. We ought to sit down and precisely focus on two points, in my judgment. There was a $139 million error. It was corrected by the Appropriations Committee. All the added dollars were put in, presumably at the request of the chairman and ranking member or others on the committee, and then they came up with a new formula as to how to allocate the funds, and in doing that not only create a new formula, but they further exacerbated the friction that exists between donor and donee States. I suggest that debate between donor-donee be reserved for the authorizing process which is going on now in a very conscientious, bipartisan way. 
I yield the floor.

There was an error. We all acknowledge it. But, Mr. President, the error was not in the law. It was in the bean counts. The Senator from New Mexico is the chief bean counter, as chairman of the Budget Committee. It was the person running the green eyeshades, the calculators, the computers, adding, subtracting, and interpreting the law. They interpreted the law wrong. The law was not in error. It was the people running the calculators.

Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I wish to try to summarize this for the Senate. It is a difficult issue. I was, and I continue to be, stunned hearing some of the representations that have been made by my distinguished colleagues and friends in opposition to this amendment, particularly the statement made by my distinguished chairman here, the senior Senator from Alaska, when he said we needed to change the law because the law was wrong. 
Mr. President, I am sorry. I have the statement the Senator made. Mr. President, this is not a question of changing the law. The Senator from Alaska put in the statement by the distinguished chairman of the full committee on which I served, Senator Chafee. And he, Senator Chafee, acknowledged that this is a clerical error committed by the Department of Treasury. 
Senator Chafee: `I want to emphasize the situation before us today is not a new one. It started in '94 when the Department of Treasury made a clerical error.' 
Going on, he says, `Since last July, the Departments of Treasury and Transportation have corrected the error.'

<DOCNO>105-warner-va-18-19970508</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
Mr. WARNER. This is a clerical error that had to be corrected. The Appropriations Committee corrected it as related to the $139 billion. But the distinguished Senator from Alaska said, we had to take and change the law so that the balance of the money--money not requested by the administration or anyone else--could be distributed accurately and fairly. 
So we really have law No. 1, which is the 1991 law, and which we have been acting under for these several years, 5 years, under the ISTEA, 1991. We now have a proposed new law by the Appropriations Committee, a law arrived at without any participation in the normal process of drawing up an important statute like this--no hearings on it, simply cobbled together by the appropriators, hastily, not in consultation with the authorizers. And then we have a third law which, not in existence, is to be devised by this body after careful deliberation on a bill that will be forthcoming from the full Committee on the Environment and Public Works. That debate, which you have seen parts of today, will be extensive, as it should be. It will be thorough. And all Senators will have the opportunity equally to shape the third law, which will control the distribution for the next 5 years. 
Mr. President, my amendment simply says to the U.S. Senate: Let us follow the existing law in 1991, not accept a hastily put together law by the Appropriations Committee without participation by the full Senate. That is a compounding of the inequities of this whole issue on donor/donee. 
So, as Senators go to their desks, please, first, do not accept the fact that some States get zero. I do not know where that sheet came from. I have put on the desk the Department of the Treasury allocation under the Warner formula, which is simply--the Warner formula is nothing more than the existing law. So I plead with the Senate not to hastily rewrite the existing law in a debate which, although thorough, had been but an hour and a half, and not all Senators have had the opportunity to participate. Please, I urge the Senate, do not change the law. Let the 1991 bill finish its intended purpose to 1997, and let that law distribute the additional funds brought forth under this supplemental by the Appropriations Committee. 
I yield the floor.

We should not, as the U.S. Senate, endeavor in this brief period to rewrite that ISTEA 1991 distribution formula. That should await the next piece of legislation which is coming through in the orderly, bipartisan process, through the authorization committee. 
I make the proffer right now to withdraw the amendment if the Senator will revise the bill before the Senate, such that it reflects that in 1991, the ISTEA law governs the distribution of those funds over and above $139 million in this bill.

Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I would like to report to the Senate that the Committee on Rules and Administration is about to embark on a bipartisan investigation into allegations that fraud, irregularities, and other errors, affected the outcome of the 1996 election for U.S. Senator from Louisiana--the first such Senate investigation into vote fraud since the early 1950's. 
A review of the basis for this investigation and the developments to date is an obligation I have as chairman. 
On November 5, 1996, Ms. Mary Landrieu and Mr. Louis `Woody' Jenkins competed in a very close election in which Ms. Landrieu was declared the victor by Louisiana State officials, by a margin of 5,788 votes out of approximately 1.7 million total votes cast. This margin represented a percentage difference of only 0.34 percent, one of the closest contested elections in U.S. Senate history. 
On December 5, 1996, Mr. Jenkins filed a petition with the U.S. Senate asking that the election be overturned because of vote fraud and irregularities which he believed affected the outcome of the election. Along with an amended petition, Mr. Jenkins filed supporting evidence with the Senate on December 17. 
Senator Landrieu filed a response to the petition on January 17, 1997. On February 7, 1997, Mr. Jenkins then submitted an answer to Senator Landrieu's filing. 
In accordance with Senate precedent, Ms. Landrieu was seated `without prejudice' as the Senator from Louisiana on January 7, 1997, with all of the privileges and authority of a U.S. Senator. Majority Leader Lott quoted former Majority Leader Robert Taft in defining the term `without prejudice' when Senator Lott spoke on the floor on January 7: 
[T]he oath is taken without prejudice to the right of anyone contesting the seat to proceed with the contest and without prejudice to the right of anyone protesting or asking expulsion from the Senate to proceed.

Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise to associate myself with comments made previously by my colleagues, Senator McCain and Senator Hutchison. I rise in support of the Government Shutdown Prevention Act and the efforts to add this to the supplemental appropriations bill. This provision will create a statutory continuing resolution to safeguard Federal and military pay in the event of a Government shutdown. Further, it would provide for continuing appropriations for key Government functions in the event of a spending impasse like we suffered in 1995. 
This provision, when attached to the emergency supplemental, will only take effect if the appropriations acts do not become law or if there is no continuing resolution in place at the beginning of the new fiscal year on October 1. 
Although I am a strong supporter of the balanced budget and the reconciliation process, I am deeply concerned that our Federal employees could again be held hostage to the politics of the budget process between the Congress and the administration. Our Nation's dedicated civilian and uniformed Federal personnel should never again be penalized for the inability of Congress and the administration to agree on spending priorities. 
As stated in a 1991 GAO report on Government shutdowns, closing the Government does not save money. In fact, the GAO reported that a mere 3-day workweek shutdown would cost taxpayers between $245 and $600 million. In this time of tight budgetary constraints, such irresponsible actions make no sense. 
Mr. President, with more than 300,000 Federal employees and retirees in the Commonwealth of Virginia, the effects of a Government shutdown, even one of a short duration, would be devastating to our local economy. 
The impact of the shutdown over the 1996 Federal budget spread beyond just our Federal employees in the metropolitan Washington region. It caused a ripple effect well beyond the Capital Beltway. From trips canceled due to lack of passports; to the closure of our National Parks and the economic impact on those communities who depend on tourists for their economic well-being; to our prisons and VA hospitals that must ask vendors to supply food on credit--the shutdown created havoc. 
Federal employee are not the only group that is affected by a Federal Government shutdown. Thousands of companies, who contract with the Government, would be impacted unless a safety net is in place. These firms are dependent upon revenues for services and goods rendered, in order to keep their doors open and to continue paying their employees. 
By an overwhelming majority, the American people are still fearful of the reoccurrence of a Government shutdown. Our Federal employees remember November 14, 1995, and the following 6-day shutdown as Congress feuded over the 1996 Federal budget, at a total cost to the taxpayer of $800 million. They remember December 15, 1995, when the Government shut down again, this time for 21 days, at a total cost of $520 million. 
I applaud the Republican leadership of Senator McCain and Senator Hutchison. By providing this safety net against a potential trainwreck, we are changing the way that Government does business. We cannot continue business as usual when we play politics and appear cavalier in attitude toward our Federal employees--both civilian and military.

Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today to once again introduce the Volunteer Firefighter and Rescue Squad Worker Act. 
The purposes of this legislation, which was S. 324 in the 104th Congress, are to preserve the spirit of volunteerism in our communities and to assist our volunteer firefighters and rescue squad workers in their mission to provide vital life-saving and property protection services in their communities. 
Under current law, it is illegal for a firefighter or rescue squad worker to work on a volunteer basis for the same community which employs him or her during the workweek. My bill would amend the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 to reflect the realities of the work force of the 1990's by excluding from the definition of `employee' firefighters and rescue squad workers who are performing volunteer services, thus removing the need to pay these volunteers overtime pay for those hours volunteered. 
The need for this legislation stems from a 1993 U.S. Department of Labor ruling that a career firefighter cannot serve as a volunteer firefighter within the same county in which he or she is employed. My legislation would allow professional firefighters and rescue squad workers to volunteer their services during off-duty hours and to waive overtime pay. The bill specifically prohibits employers from requiring firefighters and rescue squad workers to volunteer when they would otherwise be entitled to receive overtime compensation, and it requires that any agreement by such employees to waive their right to overtime compensation be put in writing. I have also added new anticoercion language to the bill to specifically define behavior that would be considered coercive. 
Historically, volunteer fire and rescue services have played an important role in our communities. Millions of people, at some point in their lives, have depended upon the services of such volunteers to protect life and property. In many cases, it is the professional firefighters and rescue workers who volunteered their expertise and training to their communities as a way of giving something back to their friends and neighbors. The current law, in comparison, does not even allow a firefighter or rescue worker to respond to an emergency without FLSA regulation. 
Moreover, many municipalities and counties rely upon volunteer services because they lack the funds to operate a full-time professional and rescue service. I am concerned that until this bill is passed, many of our citizens will lack the level of protection that would voluntarily be provided by these professionals. This problem is especially acute for rural areas where fire and rescue units are less common and more remote. 
Mr. President, I thank my colleagues, Senators Cochran, Enzi, Helms, Hutchinson, Roth, Sessions, and Thomas, who are cosponsors of this legislation. I hope my other colleagues will support this important legislation to return an important resource to localities to protect the property, and indeed the very lives, of Americans across our great nation.

Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I was asked by a reporter my view of the distinguished majority leader's role in this very important debate, and I replied, without hesitation, that the tougher the issue, the closer the division within the ranks of the Senate and most particularly within our party, the tougher the leadership challenge. I am proud to join others in saying our leader has met that challenge. 
Likewise, my distinguished colleague and friend from day one in the Senate, the senior Senator from North Carolina, together with Senators Kyl and Smith and Inhofe, have met the challenge. They have ensured that the Senate has conducted a full and thorough debate on this treaty, and they have been instrumental in achieving the 28 conditions which have been adopted by the Senate. Those conditions have improved the document which the President submitted to the Senate in 1993. 
There is a clear division within the ranks of Republicans on this issue, and it has been a conscientious and thoughtful process by which each has reached his or her position. 
Now, Mr. President, to go to the subject itself. I will not go into the details of this treaty. I would like to speak to the broader issue. 
I first learned of chemical weapons at the knee of my father who was a surgeon in the trenches in World War I. He described to me in vivid detail how he cared for the helpless victims of that weapon. 
On through my years on the Armed Services Committee, where I was the point man in the 1980's to drive through the legislation for binary chemical weapons because I wanted this country to be prepared to deter the use of those weapons. 
And, then, through the Reagan-Bush era, our Nation has come full circle, and decided to lead in the effort to eliminate these weapons. Whether that can be done I know not, nor does anyone. But we cannot turn back now from that leadership role. 
This treaty does not meet my full expectations. But I think we can fight better in the arena, in the ring, to improve this treaty than were we to stay outside and peer over the ropes. It is for that reason that I shall cast my final vote in support of this convention. 
I recall the ABM Treaty. I was in Moscow as a part of President Nixon's team, as Secretary of the Navy. The drafters of that treaty put their minds to dealing with the threat at that period of time. They never envisioned, nor could they envision, a decade or two decades hence, what the scientific community might produce. Therein we have made a mistake as a nation by not adapting that treaty over time to deal with technological developments. I shall continue to fight very vigorously to see that that treaty does not become written in stone so as to block the efforts of our Nation to properly defend itself against attack from short-range missiles. 
I cite that as an example, because technology is outpacing what the best minds in this Nation can draft--whether it is a treaty or a law. We have to look upon this treaty--as we should look upon all treaties--as a living document, a document that must be changed by the conscientious efforts of the signatories to this treaty. It must be changed to meet the advancements of technology in the area of chemical weapons; it must be changed to address the concerns that have been raised during this debate. 
Like our Constitution--a document that has lived and survived so that we, the United States, are the oldest continuously functioning form of democratic republic on Earth--this convention must be a living document. Our Constitution has been amended. It shall be amended, perhaps, in the future. Because it is a living document. It has adapted to the many changes we have witnessed as a nation. 
This treaty must be regarded as a living document and it is incumbent upon this President and his successors thereafter to work conscientiously, within the arena, to see that it is strengthened. 
The work in this debate has gone far to show that it is a living document. Under the leadership of Senator Helms and Senator Lott we have already brought about a number of changes. The Senate may effect further changes as the evening progresses. But the important thing we must keep in mind is that this document must be regarded as one that has to be improved. And it is the leadership of the United States that must step forward to achieve that goal. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, today the nations of Europe enjoy historically unprecedented freedoms and economic success as democracy flourishes across the continent. This was not the case a mere 50 years ago. 
I rise today to ask my colleagues and the American people to recall the state of the European Continent at the end of World War II. Like many of you, I will never forget the horrible devastation that the world witnessed in Europe: the destruction of the world's most remarkable cities; devastation of God's beautiful countryside; and the despair of the people. Europeans endured not only the ravages of two world wars, but also economic and political turmoil throughout the first half of this century. As I recall, even the elements seemed to plot against a post-World War II European recovery--one of the harshest European winters on record was in 1946. 
This situation might well have precipitated renewed divisions and another war rather than a lasting peace. It was quite possible that we may have never enjoyed, in our lifetime, a Europe such as it thrives today, if it had not been for the foresight and wisdom of then-Secretary of State, and former Army Chief of Staff, Gen. George Catlett Marshall. 
On behalf of the American people, George Marshall conceived and implemented one of the most benevolent acts of charity in the history of mankind. Under his stewardship, the European Recovery Program, or Marshall plan, provided over $13 billion in economic relief to the nations of Europe. Marshall's ingenuity and leadership restored hope and pride to a disheartened people, helping them to rebuild their cities and societies and again be positive contributors to the international community. 
With the economic recovery of Western Europe came political stability. The Marshall plan, which Winston Churchill characterized as `the most unsordid act in history,' enabled the re-emergence of free, democratic institutions. Today, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development are successful institutions which can trace their origins to the Marshall plan. 
General Marshall outlined his visionary initiative during remarks delivered at Harvard University in June 1947. That same month, he met with representatives of European nations to encourage their participation. Today, as we approach the 50th anniversary of that month, I am proud to introduce this resolution to once again acknowledge the integrity, vision, and benevolence of George Marshall, statesman and soldier, and the unparalleled importance of the Marshall plan in shaping the world of the 20th century. It is important that we continue to foster the virtues embodied in the Marshall plan; virtues which all the world continues to expect from the United States. I invite the support of my colleagues to this important legislation.

Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, Virginians appreciate the value of education. The Commonwealth owes its economic success to a strong university system and an educated workforce. This commitment to education continues to fuel economic expansion, job growth, and rising incomes. 
Middle-class parents across the country recognize that education is the key to their childrens' success. But they often struggle to provide this education, as college tuition increases far outpace increases in personal income. Tuition savings programs help provide a solution. 
Virginia was the first State in the union to launch its program after the Small Business Protection Act was signed into law last August. This legislation builds on that success, by making investment earnings in qualifying State tuition plans entirely tax exempt and by expanding coverage. This bill will encourage more families to save more money for higher education. 
Virginia's prepaid tuition program is an overwhelming success. During the first 3-month enrollment period, over 16,000 children were enrolled in VPEP. The value of these contract total over $260 million, ranking Virginia fourth in the Nation among States with prepaid education programs. The Virginia Higher Education Tuition Trust Fund received over 85,000 telephone calls from around the State seeking information about the program. I want to commend Governor Allen for his leadership, as well as Diana Cantor, executive director of the trust fund, and her team for their tremendous efforts. 
As Virginians recognize by their overwhelming support of the state's plan, education is a critical component of future success. I am pleased to cosponsor this important legislation and I commend Virginia for taking the lead.

Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today as a cosponsor of legislation expressing the sense of Congress that Federal retirement cost-of-living adjustments [COLA's] should not be delayed. 
I join with my colleagues Senator Sarbanes and Senator Mikulski of Maryland, and Senator Akaka of Hawaii in opposing President Clinton's fiscal year 1998 budget proposal to delay Federal retiree cost-of-living adjustments [COLA's]. 
It was a matter of great satisfaction to me that the balanced budget proposal approved by the Congress in 1995 provided for full CPI-based COLA's for Federal retirees each January through the year 2002. That legislation was vetoed by President Bill Clinton on December 6, 1995. 
The President has once again indicated his lack of support for COLA equity by submitting his fiscal year 1998 budget proposal including delayed Federal retiree COLA's. It is my intention to strenuously oppose the President's inequitable COLA policy whenever possible. I will be looking to the Federal retiree community for support in this effort as the fiscal year 1998 budget process continues. 
Federal retirees must be treated equitably in terms of cost-of-living adjustments [COLA's] and income security. You may recall that in 1986, I was an original cosponsor of the COLA equity amendment, landmark legislation which guaranteed equal COLA treatment for all participants in Government retirement programs--Social Security, civil service, and military. From that point until President Clinton's Deficit Reduction Act of 1993, full CPI-based COLA's were provided for all retirees each January 1. 
Regrettably, President Clinton's 1993 budget departed from the policy of COLA equity in that a series of COLA deferrals were put in place for civil service, and military retirees. As you know, Social Security recipients were not affected. What you may not know is that last year, I sponsored legislation which was enacted into law to at least retain COLA equity for the military and civil service. A damaging proposal had surfaced to further delay civil service COLA's to help fund military COLA's, an unworkable and unfair proposition. I vigorously opposed it and fought for its defeat. 
It is time once again to stand and oppose this COLA inequity for Federal retirees. I urge my colleagues to support this resolution to restore equity for all retirees.

Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the father of the Congressional Research Service, Dr. Ernest S. Griffith, who recently passed away at the age of 100. 
Dr. Griffith came to the Legislative Reference Service--now the Congressional Research Service--in 1940, at a time when the U.S. political landscape was dominated largely by the executive branch. Legislation was enacted based on information provided by the President, with little opportunity for independent research and analysis by the Congress. Indeed, with an average of only two or three personal assistants per Member and a mere handful of committee staff, Members of Congress had nowhere to turn for accurate, reliable research and analysis. Nowhere, that is, until Ernest Griffith assumed the reins of the Legislative Reference Service. 
Fueled by his belief that `the Congress of the United States is the world's best hope of representative government,' Dr. Griffith dedicated himself to transforming the fledgling LRS into a vital source of objective, nonpartisan information and analysis for Members of Congress and their staffs. He recruited experts in disciplines ranging from tax policy to transportation, and greatly expanded the services offered by the LRS. He also appointed senior specialists who, under the terms of the Legislative Reorganization Act of 1946, could be called upon by congressional committees at a moment's notice to work on important legislative initiatives. These senior specialists laid the foundation for our modern legislative information infrastructure, and, in so doing, with others enabled the legislative branch to re-assert itself as the Nation's first branch of Government. 
When asked to describe his greatest achievement as the Director of the LRS, Dr. Griffith once responded: `I think I am proudest of the fact that we have operated independently of the executive branch in a technical age.' Mr. President, I too am proud of Dr. Griffith's achievement in this area. It is something of which we should all be proud. 
Dr. Griffith left the LRS in 1958 to become the founding dean of the American University School of International Service. A Rhodes scholar, he received his undergraduate education at Hamilton College and his Ph.D. from Oxford University. He taught economics at Princeton and government at Harvard, and was the undergraduate dean at Syracuse University before moving to Washington in 1935. 
Among his many academic distinctions, Dr. Griffith was a Fulbright visiting professor at Oxford. He also lectured at New York, Birmingham, and Manchester Universities, Swarthmore College, the University of Oslo, and the University College of Swansea. He was visiting professor at the International Christian University and Rykko University in Japan, and lectured on American Government in Turkey and Brazil. He was professor of American Government at Alice Lloyd College in Kentucky in his middle eighties. 
In his spare time, Dr. Griffith taught Sunday school and served as a delegate to the Third World Council of Churches. He founded the Pioneers, a forerunner of the Cub Scouts, and chaired the Council of Social Agencies, a predecessor of the United Way. He chaired the policy board of an inter-university training center for Peace Corps volunteers, was vice president of the American Political Science Association and president of the National Academy of Economics and Political Science. He climbed mountains into his nineties. 
Mr. President, it is with great sadness that we bid farewell to Ernest Griffith, who was memorialized last Saturday at the Metropolitan Memorial United Methodist Church here in Washington. He was a pioneering public servant, a brilliant student of American Government, and a true friend to the community around him. He will be sorely missed--not only by his children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren, but also by us.

Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I join those in expressing our good wishes to both the senior Senator from Kentucky and, indeed, his wife and family for their next chapter. 
Yesterday afternoon, I say to my good friend from Kentucky, I interrupted the proceedings in relation to the underlying amendment to speak briefly on behalf of our good friend and colleague, who at that time was necessarily detained in that State he loves most, Kentucky. But I have been privileged now to serve as chairman of the Rules Committee with my distinguished colleague as the ranking member, and I have been a member of this committee for many, many years. We have all come to know and respect Wendell Ford. And I think within the institution of the Senate, certainly as it relates to all the employees, no matter whether they are in the cafeteria, no matter whether they are here on the dais, wherever they are, he feels a very keen sense of responsibility for their welfare and their safety and for their ability to achieve their goals and care for themselves and their families. 
He has done a remarkable job on the Rules Committee over these years, and I look forward to working with him the balance of this distinguished Senator's term. The Rules Committee is often thought of as housekeeping. Fine, call it housekeeping if you wish. We saw an example today where it occasionally is a little more than housekeeping. But whether it is the complicated issue like today or caring for any employees in this institution of the Senate and working with the House on the overall protection of the Capitol of the United States, where the two bodies share joint jurisdiction, Senator Ford is always there, keeping in mind what is in the best interests of the Congress and of the Senate and of those people who serve the Senate. I salute my good friend and wish him well. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

And I wish to give him and all Members of the Senate my personal assurance that in my capacity as chairman, I will exercise due diligence, the fairest, most aggressive action by our committee in the areas delineated by the amendment that was sent to the desk here momentarily by the distinguished majority leader and joined in by myself. 
We have clearly through the years--the Rules Committee--had jurisdiction in this area, and we will pursue it. I hasten to point out that the three members of the Rules Committee are members of the distinguished ranking member's committee, the Governmental Affairs Committee. Indeed, the past chairman, Senator Stevens, has joined in supporting the amendment in the Rules Committee by the Senator from Virginia, which is now the underlying amendment here in the ardent debate this morning. To suggest that just one or two or three, or whatever it is, members of the Rules Committee can stop either the committee or the Senate from, at this juncture, a full and thorough investigation of all aspects of soft money, all aspects of other alleged areas of campaign finance or campaign reform that need to be addressed by the Senate I think is not a wise step to take at this point in time. 
Mr. President, echoing, again, the very important message that the majority leader stated earlier today, we have to get on. This committee is ready to go to work. Reports are coming in that possible sources of evidence might be disappearing. I will leave that to others to discuss. But I do know that we are tied up here on process, and I hope we can move at the earliest possible time to vote on the amendment of the Senator from Ohio, and the underlying amendment, and of course the amendment by the distinguished majority leader. That will be decided upon by the leadership. 
But I urge all Senators to come to the floor now. Now is the opportunity to give your thoughts on this important matter. Let us get on with it so the committees as allocated under the resolutions here can get on with their business. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, we did discuss this in our hearing. We discussed it yesterday and essentially this is a matter that is going to be placed directly before the chairman, the distinguished ranking member, my good friend from Ohio, Mr. Glenn, and the members of the committee. 
I hope, in the context of their deliberations on what they define as `illegal,' they will refer to traditional sources. I have here the dictionary definition of `illegal,' which I will read. We, of course, recognize it as being an adjective. It means, `not legal, contrary to existing statutes, regulations, et cetera, unauthorized.' 
Then I went to Black's Law Dictionary, which all of us had in law school--at least I did. That is the first book I bought. As a matter of fact, I still have it. I really have coveted that little personal item. So I went back and read in that, and I cite that. `Illegal,' `against or not authorized by law.' `Illegal contract,' `A contract is illegal where its formation of performance is expressly forbidden by civil or criminal statute or where penalty is imposed for doing an act agreed upon.' 
So I say to my colleagues, there seems to be not what I would call a great wealth of debate. It is interesting we went back to examine court opinions. I would have thought in the history of our country someone would have argued that, but I am not sure that anything we found in the course of our research shed a great deal of light. Perhaps my distinguished colleague from Michigan, who is a student in many areas, could refer to some source that he has broader than what the Senator from Virginia has provided this morning.

Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, if I might just reply to my good friend. 
There is documentation. I examined both of those precedents at the time that I drafted the resolution. 
Mr. President, the Senate is now working its will on the resolution that was proposed by the Rules Committee. This body eventually will vote and decide the issue. But I suggest, with all due respect to my colleague from Michigan and the distinguished chairman of the Committee on Governmental Affairs, the ranking member, and others, that we are making sort of legislative history as to what we think is the meaning of the term `illegal' and what we think this committee should do. 
I hope that that legislative history that we are making for ourselves as a body will be the guidepost for that committee and that they will not continually be searching as to how to get around or evade what is the will of the Senate. That will be expressed eventually through a series of votes and the passage of some document in the form of a resolution. It is my hope that the resolution of the Rules Committee remains intact, but that is yet to be seen. So that will be the guidepost, the beacon. 
I am confident that the chairman and the ranking member and the other members of that committee will in turn be guided by this very important debate on the scope of the jurisdiction.

Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, at the present time I have stated my views as to the word `illegal' and its interpretation and its breadth. I predicated that interpretation carefully upon a dictionary definition as well as one citation from Black's Law Dictionary, which is somewhat broader. 
But I want to make certain that my distinguished colleague from New Jersey pauses for a moment to go back and look at the Record as to exactly what Chairman Thompson said. And, if it is agreeable--I do not want to interrupt the distinguished Senator from Michigan.

Mr. WARNER. I read from page 74 of the transcript of the hearing of the Rules Committee on March 6. 
The distinguished Senator from New Jersey was speaking. 
Senator Torricelli. Mr. Chairman, if I could just for a moment--I do not want to delay the committee, but when the hearing began, I expressed concern, Senator Thompson, that the standard was being set extraordinarily high in order to address any campaign abuses because of the `illegal' language that is used. 
Do I understand that when I was absent from the room for a moment, in answer to Senator Ford's question, you have equated `illegal' with `criminal' and that in your mind they are relatively indistinguishable as the standard you are going to use in deciding which campaign activities are within our jurisdiction? 
I will digress to go back to the colloquy with Senator Ford. I now read from page 65. 
Senator Ford. Understand that. And we are used to that. But am I correct that violations of Federal campaign laws are not criminal? 
Senator Thompson. Senator, I would rather not try to give you a legal opinion off the top of my head. 
Then the colloquy went on, in which Senator Thompson further said: 
Well, my idea, campaign finance reform does not have much to do with the statutory regulatory framework that you are referring to. 
So at that point it seems to me that Senator Thompson was not definitive on this issue. 
Now I return to page 74 where the distinguished Senator from New Jersey had posed the question, and I shall read Senator Thompson's reply: 
Senator Thompson: Senator, I cannot say that in all respects, in every situation, that they are exactly the same, and I would rather not try to give you a precise legal opinion that will stay with me for the rest of the year. I think you are entitled to look into that if you want to do that, certainly. The illegal standard has been used time and time again with regard to other investigations. You allude to the high standard. It just goes to show whose ox is being gored, I suppose, in these matters, because I have been spending a lot of time answering some of my colleagues' questions about how can you subpoena somebody just on public information. You are tying up their lives. They are having to hire attorneys and all of that, and now others have a concern that we are not, it is not easy enough to get to them. In other words, the standard is too high. So those are all the things that we are going to have to balance out, but I am not sure that my top of the head legal opinion on the intricacies on the difference between illegal and criminal are as good as what you might be able to get from somebody who has got the books in front of him and can look it up. 
I believe that is somewhat different from what my distinguished colleague said in his earlier comments as to the position taken by Chairman Thompson.

On behalf of Leader Lott I ask unanimous consent that the time between now and 12:30 be equally divided for debate between Senator Warner and Senator Glenn, and further when the Senate reconvenes today at 2:15 there be an additional 15 minutes of debate equally divided between the two leaders or their designees, and immediately following that debate the Senate proceed to a vote on or in relation to the Lott Amendment No. 22, and no amendments be in order prior to the vote in relation to amendment 22.

Mr. WARNER. If the Senator will yield on my time, I was very careful to say I was speaking for myself, and I used precise language from the dictionary and one legal reference. That decision as to the experience of illegal, again, is to be left to the combined judgment, hopefully, of all members of the Governmental Affairs Committee, and using as a precedent that document that will be finally agreed upon by the U.S. Senate today or tomorrow. 
Now, that is the response that I gave very carefully.

I come back again, the Senate will work its will. This resolution that I offered which is the underlying matter before the Senate could well be amended. I hope not, but it could be. So I want to await the final decision of the Senate before I make any further comment as to what my response will be to the question.

Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, if the Senator will entertain a comment, which I hope is constructive and helpful to my good friend and colleague, you are talking about the actual Rules Committee as if we just took everything away from them. Let's go back and take a moment to see exactly what happened, because I know, having worked these 18 years with my good friend--this is on my time--that he deals in precision. We have served together side by side these many years on the Armed Services Committee. 
Now, let me walk my colleague through exactly what happened. First, we have the Standing Rules of the Senate, which defines the basic parameters of the authority of the Governmental Affairs Committee. Each year, Mr. President--and it is rather interesting--the chairman of Governmental Affairs comes to the Rules Committee with a twofold request: first, for a sum of money to operate the committee for the coming fiscal year, and then a request to enlarge the jurisdiction as set forth in the Standing Rules of the Senate. That was done this year. I hasten to point out to my good friend----

Mr. WARNER. The Rules Committee issued Senate Resolution 54, which was voted on by the Senate. 
Any reading of Senate Resolution 54 shows a considerable broadening and enlargement beyond the scope of the authority vested in that committee under the Standing Rules of the Senate. That is my point. And it is, I say to my friend from Kentucky and my friend from Michigan, an enlargement. Let me read the language as recommended by the chairman and presumably the ranking member and the Rules Committee accepted it.

Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, what the Senator said, as I understood him to say, we took away all your jurisdiction. That is not correct. As to the $4.53 million, it is there. As to the second allocation of funds in the nature of a supplemental, it is quite true the Rules Committee laid down in the resolution a more precise definition as to what you do with the second allocation of funding and that is restricted to illegal activities in the 1996 campaigns, Presidential and congressional. But the Senator made the statement that it took it all away. I am pointing out the distinction. No, no, it relates to the second allocation of funding.

Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, my response to that question is that the use of the first allocation of funds pursuant to this resolution is limited to this, and it is up to the Members to interpret it. And, second, it would be my hope that the members would interpret this language in accordance with whatever resolution is finally passed by the Senate today because I view that as an expression by the Senate as to what the scope should be of activities of the Governmental Affairs Committee with regard to both the underlying $4.53 million and 
the additional funds.

And I hope that you, as a colleague, will give us the benefit of the doubt, that the Rules Committee will diligently--certainly speaking for myself, and I think for many members of that committee, if not all--will diligently pursue the issues that are of great importance. I share your concern over the importance of both independent expenditures and soft money. The phrase `soft money' must be terribly complex to the American public. What is soft money? I guess we are going to get a tight definition of that at some point. But we will pursue it with diligence. And I hope you acknowledge that fact.

I would have to say to my good friend and colleague, we will have more debate on this as the day goes on and perhaps tomorrow. Hopefully, we can finish tonight, but I will be ready to take the floor tomorrow again. 
Mr. President, he misstates the case. This Senator is for campaign finance reform of some measure. I am not able to give the parameters in totality now. The distinguished majority leader sat here and opened this debate this morning indicating what is taking place. He, together with Senator Nickles, is conducting a task force on this side of the aisle which meets on a regular basis to examine those provisions, which, hopefully, we will insert at some point in time in a bill which is clearly campaign finance reform. So, I have to strongly disagree with my good friend and colleague on that point. 
Now, Mr. President, we shall stand in recess.

Mr. WARNER. Therefore, Mr. President, I express my appreciation to the distinguished Republican leader, the Republican whip and others who worked on this resolution. The amendment, which was reported out from the Rules Committee, will be amended by the distinguished majority leader, and I will be a cosponsor, whereby we add the word `improper.' That reflects on the original document that I drew from, namely the Watergate amendment which we referred to several times on the floor. That contained that particular word, and it has been throughout the various expressions by the Governmental Affairs Committee as to their desire. But that does not in any way infringe on the continuing role of the Rules Committee or the continuing role of the Ethics Committee. 
Again, there is a clear division under the underlying resolution from the Rules Committee that these three committees will work together as a team and, hopefully, resolve many problems relating to campaign reform and campaign finance and otherwise. I certainly will say to my distinguished colleague, and I see on the floor the distinguished chairman of the Governmental Affairs Committee, with whom I have had a dialog just about every day, their main focus will be on the question of allegations of illegality and the presence, or lack thereof, of illegality in the generic subject of campaign finance and campaign reform. 
Mr. President, unless the distinguished Senator from Ohio has further remarks, I yield back the time and we can proceed with the vote.

We have, in Senate Resolution 54, which has been adopted by the Senate, the budgets for all of the committees of the Senate for their fiscal year, which runs from March 1 through February 28. 
The Committee on Governmental Affairs, in Senate Resolution 39, submitted their request for funding. In the initial consideration of Senate Resolution 39 by the Rules Committee, the committee determined that they would grant a portion of the funding request, and that is reflected in Senate Resolution 54. 
The Governmental Affairs Committee still had, under Senate Resolution 39, the balance of their request, which was considered on the 6th of March by the Rules Committee. After a full debate--and certainly in the judgment of the chairman, myself, and actively participated in by Senators on both sides, as we had nearly 100 percent attendance at the committee hearing on both sides--the committee voted to provide $4.35 million for the Committee on Governmental affairs as a supplemental to the request as reported in Senate Resolution 54. 
Now, how did we arrive at that figure? You can look at the request of the distinguished Senator from Ohio--indeed, a request that, by and large, was supported by most on that side of the aisle--that there be a definitive date for cutoff, and that date by the senior Senator from Ohio was December 31 of this calendar year, 1997. 
If I took that and viewed it as a reduced period of time; namely, that the Governmental Affairs Committee could begin its work using the supplemental funds, March 15, from a practical standpoint, through December 31, 1997, it would appear to this Senator that we would have, by and large, given that committee the funding profile in dollars in proportion to the timing from which those funds may be expended. 
The next question was the scope. I worked with other colleagues, primarily those on the Rules Committee, and I devised a formula, in consultation with the distinguished majority leader and others, whereby looking at the original Watergate resolution, we took from that the concept that we would allow the Governmental Affairs Committee to expend the supplemental budget for such investigations that they felt were illegal in connection with the 1996 Presidential election and congressional elections--not delineating between the House and Senate, but simply all Federal elections in calendar year 1996. 
So it seems to me that the Rules Committee, in a fair manner, recognized the dollars that we needed, gave the Governmental Affairs Committee a scope of the investigation and illegal--illegal is a very broad scope. It goes beyond. And I will at a later time today put into the Record the definitions of illegal. But it goes beyond just criminal assertions of allegations of criminal violations. It goes beyond that. So it is a broad scope. Then the Rules Committee took from the proposal, which the senior Senator from Ohio will address momentarily, a termination date of December 31, 1997. 
In addition to the Rules Committee, I think very importantly recognizing the essential need for the Senate of the United States to actively participate in determining what happened, certainly in 1996 in connection with the ever-increasing number of allegations--most of them regrettably could border on or do, in fact, constitute illegal--it was essential that the other committees of the Senate take on their responsibilities, which is traditional under the allocation in the Senate of the responsibilities among the several committees. Therefore, we charged the Rules Committee, of which I am privileged to be the chairman, the duty to continue its hearings on campaign finance reform, gave it a sum of $450,000 to be used by that committee in enlarging and broadening the scope of their operations in the overall context of campaign reform and campaign financing. So the Rules Committee will take on an added role. 
In addition, if there is that development by the Governmental Affairs Committee or the Rules Committee of facts which should be examined by the Ethics Committee of the U.S. Senate as those facts relate to a Member of this body, it will be incumbent upon the Ethics Committee to review any allegations we feel merit the judgment of that committee as it relates to an individual in the U.S. Senate. 
So, Madam President, I feel that the Rules Committee unanimously, regrettably--bipartisan, yet unanimous among the Republicans--has addressed this tough issue, and we are here today for the purpose of amending Senate Resolution 39 such that they can have the additional funds and under a very carefully crafted and proscribed scope of activities within a time limit of December 31, 1997. 
Madam President, I yield the floor so that my distinguished colleague from Ohio can present his views.  
Mr. GLENN addressed the Chair.

Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, there are others anxious to speak to this. I see Senator Hatch is here, and I want to, just in reply to my distinguished friend and colleague, say a few words here, and then Senator Hatch, hopefully, will take the floor momentarily. 
First, I want to make it very clear, I am not going to personalize this debate in any way or use the word `pandering.' Nobody is pandering anybody around here. What we are trying to do is how to get as quickly as possible to the point where the U.S. Senate, in several committees, can start looking into this very important issue, hopefully in a fair and objective manner, for the best interests of this institution and our country. 
I have been in politics--I am almost hesitant to mention how many years--but it is a good 40-plus, and I have never in my lifetime ever seen a situation engulfing this great Nation, casting more doubt in the minds of the voters with regard to how we, those who serve in the Congress and those who serve in the executive branch as the President and Vice President, go about the process of elections, and we have to get at the bottom of this thing as quickly as possible. 
I have indicated my support for Chairman Fred Thompson as a man I have absolute faith in, who can deal with this matter fairly and objectively, and I have said that for weeks. Never once have I deviated, and I do not think there will ever be a basis that I shall deviate. I said from the beginning that I want to support him as an individual. I want to support the work of his committee. But there is a very careful delineation of responsibilities here among the several committees, and there is clearly, within the jurisdiction of the Rules Committee, which I am privileged to chair, the right to superimpose our own judgment on the scope and activities of the other committees of the Senate as it relates to those funds under our jurisdiction. 
This is in no way any bald-faced effort by myself or other members of the Rules Committee, particularly the distinguished majority leader, who was just on the floor consulting with me minutes ago, no way to try to do other than what I have just said, which is to get the Senate on the track as quickly as possible. We just have to get beyond all of this procedure business and get on with the business. 
I said that I drew this scope language, drawing from the Watergate. I never said I used it. I have read it now probably 25 times and studied the history of it. I know all the words that are in it. It is interesting. In the Watergate resolution, I ask my friend, if he wants to debate it later on, whether or not you find any authority in there to investigate the Congress. I do not find it in the Watergate resolution, but it is very clearly expressed in this resolution as adopted by the Rules Committee. We in no way tried to obfuscate that issue. 
This volume is the `Authority and Rules of Senate Committees' for the last fiscal year, but it is applicable to this. I would like to just read the question of jurisdiction of the Rules Committee, and it is found on page 155 of that book. It states we have the authority to investigate `corrupt practices.' 
Now that is about as broad as any charter can be--as broad as any charter can be. Then go to section 5: 
Federal elections generally, including the election of the President, Vice President, and Members of the Congress. 
There it is. That is the jurisdiction of the Rules Committee. 
Now go over to the jurisdiction of the Governmental Affairs Committee--and I urge my colleague from Ohio to take a moment or two to look through this book so that he can reply--found on page 101, and in detail on page 102, where it says, the committee is duly authorized, or a subcommittee thereof is authorized to study and investigate. 
You do not find--at least I haven't thus far in studying it--that precise language as it relates to the Rules Committee concerning jurisdiction over precisely what it is that the U.S. 
Senate must investigate. If anything, this volume gives clearly the authority to the Rules Committee, and I find less specificity as it relates to the Governmental Affairs Committee. 
Lastly, as to campaign finance reform, the generic subject, the Rules Committee held a number of hearings last year. We already commenced our series of hearings this year. The distinguished majority leader designated the majority whip, Mr. Nickles, and a group of us, including the Senator from Virginia speaking, and it is our responsibility to try to come up with a grouping of proposals which we have reason to believe will effect the greatest possible reform in this generic subject of campaign finance reform. 
You bet there are areas which I would like to see changed. In my last campaign, I experienced spending by my opponent--and I do not castigate him in any way at this point in time, nor did I ever--but clearly he had the authority under the Supreme Court decision to spend all the money of his personal funds he wished. He set a record in the history of the U.S. Senate races from the first day this body was constituted through and including today for the greatest amount of money spent for a State per capita in the United States. 
I think we should enact some legislation that would curtail, in some manner, the limit of an individual to expend millions and millions and millions of dollars. In the case of my race, it is presumably in excess, it was reported, $10 million out of personal spending. Maybe subsequent records will show an additional amount, but that is not here to argue. The point being, the only way that can be done is by a constitutional amendment. I would not want to see this body rest its entire package of reforms that a constitutional amendment is going to be adopted in this area of campaign finance reform. 
My own personal opinion, it is highly unlikely that such an amendment, even though I would favor certain types of constitutional amendments on campaign reform, that that can be achieved; essentially, the first amendment, which, again, would require a constitutional amendment. There are many areas of campaign finance reform that would be solely predicated on the ability to get a constitutional amendment in order to achieve those goals. 
I would not want to see this body pass a package of campaign finance reform proposals knowing full well in our hearts that the Federal court is going to strike down in large measure a number of those provisions. 
So I look forward to continuing to work with the distinguished majority leader and the majority whip in seeing what we can come up with in a package of campaign finance reform proposals which can be adopted by this body and, Mr. President, can withstand the essential scrutiny that will come about by the third branch of Government, namely, the Federal court system. 
Mr. President, I now yield the floor.  
Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.

Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished friend and colleague, the senior Senator from Utah. Indeed, he points out, really, the tip of the iceberg here, in terms of the scope of the problem of all the issues that befall the Senate of the United States. There is plenty of work for everyone. I urge that it be done in accordance with the established rules and precedence of the U.S. Senate as to the allocation and responsibilities among the several committees. 
I certainly join in the Senator's observation about the chairman of Governmental Affairs, Senator Thompson, and my good friend, the senior Senator from Ohio. A note of irony here. The two of us used to do a lot of the investigation for the Senate Armed Services Committee a decade or so ago, and I thought we did it rather well. By the way, Mr. President, we didn't have any charter or much money, but we got the job done and did it quite well, for the wonderful men who preceded us on the Armed Services Committee, Senators Stennis, Tower, and Jackson. They gave us special tasks and we followed through. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I understand that. But I think the Senator is pretty well of a mind to let us get on with the business. The Senator knows what has to be done in exchange with colleagues. Yet, the charter given by the Rules Committee for the additional funding, that sum of money on top of the normal budget for Government Affairs, goes to December 31. You are not going to wait until December 31 to hopefully get the legislation that you have resolved to have one way or another put on the floor, am I not correct? As a matter of fact, do I have reason to believe that you would like to see that legislation enacted before July 4 of this year?

Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, on this issue I wish to engage my colleague. Clearly, in this resolution we have added additional money for the Rules Committee. If the Senator will examine the document which I referred to earlier, the authority and rules of the Senate, you see in here the clearest of jurisdiction given by the Senate over decades to the Rules Committee to do precisely this, the broadest type of authority. You do not find in here, incidentally, the same authority for Government Affairs. Why? Because they are charged with investigating violations of law. They are not a committee that originates legislation in this area. That is for the Rules Committee. 
So it is very clear to this Senator, and I think other Senators will soon recognize, that we are not sidestepping any issue, I say to my friend and colleague. We are simply adhering to the traditional guidelines, precedents and the written prescription for the committees of the Senate to perform their duties. I would urge the Senator to think about whether or not this is sidestepping, or, rather, using the rules and precedents of the Senate set forth in this volume and elsewhere with great clarity.

Mr. WARNER. I am in favor of reform, although I have not supported McCain-Feingold because I find there are serious questions as to whether the majority of that bill can be upheld in the Federal court system. That is my concern. And my concern is it totally ignores the very serious problem in this Senator's mind whereby labor unions compel their membership to donate by taking it out of their paycheck before it even gets to the union family. 
But anyway, I am not here to try to raise all the red hot irons. I want to keep, hopefully, this debate focused on this volume which lays out the authority of the several committees and the fairness of the resolution in this Senator's mind. I take umbrage, personal and otherwise, at the Senator's comment--he wants to generalize--that the Rules Committee is the burial ground for campaign finance reform. Other Senators can speak to their thoughts on this. But certainly for this Senator, I am very anxious to participate in reform. As I said earlier, I am working with the distinguished majority whip in trying to bring together a series of concepts which will withstand Federal court scrutiny, in our judgment, and which will move forward in substantial reform. 
So I say to my friend, I have listened very carefully to his comments, but I do urge him to look at this volume, which prescribes the duties of several committees, and to reflect once again on the fairness of the proposed resolution. We can move forward, Mr. President, with campaign finance reform irrespective of the timetable that is given, whether it is to the Rules Committee or the Governmental Affairs Committee. We can move forward. And that is a judgment call of the 100 Senators to work on collectively under their respective leaders.

I know my colleague from Ohio has looked over that statement in which he has indicated that he no longer is going to pursue a career in the U.S. Senate, but is to return to greener fields. I just thought we should put that in the Record, as to his absence here today.

We are particularly fortunate on the Rules Committee to have a very significant number of senior colleagues, of which my good friend, the senior Senator from Mississippi, is one. And three members of the Rules Committee, three who voted for this resolution, are also members of the Governmental Affairs Committee. That, in my judgment, is a very, very important aspect of this debate. They looked at it from both perspectives. They have counseled this chairman as well as others on the committee. I think that goes a long way to say that this was a resolution carefully crafted and thoughtfully arrived at. I thank my dear friend.

Mr. WARNER. I thank my distinguished colleague. Since he came to the Senate, I have valued his views greatly and his friendship a good deal more. Although we differ from time to time, let us see if we can't come to some fundamental understanding here. Has the Senator had an opportunity to review the document, which I referred to today, the `Authority of the Rules of the Senate on Committees?' If not, I urge that the Senator take a little time to look through it. I read it as saying very clearly, that the broadest jurisdiction possible is in the Rules Committee to look into the subject before us--namely, campaign finance reform, campaign finance violations, the whole generic subject. It is silent with respect to the Governmental Affairs Committee. Most respectfully, it is silent on that subject. 
The distinguished Governmental Affairs Committee is not a legislative committee in the context of this subject. I wonder if the colleague will take the microphone and we can have a colloquy. The first question is--you have not had a chance, but you will look at this?

<DOCNO>105-warner-va-17-19970310</DOCNO>

Mr. WARNER. I want to take it step by step. But as far as legislation, to the extent that the Senate hopefully will adopt legislation on campaign finance reform and campaign finance violations, this Senator is going to--and has and will continue 
to--work vigorously toward that goal. At the current time, the distinguished majority leader has designated the majority whip to head a task force on this side of the aisle, and I am a part of that. I can assure we are working diligently. So that's the legislative action. 
The second point I wish to make is, I don't know of anything done by the Rules Committee in this particular resolution, or in any other thing the Rules Committee has done, which would deter the Senate or forestall the Senate from taking up campaign finance reform whenever the concurrence as to the timing comes with the distinguished majority leader and the minority leader. That is traditionally the function of those two leaders. That is a subject that is being actively discussed between the leaders. So nothing we have done deters that. That is a separate timing, a separate subject. 
But we see when we pick up the papers, there is something new on this subject every day. It is the most distressing period I have ever seen.

Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, we are coming to a very important point, and I was going to raise that because I had this in my hand at the time I yielded for the colloquy with the Senator from Ohio. Senate Resolution 54, the omnibus resolution of the Rules Committee for all committees, under which $4.533 million was allocated to the Governmental Affairs Committee--there 
is nothing in here respecting exactly how it will go about it. That is a matter that is up to the collective wisdom of the members of the committee under the leadership of the very fine chairman, and, indeed, equally fine ranking member. What the Rules Committee decided is, if you wish to have additional funds, that is within the province of the Rules Committee to say that those funds will be for a specific purpose, and that purpose being--we know exactly what it is. But it would seem to me that that action by the Rules Committee, subject to whatever the Senate does in working its will on this resolution--however this resolution emerges--hopefully, in my judgment, will emerge intact. There may be a technical change here or there. That should certainly be a precedent to the members of the Governmental Affairs Committee--a sort of guidepost as to how collectively, exercising the majority vote in this, the members should expend all the funds, in my judgment.

We will continue this year, and we will deal with those issues relating to soft money and independent expenditures. Somebody thinks you can take a hand and remove soft money but it is just all driven into the independent expenditure. And then you come straight to the first amendment and an individual's right to speak and to spend, which the Supreme Court of the United States has basically equated under their interpretation of the Constitution. Am I not right on that?

Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, if I could continue with the question, and I recognize two other Senators are seeking recognition so I will be brief, but several of our colleagues, and I respect their views, have come during the course of this very good debate this afternoon on this issue and tried to indicate in their judgment that this action by the Rules Committee is a deterrent, stalling or in another way impeding the progress of the Senate on the generic subject of campaign finance reform, which we have been working on now for some 2 years, and I do not think this is in any way a deterrent. As a matter of fact, the Governmental Affairs committee is to go on until next December. 
It would be my hope and expectation that the distinguished majority leader and the Senator from Oklahoma in consultation with the minority leader would work on a schedule that is mutually agreeable. And I also wish to commend the Senator for taking the leadership in consultation with the majority leader to have a specific task force within our group that is now assessing what can be done and what will withstand constitutional scrutiny of the Federal courts to put a package together. It would be wrong to put a package through here if we all knew, many of us being lawyers, that it was going to be struck down by the Federal courts. But it is an easy thing to go out amidst this public concern, rightful concern about campaign finance reform, shovel the legislation out knowing that in a year's time it will be struck done by the courts. And that is wrong. 
So I wonder if the Senator would just take a minute to describe the work of the task force. We have now had three meetings. In my judgment, we are making progress and I hope that the Senator shares that judgment.

Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, that was a very interesting dissertation as part of this debate by the distinguished majority whip. 
I would like to also note that the former chairman of the Governmental Affairs Committee, the senior Senator from Alaska, participated throughout the debate in the Rules Committee on this issue. He, as well as anyone, understands that committee, the scope of its jurisdiction, the wisdom of preserving the jurisdiction, and he voted solidly with us on this matter. So we have three members, the distinguished Senator from Oklahoma, the distinguished Senator from Alaska, and the distinguished Senator from Mississippi, who spoke today in strong support of this resolution. 
So we are particularly fortunate that we have three members of the other committee that served on the Rules Committee and who gave their unqualified support for this resolution.

So I think there are a few other facts that should be brought to bear as we look at this situation.

Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, it is a great pleasure today that I introduce the Lorton Correctional Complex Closure Act. For, while a small penitentiary with 60 inmates might have been acceptable in rural Fairfax County in 1916, when the prison was first established as a farming work force, to have over 7,000 inmates in the middle of the heavily populated modern area of Fairfax today, this Senator finds totally unacceptable, legally, environmentally, and in terms of public safety. 
The facts about Lorton clearly demonstrates that it should be removed. I say that, Mr. President, having worked on it for some 18 years that I have been here in the Senate. These facts clearly demonstrate that it must be removed in a reasonable period of time, recognizing that such removal requires careful planning, not only taking into consideration the needs of the people in the communities of Virginia, but many other considerations, among them humanitarian needs. 
The current facility is inadequate and unsafe. The facilities now lack any institutional control, certainly not that measure of control that should be accorded an institution of this importance. 
Also, on the question of rehabilitation, I do not think this facility today is serving to rehabilitative purpose, which is a very vital and important part of the ability to take people who have finished their sentences and equip them to return to society. 
The antiquated management and physical structures mean the taxpayers in the District of Columbia get a very poor return on their investment, and a considerable part of the cost is directed to the citizens of the District of Columbia. With its far too many escapes and disastrous pollution record, this facility has continually degraded the quality of life for those living in the immediate area. This is the combination of facts that compels Congress, in my judgment, to end this unfairness to Virginia. 
Now, part of the plan that the President of the United States is considering to revitalize the District includes Federal assumption of the District's correctional facilities, including those at the Lorton Prison Complex in Northern Virginia. The present proposal anticipates massive renovation of the existing prison and new construction, as well as a cost of nearly $1 billion to the Federal taxpayer. 
Now, Mr. President, that is just not going to happen. I have consistently advocated the closing of Lorton prison in its entirety throughout my 18 years of Senate service. Several years ago, Mr. President, I participated with others on both sides of the aisle, and with the House of Representatives, and we secured legislation and included initial appropriations to start the relocation of the Lorton facility. The mayor at that time and other District of Columbia officials refused even to make the first steps toward a site selection. We were stonewalled even though Congress had spoken, even though Congress had anted up the necessary funds to conduct that site selection and to begin the relocation. 
I know of one community in a nearby State that was more than anxious to participate in the construction of a major modern facility. District officials looked the other way. I do not intend, and I say this respectfully to the Senate and the President and his efforts, and I am not known around here as one to make threats, but I do not intend to abandon my goal to relocate Lorton. I say that again. I do not intend to abandon my effort to relocate the Lorton facility. 
I wish to be fair and constructive. Consequently, I wish to make it clear that I will be a constructive working partner on the President's proposals as they relate to other aspects of the District of Columbia, because I believe the Nation's Capital needs the help on a wide range of issues. It is my hope to vote in support of a broad relief plan, provided, however, that the proposal contains a clear provision which is binding on D.C. officials, a provision that has a binding obligation on the part of those in the executive branch, the Federal Bureau of Prisons and others, to work with the District, to work with other jurisdictions on the relocation, if that is necessary. There could be a site 
right in the District: I know of one site that lends itself more than adequately to relocation. But unless those clear and binding provisions are in there for a relocation within a stipulated and reasonable time--and that timetable should be laid out--then I will fight this. I will fight this. 
I wish to advise my colleagues that absent such clear plans to remove this facility, then I, the senior Senator from Virginia, would be forced to utilize to the fullest extent all rules of the U.S. Senate to block any proposal relating to the District of Columbia. It is as simple as that. I fervently hope I shall not do it, and I will work industriously to include that provision. 
I look forward, as I say, to working with my colleagues in the Virginia delegation to have Congress finally put Lorton on the road for removal and relocation. I will work very closely with my good friend, the distinguished Representative from Virginia, Congressman Tom Davis, chairman of the Subcommittee on the District of Columbia of the House Committee on Government Reform and Oversight, who has shown incredible leadership on this issue. I cannot recall any Member of Congress on either side of the aisle who has worked more diligently and more conscientiously with very little return, if any, to him politically or otherwise, but nevertheless has plowed ahead to show leadership on resolving the tough issues relating to the Nation's Capital. 
Tom Davis is to be saluted and commended. I know Senator Robb and Representatives Frank Wolf and Jim Moran from Virginia, as well, and the Governor and attorney general of Virginia, will do their best. The present Governor and attorney general, and hopefully their successors, will do their best to make the removal of Lorton a reality in the near future.

Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I pay tribute to my most senior staff member who is departing after a well-earned career to take on other pursuits. I do so with a sense of sadness, but indeed, a great sense of recognition for an individual upon whom I have relied, as have many other Senators. Rem is meritorious among his peer group of staff in the Senate and is recognized as the type of individual who is the very foundation upon which we, the 100 Senators, have to rely every day. His support and advice enables us to represent our respective constituencies and to do what we individually think is in the best interests of our Nation. 
Remmel T. Dickinson's service in my office began February 12, 1979, and he is to complete his Senate career on Wednesday, March 5, an impressive 18 years, on my staff, and serving 20 years in the U.S. Senate. 
He proudly hails from Little Rock, AR, but developed early on in his career in the Senate an equal if not greater loyalty to the Commonwealth of Virginia. I must hail him for that. 
From the campaign on which I was first elected, in 1978, he came on to the Senate, and like so many, he did not want to start anywhere but right down at the threshold level where he could learn the system all the way up. Indeed, he started in that all-essential institution known in the Senate as the mail room, which in many respects is the heartbeat of every Senate office. 
With meticulous attention to detail and congenial personality, and I want to underline that, Rem gained the admiration of his peers in the Senate wherever they may work, and his peers throughout the Commonwealth of Virginia, because he was very loyal to many, many people in Virginia. He was a true friend, and is today and always will be, to those that are disadvantaged in our society--be it with physical problems, educational problems, health problems, or whatever it is. The bigger the problem, the bigger the challenge, the harder Rem Dickinson worked to solve it. 
The Federal employees are often a very beleaguered group. He was there no matter what the challenge, to step up and advise me and other Members of the Senate, and indeed, staffers throughout this institution, on what he felt was best and equitable for the Federal employee. And not just those in the greater Metropolitan 
Washington area, but all across the United States he was recognized for his knowledge as it related to the essential services provided to the Federal employee by our country. Equal access for quality education opportunities and equal access in our health care system were his goals, and indeed we have achieved that and will go on to try and improve on those achievements here in the Senate. 
In past years, Rem worked tirelessly on the Republican Health Care Task Force striving for solutions to the dilemma confronting millions of Americans who simply did not have health insurance and the millions more attempting to cope with the ever-increasing problems associated with increasing health costs. 
In the area of education, Rem has helped in supporting our States to provide educational service for students with disabilities, known as IDEA. His attention has also focused on impact aid, a program which local school districts, those local districts colocated with military bases all across our Nation, and helping to get those funds which will enable the children of military families to receive their education in the local school districts without too severely impacting the costs of others who contribute, by and large, through local real estate taxes. 
Rem believes, as I do, that education is the key to a better quality of life for all Americans. He has earned a reputation for honesty and professionalism both in the Senate and, as I said, throughout Virginia. My constituents have had an open door to the Senate's work through Rem's expertise in these areas. 
As the years have passed, I am impressed by his dedication to duty, his loyalty to this Senate, to those on my staff, and to those on other Senate staffs, and indeed on a one-on-one basis with many Senators. Above all, he is a gentleman of honor in the finest traditions of the South which he loves. 
Indeed, Rem has earned the loyalty, respect, admiration, recognition, and gratitude of virtually everyone with whom he has come in contact during his lifetime. 
And I can only presume that the manner in which he has carried himself, and the care he has exercised in the performance of his duties will continue in whatever Rem chooses to do when he departs the Senate. 
We will miss Rem's daily good counsel. I commend Rem for a career well spent and well conducted, and I congratulate him on the contribution he has made to our Nation, to Virginia, and we wish him the best in his future pursuits.

Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, on February 11, in his capacity as chairman of the Joint Committee on Printing, the senior Senator from Virginia testified before the U.S. House of Representatives Legislative Branch Appropriations Subcommittee. 
The purpose of that testimony was to provide justification for the Joint Committee's Fiscal Year 1998 appropriations request, and to outline the priorities of the Joint Committee in the current and future fiscal years. 
Chief among the Joint Committee's priorities are reform of Title 44 U.S.C., and the implementation of means to assure that the American public continues to retain access to information created by the Federal Government at taxpayer expense. 
Currently, the Government Printing Office is charged under title 44 with the management of the Federal Government's procurement of information products and with the maintenance of the public's access to these products--through the Federal Depository Library System, through the GPO Bookstore Program, and through GPO access, the on-line service of the Government Printing Office. 
In recent years, however, various Federal agencies have taken to ignoring title 44. Some are procuring their information products directly from the private sector without going through the GPO's private sector procurement program. Others are setting up in-house facilities to create their own information products. In addition, a few agencies, in an effort to be entrepreneurial, have taken to making arrangements with organizations outside the Federal Government for the dissemination of taxpayer-funded information. In doing so, this information has become copyrighted, or had copyright-like restrictions imposed upon it. The net result is that the public's access to taxpayer-funded information has been greatly restricted. 
Mr. President, the Government Printing Office's Superintendent of Documents, Mr. Wayne Kelley recently delivered a speech on this issue. In his remarks, Mr. Kelley provided specific details and raised a number of important questions about these activities and their detrimental effect on the American public. 
I ask unanimous consent that Mr. Kelley's speech before the Government Documents Roundtable, Federal Documents Task Force, of February 15, 1997, be printed in full at the conclusion of this statement.

Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the Senate Committee on Rules and Administration, which also is chaired by the senior Senator from Virginia, will hold 2 days of hearings later this spring on legislation to correct this situation and to reform other areas of title 44. 
It is this Senator's intention that this legislation will be supported on a bicameral and bipartisan basis, and that the administration will fully support it as well. 
Mr. President, the strength of America's system of government lies with an informed public. Free and open access to information created at taxpayer expense is the principle which has enabled the United States to endure and prosper for over 200 years, making this Nation the oldest, continuous, constitutional democratic republic in the world. 
Members of Congress have a responsibility to our Founding Fathers, to our citizenry, and to future generations to ensure that this principle is maintained.

 Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, concluding nearly 53 years of Federal service, Glenn H. Rottmann recently retired from the U.S. Government Printing Office [GPO], where he had risen through the ranks from junior offset platemaker to Director of GPO's Production Services with responsibility for all printing performed at GPO, including many of the essential products needed by Congress for its daily operation such as the Congressional Record. 
Following 14 months of service in the U.S. Army, Mr. Rottmann began his career at the GPO on July 23, 1945, as a junior offset platemaker. In 1971, he was made foreman of the offset plate section, and in 1975 he was named Superintendent of the Offset Division. In 1981, Mr. Rottmann was promoted to production manager with overall responsibility for GPO's inplant production facilities, including the Press Division, the Binding Division, and prepress operations under the Electronic Photocomposition, Graphic Systems Development, and Electronic Systems Development Divisions. In 1993, he was promoted to Director of Production Services following an agencywide reorganization. 
As one of the Nation's largest printing plants and the largest manufacturing operation in the District of Columbia, GPO produces a wide variety of products, from essential legislative documents for Congress and critical information such as the U.S. Budget, to other important publications such as the daily Federal Register, U.S. passports and postal cards, and a broad variety of other items. Some publications, such as the Congressional Record and the Federal Register, are printed on demanding schedules overnight, each containing as much type as four to six metropolitan daily newspapers. Mr. Rottmann's responsibility was to ensure that this essential Government printing was accomplished with the highest possible quality, in the most timely manner, at the lowest possible cost. 
During his tenure, Mr. Rottmann oversaw the upgrading of GPO's inplant production operations with modern graphic communications and electronic information technologies. Under his leadership, GPO completed the conversion from hot metal to electronic photocomposition technology, expanded desktop publishing opportunities on Capitol Hill and in Federal agencies through GPO's dialup composition system and MicroComp software package, began the production of CD-ROM products, acquired and installed state-of-the-art offset press technology, expanded the use of environmentally sensitive products such as recycled paper and vegetable-oil inks, and developed the technology and databases supporting GPO Access, GPO's award winning online information dissemination service. As a result of these changes, citizen access to Government information has been substantially improved, and the productivity increases from new technology have permitted substantial staff downsizing and increased savings to the taxpayers. Beyond these achievements, Mr. Rottmann was widely considered an able administrator and a friend by GPO's employees. 
Mr. Rottmann earned numerous GPO awards, served as an apprentice training representative, completed several training programs, and is a graduate of the Federal Executive Institute in Charlottesville, VA. 
I extend congratulations and sincere appreciation to Mr. Rottmann for his 53 years of dedicated public service to Congress and the Nation, and I wish him a long and happy retirement.

 Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined today by Senator Bob Graham and so many of my colleagues in introducing the STEP-21, ISTEA Integrity Restoration Act, to reauthorize our Nation's surface transportation programs. 
The current legislation--commonly known as ISTEA--expires on September 30 of this year. New legislation must be passed for our States and local governments to receive any transportation funds on the beginning of the new fiscal year on October 1. 
Mr President, my bill presents a regionally balanced, multimodal approach for establishing a new transportation policy that will successfully carry us into the 21st century. 
STEP-21 is a 5-year authorization bill that maintains a strong Federal role in transportation. It responds to the mobility and accessibility needs of all Americans to a modern and safe transportation system. It provides the resources and policies necessary for our American products to compete in a global marketplace. And, we continue the guiding principles of ISTEA committed to a system that is economically efficient and environmentally sound. 
Our STEP-21 proposal is grounded in two fundamental principles--funding equity and a streamlined program. 
Already much attention has focused on the regional disparities in the funding distribution formulas. But, our legislation recognizes that all regions of the Nation have important transportation needs. We are committed to devising a program that--for the first time--responds to our transportation demands using current needs information. In doing so, we provide a program that acknowledges that sparsely populated States with large land areas or States with small populations cannot go it alone. We are committed to continuing a national transportation system--to provide effective connections among the States. I believe the needs of these States must be addressed and we do so in our legislation. 
STEP-21 has a much broader focus than just the single issue of funding distribution. 
STEP-21 moves us beyond the advances of ISTEA with further streamlining of the current bureaucratic maze of Federal programs. We reduce the number of program categories, thus increasing the flexibility permitted for our State and local partners to determine their own transportation priorities. 
STEP-21 also continues and builds upon the many successes of ISTEA. 
Mr. President, this legislation maintains our national focus on multimodal solutions to moving people and goods efficiently. 
We continue the flexibility of State and local decisionmakers to invest their resources in nonhighway alternatives--such as transit or commuter rail options. 
We continue the important role of metropolitan planning organizations and their need to have an identified funding source. 
We recognize a full and open planning process that stimulates public participation at both the State and local level will foster transportation solutions that respond to larger community goals. 
We provide a program that is environmentally sound, recognizing that transportation plays an important part in our national goal to improve the quality of the air we breathe. States can continue to invest in those transportation choices that move people and goods without degrading air quality. The enhancements program that invests in alternative forms of transportation--bike paths and pedestrian walkways--and mitigates the impacts of past transportation choices on our communities quality of life will be continued. 
In brief, STEP-21 ensures that we have a national multimodal transportation policy that is ready to meet the economic demands of a global marketplace. It provides solutions to the regional disparities of the current program and the Federal second-guessing of State and local transportation choices. It does not retreat from the principles of ISTEA to provide for an open decisionmaking process permitting States and localities to invest in different modes of transportation.

 Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize and to pay respect to Dr. William Perry for his distinguished service as the 19th Secretary of Defense. From his confirmation by the U.S. Senate on March 5, 1993, until his retirement on January 24, 1997, Dr. Perry has successfully faced many challenges as he has advised the President and the Congress through the difficult and ever-changing post-cold war era. Clearly, he was the right man at the right time. 
Bill Perry brought to the Office of the Secretary of Defense a deep intellect, sound judgment, and a patient but effective leadership style. It is no surprise to me, and I am sure to others that know Bill Perry, how quickly he endeared himself to our men and women in uniform. His genuine concern for our service members has been the hallmark of his tenure as Secretary of Defense. Indeed, his initiatives in the area of quality-of-life have truly made a difference, and will serve as a fitting legacy of his exemplary service. 
I have known Bill Perry for many years. I have had the opportunity to work with him during his service in both the Government and the private sector. As he returns once again to the private sector, I look forward to continuing our relationship and I wish him and his family all the best.

Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, William L. Ensign, Acting Architect of the Capitol, is retiring on February 3, 1997, after 20 years of Federal service. Bill began his distinguished career with the Office of the Architect of the Capitol as the Assistant Architect in May 1980. He occupied this position until November 22, 1995, when, upon the retirement of George M. White, he became the Acting Architect of the Capitol. 
Bill, in his role as Assistant Architect, was also the Director of Architecture and the principal adviser to the Architect in all matters concerning the architectural design of new buildings, the restoration and renovation of existing buildings, and the planning and adaptive reuse of facilities throughout the Capitol Hill complex of buildings. Specifically, Bill was responsible for the Architecture and Construction Divisions encompassing design, construction, and production technology. 
In November 1995, Bill inherited the leadership of the office. In this capacity he has been responsible to the Congress for all design, construction, care, operations, and maintenance of facilities within the Capitol Hill complex of buildings. 
Prior to service with this Office, Bill was president and chief executive officer of the firm McLeod, Ferrara, Ensign Chartered Architects, from 1955 to 1980. He also served as an officer in the Civil Engineer Corps of the U.S. Navy from 1952 to 1955. 
Mr. President, on the occasion of his retirement, I am honored to express and extend my gratitude and appreciation to William L. Ensign, for his many years of dedication and professionalism to the Congress and the Nation. Bill's commitment and expertise has assured that future generations will be able to visit the buildings and grounds and enjoy the rich history that is encompassed in the Capitol complex. 
Mr. President, I thank Bill for his distinguished service and wish him and his family the very best during his retirement years.

Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation which will return a sense of fairness to the military health care system by providing Medicare-eligible military retirees the same health care plan that is currently available to every other retired Federal employee. Under this legislation, all Medicare-eligible military retirees and their family members will be given the option to participate in the Federal Employee Health Benefits Plan [FEHBP]. 
Under the current system military retirees lose their guaranteed access to military medical care at age 65 and are forced to rely exclusively on Medicare. It is worth noting that our military retirees are the only group of Federal employees whose health plan is taken away at age 65. I am sure that my colleagues would agree that this situation is not only inherently unfair, but that it also breaks a long standing health care commitment to our military retirees. When these men and women joined the Armed Forces, they were promised health care for both them and their families, for the rest of their lives. This was a commitment. This was in writing. Now, at age 65, they find out that this commitment is being withdrawn. 
Mr. President, the commonly held belief that the health care provided for military retirees is second to none is a myth. The truth is that when you compare it to what is provided by other large employers including General Motors, IBM, Exxon, and the rest of the Federal Government, the health care that is provided to our Medicare-eligible military retirees and their family members has become second to almost all others. 
This bill that I am introducing today is the same legislation that I introduced in the 104th Congress. Although my legislation was not adopted, the fiscal year 1997 Senate-passed version of the National Defense Authorization Act Conference Report directed the Department of Defense to conduct a study of the cost and feasibility of extending the option of enrollment in FEHBP to our Medicare-eligible military retirees. This report is due to Congress on March 1, 1997. I am hopeful that this study will thoroughly examine this issue and provide meaningful recommendations that we can use to strengthen the military health care system during the Armed Services Committee's consideration of the bill I am introducing today. 
Mr. President, this legislation represents a major step forward in the application of equitable standards of health care for all Federal employees and honors our commitment to those veterans who served our Nation faithfully through many years of arduous military service. I invite my colleagues to join me as cosponsors of this bill.

Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, on Monday, January 20, the U.S. Congress, through the auspices of the Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies, hosted the 53d Inauguration of the President and Vice President of the United States. 
In addition to the senior Senator from Virginia, who served as Chairman, the members of the committee included: Senator Wendell H. Ford, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, Speaker of the House of Representatives Newt Gingrich, House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt, and House Majority Leader Richard Armey. 
With over one-quarter million people gathered on the west front of the U.S. Capitol and the Mall, and millions more watching on television and listening on radio--throughout the United States and around the world--William Jefferson Clinton reaffirmed the oath of office as the 42d President, and Albert Gore, Jr. reaffirmed the oath of office as the 45th Vice President of the United States. 
This ceremony--at which the President and Vice President, standing before the people's elected representatives, are sworn to execute the will of the people as expressed by Congress--is central to America's governance, making the United States, the oldest, continuous, constitutional democratic republic in the World. 
The ceremony has grown by tradition and precedent since George Washington first took the constitutionally prescribed oath of office as the Nation's first President. 
It commemorates the peaceful transition of power and the continuity of leadership conceived by our Founding Fathers and reflected in both article II and the 20th amendment of the Constitution of the United States. 
Article II, Section 1 
* * * Each State shall appoint, in such Manner as the Legislature thereof may direct, a Number of Electors, equal to the whole Number of Senators and Representatives to which the State may be entitled in the Congress: but no Senator or Representative, or Person holding an Office of Trust or Profit under the United States, shall be appointed an Elector. 
The Electors Shall meet in their respective States, and vote by Ballot for two Persons, of whom one at least shall not be an Inhabitant of the Same State with themselves. And they shall make a List of all the Persons voted for, and of the Number of Votes for each; which List they shall sign and certify, and transmit sealed to the Seat of the Government of the United States, directed to the President of the Senate. The President of the Senate shall, in the Presence of the Senate and House of Representatives, open all the Certificates and the Votes shall then be counted. The Person having the greatest Number of Votes shall be the President, * * * 
Before he enter on the Execution of his Office, he shall take the following Oath or Affirmation:--`I do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will faithfully execute the Office of President of the United States, and will to the best of my Ability, preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States.' 
Amendment 20 
Section 1. The terms of the President and Vice President shall end at noon on the 20th day of January, and the terms of Senators and Representatives at noon on the 3rd day of January, of the years in which such terms would have ended if this article had not been ratified; and the terms of their successors shall then begin. 
Mr. President, the objective of the Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies was to ensure that the swearing-in ceremony was conducted in a manner reflecting dignity on the Office of the President, the Congress, and the U.S. Supreme Court--the three coequal branches of our Government. 
To achieve this end, Congressional staff, military personnel, Executive Branch employees, and volunteers worked for more than 6 months to plan and executive this ceremony inaugurating the President and Vice President. 
Viewing the ceremonies from the Capitol grounds or on television, it is difficult, if not impossible, to appreciate all the planning and effort that goes into an inaugural swearing-in ceremony and the luncheon that follows. 
Every possible detail from the precise words used to introduce the President and his escorts to the platform to the location of television cameras had to be considered, reviewed and agreed to by representatives from the Congress, the Office of the President, the media, and numerous security organizations. 
Particular commendation goes to the outstanding program participants whose lasting contributions of prayers, songs and poetry made this such a memorable, historic day in the continuing life of America. 
To put the many thousands who came to the Capitol in a proper spirit, the morning began with a sing-along of patriotic music led by the U.S. Marine Band. So far as we can determine, this was a first. 
The sing-along was followed by musical presentations by the choir from the College of William and Mary from Williamsburg, VA, and the choir from Hampton University from Hampton, VA. 
The Rev. Billy Graham and the Rev. Gardner C. Taylor offered prayers. Jessye Norman, the Children of the Gospel Mass from the Washington Performing Arts Society, the Immanuel Baptist Church Choir and Orchestra of Little Rock, Santita Jackson, and the Resurrection Choir lifted our spirits with song. The scholar Miller Williams presented an original poem written specifically for this occasion. 
And for the first time, which I find astonishing, the Pledge of Allegiance was recited at the inaugural swearing-in ceremony. 
Eagle Scout David Morales, a junior at James Madison High School in Vienna, VA, was selected to lead the Pledge. His performance was a tribute to the scouting movement and to the youth of our great Nation. 
The Architect of the Capitol was tasked with the substantial logistical responsibilities of building the platform, arranging the seating, installing security fences, and maintaining the grounds. 
The Capitol Police, the U.S. Secret Service, the Metropolitan Police Department, and the National Park Service had to consider every movement of the President and Vice President, how to afford security and, at the same time, provide the viewing public and other participants maximum opportunity to view their national leaders. 
Everyone involved in carrying out this enormous task can take great pride in the high degree of professionalism with which they performed their duties. 
The timing of all aspects of the ceremony, beginning with the departure of the traditional congressional escort committee going to the White House, meeting the President and bringing him to the Capitol, and ending with the President's departure from the Capitol following lunch required intense cooperation and coordination between the Office of the President and the Congress. Both were given in full measure on this challenge and all others. 
A very special commendation goes to Terry McAuliffe and Ann Jordan, the co-chairmen of the President's Inaugural Committee. Their directions were well and carefully carried out by Tim Keating. 
The traditional congressional luncheon honoring the President and Mrs. Clinton, and the Vice President and Mrs. Gore--from the brief speeches to the beggars pudding--was judged a success. Grayson Winterling, Ginny Sandahl, and Dot Svendsen deserve special recognition for their astute and sensitive planning and execution of every luncheon detail. 
Beginning 100 years ago, with the inauguration of William McKinley in 1897, Congress has hosted a luncheon for the President and Vice President. This year our luncheon theme was the inauguration of John Adams and Thomas Jefferson in 1797. 
The menu for the luncheon was based on foods Adams and Jefferson might have enjoyed in their time, and the memento provided each guest was a magnifier glass similar to ones used in that era. 
As the chairman of the Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies, and on behalf of the committee and the entire Congress, the senior Senator from Virginia extends a grateful thanks to all who helped make this historic swearing-in ceremony possible, including: 
The staff of the Joint Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies: Susan Aheron Magill, executive director; John Chambers, deputy director; Jack Hoggard, Bobbie Kilberg, M.L.

I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.

Mr. WARNER. I thank the chairman. 
Madam President, President Clinton performed an act of political courage in reaching across the aisle and getting a proven Republican warrior to take on this important post. But that act is matched by the independence and, indeed, the courage that Bill Cohen brings to this office. 
For 18 years, it has been my privilege to be seated next to him on the Senate Armed Services Committee, and to travel with him throughout the world. 
The hearing today was thorough, the questions were tough, and that is the way Bill Cohen would have wanted it. That is the way the committee dealt with him today. It was not easy. It was a thorough and careful hearing, and I commend the chairman and Senator Levin. 
In the course of the questioning, by myself and others, I think Senator Cohen made--I do not think, I know he made a commitment to the Congress that he will try to work in this next Clinton administration to improve the consultation between the President and his advisers and the Congress in a timely manner before we commit the men and women of the Armed Forces of the United States into harm's way. 
On that point, I questioned him about what standard should be employed when U.S. troops are deployed into hostile situations. I drew Senator Cohen's attention to responses given by the Secretary of State-designate Albright at the time of her confirmation hearing on January 8. Ambassador Albright spoke of a series of situations when `our interests and those of our allies may be affected.' In those instances, our new Secretary of State would recommend the use of U.S. forces. I felt that we should be more explicit in defining the standard for using U.S. troops in hostile situations. In my view, the men and women of the Armed Forces should know, before they are deployed by the President and the Secretary of Defense, that the mission of these fine troops is in our vital national security interest. 
Senator Cohen came close defining the standard that I have applied on this issue--that is, that U.S. vital national security interests must be threatened before we agree to put U.S. troops in harm's way. But he said he wanted to leave room for the use of United States troops in those instances where there was a potential for a situation to approach a vital national security interest, such as in Bosnia. While he clearly stated that Bosnia was not in the vital national security interests of this country, he pointed out that, by virtue of the intervention of our troops and others, we avoided a situation where the conflict could have spread beyond the borders of Bosnia, thereby creating a situation which would be in the vital security interests of this country and indeed other nations. I will continue to work with my good friend to further tighten his standard regarding the use of U.S. troops. 
There were several other issues I explored with our Secretary of Defense-designate during this morning's hearing that I would like to discuss at this time for the benefit of the entire Senate. The first is the critical issue of congressional involvement in international agreements which substantively modify the ABM Treaty. I reminded Senator Cohen that during the last Congress--and, indeed, dating back to 1991--he was my partner in our efforts to provide adequate missile defenses for our troops deployed overseas and to Americans here at home. One issue which has been of paramount concern to many Republican Members of Congress is the Clinton administration's repeated attempts during its negotiations with the Russians on a demarcation agreement to apply the limitations of the ABM Treaty to our shorter range, theater missile defense systems. I was in Moscow in 1972 when the ABM Treaty was signed. I know that the ABM Treaty was never envisioned to restrict our shorter range systems. 
Unfortunately, the battle with the administration over the demarcation issue continues. Senator Cohen joined me in 1994 in cosponoring an amendment to the Fiscal Year 1995 Defense Authorization Act which states that any international agreement which substantively modifies the ABM Treaty must be submitted to the Senate as a treaty. During last year's conference on the Fiscal Year 1997 Defense Authorization Act, National Security Advisor Tony Lake came before the conferees and stated unequivocally that the administration had determined that the demarcation agreement the administration had tentatively concluded with the Russians was indeed a substantive modification of the ABM Treaty. Despite this position, and--in my view--the clear legal requirement that flows from the law enacted in 1994, the Clinton administration refuses to acknowledge that it must submit the final demarcation agreement to the Congress for approval. 
To his credit, Senator Cohen reaffirmed his view that agreements which represent substantive modifications to the ABM Treaty must be submitted to the Senate for consideration. I am hopeful that from his new position, he can help us in resolving this longstanding dispute between the Congress and the Clinton administration. 
The final issue I would like to mention concerns the negative impact that the Bosnia operation and other similar contingency operations are having on the overall level of military readiness, and on defense funding levels. I pointed out to Senator Cohen that 
our troops deployed to such operations as those in Bosnia are distracted from their normal training evolutions which are critical to maintaining their combat readiness. This problem is compounded by the ad hoc way the administration has been funding these contingency operations. As Senator Cohen acknowledged, we will soon be faced with a supplemental budget request of over $2 billion to fund our continued involvement in Bosnia. That $2 billion will be taken out of the critical readiness and procurement accounts which are already at dangerously low levels. Senator Cohen recognized the problems I outlined, and agreed to work with the Congress to find solutions. I look forward to that dialog. 
Madam President, Bill Cohen will not only be a valuable adviser to the President, but I think to the Cabinet as a whole. His hallmark in the U.S. Senate was to bring disparate factions together and to try to strike a common ground of understanding between the strongest of differing viewpoints. Therefore, in those Cabinet meetings, I anticipate he will take on an added responsibility and role. He will quickly gain the respect, not only of the President, but of his other colleagues. 
Lastly, Madam President, might I say, on the question of sexual harassment, he came down with a zero tolerance standard. And that was a message that I think all Americans wanted to hear. I reminded him of the success of the military in handling a very serious drug problem at the time he and I first came to the Senate. That is the benchmark for him to follow in dealing with the sexual harassment problem, as he institutes that zero tolerance policy, which I hope he will succeed in attaining. 
I thank the Chair.

Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I commend first the distinguished chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee for the manner in which he expedited the hearing on this very important, most senior of our Cabinet positions. 
Also, I wish to commend the distinguished chairman of the Armed Services Committee. Our committee just completed its hearing on Senator Cohen, and we anticipate that today the Senate is likely to turn to that nomination also for a vote. 
So that under the leadership of the majority leader, with the cooperation of the distinguished Democratic leader and the chairmen, we have, I think in record time, accomplished the very careful and thorough screening of two Cabinet posts and providing the President with that advice which he needs. 
I have had the privilege of knowing the distinguished Ambassador, the nominee for the post of Secretary of State, for many years. Ambassador Albright has come before the Senate Armed Services Committee, over the 18 years I have been privileged to serve on that committee, on a number of occasions as an expert witness, which is a difficult role to carry out. But she has always done it in a very careful and well-informed manner. Early on, she gained the respect and admiration of both sides on our committee, as she worked her way up through a number of important posts before going to the United Nations as our Ambassador. And now I think the President is to be commended in selecting her for this assignment, which I anticipate she will discharge with equal if not greater wisdom and skill than her previous assignments. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. Warner. Mr. President, Mr. Vice President, Mr. Speaker, Mr. Majority Leader, Mr. Chief Justice, Members of the U.S. Congress, their families and guests--all one-quarter million who have joined here today on the grounds of their Capitol. 
[Applause.] 
Welcome to the 53rd Inauguration of the President and the Vice President of the United States of America. 
[Applause.] 
Across our Nation, and around the world, Americans join William Jefferson Clinton as he reconfirms the oath of office as the 42nd President of the United States, and Albert Gore, Jr., as he reconfirms the oath of office as the 45th Vice President of the United States. 
Our first President, George Washington, was inaugurated in 1789. 
Thereafter, every 4 years, our citizens have witnessed this transition of authority as required by the Constitution of the United States. 
It is the conferring of this trust and authority--which has occurred without any interruption for 208 years--that is the cornerstone of our representative democracy. 
It is a tribute to the providential vision of our Founding Fathers. 
It is a tribute to the strength of character of the American people and the endurance of their institutions. 
It is a tribute to successive generations of Americans who have guarded our most valuable heritage--our freedom. 
And, Mr. President, may I say, on behalf of the millions and millions of Americans, we express to you our gratitude for this past week, having invited to the White House a true man who fought for freedom, and you presented him with the Presidential Medal of Freedom, Senator Dole. Thank you, Mr. President. 
[Applause.] 
For two centuries, the American Presidential Inauguration ceremony has represented both national renewal and continuity of leadership. 
So it is altogether fitting that as the world's oldest continuous constitutional democratic republic, we gather today to honor this historical triumph, and to recommit ourselves to keep our Nation strong for future generations. 
Mr. President, prayer has been an essential part of all inaugural ceremonies. 
As I was privileged to drive up with you from the White House, you held the Bible and read the passage that you will read today. 
Therefore, we are honored today to have the Reverend Billy Graham to lead our Nation in prayer, as he has at seven previous inaugurals. 
Please stand for the invocation and remain standing for the Pledge of Allegiance. Reverend Graham.  
INVOCATION 
Reverend Graham. President Clinton, Mrs. Clinton, Vice President Gore, Mrs. Gore, I am going to ask that we all bow our heads in prayer. 
Our Father and our God, we thank You today for the privilege of coming into Your presence on this historic and solemn occasion. 
We thank You for Your gracious hand which has preserved us as a Nation. We praise You for the peaceful continuity of Government that this inauguration represents. 
We recall that the Bible says, `Except the Lord build a house, they labor in vain that build it.' You also said that to whom much has been given, much will be required. 
We look gratefully to the past, and thank You that from the very foundations of America You granted our forefathers courage and wisdom, as they trusted in You. So we ask today that You would inspire us by their example. Where there has been failure, forgive us; where there has been progress, confirm; where there has been success, give us humility, and teach us to follow Your instructions more closely as we enter the next century. 
Give to all those to whom You have entrusted leadership today a desire to seek Your will and to do it. 
So today, we ask Your blessing on President Clinton and his wife, Hillary, and their daughter, Chelsea, and upon Vice President Gore and his wife, Tipper, and their children. 
Give to all our leaders the vision of what You desire America to become and the wisdom to accomplish it and the strength to cross the bridges into the 21st century. 
We pray also for the Members of the House and the Senate, for the Supreme Court, and for all who bear responsibility of leadership in this Nation which is blessed with such ethnic diversity. 
We have not solved all the social problems of our times, such as drugs and racism. Technology and social engineering have not solved the basic problems of human greed, pride, intolerance, and selfishness. We need your insight, we need your compassion, we need your strength. As both President Clinton and Senator Dole urged us in the recent Presidential campaign, may this be a time of coming together to help us deal with the problems we face.

Of History and Hope 
We have memorized America, 
how it was born and who we have been and where. 
In ceremonies and silence we say the words, 
telling the stories, singing the old songs. 
We like the places they take us. Mostly we do. 
The great and all the anonymous dead are there. 
We know the sound of all the sounds we brought. 
The rich taste of it is on our tongues. 
But where are we going to be, and why, and who? 
The disenfranchised dead want to know. 
We mean to be the people we meant to be, 
to keep on going where we meant to go. 
But how do we fashion the future? Who can say how 
except in the minds of those who will call it Now? 
The children. The children. And how does our garden grow? 
With waving hands--oh, rarely in a row-- 
and flowering faces. And brambles, that we can no longer allow. 
Who were many people coming together. 
cannot become one people falling apart. 
Who dreamed for every child an even chance. 
cannot let luck alone turn doorknobs or not. 
Whose law was never so much of the hand as the head 
cannot let chaos make its way to the heart. 
Who have seen learning struggle from teacher to child 
cannot let ignorance spread itself like rot. 
We know what we have done and what we have said, 
and how we have grown, degree by slow degree, 
believing ourselves toward all we have tried to become-- 
just and compassionate, equal, able, and free. 
All this in the hands of children, eyes already set. 
on a land we never can visit--it isn't there yet-- 
but looking through their eyes, we can see. 
what our long gift to them may come to be. 
If we can truly remember, they will not forget. 
[Applause.]

Mr. Warner. Santita Jackson will lead the singing of our National Anthem. She will be accompanied by the Resurrection Choir, a group composed of singers from the choirs of American churches tragically destroyed by fire in recent months. 
This choir's performance is a befitting commemoration of this day on which we honor also Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr. 
Before we sing our National Anthem, the Reverend Gardner C. Taylor will deliver the benediction. 
Ladies and gentlemen, please stand for the benediction and remain standing to sing our National Anthem. 
Reverend Taylor. 
BENEDICTION 
Reverend Taylor. Let us lift up our spirits before our Creator, eternal God, brooding over the days of our years. In sovereign judgment, and yet with tender mercy, now close to the end of this solemn but joyous occasion, we lift our hearts and our hopes before Thee. 
We pray for our President, William Jefferson Clinton, that Thou will give to him ever increasing vision and vigor and voice, that he might speak tellingly to the American promise in history. 
We pray for the gracious and gallant lady at his side, Hillary Rodham Clinton, and for their daughter. 
We ask Thy blessings upon the Vice President of the United States and upon his wife, Mrs. Tipper Gore. Grant, we pray, that he may ever be more a partisan of what is best in our American tradition. 
And now, our God, we hold before Thee this Nation so richly endowed, so grandly blessed, and yet imperiled, apparently often, by the very richness of its diversity. Deliver us from pettiness of heart, from harshness of speech and from violence of action. Make us worthy of our history, of patriots' sacrifices and martyrs' blood, in the vanguard of which stand Lincoln and King, Thy servants Abraham and Martin. Give us ever a greater dedication and commitment to the grand defining words of our democracy--liberty, justice, equality, opportunity. 
And now let the words of our mouths, all of our mouths, in the meditations of our hearts, all of our hearts, be acceptable in Thy sight, O Lord, our Strength and our Redeemer, and now unto the old, wise God, our Deliverer, be glory and majesty, dominion and power both now and evermore. Amen.

Mr. WARNER. I have discussed with Majority Leader Lott the procedures he proposed today with regard to the seating of Senator Landrieu and the review of Mr. Jenkins' petition contesting the election of Senator Landrieu. 
I agree with and fully support the actions taken by the majority leader. I would like to take a moment to explain the actions the Rules Committee has taken thus far concerning this contest and those procedures which we anticipate following in the future. 
The Senate is the Constitutional judge of the qualifications of each Senator. Article I, section 5 of the U.S. Constitution, states that the Senate is the `Judge of the Elections, Returns, and Qualifications of its own Members. . . .' 
The Secretary of State of Louisiana has certified that Mary Landrieu defeated Louis `Woody' Jenkins by 5,788 votes in the 1996 U.S. Senate race, and this morning Senator Landrieu was sworn in `without prejudice.' This action is in accordance with the precedents of the Senate, which recognize that the Senate generally defers to the certification of the State until the Senate has had the opportunity to review such petitions and evidence as may be submitted by the contestants or gathered by the committee. 
On December 5, 1996, Mr. Jenkins exercised his right to file a petition of election contest with the Vice President of the United States. That petition was referred to the Senate Committee on Rules and Administration, chaired by myself with the distinguished Senator from Kentucky Mr. Ford, serving as the ranking Democrat. 
On December 18, 1996, Mr. Jenkins submitted an amended petition along with considerable documents related to the allegations in his petition. These allegations go to the heart of the integrity of the election process on November 5 in Louisiana, and Mr. Jenkins' steps, thus far, merit thorough consideration by the Rules Committee. 
In consultation with Committee members, and consistent with precedent, Senator Ford and I engaged two attorneys to serve as outside counsel for the Committee, and their letters of engagement are attached for the record. Bill Canfield was selected by the Republicans, and Bob Bauer was chosen by the Democrats. Their assignment is to review the petition and all documents submitted to the Committee relating to the petition and to advise the Committee as to whether the petition should be dismissed or, if not, what further courses of action the Committee should consider. 
As a means to providing equity to both candidates, the committee advised then Senator-elect Landrieu of her right to file material for consideration, and a copy of the letter from the committee to her counsel is attached for the record. Senator Landrieu's attorney has indicated that she will respond by January 17, 1997. 
Mr. Jenkins will then be given time to examine any material submitted by Senator Landrieu and provide the committee with a surrebuttal. After reviewing all of the filings, our outside counsel will promptly provide the committee with their respective opinions. I anticipate the two counsel will have some areas of their opinions reflecting a concurrence of views and recommendations. 
It is my intention to then hold a committee business meeting on counsels' reports immediately thereafter and determine the next step in this process. I am hopeful that we will be able to hold this meeting early in February. 
These procedures will allow and ensure a fair and equitable review of the allegations. Senator Landrieu, Mr. Jenkins, and the citizens of Louisiana, as well as the entire country, expect and deserve no less. 
The above outline of committee procedures, so far, parallels the actions of the Rules Committee in the Huffington-Feinstein contested election in 1995.
