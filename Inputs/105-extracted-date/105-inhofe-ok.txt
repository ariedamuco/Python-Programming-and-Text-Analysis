Mr. INHOFE. I would like to enter into a colloquy with my friend Senator McCain, who is the chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, in order to clarify an amendment to the Coast Guard authorization bill. This provision, which was adopted in committee as part of S. 1259, has the unintended effect of raising serious safety concerns for general aviation pilots. It would make it a criminal offense if a pilot knowingly disobeys an order to land, but there is no explicit requirement for reasonable suspicion of criminal activity. It also could make an aircraft owner responsible for paying thousands of dollars to reclaim their aircraft, even if they are totally innocent of any wrongdoing. 
As the Senator knows, I have been a pilot for over 40 years, and I understand that an `order to land' could be a dangerous and traumatic experience for a pilot. In fact, the International Standards, Rules of the Air, published by the International Civil Aviation Organization says `interceptions of civil aircraft are, in all cases, potentially hazardous.' 
The provision was intended to provide additional authority to U.S. law enforcement officers to curtail maritime and aviation drug smuggling near the border, which I'm sure all of us agree is a laudable goal. However, because of the potential danger and immense burden to pilots, I believe some relatively minor changes should be made to the amendment. 
With that in mind, I have drafted some changes to the language that I would appreciate the House and Senate considering during their deliberations. These changes will directly address the concerns of the general aviation community without undermining the ability of law enforcement to track and stop pilots involved in illegal activity.

Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I, too, rise in support of S. 1194, the Medicare Beneficiaries Freedom to Contract Act. 
You and I, Mr. President, and all other Americans not covered under Medicare, may obtain health services without informing the federal government. However, our nation's senior citizens must first seek out Washington's approval--even when they prefer to pay for those services out of their own pocket. 
Congress intended to correct this situation by permitting private contracts. Unfortunately, the President insisted he would veto the entire 1997 Balanced Budget Act unless this fundamental right of all Americans was eliminated or severely limited for senior citizens. 
Medicare beneficiaries should have the same freedom to obtain the health care they choose from the physician or provider of their choice--as do Members of Congress and virtually all other Americans. It's ridiculous that this right was taken away and unfortunate that it's taken so long to correct. 
Mr. President, I thank the majority leader, Senator Lott, and Senate Finance Committee Chairman Roth for acknowledging the importance of this issue and for pledging to look into it further next year in the 106th Congress.

Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, in the midst of all the confusion and anxiety of the last week, we are going to be asked to vote on the confirmation of three judges that I think should be looked at very carefully. 
First is the nomination of William Fletcher to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. Groups are in opposition due to a Law Review article in which he stated that judicial discretion trumps legislative discretion when a legislature fails to act. 
Presently, Fletcher's mother is sitting on the Ninth Circuit, which is historically the most liberal and activist court in the United States. Over the last 3 years, the Supreme Court overturned the Ninth Circuit more than any other. 
In a book review, about which Mr. Fletcher was questioned before the committee, he stated that political circumstances outweigh a literal reading of the Constitution. In short, the Constitution is what Judge Fletcher says it is. Judge Fletcher is an extremist and should not be confirmed. 
Nomination of Richard Paez to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals: In an outrageous ruling in 1997, Judge Paez ruled that an American company could be liable for human rights abuses committed by their partners in another country. 
Paez has shown a bias against religious and conservative groups. In one of the most publicized cases Paez heard as a District Judge was the 1989 trial of Operation Rescue leader Randall Terry. Paez became upset with some of the pro-life language Terry used and `stormed off the bench.' Additionally, he angrily warned the defendants that their Bible would be confiscated if they continued to wave or consult it. 
While a sitting District Judge, Paez gave a speech at UC-Berkeley's law school in which he called California's Proposition 209 an `anti-civil rights initiative.' In that speech, he also said, `legal action is essential' to `achieving the goal of diversifying the bench.' He characterizes himself as a `liberal.' Judge Paez is an extremist and should not be confirmed. 
Lastly, and briefly, the nomination of Timothy Dyk to the Federal Court: While in private practice, Mr. Dyk, successfully fought the FCC's ban on indecent programming to protect children. 
He has sat on the board of People for the American Way, and while working as an attorney for People for the American Way, he successfully defended a county school board that forced students to read materials their parents believed violated their deeply held religious beliefs. A member of Mr. Dyk's legal team called the concerned parents `somehow less important' and said `the enemy was really not' the plaintiffs `but [Rev. Jerry] Falwell.' 
I believe that Mr. Dyk is also an extremist and should not be confirmed in his nomination. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, we had a very significant meeting yesterday of the Senate Armed Services Committee, which was a culmination of months and months of work on behalf of many of us trying to explain to the American people the very threatened situation that our country is in, and I am very proud that we had a meeting that I will describe to you in the next few minutes which, I think, is going to actually change America's approach to our defense system. I think it is very appropriate to talk about this now because I also would be speaking in favor of the Strom Thurmond National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 1999. 
I think it is important for us to understand the deplorable condition of our defense system. We have for 14 consecutive years, counting this year, actually had a decline in defense spending. It has dropped and it has dropped and it has dropped. I have to hasten to say this also transcends politics. It has been in Republican administrations and Democrat administrations. Of course, during the administration of President Clinton it has been worse than it has been before. We are now at the lowest level in procurement since 1960. This was attested to yesterday by General Reimer, Dennis Reimer, the commander of the Army. 
Our military now is smaller than it was in the 1930s and is on more missions than we went on during the Vietnam war. Our Army deployments have tripled, the Air Force deployments have quintupled, if there is such a word, and the Navy ships in the Persian Gulf have reached one of the lowest states of readiness in 5 years. We have Navy aircraft crashes. They are called class A mishaps. They have doubled this year, the highest in 5 years, and CNO Adm. Jay Johnson has attributed this to a lack of spare parts. 
As I go around to the various military installations, I see that we don't have spare parts, that we are cannibalizing perfectly good aircraft to get spare parts to keep other ones running. 
The Navy was 7,000 short in their recruits this year--7,000. That means we don't have enough sailors to go out and man the ships necessary to meet the minimum expectations of the American people. The pilots are leaving the Air Force in droves. Right now, our pilot retention has dropped below 20 percent. Madam President, it costs $6 million to put a pilot in the seat of an F-16, and yet we are down now to a 20-percent retention. 
What does this mean? It means that it costs almost 100 times as much to go out and retrain someone as to retain someone who is already there. What is the reason for this? 
I spent most of the August recess, Madam President, going around to the various military installations in my plane. In fact, I was taking journalists with me so they would start writing about this deplorable situation that we find our military in right now. I know one of the individuals who went with me in my plane is Roland Evans, of Evans and Novak, and we made a lot of visits to various installations on very, very short notice. In one of the installations, we had over 20 pilots in one room. I said, `Why is it you are down to 20 percent? How many of you in here, after this tour of duty, are going to come back in and continue your careers flying for the Air Force or the Navy?' About 20 percent are going to do it. It is actually a little below that now in the Navy. 
I said, `What's the reason for it?' They started out with the fact that we have starved the budgets for the military to the extent that they don't have adequate spare parts, and those kids who are out there, the mechanics who are putting these engines back into condition, flying condition, are using spare parts that were cannibalized out of another engine, maybe a new engine, and the end result of that is they are not sure of the work quality of these individuals since they have been up and they are working sometimes--we ran into some situations where they are working 16, 18 hours a day. I ask you, Madam President, would you feel very secure about flying an aircraft that has been maintained by someone who has been on his 18th hour that day? It is a very difficult thing. These young people are willing to do it. 
Then after they talked about that, they talked about--Wait a minute, it is not just that; we were hired and recruited to have a career in flying and defending America. We want combat skills. As a result of the deployments to places like Bosnia where we don't have any national security interests, these people are not able to continue their training. Out at Nellis Air Force Base in the Mojave Desert where they are supposed to have the red flag exercises--these are beautiful exercises that allow fighter pilots to go in and train under actual combat conditions, or nearly actual combat conditions, and they are not able to do it. They have cut down the number of training flights, because when they come back from the long deployments to places like Bosnia and other places where we don't have any national security interests, instead of being with their families, they try to get training in, and there isn't time when they are back home. Consequently, we are having them leave by droves. 
Now, I used the example, of course, of pilots because there seems to be more interest in them. It is easier for people to understand that if you have a $6 million investment in a man or woman to fly a vehicle and they go off and start working for the airlines and yet they really wanted to stay and defend America, you have to examine why is this. It is money, it is the contingency operations and it is a lack of mission. I have heard that so much from these people, saying, well, we no longer know what the mission is of this country. We are in places where we are not able to use our combat skills. The marine pilots, they are flying helicopters that were used by their fathers in Vietnam. 
We hear about the MTWs. Sometimes we stand on the Senate floor and we start talking in the language that a lot of people don't understand because they don't know what an MTW is. That is a major theater war. There is an expectation out around the United States that America's military is able to defend America on two regional fronts, and this is not our situation today, as came out in the hearing that we had yesterday. I think the people in Oklahoma are aware of this because I commute, I go back every weekend, and I have town meetings. They are fully aware of the condition of our military. I was recently in Chelsea, OK, the home of Will Rogers, and over at the Port of Catoosa, places where they would otherwise have to depend on what they are reading of something that is coming out of the Washington media market so they wouldn't really be in a position to understand how deplorable this situation is. 
As far as the two major theater wars, we are not able to do that today. If you ask the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and you ask the various chiefs, they will say: Yes, we can do two nearly simultaneous major theater wars. But then you ask them, what is the risk factor? The `risk factor' is a term that is used in saying: Yes, you are prepared to do this, but if you do this, No. 1, how long will it take? No. 2, how many soldiers will be wounded or killed? 
In asking them yesterday what the risk factor is of two major theater wars, they said it is medium for the first one and high for the second. We need to have the risk factor low, because we are now quantifying as to how many American lives will be affected should we find ourselves in a situation where we have two major theater wars. It comes to something like 16,000 additional Americans will be wounded because of this high-risk factor. 
One might wonder why there is a high risk factor. Right now we know, if you have been reading the newspapers, Madam President, that we have very serious problems in places like Iraq. I don't think there is anyone with a background in the military who will tell you if a crisis exists, as it does now, if we have to go into Iraq, that it can all be done from the air. It cannot all be done by air. You have to follow up with ground forces. 
If you go over to the 21st TACOM in Germany--that is where they handle all the logistics in that theater, which includes Bosnia, Iraq, and the entire Middle East. What would we do if we had to support a ground effort in Iraq when we are now at over 100 percent just taking care of the needs of Bosnia? 
I know that is a shock to a lot of people when they realize that going into Bosnia, taking all the stuff down there to support the troops that we have there and that our NATO allies have there, and fulfilling the commitment we made to them--which we never should have made--is using up 100 percent of the capacity of the 21st TACOM. 
That means, in the event we had to go into the Middle East, like Iraq or Iran or Libya or any other place, we would have to be dependent 100 percent on the Guard and Reserve. 
What has happened to the Guard and Reserve? Because of underfunding and deployments to all these different places like Bosnia, in Oklahoma we are deploying our Guard and Reserve for up to 270 days. How many people are in an occupation where they can be let go for 270 days? 
We have our occupation specialties, our MOSs, that we don't have. We don't have doctors going over there now. If we were forced to support a ground operation in Iraq, we could not do it with our Guard and Reserve. That is how desperate the situation is. 
We covered something else yesterday--I wish the hearing that took place yesterday had happened maybe a month before; then we would have been able to do a better job with the defense authorization bill which we are, hopefully, about to pass in a short period of time--and that is, we brought to the surface the realization that, in addition to the problems I have outlined, we have a backlog of real property maintenance--these are things that have to be done to maintain our property to house our soldiers around the world--of $38 billion. This is $38 billion that will have to be spent sometime, and we have no preparation for that at all. 
We have a shortfall of $1 billion in BASOPS. Those are things that have to be paid for today. We are talking about garbage collection, water bills, and this type of thing. We do not have that kind of money. General Tilleli, who is in charge of some 37,000 troops in South Korea right now, said just the other day:  
They will not be able to fully support sustained operations due to overdue infrastructure repairs. 
This is a direct quote: 
Strategic airlift will be affected, regardless of one or two MTWs, unless the en route infrastructure in Alaska, Hawaii and Guam receive adequate funding. 
Which they are not right now. 
Presently these three locations require infrastructure repairs on their fuel handling, fuel shortage and material handling equipment. 
On a recent trip to Fort Bragg, one of the most necessary of all installations, they have barracks that are leaking. The roofs are leaking like sieves. We were there right after a very hard rain. Not only was it leaking to where our troops were in the water at the time, but also it was going down into the basement where they have the armory, where the weapons are being stored. They are corroding and rusting, and our troops are spending their time in a high OPTEMPO or PERSTEMPO rate during the hours they have to work in order to keep them for use for training purposes. 
At Camp Lejeune--it might surprise you, Madam President, even Marines have to have a decent quality of life or at least have to know something good is going to happen--they have the CH-46. That is a type of helicopter they have been using. These helicopters are all older than the pilots flying them. We have a V-22 program that is supposed to replace all the CH-46s, and it is not in place. We are not there yet. We want to get there, but we are not there. That comes into this whole equation of having to fund the overall defense system. They say you are as strong as the weakest link in a chain. All of our links are equally weak and about to break. 
Madam President, we found at Camp Lejeune in one particular helicopter squadron that only 4 of the 11 helicopters were operational. The rest were either down for maintenance or had been robbed of their parts to keep the last four working. This is something that cannot be continued. 
I am very proud of General Bramlett. He is currently the FORSCOM commander. He is just about to retire. In his memo that came a couple of weeks ago--I am going to quote some things because I want them in the Record--he said:  
We can no longer train and sustain the force, stop infrastructure degradation, and provide our soldiers with the quality of life programs critical to long term readiness of the force. 
Commanders at Fort Lewis, Stewart and Bragg report units will drop below ALO-- 
That is, authorized level of organization-- in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 1999. This threatens our ability to mobilize, deploy, fight and win. 
Further quoting General Bramlett: 
Funding has fallen below the survival level in fiscal year 1999 . . . . Current funding levels place FORSCOM's ability to accomplish its mission in an unacceptable risk. 
Unfunded requirements can only be realized with an increase in the overall funding level for the Department. 
I chair the Readiness Subcommittee of the Senate Armed Services Committee. Last week, we had both General Bramlett and General Schwartz, who will be taking his place as commander of FORSCOM. They believe the memo he wrote is true today. 
I know I have described a very ominous situation, Madam President. But the good news is that at yesterday's Armed Services Committee hearing, we had Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Shelton, along with the chief of the Army, General Reimer, General Krulak of the Marines, General Shelton, Admiral Johnson of the Navy, and General Ryan of the Air Force. I want to say publicly how proud I am of the courage that they exhibited yesterday. I do not remember a time when--and I have been here for 12 years and I have read about this situation for longer than that--I don't remember a time when the chiefs of the services had the courage to stand up and say to the President that our budget that you have been giving us for the last few years is inadequate to defend America. It displayed an incredible amount of courage. I am very, very proud of them. 
They identified an immediate need for $17 billion above the President's budget. They displayed a level of honesty that we should all appreciate and we seldom get. 
I was very proud also--I happen to be a conservative Republican and have always been prodefense--but we had several Democrats on the committee yesterday. I was surprised and so gratified to hear them come out and join in. Senator John Glenn questioned the fact we may have gone too far in our drawdown in forces. I was very proud of Senator Lieberman and his statement when he said, `We are asking more of our military post-cold war than during the cold war,' and his comments regarding national ballistic missile defense, which I want to touch on very briefly in a minute. 
Senator Cleland, Max Cleland from Georgia, spoke out and he actually made this statement in the committee, that we are going to have to go back and listen to what Dr. Schlessinger said recently when he said that the problem is so severe that we are going to have to, in a massive way, rebuild our defense system and do it in a similar way that we did in the early 1980s. He said that it does not seem that with 3 percent of gross domestic product we would be able to sustain an adequate force; it is going to have to be 4 percent. 
So what Senator Cleland was saying is, we need an additional $70 billion just to build our forces up to meet the minimum expectations of the American people. What is interesting about what Senator Cleland said was that in addition to the fact that that equates to $70 billion, if you take what each of the chiefs says is necessary over and above what we have allocated for fiscal year 1999, it comes to about $70 billion. 
Just for a minute, let's go back to Senator Lieberman who made the comment about the national missile defense system. I have found that when I go around the country and ask people what their feeling is and what we would be able to do if, for example, a missile were fired from someplace in China or someplace from the other side of the world to Washington, DC, knowing that it would take 35 minutes to get over here, and it is carrying a weapon of mass destruction, either biological, chemical or nuclear, what we in the United States could do--because most people think we could shoot it down--fifty-four percent of the people in America think that if a missile were coming over, we would be able to shoot it down. 
In fact we cannot shoot it down. We are naked. We have no defense, Madam President, against a missile coming in from another continent. And the reason is that it is outside the atmosphere. We do not have anything that will knock it down. By the time it reenters the atmosphere, it is going at a velocity that we do not have anything to knock it down with. 
We have been derelict in not pursuing the course we started on in 1983 to have a system deployed to defend ourselves against an ICBM coming into the United States by fiscal year 1998. That is what we are just winding up right now. Yet we have noted that we were on that course since 1983, until Bill Clinton was elected President of the United States in 1992, and then started vetoing the defense authorization bills and the defense appropriations bills, until we took out funding that would have been there to finish the job to have deployed a national missile defense system by 1998. That is now. Someone was pretty smart back in 1983 to realize this is the time that we would have to have a system in place. 
However, we now know that it is going to take another 3 years or so to do it. Several of us who have been promoting a national missile defense system have concluded that one of the reasons we have not been able to impress upon the people of America how dangerous of a situation we are in right now is that they have been confused by all the different types of national missile defense systems. 
So we have all kind of gotten down to one, the one that would give us the best system, the cheapest in the shortest period of time just to take care of a limited attack by a warhead that would be coming over on a missile. 
That would be the Aegis system, Madam President. We have $50 billion invested in 22 ships right now. They have the potential missile defense capability to knock down long range missiles outside the atmosphere. To do this, to upgrade the system to be fully capable in the upper tier would cost approximately $4 billion more and take about 3 more years. We want to get on that road so we can get a system here as soon as possible, but we do not have it yet. We do not have it in this defense authorization bill. And yet we have gone as far as we can go with the bill now. 
I only regret that we did not have these committee hearings a month ago so that we could have done a better job preparing for the defense of America than we have done in the 1999 Strom Thurmond national defense authorization. 
So with that, I just want to say that I do fully support the bill. I hope it comes up some time either Thursday or Friday and we can vote for it, support it, pass it, and then start rebuilding our defenses so that we can at least meet the minimum expectations of the American people and be honest with them and defend my seven grandchildren, my four children, and the rest of America. 
Thank you. I yield the floor.

 Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, while I was the mayor of Tulsa, we started an Oktoberfest to benefit the `River Parks' which is an area around the Arkansas River for jogging, cycling or walking. Tulsa Oktoberfest is known as one of the best in world and a large reason for that is due to Josef Peter Hardt, whom I dubbed `Mr. Oktoberfest.' 
Born in Oberhausen (Rhineland) Germany, Josef emigrated to Ithaca, New York in 1951 and moved to Tulsa in 1955. His professional career was in broadcasting, retiring as the manager of commercial productions of Channel 2 in 1993. His civic career consisted of work in the Theater Tulsa, television and film production, one founders of Tulsa's Oktoberfest, an active member of the German American Society Arts Association and German American Society Building Corporation in Tulsa. 
Because of his active involvement in the German American Society, he was awarded the Bundesverdienstkreuz (Distinguished Service Cross) by the Counsel General for the Federal Republic of Germany, on the tenth anniversary of the German American Society of Tulsa. During that occasion, the Honorable Peter Maier-Oswald noted that `Joe Hardt has always worked for his old country and his new country to promote relations between the two.' 
Our first Oktoberfest consisted of a small tent on the banks of the Arkansas River in 1979 and now draws over 200,000 people over a four day period. Since the beginning, Josef, has held various jobs but perhaps the one for which he will be remembered most is that of MC. As this is the last year of his active involvement in Tulsa's Oktoberfest, I wanted to take this opportunity to commemorate his leadership and faithful service to his community. We will miss seeing and hearing him as the MC, but he will always be Mr. Oktoberfest in my book.

Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I would like to point out to the Chairman that Section 606 contains a provision that appears to grant priority status to a single carrier at Chicago O'Hare for the return of slots previously withdrawn for international service. If it is the intention of this provision to give one carrier at O'Hare preference in slot allocation, the Senate conferees must act in conference to remove this provision. 
This provision appears to hand over roughly 35 slots that the dominant carrier at Chicago previously sought to obtain from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) but was twice denied. 
This provision would advantage a single carrier, which knew of the priority of slot withdrawal and should have planned its hub operations to take into account the effects. It strengthens a single carrier's position at O'Hare, a situation which the Congress should not legislate. 
As this legislation goes to conference, the Senate is relying on the conferees to ensure Congress is even-handed in these matters.

Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, section 606 subparagraph (6) of S.2279 will have the unintended consequences of limiting competition at Chicago's O'Hare airport. I have spoke at length with Senators Lott, McCain, and Ford regarding my concerns with this provision and understand that it may be possible to correct this problem in conference. I hope that is the case. 
This provision will allow those carriers who have lost landing/takeoff slots to foreign air carriers at Chicago's O'Hare to get them back. On the surface this seems very fair; however, it will in fact unfairly favor the largest slot holder at O'Hare at the expense of other competitors and new entrants. Because the dominant carrier at O'Hare has lost the most slots, it stands to gain the most. The result will be less competition rather than more at O'Hare.

Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, there is a process that is used by the FAA which is known as the emergency revocation process. This process will allow an inspector in the event of an alleged violation by a licensed pilot to take away the pilot's certificate. He would take away the certificate under the 
emergency revocation clause declaring that an emergency exists. 
The problem with this is that many times when you have an inspector do this, or an examiner take away a certificate, there is not even an emergency nature to the revocation. Consequently, we have many, many cases where the individuals have been abused. 
I would like to suggest that Ted Stewart, who is an American Airlines pilot, has been a pilot for over 12 years and presently flying Boeing 767s. In May of 1995, there was an emergency revocation. He was not guilty of anything. There was not an emergency attached to this. There was never any hazard to anyone's health or safety. 
However, it was 2 months until he was able to get his certificate back. Then an examiner went back to him in June of 1996 and again revoked his certificate under the emergency revocation. Consequently, for another 2 months he was unable to earn a living. Fortunately, he worked for American Airlines; they were good enough to keep his paychecks coming, but in many cases that is not the case. 
I happen to be a very close friend of a man named Bob Hoover. I think most of you can remember who Bob Hoover is. He is considered to be the best performer in the circuit of airshows. In fact, I have flown airshows with him. In 1992--and I was there at the time--an inspector came in, an examiner for the FAA, and said to him, We think you have a problem. We think perhaps there is a mental problem or something--they didn't really define it--and they revoked his certificate. It wasn't for another 4 years he was able to get his certificate back. In the meantime, he was flying his airshows but outside the United States. 
Now, very simply, what my amendment does is set up a process whereby if you lose your certificate, you have 48 hours to take it to the NTSB and let the NTSB make a determination as to whether or not there is any kind of an emergency nature to the revocation. After they have looked this over and decided there is no emergency involved to the nature of the revocation, then at the end of 7 days the pilot will get his certificate back. If there is, then he would not get it back. They can go ahead then and go through the normal adjudication of the violation. 
This is something that has been going on for quite some time. We have been concerned about reforming this process. This is a compromise, because this makes it very clear if there is any hazard out there, if there is any risk to anyone's safety, the flying public or the pilot himself, the pilot is not going to be able to fly. It is as simple as that. 
A lot of people say that there are only 300 emergency revocations a year. Therefore, it is not really a problem; it doesn't really affect that many people. I suggest to you that if you take 300 people, there might be 20 or 30 of those who make their living flying airplanes for American Airlines or one of the other airlines, in which case that takes them out of their occupation. 
The other problem we have is there are 650,000 pilots right now licensed in the United States and they all live in mortal fear that something like this would happen to them. 
At this point let me yield 1 minute to Senator Frist.

Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President just a few years ago we went through the same thing with the civil penalties of the FAA Act, so there would be someone other than the FAA involved. Prior to that time, the FAA was the judge, the jury, and the appellate court. They made all the decisions and they were protecting their own, because every bureaucracy does this--EPA, IRS, FDA and all the rest of them. 
We changed the regulation so the NTSB, then, would be the appellate court for civil penalties, and it has worked very well. The junior Senator from Texas served on the NTSB, and I yield her whatever time she needs.

Mr. INHOFE. I will conclude by saying this in no way impairs the flying safety of the flying public or the pilots. The fact that the average time between the alleged violation and the revocation is 132 days pretty much tells you it is not really an emergency problem in most of these cases. I urge you to join the 625,000 pilots and myself in supporting the Inhofe amendment.

Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, this amendment is one that should not be controversial. I can recall as recently as the Oshkosh meeting this last August where they voted--and we are talking about 250,000 people who were involved--to say this is the No. 1 issue for general aviation in America this entire year and perhaps for several years. 
It has to do with a process that is very similar to something we went through a few years ago. When the FAA exercises its power to invoke an emergency revocation of a license, they can do so for an indefinite period of time and that person will lose that license. In many cases, it may be this person's only way of making a living. 
We have worked for several years to come up with some type of a compromise that will allow an individual to recover his license in the event that it is shown there is nothing dangerous in the way that individual had been flying. It is very unfortunate that in any bureaucracy, there are a few people who will occasionally do something that is not justified. 
I share with you, Mr. President, a case of an individual named Ted Stewart who had been employed by American Airlines as a pilot for more than 12 years and presently serves as a Boeing 767 captain. No complaints had ever been registered against him or his flying. 
In January of 1995, the FAA suspended Mr. Stewart's examining authority. And the reason? Possibly improper issuing of ratings. He complied with the FAA request that he provide log books and/or other reliable records for inspections. On May 16, 1995, an emergency revocation was issued, and he lost his airman certificates. 
June 19, 1995, the National Transportation Safety Board Administrative Law Judge Mullins ruled in Mr. Stewart's favor on all counts. In July of 1995, the full NTSB upheld Judge Mullins' initial decision. All pilot certificates were returned. I point out, this is almost 2 months after the revocation. In January of 1996, he was awarded approximately 60 percent of the money spent to defend himself. The FAA appealed the ruling and it is still pending before the full NTSB. 
What I am getting at is, we have case after case where individuals have lost their ability to make their living for their families when there was not any type of an emergency, there was not any type of a hazard in their performance in terms of their acting as a pilot. 
What we are trying to do is similar to what we did successfully a few years ago under the civil penalties provision, and that is, insert into the process an unbiased source that will be able to participate in the process. In the case of civil penalties, we had the NTSB to hear the cases after they have been ruled on by the FAA. This has been working very well since that time. 
My amendment, as far as it addresses the emergency revocation, addresses the problem prudently by providing an airman--that is the pilot--48 hours after receiving an emergency revocation order the opportunity to request a hearing before the NTSB on the emergency nature of the revocation. This is not on the offense, this is on the emergency nature as to whether or not this would be an emergency. The NTSB then has 48 hours to hear the arguments. Within 5 days of the initial request, the NTSB must decide if a true emergency exists. During this time, the emergency revocation remains in effect. 
In other words, the certificate holder loses use of his certificate for a maximum of 7 days. However, should the NTSB decide an emergency does not exist, then the certificate will be returned to the certificate holder, and he can continue to use it while the FAA pursues their revocation case against him. 
Keep in mind, no emergency exists, nothing is done to impose a hazard on himself or the public. 
If the NTSB decides that an emergency does exist, then emergency revocation remains in effect and the certificate holder cannot use his certificate while the case is adjudicated. That would revert back to the way the law is today. That individual would not be able to fly. So all we are talking about is whether or not there is an emergency nature in this case. 
Please do not misunderstand, in no way do I want to suggest that the FAA should not have emergency revocation powers. I believe it is critical to safety that the FAA can ground unsafe airmen or other certificate holders. However, I also believe that the FAA must be judicious in its use of the extraordinary power. 
The FAA will argue that because emergency certificate actions are only a small percentage of overall certificate actions, there is no reason for this concern. However, review of recent emergency cases clearly demonstrates a pattern by which the FAA uses their emergency powers far more frequently than the circumstances warrant. 
For instance, of the emergency revocation orders issued during fiscal year 1990 through 1997, 50 percent occurred 4 months to 2 years after the violation occurred. In only 4 percent of the cases was the emergency revocation issued within 10 days or less of the actual violation. In fact, the median time lapse between the violation and the emergency order was a little over 4 months. That is 132 days, Mr. President. I suggest to you, how can that be considered an emergency if nothing happened until 132 days after the alleged violation? 
I think clearly at issue is what constitutes an emergency. Simply defined, an emergency is `an unexpected situation or sudden occurrence of a serious and urgent nature that demands immediate action.' Yet, as discussed above, the `urgent nature' of the revocation which `demands immediate action' has more often than not occurred several months previously. 
There are far too many cases where the FAA unfairly uses this necessary power to prematurely revoke certificates when the circumstances do not support such drastic action. 
Mr. President, I have other cases that I could drag out here and talk about, such as the case of Bob Hoover. I have had the privilege of flying in airshows with Bob Hoover for over 30 years. Bob Hoover--probably if you were to ask anyone in the aviation community who the best pilot in America is, they would probably say Bob Hoover. Yet he was the victim of the emergency revocation. We had to go to bat for him, and we had literally thousands of letters from all over America coming to the aid of Bob Hoover because everybody knew there is nothing wrong and nothing of an emergency nature to the revocation of his ability to fly. 
So, Mr. President, I feel that this being the No. 1 concern and issue of general aviation today--it is a sense of fairness issue, something that has worked very well in the case of civil penalties--it is one that I feel should be changed in the FAA regulations. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I don't disagree with some of the statements made here. I have a little different interpretation. I think the Senator from Arizona is correct when he says 2.55 percent of those were of an emergency nature. The numbers equate to about roughly 300 people. 
Now, all too often, we stand down here and say it is such a small number that, if there is an injustice, it doesn't affect that many people. I think that is probably true, but those individuals who are affected, it is a matter of taking away their livelihoods. I disagree with the way the system works. When I look at the average between the time of the alleged offense and the emergency revocation, the average time of those in this last entire year was 132 days. I ask the question, How could there be an emergency nature to these revocations if it takes 132 days before that license is revoked? 
I also comment on the extreme cases that we bring out, such as the Ted Stewarts and the Bob Hoovers. There are many others out there like that. Again, we are not talking about anything that is going to impair the safety of the flying public or the pilots because we are setting aside a process whereby there are a certain number of hours to appeal this to the NTSB. It goes back to using the same argument that was successfully used when we changed the rules having to do with civil penalties. With civil penalties, we argued that you can't have just the FAA be the judge and jury and appellate court; and, of course, it has worked out very well since then. 
While I respectfully disagree with my colleagues from Arizona and Kentucky, I say that there is no interpretation that can be put on my amendment that is going to do anything to make flying more hazardous, or to keep a person from holding a certificate if there is an emergency nature to the revocation. If there is an emergency nature to the revocation, as determined by the NTSB--and that is their job--then, of course, they will keep the certificate and that individual will not have the ability to fly an airplane. 
Let me just make one comment about the NTSB because, while it has been stated that the NTSB and FAA are both opposed to this amendment, I can assure you we talked as recently as yesterday to Dan Campbell, the chief counsel for the NTSB, and he says, no, it is natural that they generally don't want a heavier workload than they currently have. 
But he feels that this is a fair approach, and they don't have an official position against it. 
Does the FAA? Yes. I think any time you are dealing with a bureaucracy--I don't care if it is the IRS, the FDA, the EPA, or the FAA, or any of the rest of them--they don't like to give up anything. This way, they would be giving up part of this appellate process. This is a matter of fairness. 
I recognize that we will not be voting until tomorrow. However, I ask for the yeas and nays.

Mr. President, I have been listening, as I have in years past, to the debate, to the eloquence of those dedicated individuals who feel so strongly about this issue, particularly the leadership of the Senator from Pennsylvania and the things he has said, the things he has stood for, and the Senator from New Hampshire, Senator Smith, and then Dr. Frist. 
I hope people heard what Dr. Frist said because he really is the only one who truly is a professional, who truly understands what this is all about, who can articulate the pain that a small baby during the birth process feels when he is put to death in the very cruel way that this takes place. 
As he described that procedure--the procedure of going under the cranium with scissors and opening it up with no anesthesia and the baby feeling that pain--something occurred to me: that those individuals who want to keep that procedure alive and keep it legal are the same ones who, if you did that to a dog, would be picketing your office. 
I think somehow we have developed, in a perverted way, into a society, many of whom put a greater value on the lives of critters than on human life. I hope we change that today. I yield the floor.

 Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to an exceptional leader in recognition of a remarkable career of service to his country--Lieutenant General Richard A. Burpee, United States Air Force, retired. Dick Burpee has amassed a truly distinguished record, including 35 years of service in the Air Force uniform, that merits special recognition on the occasion of his retirement as chairman of the board of directors of the Retired Officers Association. 
Born and raised in Delton, Michigan, he is now a distinguished citizen of the great State of Oklahoma. He enlisted in the Air Force just after the Korean War in 1953. Subsequently selected for pilot training, he earned his aviator's wings and Second Lieutenant's commission in 1955. 
Over the next decade, Dick served in a variety of flying and staff positions, including assignments as an instructor pilot and as an exchange pilot with the Royal Canadian Armed Forces. In the process, he successfully completed studies leading to the award of a bachelor's degree in economics and a master's degree in public administration. 
During a 1967-68 tour of duty with the 12th Tactical Fighter Wing in Vietnam, he distinguished himself with a record of 336 combat missions in the F-4 fighter and the award of the Silver Star, two Distinguished Flying Crosses, a Bronze Star and fifteen air medals. 
Air Force leaders recognized the talent and potential of this general-to-be and selected him for prestigious positions at Air Force headquarters in Washington, DC, first in the Office of the Director for Operational Test and Evaluation and subsequently as an aide to the Air Force Vice Chief of Staff. 
Following completion of the National War College and selection for promotion to the grade of Colonel, he returned to operational flying duty in a series of leadership positions, ultimately serving as Commander of the Strategic Air Command's (SAC) 509th Bombardment Wing in 1974-1975. 
Exceeding even the Strategic Air Command's high standards of leadership excellence, Dick Burpee was hardly getting started. Following selection to General officer rank, he carved a path of performance and achievement through assignments at Headquarters Strategic Air Command, as Commander of the 19th air division, and in senior plans and operations positions at Air Force headquarters in the Pentagon. From 1983 to 1985, the great State of Oklahoma had the good fortune to get to know Dick Burpee as a particularly outstanding Commander of the Oklahoma City Air Logistics Center. 
Oklahomans were not alone in recognizing his talents, as he was subsequently promoted to three-star rank and assigned as Director for Operations for the Pentagon's Joint Staff--the highest ranking operations staff officer of our country's Armed Forces. 
Finally, in 1988, he was appointed to command the Strategic Air Command's prestigious 15th Air Force, a position he held until his retirement from active military service in 1990. 
In addition to the impressive combat record I have already mentioned, I would note that General Burpee's military files reflect an outstanding total of 11,000 flying hours as well as the award of the Defense Distinguished Service Medal, two Distinguished Service Medals, and the Legion of Merit. A true warrior and leader, indeed. 
Dick Burpee, however, is not a person who considers even 35 years of arduous service a full working career. Following his retirement, he started a successful consulting business in management and marketing with aerospace industries and government. Since relocating to 
Oklahoma City in 1991, he has served as vice president for development and vice president of administration at the University of Central Oklahoma, sits on the board of directors of the United Bank in Oklahoma City, and has been deeply involved with the Oklahoma City Chamber of Commerce. Elected to the board of directors of the Retired Officers Association (TROA) in 1992, he was unanimously selected as TROA's chairman of the board in 1996, a position from which he is now retiring. 
Through his stewardship, the Retired Officers Association continues to play a vital role as a staunch advocate of legislative initiatives to maintain readiness and improve the quality of life for all members of the uniformed service community--active, reserve and retired, plus their families and survivors. 
I won't describe all of his accomplishments, but will briefly touch on some highlights to illustrate his involvement and concern for military people. As chairman, he has championed the fight for health care equity for retirees of the uniformed services, whose access to the military health care system has been severely curtailed by base closures, downsizing, and shrinking military medical budgets. His persistent and well-reasoned proposals have translated into successful legislative initiatives aimed at expanding Medicare-eligible retirees' access to military facilities and allowing them to enroll in the federal employees health benefits program. He also has been one of the most vocal advocates for ending the practice of capping annual pay raises for active and reserve personnel below those enjoyed by the average American. Happily, those efforts are now bearing fruit in the form of full-comparability raises for the troops in 1999 and, hopefully, from 2000 on. 
Taken together, these comprise two of the most important institutional inducements to help reverse declining career retention statistics in all services. 
In forcefully articulating the urgency of honoring long-standing health care and retirement commitments to those who have already served and by championing improved quality-of-life initiatives for those now serving, Dick Burpee has significantly raised Congress' sensitivity to these important retention and readiness issues. 
Perhaps most importantly, Dick Burpee has distinguished himself and TROA from other, often strident, critics by consistently offering cogent, well-researched plans that outline workable legislative solutions to these complex problems. 
My closing observation, with which I am sure you will all agree, is that General Dick Burpee has been, in every sense of the word, a leader in the military, TROA and the entire retired community. Our very best wishes go with him for long life, well-earned happiness, and continued success in service to his Nation and the uniformed servicemembers whom he has so admirably led. 
As a former soldier myself, who entered military service at about the same time he did, I offer General Burpee a grateful and heartfelt salute.

Mr. INHOFE. Thank you, Mr. President. 
I regret that we are on such a tight constraint, because I think this is the most significant issue this Senate will be addressing certainly this year. We are talking about the lives of American citizens. 
As one who is from Oklahoma and can see what type of terrorist devastation can take place, and realizing that the devastation in Oklahoma was one-thousandth of the power of the smallest nuclear warhead known, it is a very scary thing. 
I believe right now--I don't think there is a Senator here who doesn't believe this--that there could very well be a missile headed our direction as we speak. It is not a matter of a rogue nation learning how to make missiles to deliver the weapons of mass destruction that we know they have. It is a matter of just getting that technology and those systems from a country that already does. China is such a country. 
China fully has missiles that can reach Washington, DC, from any place in the world. We have no way in the world of knocking them down. We know that China is trading technology systems with countries like Iran--countries that would not hesitate to use missiles against us. 
I wish I were speaking last, because there are going to be some things said about the exorbitant costs of such a system. We can complete a system to protect us against a limited missile attack for about $4 billion. In the case of our AEGIS ship system, we have 22 AEGIS ships that have the capability of knocking down a missile, but not an ICBM. We have a $50 billion investment in that system, and for only $4 billion more we could have that system to protect Americans. 
I hope that people will give consideration to this resolution. I think it is the most significant resolution we will be considering this year.

Mr. INHOFE. I thank the Senator for that clarification. 
A statement that was made by the Senator from Vermont was that, if you go to parts of the world where you can see the damage inflicted by these, you perhaps will feel differently. I suggest to the Senator, I have been there, and I remember the problems we had in Nicaragua and Honduras. There is nothing that is more repugnant, nothing that is sadder than seeing the effect of landmines on individuals. However, what we are talking about now is many of those landmines were not U.S. landmines. Those were landmines that were made in other parts of the world. We are talking about self-destructing landmines, self-disarming landmines, and landmines that, in the opinion of our military leaders, are necessary to save the lives of Americans. 
As far as the alternatives, I hope that we are going to be able to come up with alternatives to landmines, even smart landmines. I will be the first one, when that time comes, to stand here on the floor of the Senate and change our policy so that we can more accurately use and effectively use these landmines. However, we can always change the law when that time comes. 
In addition, the statement that I read was endorsed by every member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and every one of the unified combatant commanders, which was: 
Self-destructing landmines are particularly important to the protection of early entry and light forces which must be prepared to fight outnumbered during the initial stages of deployment. The lives of our sons and daughters should be given the highest priority when deciding whether or not to ban unilaterally the use of destructive APLs. 
I think some of the same language was used by our Commander in Chief when the President said, it was a year ago this month I believe, Mr. President, he said: 
As Commander in Chief, I will not send our soldiers to defend the freedom of our people and the freedom of others without doing everything we can to make them as secure as possible. There is a line that I simply cannot cross and that line is the safety and security of our men and women in uniform.

I respond to the Senator from Arizona, at the very beginning when we opened our remarks, I said the language the Senator from Vermont put in this appropriations bill is left intact, but this one proviso is there. When we try to use the argument you are not going to be able to get the Joint Chiefs and the CINCs to agree, if they don't agree, I don't want to invoke this. 
I will say, yes, that is the intent and the letter of this amendment. It is very simple, and I can't imagine anyone will want to go on record saying that we want to stop the use of any kind of landmines if it is not in the best interest of our fighting troops over there as certified by the Joint Chiefs and the CINCs.

Mr. INHOFE. I thank the Senator from Arizona. 
I would like to comment on a couple of other things. In addition to the letter that was sent by the Joint Chiefs, here is a letter that was sent to the President last July by 24 of the Nation's most distinguished retired four-star ground combatant commanders, including a former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, a former supreme allied commander, Secretary of State, six former combatants of the Marine Corps, two former Chiefs of Staff of the Army, two recipients of the Congressional Medal of Honor and four service Vice Chiefs of Staff. 
This is what they said. A month ago this letter was received by the President:  
Studies suggest that U.S. allied casualties may be increased by as much as 35 percent if self-destructing mines are unavailable, particularly in the halting phase-- 
The halting phase, we are talking about should the North Koreans come down south of the DMZ, we would have a phase where we would not be as prepared. 
They said: 
--particularly in the halting phase of operations against aggressors. Such a cost is especially unsupportable since the type of mines utilized by U.S. forces and the manner in which they are employed by those forces do not contribute to the humanitarian problem that impels diplomatic and legislative initiatives to ban APLs. 
I find it difficult right now in light of what happened this last week, in terms of the missiles that were launched from North Korea and the accuracy of those missiles with two phases, that we can question whether or not there is a threat out there. 
These are the words that came from 24 of the Nation's most distinguished retired four-star ground combatant officers. 
They went on to say: 
Unfortunately, a ban on future deployment of APLs will in no way diminish the danger imposed by tens of millions of dumb landmines that have been irresponsibly sown where they inflict terror and devastation on civilian populations. Only the United States military and those of other law-abiding nations will be denied a means through the use of marked or monitored mine fields of reducing the costs and increasing the probability of victory in future conflicts.

Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, more recently, 16 of those generals have written a powerful open letter to the Senate opposing Senator Leahy's effort to legislate U.S. compliance with the Ottawa Treaty. They said in part: 
In our experience as former senior military commanders of American ground forces, such a decision would likely translate into the needless and unjustifiable death of many of this country's combat personnel and possibly jeopardize our forces' ability to prevail on the battlefield.

Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, my concern here is that those individuals who are concerned--genuinely concerned--about the problems that exist over there are concerned about damage that is inflicted by these landmines, and certainly I am one of these individuals, are also concerned about the saving of American lives. We certainly should not contemplate doing so unless the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the unified combatant commanders formally change their minds and agree such a step can be taken without jeopardizing the U.S. forces. 
I also have written a letter to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Shelton. This is just in the last few days. I have a letter back from General Shelton in which he talks about his opinion. In his response he said: 
In your third question, you noted General Norman Schwarzkopf, who has been widely portrayed as a supporter of a complete ban on antipersonnel landmines, has been quoted in an interview with the Baltimore Sun as saying, `I favor a ban on the dumb ones. Those are the ones that are causing humanitarian problems. I think the smart ones are a military capability we can use.' 
Further quoting General Shelton, he said: 
My view again is that our smart mixed ATAV munitions are critical to our efforts to protect our men and women in the field.

Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, this is very simple. It is not a complicated thing to deal with. It simply says that we take the language that is supported and has been put in by the distinguished Senator from Vermont and add--I will read it one more time, these words-- 
This subsection shall not apply unless the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the unified combatant commanders certify in writing to the Committee on Armed Services of the Senate and the Committee on National Security of the House of Representatives that the signing of the Convention is consistent with the combat requirements and safety of the armed forces of the United States. 
So it is a very straightforward and simple amendment. Quite frankly, I want to have the input of the military when these decisions are made. 
Mr. LEAHY addressed the Chair.

Mr. INHOFE. I thank the Senator from Texas for yielding the time. It is very precious time. There isn't nearly time to get into the seriousness of this issue. The Senator from Alabama is exactly right, there is no issue before this body that is more significant than this particular issue. 
We have stood here and debated this at least once a month since November of 1995. If I could criticize the Senator from Texas, I would say this isn't strong enough. But I know she knows it is not strong enough either. We should have a date. We should be out of there. And it isn't being hardhearted, it isn't being uncompassionate. 
This is something where the times are different now than they were back in 1995. If you just look at a very recent development, the Rumsfeld report came out. And if you will remember, the national intelligence estimate that came out in 1995, that said we would have a good 3 years' warning, in 3 years, to participate in preparing for a national missile defense system. Now the Rumsfeld report has come out and said that isn't true at all, that we are out of time, we are naked--if we started today to deploy a system and put it into effect, we would not be able to do it. 
What has that got to do with Bosnia? It is very simple, because in Bosnia right now they are using up our military assets to the extent that we are not able to carry out the minimum expectations of the American people, which would be to defend America on two regional fronts. 
If you do not believe this, go to the 21st TACOM in Germany. They are responsible for the ground support, anything that will happen in that theater. That theater includes Iraq. That means that if something should happen, we should have to surgically strike Iraq--I do not think there is a person in America who does not believe that is a possibility--we would eventually have to go in on the ground and clean it up. 
How do you do that? If you go to the 21st TACOM in Germany, they will say we are right now over 100 percent capacity in just supporting Bosnia. We have M-915 trucks that have a million miles on them right now trying to carry the support over there and support Bosnia on the ground. Until we are able to get that out, we are not going to be able to adequately meet the defense needs. 
I hope that you read, Mr. President, just in this morning's Inside the Pentagon: `The Navy's ability to retain its carrier aviators has hit its lowest historical annual rate. . . .'

Mr. INHOFE. I will wrap up real quickly. I think the point is here in today's report. We talk about the fact that only 27 eligible carrier pilots had applied for the ACP agreements. The minimum expectation of the Navy was 82. That means that approximately one-third are re-upping for this particular duty. 
It costs $6 million to put a new pilot in the seat of an F-16. We are at the lowest retention rate in the history of America. And if you look at the exits surveys, they will say it is not because of pay, it is because of the type of operation they are having to do to support Bosnia. And they are unable to carry out the red flag training and all the serious training that would be necessary should we have to send them into combat. 
So I do support this. I would like a much stronger amendment than this, but I would certainly support--this is the best thing out there.

Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I rise in support of the efforts that have been brought to the floor by the Senator from Kansas. I would like to make a few comments and observations about tax cuts and some misconceptions. I was somewhat distressed at the beginning of this administration when a statement was made by Laura Tyson, who was the chief financial advisor at that time. She said--and this is almost a direct quote--that there is no relationship between the level of taxation that a country pays and its economic activity. If you would carry that to its logical conclusion, you would say you could tax somebody by 100 percent and they are going to be just as motivated to work hard and to contribute to the economy and take risks and to hire people as if they had no tax at all. As we know, history has shown us that this is not true. 
One of the interesting things that is so overlooked by many of the liberals nowadays is that for every 1 percent increase in economic activity, it produces new income of approximately $24 billion. Three times in this century we have had administrations that have had massive tax cuts, and each time this has happened we have actually increased the revenue. What I am hoping we will get to is a discussion and a debate along the lines that you can actually increase revenue by reducing taxes. History has shown us that, in fact, this is true. The first time this happened was in the 1920s, during the Warren Harding and Calvin Coolidge administrations. They had consecutive tax cuts, reducing the top tax rate from 73 percent to 25 percent. The lower rates of taxation helped expand the economy dramatically. In fact, between 1921 and 1929, in spite of--or maybe because of--dramatic reductions in personal income tax rates, revenues increased from $719 million in 1921 to $1.16 billion in 1928, an increase of more than 60 percent. Now, over a 10-year period, that would have been about a doubling of the tax revenues that came as a result of reducing tax rates. 
Then in the 1960s, along came the Kennedy administration. Of course, when you hear some of the things that President Kennedy said at the time that didn't sound that prophetic, they turned out to be true. At that time, he said we needed to have more revenues and the best way is to reduce our tax rates and expand the economy. Again, going back to the assumption that has been proven over and over again that your tax revenues increase with certain types of marginal tax rate reductions, in the 1960s, President Kennedy initiated a series of tax cuts where he took the top income tax rate and reduced it from 91 percent to 70 percent. These cuts, in part, helped increase the growth by some 42 percent between 1961 and 1968. So again, you have a very similar type of growth that we experienced back in the 1920s. 
Then in 1980, we remember so well Ronald Reagan coming along and the criticisms that he has had. At that time, he was working with a Congress that was not that friendly--at least a House that wasn't that friendly. He was able to probably make the most dramatic reductions in the tax rates than at any period during any administration in this country's history, knocking the top tax rates from 70 percent in 1980 down to 28 percent by 1988. 
The results of this were very interesting in that if you look at total revenues raised to run this country in 1980, it was $517 billion. By 1990, that figure was increased to $1.3 trillion. So revenues doubled during that period of time that he reduced the tax rates. As far as the revenues that were generated from the marginal rates, or from income tax, that went from $244 billion in 1980 to $466 billion in 1990. So you have almost a doubling in that case, also. 
So I think those people who are saying that we don't want to reduce taxes are saying we don't want to reduce the revenues. We have need for more revenues when, in fact, some of the tax reductions that we will be talking about could have the opposite effect. I can remember in Ronald Reagan's speech--one of the speeches he made called `A Rendezvous With Destiny' in the sixties, it was prophetic. He said, `There is nothing closer to immortality on the face of this Earth than a Government agency once formed.' I think this is one of the problems we are dealing with now, in that it is so difficult to cut down the size of Government. 
Sometimes it is necessary to reduce taxes in order to overcome that temptation to spend the money that is out there. We know the political reality of that. By the way, when many of the Democrats--liberals--were saying, `Look at how the deficits increased during the Reagan administration,' yes, that is true, they did, but that was not as a result of reducing taxes; that was a result of increased spending. I think that, in retrospect, the President should have adopted a policy of issuing more vetoes, and I don't think we would have had the deficits that we had. 
The bottom line is that we are not an undertaxed Nation. We are a Nation that needs to reduce taxes. This is an opportunity to do it. I can't imagine that in this day and age when we have the projected, huge surpluses that are out there, we would consider anything less than making major tax reductions. The tax reduction that has been promoted on the floor by the various speakers regarding the marriage penalty is certainly one that is justified. I would like to see, in addition, some marginal rate reductions. I hope we will be able to do that before this debate is all over. 
Lastly, we have come so dangerously close to what has been stated in history. People have observed this country. When Alexis de Tocqueville came here, he came to study the penal system and to write about that. After he saw the great wealth in this Nation and the freedoms, he wrote a book about the wealth. In the last paragraph, he said that once the people of this country find that they can vote themselves money out of the public trust, the system will fail. I think we have come dangerously close to that. This is the time to reduce taxes and allow individuals to have more control of the money they earn. 
I yield the floor.

 Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, today I introduce legislation to reauthorize the National Environment Education Act. I am joined by my colleagues Senators Faircloth, Lugar, Kerry, Baucus, Lautenberg, Wyden, Graham, Jeffords, and Domenici. 
Over the last few years environmental education has been criticized for being one-sided and heavy-handed. People have accused environmental advocates of trying to brainwash children and of pushing an environmental agenda that is not supported by the facts or by science. They also accuse the Federal government of setting one curriculum standard and forcing all schools to subscribe to their views. This is not how these two environmental education programs have worked, and I have taken specific steps to ensure that they never work this way. 
This legislation accomplishes two important functions. First, it cleans up the current law to make the programs run more efficiently. And second, it places two very important safeguards in the program to ensure its integrity in the future. 
I have placed in this bill language to ensure that the EPA programs are `balanced and scientifically sound.' It is important that environmental education is presented in an unbiased and balanced manner. The personal values and prejudices of the educators should not be instilled in our children. Instead we must teach them to think for themselves after they have been presented with all of the facts and information. Environmental ideas must be grounded in sound science and not emotional bias. While these programs have not been guilty of this in the past, this is an important safeguard to protect the future of environmental education. 
Second, I have included language which prohibits any of the funds to be used for lobbying efforts. While these programs have not used the grant process to lobby the government, there are other programs which have been accused of this and this language will ensure that this program never becomes a vehicle for the executive branch to lobby Congress. 
This is an important piece of legislation, and I hope both the Senate and the House can act quickly to reauthorize these programs.

 Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, today I introduce legislation to amend the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act. I am introducing this legislation as the chairman of the subcommittee with jurisdiction over FEMA, the Clean Air, Wetlands, Private Property, and Nuclear Safety Subcommittee. I am joined today by my ranking member, Senator Graham, who has worked closely with me in drafting this legislation. It is our intention to move swiftly through the committee process with the prospect of floor action this fall. 
This bill has two main titles. The first authorizes the Predisaster Hazard Mitigation Program. This program helps communities plan for disasters before they strike which will reduce the post hazard costs associated with disasters. The second title provides a number of streamlining and cost reduction measures which will help bring into line the funds Congress ends up appropriating through supplemental budgets every time we have a major disaster. 
I would like to spend a few minutes discussing two key provisions in the Predisaster Mitigation Program that I believe are very important. They relate to the Project Impact Program which was thoroughly discussed in our recent Subcommittee hearing. 
Project Impact is an innovative program where FEMA is working with local communities to help them prepare for disasters. It began last year with seven pilots and was expanded this year to include one Project Impact community in every State. 
Our Bill authorizes funding for the program for five years, with a sunset at the end of the five years. Based on the costs of the first 50 pilots, the funds authorized will pay for an additional 300 communities. I expect FEMA to work on how best to devolve this program to the local communities over the next five years. If this program is going to be successful then it must evolve into a State and locally run program. 
Some may question why a sunset for a program like this is necessary, so let me explain. In the legislation we require the GAO to conduct a study of the program and report back to the Congress in three years. We also ask FEMA to report back on the success of the program. It is my intent that these reports make specific recommendations for the next phase of Project Impact. The House legislation only authorizes Project Impact for three years, I felt it was necessary to authorize the program for five years which will give Congress plenty of time to authorize the next phase of Project Impact.

Following that vote, a second vote will occur on adoption of the IRS conference report. 
Following those two back-to-back votes, it will be the leader's intention to begin the Agriculture Export Relief Act or sanctions legislation. Hopefully, that bill will be considered under a brief time agreement of 2 hours. 
Following that legislation, it is expected that the Senate will begin consideration of the higher education bill under the consent agreement of June 25, 1998. Therefore, several votes will occur during today's session of the Senate, with the first two votes occurring back to back at 10 a.m.

Mr. INHOFE. First of all, there is not a person in this Chamber who has a stronger record for supporting defense than I do--not one Senator on the Democrat side or the Republican side has a stronger record in support of defense. 
No. 2, those individuals who are speaking against it, I wish we had a chance last night, we had a little bit longer for debate. This has nothing to do with base closures, because I approve of the BRAC process. Last night, I went into detail as to why I think that is the right process to use. 
No. 3, the Senator from Arizona talked about `measuring" with civilian employees. That is current law. We are not changing that. That is already in the law. That law, by the way, was put on the books by the current Secretary of Defense when he was then in the U.S. Senate. 
So, I only say that we have covered all these bases. It is something that is significant. Yes, we do have excess infrastructure, but when we heard Secretary Peters and General Ryan say they didn't care what Congress said, they are going to go ahead and close the bases without going to Congress, I decided we had to do something to stop that. That is all this does--it makes them come to us instead of doing it without our consent or knowledge or without the BRAC process. 
I yield the remaining time to the Senator from North Dakota.

Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I agree with the very letter of what the Senator from Michigan said. He is right. It does make it more difficult for the Secretary of Defense to close the realigned bases without coming to Congress or without going through the BRAC process. 
I have to say, respectfully, to my colleague from Virginia that the letter he read from was referring to a previous version--a much stronger bill. We have moderated this language quite a bit. I also say that is the same individual that put this into law 20 years ago himself. 
Third, this doesn't stop the 2001 BRAC process. It does not stop. We can still do it. It just says we don't need to decide in this bill whether or not we are going to have a 2001, and it could just as well be done next year. 
Lastly, the comment that was made that this would draw a veto, this is used every year. I have very serious doubts that the President of the United States, on the defense authorization bill, is going to veto it on the basis of an amendment that is supported by both the majority leader, Trent Lott, and the minority leader, Tom Daschle. 
I yield the remainder of my time.

I too have, as a member of the Armed Services Committee, looked at the issue of our vulnerability to missile attack and concluded--as has my friend from Arizona--that it is one of the most serious shortcomings we have in our entire military posture. 
I too have concluded that there is nothing we could do that would be faster or more effective than the AEGIS Option in terms of defending our people against the sorts of threats we now read about practically every day--from the thirteen ICBMs China has pointed at our cities, to the possibility of an accidental Russian missile launch, to the Indian, Pakistani, Iranian and North Korean missile programs, to Saddam Hussein's VX never gas-laden missiles and so on.

Mr. INHOFE. I would like to make a comment as to the genesis of this. I think there might be some misunderstanding. First of all, we did have a vote back in 1995. That was the resolution of disapproval. And I suggest that we only lost that by three votes. And at that time there was a guarantee it was going to be a 12-month operation, it would not exceed $1.2 billion, all of these things. So predicated on that, the vote took place. 
Now we are over there, and, quite frankly, I would have preferred to have an amendment that would require a vote periodically, every 3 months or every 6 months, on approval of leaving them there, because I think that would be much stronger. I think we need to be on record. 
But all the Senator is doing is just--he is not saying this is going to be a resolution of disapproval or approval that we are voting on; it is just a vote.

Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I was listening to the debate when the distinguished Senator from Alabama was relating to us his experiences in basic training, and I was thinking of my experiences in basic training. Quite frankly, I think I would have been for integration of the sexes when I was in basic training, but I am looking at it differently now than I did at that time. 
I would like to respond to something that the Senator from Michigan said. I have so much respect for him, but I disagree with him in this respect. As chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Subcommittee on Readiness, I spend a lot of time talking to officers in the field, talking to enlisted people in the field, as does the ranking member, the Senator from Virginia. I find a discrepancy in what you hear in the field and what you hear from the chiefs. 
I am not saying this critically of the current chiefs, but I think the chiefs have always reflected the philosophy of the President. The President is the Commander in Chief. He is the guy responsible for their careers. So we hear different things from the chiefs here in Washington than I hear when I go out to the National Training Center, or to 29 Palms, or Fort Bragg, or to Camp Lejeune. They are very emphatic and supportive of that portion of the recommendations of the Kassebaum-Baker report having to do with housing. 
Thirdly, three different Members, while I have been sitting here, have gone into detail as to the makeup of the committee that we have asked for from our committee, and it is a very distinguished panel. But I think that we have kind of lost sight of the fact that the committee that we refer to as the Kassebaum-Baker committee was actually appointed under the supervision of Secretary of Defense William Cohen. He put together a committee and, frankly, I probably would not have put together the same committee. I would want it stacked a little bit the other way. Real briefly, I will go over the committee. 
They are: Richard Allen, retired vice admiral of the U.S. Navy; Robert Forman, retired lieutenant general, U.S. Army; Marcelite Harris, major general, retired, from the Air Force; Condoleezza Rice, a Stanford professor; Don Gardner, a retired major general from the Marine Corps; Deval Patrick, who was the Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights, appointed by President Clinton. I mean, if there is anybody who would have a bias toward the administration, it would be this individual. Ginger Lee Simpson, retired U.S. Navy, and others. 
I suggest to my fellow Senators that this committee of 11 had a majority of women. On this committee of 11, 5 of them were either retired generals or admirals. 
I would hold up this committee to be certainly comparable to the committee that had been discussed on this floor. I think any time you have a committee like this reaching a unanimous decision--all of these retired women from all the services, along with the former Assistant Attorney General in charge of civil rights appointed by President Clinton--and it was unanimous; they all agreed. I think when you have this unanimity, I can't imagine that any other committee is going to come up with a different result. 
What would happen is, it would delay the implementation of this by a year. If it is good now, and it is good a year from now, I think one year should make a tremendous difference in the morale of the services, which is certainly suffering at this time.

Mr. INHOFE. I think I probably will voluntarily cut this down. It depends on who shows up and wants to be heard. 
Mr. President, as I have said in response to the comment by the Senator from Iowa, this is not really a Republican amendment. We have, certainly, Senator Daschle, Senator Dorgan, Senator Cleland, Senator Conrad, and many Democrats who are supporting this amendment. 
The need for this amendment came up when several comments were made by members of the administration, primarily Acting Secretary Peters of the Air Force, making statements that, `We don't care whether or not we are authorized to have further BRAC rounds, we are going to go ahead and close bases anyway.' 
Later in this discussion, I will actually offer some of the quotes that were made. Right now, I will merely explain what this amendment does. It does essentially five things. 
First of all, the current language, in order for a military facility to be closed without Congress' consent, has a threshold of 300 civilian employees. Let me stress, that is civilian employees, not military employees. This bill will reduce that number to 225. 
Now, my original bill would have reduced it to 150. I still like that better. However, I was willing to accommodate the concerns of several Democrats and other people who wanted to have 225. The effect of this would mean that if they tried to close a military base, they could not do it without our consent unless that base had more than 225 civilian employees. 
No. 2, in the event that realignment became the desire of the services--Department of Defense--that they could not do it if there were as many as 750 civilian positions or 40 percent of the total civilians authorized to be employed. 
The current language has a threshold of 1,000 civilian employees at 50 percent of the total civilians authorized to be employed. So this again is dropping that down a modest amount, by approximately 25 percent. 
No. 3, we clarify the definition of closure. The reason we feel this is necessary is that there have been statements made like, `We will just transfer it to a caretaker status, or a state of inaction or abandonment.' What we are doing is expanding the definition in the law of closure to include these statements, so that someone cannot do this and circumvent the closure requirements by saying we are not closing, we are just abandoning or putting it into a state of inaction. 
On this, I pause at this point and say, if you stop and think about every community in America that might have some type of a facility, they would not know, they would not be prepared in advance as to whether or not somebody is going to try to make it inactive or put it into caretaker status. We want to be straightforward and say if you are going to close it, you are going to close it--using those terms. 
No. 4, we will add a provision that requires a waiting period of 4 years after a realignment before a base could be closed, if that realignment drops the civilian workforce below the new threshold of 225 civilians. Our concern here is that this can be circumvented and we could be left out of the loop as the U.S. Senate if they were able to take it one step at a time and say, fine, we are going to go ahead and realign, and next week we will come and realign some more and have the effect of closing a base entirely, regardless of the number of employees, if they are willing to do that. This would preclude that. 
Lastly, it is the sense of the Senate that there is no need to reauthorize for the year 2001 in this 1998 authorization bill. There is no reason in the world that we can't have more time to consider this and to see how current law works and maybe address this again in the 1999 authorization bill. It would not make any difference at all; it would still be the year 2001. 
These are essentially the changes in the current law that this amendment would offer. 
With that, I yield the floor.

Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, first of all, I have so much respect for both the Senator from Arizona and the Senators from Michigan and Virginia. I have to say, I am sure the Senator from Arizona would agree that there is no stronger proponent for a strong national defense than I am. We work hard. 
One of the big problems I have is that we need to look at the overall picture. All this talk about base closings is important. I support base closures. I made it very clear that we have time on this. If we do not have base closures until the year 2001, there is no reason to be addressing base closures in this bill. 
Certainly--I also respond to the Senator from Arizona--what he referred to was a sense-of-the-Senate portion of this bill. It says, `Notwithstanding any other provision of the law,' no action would be taken, and no funds appropriated, and so forth, as you read. 
However, if we should authorize another BRAC process, that would have precedence over this and this would not be in effect. 
It is my understanding that the Senator from Washington has a request for a couple, 3 minutes and I would like to yield to him, and then I will respond to the rest of the comments that have been made.

<DOCNO>105-inhofe-ok-14-19980624</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, first of all, let me clarify something. I do support the process. It happens that I was elected to the other body in 1986, and that is when Representative Dick Armey from the State of Texas came out with the whole idea that we have got to close down some of the infrastructure that is no longer needed. We understand that. But we can't do it because of the politics that are there. 
So he devised a system, and that system was devised to take the politics out of it, and it worked. If there were time, I would read the statement he made on the floor of the House of Representatives when he found out he had to do something that was bad for his State of Texas, and he was willing to do it to save the system, the integrity of the system that was designed to take politics out of it. 
Now, as the Senator from Washington said, politics were reinserted, and when that happened I think several of us felt we had to ensure that did not happen again. And so some of the 
people, wisely perhaps, said that, well, we can do that by waiting until after this President is no longer in office, 2001. 
My concern there is I don't know who is going to be the Republican nominee or who is going to be the Democratic nominee or who will ultimately be the next President of the United States. But if that President should be inclined to do so, it would be a tremendous temptation for him to use the same politics that President Clinton used, because if he doesn't do it, he is not using the full force of his office. That is a precedent that has been set. We are trying to stop that now. 
I would like to respond to the distinguished Senator from Michigan. He made the statement about money being saved. I have supported every effort to increase our defense spending. For 15 consecutive years now we have actually reduced defense spending when many people a lot smarter than I am agreed with the statement that I have made when I said that I feel the threat that is facing America is greater today than it was even during the cold war because of the nonpredictability, the unpredictability of the threat that is out there, the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, the fact there are missiles out there right now that can reach all the way to any city in the United States of America. And it has been recently disclosed by some newspapers that there are, in fact, some missiles, some CSS-4 missiles in China that are targeted at the United States. 
Now, I anticipate the President will come back and say, I accomplished the retargeting of these things. However, if you remember the Anthony Lake hearings, we documented the fact that retargeting can take place in as short as 3 minutes. 
So anyway, I would say this as far as money being saved by base closures. It is bleeding right now. We need to have as much money right now in order to try to help our defense system survive. Modernization, force strength, quality of life, all of these we are having very serious problems with. We have the lowest retention rate right now we have had in the history of some of the services, including the Air Force. It costs $6 million to put someone in the seat of an F-16 and yet we are losing the pilots. I heard an unofficial report today it is not a retention of 25 percent. It is now down below 20 percent. That is very serious. 
But let's look at where we can really fund the services. The first thing I would do, if I were responding to the Senator from Michigan, is get us out of Bosnia. Right now, that was supposed to cost us some $1.2 billion. Now it is over $9 billion direct, and I suggest about twice that much money in reality. 
I would also comment that as far as Senator Cohen's statement that this might draw a veto, I find it very difficult to believe that a bill that is supported by the number of Democrats that are supporting this bill, including the minority leader, Tom Daschle, is going to draw a veto. This is a threat that is always there. And I would also comment that Secretary Cohen, when he was Senator Cohen, would have been right up here with me supporting this amendment. And if anyone questions that, I can document that. 
Thirdly, when you talk about the courage to do a BRAC, yes, we need to do it. We have to first protect the integrity of the system. That is what the Senator from Washington is saying, and that is exactly what I want to do. I want to reduce more infrastructure. I made that statement. I have said that we need to do it professionally and it needs to be done out of politics. 
Lastly, when the Senator from Virginia talked about taking politics out of the process, I really think the distinguished Senator from Virginia gave a pretty good argument for my amendment. So I understand that tomorrow we are going to have--my time has expired, but we are going to have 10 minutes equally divided. Senator Dorgan and some other Senators who are not here tonight have asked to have that time, which I will yield to them tomorrow. 
I yield back the remainder of my time and yield the floor.

<TEXT>
Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I had the intention, and still have the intention at some later time, of reintroducing the amendment that is at the desk. 
What it effectively does is address the potential problem and influence that a company called COSCO, the Chinese Ocean Shipping Company, will have on the United States. 
Mr. President, the Chinese Ocean Shipping Company is Communist China's largest shipping group. It has more than doubled the number of ships that our entire U.S. Navy has. This group has been given preferential treatment by this country and other countries for some period of time. It wasn't long ago that they were given the opportunity to have ports at both ends of the Panama Canal, the Ports of Colon and Cristobal, and our country was supportive of that. 
This 25-year lease gives them an abundance of control in the Panama Canal and was to cost $22 million a year. But the deal that was made would be to waive that amount of money, and to waive the labor laws and veto rights over a period of approximately 2 years. 
Other areas where we have given preferential treatment to COSCO fall in the area of taxpayer-guaranteed loans. 
COSCO was the first shipping company owned by Beijing government to receive a U.S. Federal loan guarantee under a 40-year-old Transportation Department program designed to help American shipyards win business. This was a $138 million loan, which constituted 87.5 percent of the cost of the projects to build four container ships in Alabama. The ships were never built. They did not go through. Nonetheless, the permission was given. 
There are many other areas where they have received preferential treatment. Since the 1950s, ships from Communist nations have been forced to give 4 day's notice before they could dock near U.S. military establishments. This was to give the U.S. officials early warning about possible spying and this type of thing. The restriction still applies to countries like Cambodia, Vietnam, Russia, and some of the other former Soviet Republics. But in a deal that was worked out in December of 1996, the United States cut China's wait at a dozen sensitive 
ports from 4 days to 1 day. 
Make sure we understand what we have done here. We have allowed this company to only have to wait 1 day, and all the rest of the Communist nations have to wait 4 days. Cambodia still has to wait 4 days. Vietnam still has to wait 4 days. Russia still has to wait 4 days, but China only 1 day. 
U.S. firms still can't get sole-tenancy leases at Chinese ports, yet COSCO got just such rights last year from Long Beach, CA. What a lease--a vacant U.S. Naval Station with no security check. What they are attempting to do now is to get the rest of that closed operation. 
We are talking about several hundred acres very strategically located. 
It is kind of interesting, since we have been giving such preferential treatment to the Chinese Ocean Shipping Company. Why are we doing this? 
I think it is important to understand that this shipping company is not a part of the private sector. This is owned by the Chinese Government. It is owned specifically by the People's Liberation Army of Communist China. So their interests are not just in mercantile--not just in ships--but also they have military interests. COSCO reports to the Chinese Ministry of Communications, which falls under the State Council, which in turn is led by the Communist Party Politburo member and Premier Li Peng. 
If we are looking at the problems that have come up and surfaced and have caused many of us to be concerned, we might want to remember that back in March of 1996 a COSCO ship, the Empress Phoenix, transported 2,000 illegal AK-47 automatic weapons to be used in street gangs in Los Angeles. It was intended to be sold to the California street gangs, and this has been verified. The corporation was the Norinco Corporation, which is controlled by the People's Liberation Army. Fortunately, the guns were confiscated as a part of an FBI sting operation. 
Mr. President, it is certainly no coincidence that the firm is also the employer of record of Wang Jun, which is the well-known Chinese arms dealer who attended a recent radio address in this country. 
Mr. President, only last week the Washington Times reported that a COSCO ship was on its way to Pakistan. 
Now we are talking about shipping, carrying, nuclear technology and equipment in violation of an international nonproliferation agreement. We are talking about carrying this information, carrying this technology, carrying this nuclear technology to Pakistan from China, a clear violation. 
The COSCO ships have previously been used to transport military and strategic cargoes, including components for ballistic missiles from China and North Korea to such countries as Pakistan, Iran, Iraq, Syria, and just most recently, we learned last week, Libya. 
So I think that we have a great deal of our Nation's security at risk by allowing them--continuing to allow them to have this lease. 
With that in mind, I would again renew my unanimous consent request. I will wait and give adequate time for someone to come in, if there is an objection, but my unanimous consent request would be to set aside the pending business for the immediate consideration of my amendment No. 2405.

Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I would like to enter into a colloquy with my friend, Senator Coverdell, to clarify a situation that was brought to my attention during consideration of the Senator's Drug-Free Neighborhoods amendment to S. 1415. As an original cosponsor of the amendment, I fully support the Senator's efforts to stop the spread of drugs into our communities; however, one provision has the unintended effect of raising serious safety concerns for general aviation pilots. 
Specifically, the amendment permits officers to order an aircraft to land, but does not require any reasonable suspicion of criminal activity. It also could make pilots responsible for paying thousands of dollars to reclaim their aircraft, even if they are totally innocent of any wrongdoing. 
As a pilot for over 40 years, I can assure you that the `order to land' could be a dangerous and traumatic experience for a pilot. In fact, the International Standards, Rules of the Air, published by the International Civil Aviation Organization says `interceptions of civil aircraft are, in all cases, potentially hazardous.' 
As I understand it, the intent of the amendment was to provide additional authority to U.S. law enforcement officers to curtail border drug smuggling, which I am sure all us agree is a laudable goal. However, because of the potential danger and immense burden to general aviation pilots, I have worked with my friends at the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association to develop some relatively minor changes that could be done to take care of general aviation's concerns.

Mr. INHOFE. That's correct. But the Senate included an amendment in this bill that addresses this problem. Under this amendment, for the July 1997 PM2.5 standards, EPA would no longer be required to designate areas regarding their PM2.5 attainment status in July of 1999. 
Instead of the designation schedule currently in the Clean Air Act, this amendment would establish the following requirements for PM2.5 designations: Section 4102 would extend the time for Governors to submit designations for the July 1997 PM2.5 standard until one year after receipt of three years of monitoring data. 
Rather than the two year period normally provided by the Clean Air Act, under section 4102(d) of this amendment, EPA would not be required to promulgate nonattainment, attainment and unclassifiable designations for PM2.5 areas until one year after the Governors are required to submit the designations or until Dec. 31, 2005, whichever date is earlier.

Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, first of all, I thank the senior Senator from Minnesota for his courtesy. We discussed this a few minutes ago and decided it might be better if I go first, because he might want to respond to some things I might say. 
Some statements were made on the floor yesterday concerning my hold that I have on James Hormel to be the Ambassador to Luxembourg. It is true that I do have a hold on Mr. Hormel. 
To clarify what a hold is, it is a courtesy. It is not a procedural matter. It is something that is a courtesy to the leader so he will know there is opposition. 
There very well may be a vote on this individual, but I will oppose his nomination, and I want to stand and tell you why. 
The statement that was made on the floor was made by the senior Senator from Minnesota, Mr. Wellstone. I will read excerpts of it: 
Now, one of my colleagues, and I think it is extremely unfortunate, one of my colleagues has compared Mr. Hormel, a highly qualified public servant and nominee, to Mr. David Duke, who, among other credentials, is a former grand wizard of the Ku Klux Klan. 
He goes on to say: 
I want to say to my colleagues, that given this kind of statement made publicly by a United States Senator, this kind of character assassination, it is more important now than ever that this man, Mr. Hormel, be voted on. 
In defense, really, of the senior Senator from Minnesota, I say that if I had said what he thought I said, he was certainly entitled and justified to make the statements that were made. But I think it is important to know that I did not make those statements in the context that he believed I made them. 
Let me, first of all, say that there probably are not two Members of the U.S. Senate who are further apart philosophically than the senior Senator from Minnesota and myself. I would probably, in my own mind, believe him to be an extreme left-wing radical liberal and he believes me to be an extreme right-wing radical conservative. And I think maybe we are both right. 
But one thing I respect about Senator Wellstone is he is not a hypocrite. He is the same thing everywhere. He honestly, in his heart, believes the role of Government to be something different than I believe it to be. So we have these honest differences of opinion. One of the things I like about this body, the U.S. Senate, is that you can, in a spirit of love, talk about these things. And that is what we are doing right now. 
Let me just real quickly say that I like activists. The Senator from Minnesota is an activist. I am an activist. In fact, this is the commencement season. I quite often give commencement talks. I talk to young people, and I say, `Whatever you are, don't be a mushy middle. Stand for something.' I would far rather, even though I am a conservative, have one of these young people be a radical right-wing--or left-wing--either one--than just be in the mushy middle. 
I quote Henry Ward Beecher now and then. He said, 
I don't like these cold, precise, perfect people. In order not to say wrong, say nothing; in order not to do wrong, do nothing. 
And the Lord had something to say about this, too. He said, 
I know your works. You are neither hot nor cold. Because you are neither hot nor cold, you are lukewarm. And because you are lukewarm, I will spew thee out of my mouth. 
He is saying the same thing I am saying. And I really believe this. And the young kids, they look at us as examples. In fact, when I was in the other body and was first elected, I would take interns down to the intersection of New Jersey and Independence, and I would say as they went across the street, I said, `There are three kinds of Members of Congress. There are extreme liberals, extreme conservatives, and then the mushy middle. And the goal of those in the mushy middle is to die in Washington, DC. And how do you die in Washington, DC? You take a poll, and you make statements that ingratiate yourself.' 
The senior Senator from Minnesota cannot be accused of that, nor can I. Unfortunately, we do have too many appeasers around. 
Hiram Mann said, `No man survives when freedom fails. The best men rot in filthy jails. And those who cry `appease' are hanged by those they try to please.' 
Let me tell you quickly what I did say so that it will be clarified for the Record. 
I made the statement, when I was running for office--and I have been consistent with that--that if I get to the U.S. Senate, where I have the opportunity to participate in the confirmation process, that I will work to keep a nominee from being confirmed if that individual has his own personal agenda and has made statements to the effect that he believes stronger in his personal agenda and will use that office to advance his personal agenda more than he would the American agenda. 
Now, in the case of James Hormel, he is a gay activist. He has made statements in the past, which I will read in a moment, that have led me to believe that his agenda, his personal agenda is above the agenda of the United States. 
And I said the same thing would apply regardless of who the 
individual is. I made the statement that David Duke, if he were nominated, I would oppose him because he has made statements that his militia extremist agenda is more important than the agenda of America. I said in the way of Patricia Ireland, if she were nominated, I would feel the same way if she made statements saying that her feminist agenda was more important to her than the agenda of America. 
And the same thing with one of my closest friends, Ralph Reed. I mean, Ralph Reed, who was the one who built the Christian Coalition, he is one with whom I agree. I agree with what he stands for. I spent the Easter recess in west Africa in the countries of Benin and Nigeria and Cote d'Ivoire talking about Jesus Christ. So I agree with him. However, if he were nominated, and he said, `I want this job so that I can advance my personal agenda over that of America,' I think it would be wrong and I would oppose it. 
So let us just see real quickly. I am going to read a couple things, and then my time will expire, and I think I will be on the record as I want to be. 
During the course of the nomination process--I will read, first of all, the San Francisco Chronicle. This is on October 9 of 1997.  
President Clinton's nomination of James Hormel . . . is the latest sign that he is making good on his post-election promise to reward gays and lesbians for their support, national gay leaders said today . . .' I think it's the result of very hard work behind the scenes of national gay and lesbian organizations that have been pushing and pushing for these appointments to be made'. . . . 
That was Kerry Lobel, the executive director of the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force. 
I would also like to quote someone I think who is familiar to all of us--we hold her in very high esteem--Faith Whittlesey, former U.S. Ambassador to Switzerland. She was talking about this trend of trying to put people with their own personal agendas in the various Embassies. She made this statement. She said: 
The United States is more socially radicalized than any other country in the world on this issue (gay rights). Ambassadorships may no longer be essential foreign policy positions, but they are still symbolically important. Starting with small countries to set a precedent for bigger appointments, what they're trying to do is use the U.S. diplomatic service to open deeply held religious convictions and social mores in other countries. Ambassadorial appointments should not be used for the purposes of social engineering in the countries to which the ambassadors are assigned. 
One of the many statements that had been made previous about James Hormel that led me to the conclusion that he wanted to use this position to advance his agenda was the following statement he made on June 16, 1996. He said: 
I specifically asked to be Ambassador to Norway because, at the time, they were about to pass legislation that would acknowledge same-sex relationships, and they had indicated their reception, their receptivity, to gay men and lesbians. 
I think it is very difficult to put any interpretation on that other than the fact that individual wanted to be ambassador to that country because of pending legislation in that country. 
So, Mr. President, I stand by the statements I have made. I certainly do not want anyone to say that I am comparing two individuals as individual personalities. But I will continue to oppose the confirmation of individuals who are nominated for various positions, if I believe, in my own heart, that that individual is not going to represent the best interests of America and has his own personal agenda in advance of Americans. 
I yield the floor. 
Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.

Mr. INHOFE. I was presiding the other day, and I want to make sure I understood you correctly. You drew a relationship between our tax reductions that we were able to pass last year that we all went home and were so proud of--and we are talking about the child credit, and we are talking about the estate tax changes, relating that to the tax increase under certain assumptions. I would like to have you repeat that for my benefit.

Mr. INHOFE. If you will yield further, I think so often we talk about the fact that 54 percent of the taxes would be paid by people with incomes under $30,000 a year. We forget sometimes to mention that only 3.7 percent of the tax will be borne by those with incomes over $115,000, which I think is very significant.  
I ask you this question since you represent the fine State of Missouri and I represent your neighboring State of Oklahoma. I had an experience and I just want to see if Missouri is anything like Oklahoma. 
Over the last 10 days, I have had 3 days of townhall meetings throughout the State. As you know, I am active in aviation. I have all these townhall meetings at airports. With 20 meetings in 3 days--that was kind of a record for me, because normally I do five a day--not one time in one townhall meeting, in Watonga, OK, in Oklahoma City, in Miami, OK, right up on your border, or anyplace in Oklahoma, did anyone bring up the subject of the tobacco bill. 
I brought it up in about half those meetings just because nobody had asked the question about this tobacco bill. Then when I talked to them about it, they said they had read about it and they said, `We're opposed to it.' 
In Oklahoma, in those meetings, there was not one hand that went up when I asked, `Is there anyone here who is in support of this tobacco tax increase in this tobacco bill?' Not one. 
Is there something unusual about Oklahoma, or could it be that this is really a beltway issue? Have you tested your people in Missouri on this?

Mr. INHOFE. That is interesting. 
Let me ask just one more question, if I might, because I haven't heard it in this debate actually coming up. I had an experience. Over the Easter recess, I went on a missionary trip over to west Africa to Togo, Nigeria, Benin, and that area. I thought it was the appropriate thing to do, to go over and talk about Jesus on the Easter break. 
The international publications I saw when I changed planes in Paris going down over the Sahara Desert and then again coming out of the Middle East, had articles--this is, what, 2 weeks ago, 3 weeks ago--articles on what a great boom our tobacco bill in this country is going to do for their tobacco industries. They were referring to both legal and illegal, I suspect. But has anybody looked at the effect that this would have on the economies of those areas where they would be direct beneficiaries of what we do here if this thing should pass?

Lastly, I just ask if your office has received the same thing our office has. We count letters when they come in and we read these letters from people who have picked up notions on this thing. And they are running right now in Oklahoma to my office--this is the district offices in Oklahoma as well as the office here--about 10 to 1 against this massive takeover by the Federal Government. And one of the major concerns they say is, `What's next?' You know, it is tobacco today. Then alcohol? Then fatty foods? Or what is going to be next?

Before I do that, let me commend the junior Senator from Missouri. He is right on target. I would like to share with him that in the last 2 weeks I had over 20 town hall meetings in the State of Oklahoma. In not one meeting did anyone bring up this thing and initiate the discussion. I think this is really a beltway issue. When I brought it up and told them about the massive tax increase--the largest single tax increase, with the stroke of one pen that this results in--they were all very, very much against it. I think some people will try to use this as somehow a way to stop children from smoking when, in fact, it would not stop children from smoking.

Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I rise today to share with you and with my colleagues something I think is quite significant that is taking place, and also to correct some of the things that I have said that I found to be untrue. 
I was on the floor yesterday introducing an amendment to the 1999 Senate defense authorization bill. In this authorization bill, I have an amendment that would stop the transfer of land in California at Long Beach to the COSCO, which is the Chinese Ocean Shipping Company. I would like to share why this is an important amendment. 
I don't criticize any of my fellow Senators. But when I started talking about this yesterday, and I moved to set aside the Feinstein amendment in order to consider my amendment to stop the transfer of land to COSCO out in California, there was objection to that unanimous consent request. In a way, I think that is good because it gives me an opportunity to go into a lot more detail and to talk on some talk radio shows to alert America as to the seriousness of something that is happening out there. 
I would like to start off by saying, however, that when I talked on the floor about the fact that President Clinton signed a waiver back in 1996, and then another waiver in 1998 that allowed the transfer of technology to the Chinese, this was something that I thought was done in secret. I found out just this morning that it was not done in secret. He signed a waiver. He apparently did not disobey any law or violate any law in so doing. However, since I am a member of both the Intelligence Committee and the Senate Armed Services Committee, and I was not aware that he signed the waiver in 1996 or 1998, and not one of my colleagues who I have talked to was aware of it, I reasonably assumed that it was done in secret. 
To kind of give you the sequence in which this happened, I will tell you, Mr. President, that in June of 1989 we all saw what happened on the Tiananmen Square. At that time, as a result of the Tiananmen Square massacre, our country imposed some sanctions banning U.S. trade in dual-use technology. 
The President retains the power to grant waivers on a case-by-case basis. It seems to me that this President has an obsession in granting waivers and preferential treatment to China. In a minute I am going to read an article from this morning's New York Times that might shed a little light as to why the President was doing this. Let me finish with this sequence of events. 
From 1990 to 1995, there were some waivers given for certain technologies. In 1995, President Clinton offered a waiver for commercial satellites, allowing U.S. satellites to be launched on Chinese rockets. The Loral Corporation--maybe it was a coincidence--which was the single largest contributor to the Democratic National Committee in two Presidential elections, in 1992 and 1996, took advantage of this waiver. So we had our commercial satellites placed on rockets that were designed and manufactured by the Chinese government. Anyway, one of these rockets went off, and there was an explosion in 1996, and they went in to investigate as to why the explosion took place. In 1998, just 2 months ago, in February of this year, the President granted another waiver allowing the transfer of information to China which gave them more reliability and accuracy in their missiles. 
Now, I would like to put this in a context that is easier to understand for a lot of people who are not involved in these issues. I am from the State of Oklahoma. It is a known fact--there is nothing classified about it--that both China and Russia have missiles that can reach the United States from anyplace in China or Russia. Specifically, in the case of China, they have their CS-4 missile that has a range of 8,000 kilometers, and by going the polar route, it will reach anyplace in the continental United States or any part of the United States. So this missile will do it. 
However, with the technology the Chinese had before the President allowed our technology to go over there and give them more accuracy, their missile could hit my State of Oklahoma but it could not pinpoint any particular city like Oklahoma City or Tulsa or Fort Sill or any of our military establishments. With this technology, it gives them the accuracy to do that. So that is what the President did. I am very concerned about this obsession that the President has to share everything that we have with the Chinese. 
Let's keep in mind we are talking about the China Ocean Shipping Company. It is not just owned by the Chinese. It is owned and run by the Communist Chinese military. It was only a week ago Monday that the Washington Times came out and disclosed the content of a CIA report. This report stated that there were some 18 CS-4 missiles that China had that were targeted at various places around the world, and 13 of those missiles are targeted at cities, major cities in the United States of America. 
Now, when you get a little bit concerned about the President giving preferential treatment to China with all these waivers, allowing them to have our technology so they can pinpoint their targets, and then we find out, as I think most of us knew anyway, that there are rockets in China, ICBMs aimed at major cities in the United States of America, it is very, very distressing. 
This morning in the New York Times this article on the front page right here says, `Democrat Fund-Raiser Said to Name China Tie.' This is a major breakthrough, and it may shed some 
light as to why the President has been granting these waivers and giving this Presidential treatment, and in my opinion changing his policy to the Far East from what it was when he ran for President in 1992. I recall that he made statements in opposition to MFN status for China. Now he is the leading advocate for MFN status for China. He was one who was opposed at one time to the normalization of our relations with Vietnam, and, of course, now, as we all know, he has headed up an effort that has successfully normalized those relations. He is right now spending much of his time trying to convince Congress to let the IMF bail out some Far Eastern banking concerns to the extent of $18 billion. 
Let me just read, Mr. President, the first four paragraphs from this article in the New York Times, `Democrat Fund-Raiser Said to Name China Tie.'

Mr. INHOFE. Thank you, Mr. President. 
As chairman of the Readiness Subcommittee, I want to make a couple of comments concerning the defense authorization bill of 1999 and how it affects readiness. 
Over the past several years, a number of military officers have expressed deep concerns regarding the trends in the operational readiness of the Armed Forces. Last year, these trends led one military officer to state, `The storm clouds are on the horizon.' 
This was a year in which most of the Armed Forces were ready to meet their wartime mission, but in order to do so in a resource-constrained environment, they were forced to resort to cost-saving practices which could impact negatively on our wartime readiness. 
For example, the Marine Corps began using retreaded tires. This had not been done before. We have no way of knowing how these will perform in the case of some type of a Persian Gulf or Middle East desert-type of operation. 
While the overall readiness of forward deployed units remains adequate, this is increasingly accomplished at the expense of nondeployed units. According to Vice Admiral Browne, Commander of the Navy's Third Fleet: `More today than in the past, forward deployed readiness is being maintained with the slimmest of margins and at the expense of CONUS based training and increased individual PERS-TEMPO.' 
He went on to say: `To get the U.S.S. Denver underway early as part of the Tarawa ARG amphibious readiness group, two other ships were cannibalized for parts.' 
Furthermore, Colonel Bozarth of the Air Force's 388th Operations Group stated: `The people that pay the price, though, are the folks that are back home. Because if you take a 
wing like ours, 5 years ago, in 1993, we were looking at full mission capable rates in the nineties. In the 1995-1997 timeframe, we are looking at mission capable rates in the eighties. Now we are down into the lower seventies.' 
Unfortunately, there are reports that even the readiness of the forward deployed units is beginning to suffer. According to naval officers in the Pacific, 20 percent of the deployed planes on the carriers are grounded awaiting spare parts and other maintenance, all the time cannibalization of the aircraft is taking place. It has gone up 15 percent over the past year. In fact, Admiral Browne recently acknowledged that, `Full mission capable rates from fiscal year 1996 to 1997 for our deployed aircraft have declined from 62 to 55 percent.' 
I am very much concerned about this. Mr. President, I think this is due to two problems that we have. One is the deprived budget, insofar as our modernization program, which is leading us to have to use older equipment, and the other is the high deployment rate. 
It is interesting that since 1992, we have had twice the number of deployments that we had in the entire 10 years before that. This is not for missions that are affecting our Nation's security. 
I have had occasion to go to many, many, many installations throughout America and around the world. I can tell you right now, we have very serious problems. In Camp Lejeune, in talking to these guys down there--they are tough marines, but their OPTEMPO and PERSTEMPO rate, to the extent the divorce rate is up, the retention rates are down. It is a very serious problem. 
I think most people realize it costs $6 million to put a guy into the cockpit of an F-16, and yet our retention rate right now has gone down 28 percent. In the Mojave Desert, the National Training Center in Twentynine Palms tells us the troops they get in for advance training are far below the level of proficiency that they were 10 years ago. Nellis Air Force Base where they have a red-flag operation, which is a very good operation for training combat pilots, they now have dropped these operations from every 12 months to 18 months. This means they go down from six to four operations each year. 
What this means is, these pilots who would otherwise be going through the red-flag exercises getting this simulated training that is actually for combat are off providing missions, supporting areas like Bosnia. 
I draw attention to the 21st TACON, because in this area, we have both of these problems occurring. The 21st TACON is using old equipment. Some of the 915 trucks that they use have over a million miles on them. I personally saw that they are using for loading docks old flatbeds that are wired together. 
As far as the deployment is concerned, we know there are serious problems around the world. We know that Iraq is about to boil. We know we may have to send in ground troops, and yet they would have to be logistically supported by the 21st TACON. Right now they are at 100 percent capacity just supporting the Bosnia operation. 
What we are dealing with in the defense authorization bill for 1999 is a budget that is not adequate and it does not put us in the state of readiness we should be in, but it is the very best we can do under the constraints that we are operating. 
While it is inadequate, I do ask that our colleagues support the defense authorization bill for 1999.

Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, first of all, let me say that I applaud the senior Senator from Mississippi for bringing this up. Yesterday I spent some time in the Chamber and evaluated the arguments against this so that I could respond to those arguments. And I will just take a couple moments because I am supposed to be presiding, and I would like to respond to those objections to this legislation that came from the floor. 
First of all--and I think this has been discussed already by the senior Senator from Mississippi--the possible effect this would have on the ABM Treaty. I know he presents a very persuasive case that it would not have any threat. Quite frankly, even if it did have a threat to the ABM Treaty of 1972, I would still be supporting this, because I think when you talk to most people who were around in 1972, back when we had two superpowers--we had the U.S.S.R. and the United States--it was not the threat in the world, quite frankly, that it is now, because it was more predictable; we knew what the U.S.S.R. had, and they knew what we had. We had an agreement that I didn't agree with back then. It was called mutually assured destruction; that is, we agree we won't defend ourself and you agree you won't defend yourself. And then, of course, you shoot us, we shoot you, everybody dies, and nobody is happy. 
That was a philosophy we lived by which I didn't agree with at the time. And I have to hasten to say, this came in a Republican administration. This was Henry Kissinger and Richard Nixon. But regardless of how flawed that might have been as a policy at that time, certainly now it should not have any application. In fact, I have quoted many times Henry Kissinger on this floor. When I asked him the question: Do you feel with the changing threat that's out there and the environment we are in right now, with some 25 nations with weapons of mass destruction, biological, chemical and nuclear, that it still makes sense to abide by the ABM Treaty? And he said--this is a quote--`It's nuts to make a virtue out of your vulnerability.' 
That is Henry Kissinger. He was the architect of this ABM Treaty. Of course, I was one who voted against the START II Treaty and even said in the Chamber we had no indication that Russia was going to be signing this anyway. And, of course, we know what is happened since that time. So I think that argument on the ABM Treaty, even if it did offend that treaty, I would still support this legislation from the Senator from Mississippi. 
The second objection yesterday was the cost. They said--and this is a quote--`We don't know how much it will cost since the bill does not specify any particular system.' Well, it doesn't. And I am glad this bill does not specify a specific system. I have a preference. Mine would be the upper-tier system. The upper-tier system is very close to where we would be able to deploy this thing. We have a $50 billion investment in 22 Aegis ships that are floating around out there today. They have a capability of knocking down missiles, but they can't go beyond the upper tier. So it doesn't do us any good except with short-range missiles that stay in the atmosphere. 
If you have from North Korea a missile coming over here that takes 30 minutes to get here, it is only in the last minute and a half that we would be able to use any current technology to knock it down, and then we couldn't do it because we don't have anything that would be that fast, so we are naked. 
And the cost is not that great. The opponents of defending America by having a national missile defense system keep saying over and over again that it is going to cost billions and billions. I have heard $100 billion, a whole range. And I suggest to you that we have some specific costs. With that $50 billion investment, it would be about $4 billion more to reach the upper tier with the Navy upper-tier system. There might be another billion and a half on Brilliant Eyes so we would be able to accurately detect where in the world one would be deployed. 
And anyone who is among the 81 who supported last week the expansion of NATO--I was one who did not support it--you might keep in mind that if you are concerned about not having an accurate cost figure for this program to defend America from a missile attack, look what we voted on last week in ratifying NATO expansion. We agreed that we are going to expand that to the three countries, and the cost figures had a range from $400 million to $125 billion. Now, I can assure you we are a lot closer to being able to determine what this cost would be. 
The last thing, I think, is that when this is all over and the dust settles, maybe what happened yesterday in India and this morning in India might really be a blessing, because at least now we can diffuse the argument that was quoted of General Shelton when he said there is no serious threat emerging, and he 
said our intelligence said that we will have at least 3 years' warning of such a threat. Well, that is the same intelligence that did not know what India was doing. 
If you try everything else and that does not work, let's just look at what is common sense. We know that we have these countries that have weapons of mass destruction. We know that both China and Russia and perhaps other countries have missiles that will reach all the way to any place in the United States of America today. Using the polar route, they can reach any place in the United States of America. And with that out there, why would we assume that China would not do it, or that it would not be an accidental launch, or with some of this technology they are selling to countries like Iran, that other countries wouldn't use it? I am not willing to put the lives of my seven grandchildren at stake by assuming that somehow we are going to have 3 years' warning. I think that is totally absurd. 
Lastly, I would only share with you that I went through a personal experience with our explosion in Oklahoma City, which I think everyone is aware of, that took 168 lives. And as tragic as that was, and what a disaster that was--and as I walked through there and I saw the firemen and all of them risking their lives to try to save one or two people after some time had gone by--and you have to have been there, not just seeing it on TV, to really get the full impact on this--the explosive power that blew up the Murrah Federal Office Building in Oklahoma City is one-tenth the power, the explosive power, of the smallest nuclear warhead known today. 
So I just think my only regret is that we didn't do this 3 years ago or 4 years ago, because somebody back in 1983 was pretty smart when they said we need to have a system that could be deployed for a limited attack by fiscal year 1998. 
Here we are, and we are overdue. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for yielding. 
Mr. President, I would just like to make a couple of comments, a couple of observations, one along the line of connections. Some people have said there should not be a connection between what is happening in Bosnia and the proposal to expand NATO to the three countries; and, second, as chairman of the Readiness Subcommittee, how this impacts--how Bosnia has impacted our state of readiness. 
I think in the first case, as we stood on this floor in November of 1995 and we talked about where we were going to go and how we were going to stop the deployment of troops into Bosnia, where we had no security interests, I was somewhat in the leadership of that losing battle--but we only lost it by three votes. 
I think if you could single out one thing that had a major impact that persuaded those three more people or four more Senators to vote in favor of allowing our troops to be sent to Bosnia, it would be our commitment and our obligation to NATO. There was not a discussion on this floor where NATO wasn't brought out and it was said, we have to do this to protect the credibility of NATO; to protect our status with NATO and our leadership in that part of the world, it is going to be necessary to send our troops into Bosnia. 
We know what happened after that. We know they went over with the idea they were going to be back in 12 months. We were told the total cost would be $1.2 billion. Now our troops, 2 1/2 years later, are still over there, with no end in sight. Our direct costs have exceeded $9 billion, and I suggest that it is actually more than double that, because if you take the cost of the operations in the 21 TACCOM in Germany, take the cost of the 86th Airlift in Ramstein--all of them dedicating almost their entire operation to supporting the operation in Bosnia--then the cost is much, much greater. So there is a relationship between NATO and our troops in Bosnia. 
I see this as something that is very critical, because so long as we are supporting the Bosnia operation, we are not in a position to be able to logistically support any type of a ground operation anyplace else in that theater. 
Let's keep in mind that theater area does include the Middle East. It was not long ago when it was pretty well publicized that we might have to do surgical airstrikes on Iraq. They are talking about that again today. While the general public is deceived into thinking that we can do this without sending in ground troops, they are wrong. There is not anyone that I know of, who has a background in the military, who would tell you that you can go in and accomplish something from the air without ultimately sending in ground troops. We are not in a position, as a result of Bosnia, to support ground troops anywhere else in that theater. 
If there is any doubt in anyone's mind, all they have to do is call the commanding officer of 21 TACCOM in Germany, and they 
will tell them there is not the capacity to send one truck to logistically support an operation anywhere else in the theater. It is not that they are 100 percent occupied by Bosnia, they are 115 percent occupied with their support of Bosnia. So that has had a dramatic effect on our state of readiness. 
Second, we are using our troops at such a high OPTEMPO and PERSTEMPO that we are not in a position to retain these people. And the cost of this is incredible. Mr. President, it costs $6 million to put a guy in the cockpit of an F-16. These people are leaving. Our retention rate has now dropped below 28 percent. That is unprecedented, and that is exactly what has been happening. 
So I do applaud the Senator from Idaho for bringing this up and making an issue out of this, because there is a definite connection. I think it is perfectly reasonable for us to have to give some type of approval, on an annual basis, for our troops being someplace where there are no national security risks at stake. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, let me briefly explain what my amendment does. It simply requires the President to submit the Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change to the Senate for its consideration under the Treaty Powers of the Constitution. 
Mr. President, the White House has made a full-scale effort for ratification of expansion of NATO. We are considering that now and we have had a lot of debate. Some of us are against it and some of us are for it. We have had a chance to get our positions out and we know where we stand. But according to article II, section 2, clause 2 of the Constitution, we are the only body--and it has to be by a two-thirds vote--that can ratify treaties of the United States. The President can't do it, the Secretary of State can't do it, the Vice President can't do it, the Secretary of Defense can't do it, the Director of the EPA can't do it--just the U.S. Senate. 
Some might argue that the NATO expansion debate is not an appropriate place to raise the question about the Kyoto Protocol. But the issue here is whether the President is going to have serious regard for the Senate's advise-and-consent authority under the Constitution, which the senior Senator from West Virginia has reminded us many times is our prerogative. The President cannot be expected to send treaties up for advice and consent when he thinks the Senate agrees with him and refuse to send them up unilaterally when he feels that we do not. Truly, that is the case. 
We made our case very specific when we voted 95-0, prior to going to Japan, that if they came back with something that did not treat the developing countries the same as the developed nations, we would oppose it, and the President came back with exactly that, putting us under obligations that the developing nations were not under. So that China doesn't have to worry about it, or Pakistan, and other countries, like Mexico. But we do. This is the issue we are dealing with here. 
I am going to deviate from that for a moment in this very short time to repeat something that I said earlier in this debate because I understand I am the last speaker now and this is the last amendment. I would like to just say there are four reasons why we should not, in the final analysis, expand NATO. 
The first one is the cost. I don't know why nobody seems to be upset that the range goes all the way from $400 million to $120 billion, and those at the low end are the administration--the same administration that said that Bosnia was going to cost us $1.2 billion, and now our direct costs have skyrocketed way way above $9 billion, and there is no end to it. It is a permanent commitment. Yet, we were told that it was going to be $1.2 billion. 
So here we have an amount of money--at a time when we have cut our defense down to the bone, at a time when we have to be able to do something to put ourselves in a position to defend America. Yet, we are talking about an open-ended commitment by extending NATO to these countries. 
The second reason is it is the open door. I hope nobody thinks we are talking about three countries--Poland, the Czech Republic, and Hungary. We are talking about an open door now that is extended to everyone. I want to read what our Secretary of State said in a statement she made: 
We must pledge that the first new members will not be the last and that no European democracy will be excluded because of where it sits on the map. 
She talks about Romania, Slovenia, Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, Albania, Bulgaria, Macedonia, Slovakia, and the list goes on and on. So it is the clear intent that this is not the last. If you think this is going to be expensive, just think what it is going to be when we start extending it to other countries. Where would we draw the line? 
The third concern I have is a genuine concern that we talked about on the floor, and that is, what does this do to our relationship with Russia? Everybody says, `That's all right, I have been to Russia and they don't mind.' I have gotten commitments from people saying that is all right, go ahead, this is not going to be a problem. But that's not what the Duma said, which is their parliamentary body. The Duma passed a resolution calling NATO expansion the `biggest threat to Russia since the end of World War II.' 
There is one person I had a great deal of respect for in this body, and I regretted when he left this body; it was Sam Nunn, who I served with on the Armed Services Committee. There is not a person who would stand up on the floor and question his integrity or his knowledge of foreign affairs or question his concern for defending America. Sam Nunn said that Russian cooperation in avoiding proliferation of weapons of mass destruction is our most important national security objective, and `This NATO expansion makes them more suspicious and less cooperative.' He further said, `The administration's answer to this and other serious questions are what I consider to be platitudes.' 
So everyone is on record. Last, I will address the concern that the Senator from New Hampshire had. He has a very good resolution, and I think everybody understands it. If anybody wants to get on record as to where they stand insofar as Bosnia is concerned, his amendment is your opportunity to do so. Because right now we don't have anything to show who is on record. We do have a resolution of disapproval that was barely defeated by only three votes in November of 1995. I suspect that some people now have changed their minds now that they realize this open-ended commitment is there. 
So I would like to wind this up by saying that if this cost to support the Bosnian operation is any indication, I remind you that in November of 1995, we were on the brink of being able to defeat this and not send our troops to Bosnia, except they said that this is going to be a short commitment, it is not going to be something that would last a long period of time. 
It was going to be over within less than a year, and it was going to cost $1.2 billion. The only reason that they were able to get those votes to pass this was, they said, `We must protect our integrity with our partners in NATO.' Now that same argument can be used--I wonder who is going to be the next Bosnia. 
Mr. President, while I have this amendment, I know the votes are not there for this amendment, and there is one very good reason, because of a dear person in this body, that we want to not extend any longer than it should be extended. So nothing would be gained by considering my amendment. 
For that reason, I withdraw my amendment and urge my fellow colleagues to vote against the extension of NATO.

Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I have been watching with a great deal of interest the debate that is taking place. It has been a very healthy debate. Certainly the Senator from Wisconsin raised some very good points. As I listened to his comments, I can only say that I agree with almost everything he said except for his conclusion. I look at the cost of this, and we do not know what to anticipate should we extend NATO to these countries. I am deeply concerned about the costs that would be incurred. The range has been incredible. You talk about something between $400 million and $120 billion. That range is not one that gives me much comfort. 
I would like to remind my colleagues that the same group of people that are giving us their assurances now--that is, the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of State, and the White House --that it is not going to cost over a certain amount of money, are the same ones that told us in November of 1995 that it would not cost more than $1.2 billion for our participation in Bosnia. We knew better. But, nonetheless, that is what they said. They said that is a guarantee. Yet here we are now. Our direct costs in Bosnia have exceeded $9 billion. I suggest that is less than half of the total direct and indirect costs. So I don't have a very high comfort level when it comes to being able to rely on what it might cost us to extend NATO to these three countries. 
The second thing as I read article V, which is the security guarantee, is that I see this as a very expensive security guarantee, and it is open ended. It stipulates that, `An armed attack against one or more of them in Europe or North America shall be considered as an attack against them all.' It doesn't say that we would come to the aid of someone who is attacked if we have any national security interests. It doesn't say that if it should impair our Nation, we are going to be in a position to defend them. It is not like many of the situations where we have become involved in helping countries such as Nicaragua and others because we know it is cheaper actually to help them than it is to have to fight these battles ourselves. This just says, `as an attack against them all.' That means that if there is an attack, we have to come to their aid. We always take a much greater share of the burden than our partners do. 
The third thing is that I have no doubt in my mind that if we do this, this is just the beginning and that we will be extending it to more and more countries. 
I would like to remind you, Mr. President, of a quote from Secretary Albright that the door is open, she said, to other countries with democratic governments and free markets. `The administration is fighting an effort by Warner and others to place a moratorium on admission of additional countries until it is known how well the first recruits are assimilated.' After the first three recruits were invited last year, Albright said, `We must pledge that the first new members will not be the last, and that no European democracy will be excluded because of where it sits on the map.' 
So with the increased costs as we make these extensions, we are looking at Romania, Slovenia, Latvia, Estonia, Lithuania, Albania, Bulgaria, Macedonia, and Slovakia, and many others. 
I don't see where there is an end it to. However, I remind my colleagues that this is not a partisan subject. 
I was honored to serve on the Senate Armed Services Committee with the Democrat who is probably more knowledgeable than any Democrat has been--certainly in my recollection--on that committee, Sam Nunn. Sam Nunn was quoted as saying, `Russian cooperation in avoiding proliferation of weapons of mass destruction is our most important national security objective, and this NATO expansion makes them more suspicious and less cooperative.' He further said, `The administration's answer to this and other serious questions are what I consider to be platitudes.' 
I agree with Senator Nunn that this is opening the door to something that is very expensive, and also it could impair what progress we have made with Russia. 
Just to quote the Duma, on January 23 they passed a resolution--this is in Russia, the Russian Duma--calling NATO expansion the biggest threat to Russia since the end of World War II. 
All of these things have been talked about on this floor. One thing that has not been talked about is what I would consider to be the greatest exposure we would be inheriting by making this extension. 
I can remember being here on the Senate floor back in November of 1995. We missed passing a resolution of disapproval to keep sending our troops over to Bosnia. We had no national security interest on a very expensive thing that now has caused the decimation of our entire defense system. We did that as a response to the strongest argument; that is, we must continue our commitment and our allegiance to NATO. So NATO is the reason that we are over in Bosnia today. Even though the administration said this would be something that would cost approximately $1.2 billion, it has cost directly $9 billion, and indirectly far more than that. 
Mr. President, it wasn't long ago that we were talking about making some strikes on Iraq. We know there are problems there. We know they have not kept their commitment to the United Nations. They have not allowed our inspection teams to see what they had agreed they should be able to see, and it looks like those storm clouds may be there. If that happens, I don't know of one person who has a background in military strategy in the Pentagon or one person in the administration who can tell you that you can go in there and do surgical strikes from the air and not end up having to send in ground troops. Where are we if we should have to do that? 
In the case of Iraq, we are talking about a theater that includes Bosnia. We are talking about the 21st COCOM located in Germany that was supposed to be offering the logistical support for any ground movement in any place within the theater. That would include Iraq. 
Right now, you go over to the 21st COCOM in Germany, and you will find out that we don't have the capability of supporting any other ground operations in addition to Bosnia because they are at over 100 percent capacity right now trying to support Bosnia. They don't have the spare parts for their equipment. They don't have the equipment. They are using M-115 trucks that have 1 million miles on them. It is something that we can't afford. It is something that we can't afford in terms of using up our military assets and our capability. Yet we are not able to support any ground operation anywhere else in the theater so long as we are offering that support to Bosnia. And the reason we are there is this allegiance that we apparently have to NATO. 
It seems to me, Mr. President, that in addition to all the other arguments we have heard, from the cost of the operation to our relationship with Russia and all the rest of them, that there is another very serious problem we are facing, and that is how many more Bosnians are out there that we are going to be obligated to support as a result of increasing our commitment to NATO. 
Mr. President, I would like to say that if you were in a position where most Americans think we are in right now, and that is where we are the superpower, that we are able to defend America on two regional fronts, then I would say maybe we should consider doing this. But right now we have a hollow force. We are in a situation very similar to what we were facing in the 1970s. 
Mr. President, I think we can no longer afford the luxury of any more activities such as the Bosnian operation. I think we would be best served not to extend NATO to these three countries.

 Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, today I would like to salute several outstanding young women who have earned the Girl Scouts of the U.S.A. Gold Award. All are members of the Red Lands Council of Girl Scouts in Oklahoma City, OK. 
These outstanding young women will be honored on April 30, 1998, for earning the highest achievement award in Girl Scouting. The Girl Scout Gold Award symbolizes the outstanding accomplishments in the areas of leadership, community service, career planning, and personal development. The Girl Scout Award can be earned by girls ages 14-17 or in grades 9-12. 
Girl Scouts of the U.S.A., an organization serving over 2.5 million girls, has awarded more than 25,000 Girl Scout Gold Awards to Senior Girl Scouts since the inception of the program in 1980. To receive the award, a Girl Scout must fulfill five requirements: earn four interest project patches, earn the Career Exploration pin, earn the Senior Girl Scout Challenge, and design and implement a Girl Scout Gold Award Project. A plan for fulfilling the requirements of the award is created by the Senior Girl Scout and carried out through close cooperation between the girl and an adult Girl Scout volunteer.

Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Texas for yielding a little time here. 
I can remember in November of 1995 when the Senator from Texas was the primary author of the resolution of disapproval of sending troops into Bosnia. I was on the resolution with her. We only lost by three votes. In other words, if three Senators had voted the other way, we very likely would not have had to send troops into Bosnia to begin with. 
In anticipation of this, I went to Bosnia, up to the northeast sector, only to find there was never any belief that we could get into this thing and be out in 12 months. The reason the President was able to get the three votes necessary to defeat the resolution of disapproval was the guarantee that our troops that were going to be sent over there in November of 1995 would be home for Christmas in 1996. That was not an expectation; that was a guarantee. I can remember so well talking to General Haukland up in the northeast sector when he laughed and said, `You mean 12 years.' As the years and months are going by now, it looks like there is more and more truth to that. 
Let me just mention my concern is a little different than the concerns that are expressed by most people. Mine is one as to how this involvement in Bosnia is adversely affecting our ability to defend America. 
I am chairman of a committee called the Readiness Subcommittee of the Senate Armed Services Committee that is in charge of training and making sure that we are ready. Until some of the recent scandals have taken the headlines off the front page, we have finally broken through the national media so that people realize, and the national media realizes, that we are facing huge 
threats today all over the world with over 25 nations with weapons of mass destruction with delivery systems that can reach the United States from anyplace in the world. 
With all this, we are concentrating our efforts and spending our defense dollars on Bosnia. This is the thing that concerns me. We keep hearing that there are only 8,500 troops in Bosnia. That is not much of a commitment, but I can assure you, Mr. President, it is far greater than that. If you just add the troops who are directly affected by the Bosnia operation in the rim countries, in Croatia, that adds up to 12,000. Then you go over to Europe and you see the logistical support of that operation. We find that in the 21st TACOM, for example. That is the operation that is responsible for logistical support of any ground operation, for example, if we should have to send ground troops into Iraq. 
I don't think anyone is naive enough to think we could surgically bomb Iraq if it became necessary and not have to make a commitment of ground troops. But if that happened, we don't have any way to support logistically those ground troops that would be sent to Iraq. The 21st TACOM, which has to support logistically ground troops anywhere in that theater, which includes Iraq, is now totally consumed by their participation and their support in Bosnia. Right now they are operating at a very high op tempo and pers-tempo rate so individuals are being consumed by the operation in Bosnia. 
We are at 115 percent capacity just supporting Bosnia. What does that mean? That means in the event we had to send ground troops someplace else in the world, we would not have the logistic support for them. 
When you ask the question, `What would you do if that happened,' the commanding officer at the 21st TACOM said we would be totally dependent upon the Guard and Reserves. I suggest to you, Mr. President--you know and the rest of us know who are close to this subject--we don't have the necessary MOSs and capacity in Guard and Reserves to make that support. You go 10 miles up the road to the 86th Airlift in Ramstein. In Ramstein, they are right now at 100-percent capacity just supporting the airlift to Bosnia. 
So the cost is far greater, even far greater than $8 billion that so far we have admitted we have spent in Bosnia. We are making a commitment that makes it virtually impossible for us to support any other operations should it become necessary. 
So I think there has to be an end to this thing. It is easy to get into these things; it is very difficult to get out. We got in; we got in with a guarantee it would be a 12-month operation; we got in with the expectations it would cost $1.2 billion. We knew better at the time. We knew they were not telling the truth about what kind of a commitment we were making and, consequently, we have to have some way of getting out. 
So this is a major national security issue, Mr. President, that we get out of Bosnia so that we can have the capacity to take care of the needs of the American people in terms of defending our country. 
With that, I defer to the Senator from Kansas for any comments he might want to make.

Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I think it is very important that we get something in the Record here in terms of this Kosovo resolution so that it would be abundantly clear later on that it cannot be misconstrued as to being supportive in any way at the present time or in the future of any type of military action in Kosovo or anyplace in that area. 
I am very much concerned over what has happened in Bosnia. I am concerned about our state of readiness--or lack of readiness, I should say--and I certainly feel that if there is one factor that is contributing to our state of readiness, or lack of readiness, it is our activities in Bosnia. Of course, we knew back when we passed the resolution to send troops to Bosnia that our resolution of disapproval died by only three votes, and there was a guarantee by the President of the United States that it would be a 12-month operation, which would cost approximately $1.2 billion. Now it is passing through $8 billion and it looks like it is going to be ongoing. 
As a result of that, we are not able to support ground troops should they be called upon in such areas as Iraq, because we are consuming 100 percent of our capability to logistically support ground troops in Bosnia. Specifically, the 21st TACOM in Germany is at over 100 percent capacity, just supporting the logistics support of a ground operation going through into Bosnia. The 86th airlift in Ramstein is absorbed totally with taking care of the air operation to support Bosnia. If there is anything our country cannot afford, it is any type of expansion of that support to any other country in that legion or anyplace else that is going to use those assets. 
While I am an original cosponsor of this resolution, I want to be sure to condemn Milosevic and the atrocities that are committed and have been committed in Kosovo, and I want to make it abundantly clear that there are many of us who are supporting this resolution who will oppose any future attempt to send any type of military operation into Kosovo. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss an amendment that I offered yesterday, amendment number 1687, to S. 1173, the ISTEA Reauthorization Act. This amendment was agreed to by voice vote. This amendment was cosponsored by Senator Breaux, Senator Byrd and Senator Sessions. 
The purpose of my amendment was to provide the necessary flexibility and funding to the States that was promised by President Clinton and EPA Administrator Browner for the new National Ambient Air Quality Standards for ozone and particulate matter. These standards were promulgated last July. My amendment in no way ratifies or affirms the underlying standards. These standards are the subject of various lawsuits and pending legislation which seeks to overturn the standards in part or in whole. This amendment simply relieves the uncertainty for the States during the implementation phase over the next few years. 
The President and Administrator Browner promised a flexible implementation time frame for the standards which was not based in the Clean Air Act. This amendment ensures that the implementation of the standards would not occur at a faster rate than the President promised. 
The first section of the amendment, Section 2(a) provides that the EPA will fund all of the costs for the PM monitoring network with new program dollars and just doesn't take money from other State grants. The States claim that the EPA has reprogrammed fiscal year 1998 dollars from existing State Grant authorities, the amendment requires that these funds be repaid to the States. This provides the assurance to the States that this will not be another unfunded mandate. It also restores the grant funds to the States that the EPA diverted to the monitoring program in 1998. 
Section 2(b) ensures that the national network (designated in section 2(a)) which consists of the PM2.5 monitors necessary to implement the national ambient air quality standards will be established by December 31, 1999. EPA will have received the funding from Congress and they will be responsible for ensuring that the network will be in place. If they fail, they will be subject to legal action and must explain the cause of any delay. 
Section 2(c) requires that the PM monitoring network be in place and that the States have three years of monitoring data before the Governors are required to submit their recommendations to the EPA. Under the Clean Air Act the Governors must examine the data and notify EPA when an area in their State violates the standards. This will stop the possibility of the EPA being sued by a citizens group demanding that an area be classified before the data has been collected. The Clean Air Act does not require the monitoring data to be collected first. But the President and the EPA promised they would wait for the three years of data. This provision provides the legal authority to wait for the data. 
Section 2(d) follows the Clean Air Act and the EPA's implementation schedule, it is the EPA's official review of the Governor's recommendations. It ensures that the Governor's data and information is correct and allows EPA the time to publish the decision in the Federal Register. 
Section 2(e) addresses the concerns of the farmers who believe that they will be targeted for PM 2.5 even though their emissions are larger than 2.5. The study will examine the monitoring devices to ensure that they do not capture larger particles. This section is endorsed by the American Farm Bureau who wrote, `The agriculture community continues to be concerned over the accuracy of EPA's fine particulate measurements, especially in regard to agriculture emissions. Testimony has been given in both the Senate and House Agriculture Committees indicating concern that agriculture would be `misregulated' due to inaccurate fine particulate measurements. This amendment will allow a comparison of EPA's approved method used to measure fine particulate and the new monitors to find if both adequately eliminate those particles that are larger than 2.5 micrograms in diameter.' 
Section 3(a) follows the EPA's and the President's timeline for allowing the Governors two years to review the current ozone programs before they have to designate nonattainment areas. It allows the Governors to review the other ozone programs such as the new regional ozone transport program before they make new decisions about the new ozone standard. 
Section 3(b) follows the Clean Air Act and the EPA's implementation schedule, it is the EPA's official review of the Governor's recommendations. It ensures that the Governor's data and information is correct and allows EPA the time to publish the decision in the Federal Register. 
Finally, Section 4 protects the pending lawsuits so that others can raise the issues of Unfunded Mandates, Small Business Review, the validity of the standards, and other issues without having this amendment impede their legal rights. It affirmatively states that this amendment is not a ratification of the new standards and any and all legal challenges to the standards are still valid and real.

Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, we have had an amendment and actually have had a bill to address a problem that many of us are concerned with having to do with a change that was proposed by the Administrator of the EPA in November 2 years ago. This made dramatic changes in the standards for particulate matter and for ozone. 
We held extensive hearings. As chairman of the Clean Air Subcommittee, we had seven hearings on this bill. It has become very controversial. The Administrator of the EPA has set the standards. After having gone through the process of the hearings and the process of the comment periods, it is now set. However, in the memorandum of implementation by the President, we have a time guideline for the implementation of these standards. Let me repeat that. The standards are set in both particulate matter and in ozone but not yet implemented. The implementation period provides for certain periods of time for establishing a PM monitoring network for collecting data for Governors to recommend areas of designation for the EPA to designate new nonattainment areas, and then for the States to submit State implementation plans. That would be true on both ozone and particulate matter. 
What we are attempting to do with this bill is to take these guidelines to make sure that they are in order and that everyone has ample time to carry out what has to be done in order to implement these standards. That would require a period of time. 
So what I have done with this amendment is take the memorandum of implementation from President Clinton and put that down into periods of time as he recommends, and we are adding that as an amendment. Obviously, this is germane to this bill because if we are to find ourselves out of attainment, it would dramatically affect the ability of the States to be able to have their transportation funds. 
So with the following three exceptions, this amendment only puts into the bill the time guidelines that we have all agreed to. It has been signed off on by the minority and the majority and the EPA. 
The first one is an area that does not affect time lines. It has to do with fully funding. This is a conscientious concern. However, the States have talked to us through the Governors associations, U.S. Conference of Mayors, the counties, and the rest of them saying that what they don't want to have is an unfunded mandate whereby they would have all of these obligations to monitor the PM and go through all of this and not have it funded. This portion of the amendment, section (2)(a), requires that the EPA absorb all of these costs. 
The next area is one that meets a problem that mostly concerns the agricultural community throughout America; that is, their concern with how they will be treated. Section 2(e) says that this study would take place that would address the concerns of farmers who believe that they will be targeted for PM 2.5. And we talked about PM 2.5. We are talking about 2.5 micrograms as opposed to the current 10 and emissions larger than 2.5. 
This is their concern. Everyone has agreed that this is a legitimate concern that the farmers of America have, and we are accommodating them. 
The last section that does not affect just the timeline is section 4 where it says: 
Nothing in section 1-3 above shall be construed by the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency or any court, State, or person to affect any pending legislation. 
There is some pending legislation. 
I would like to add that I had a conversation with Administrator Browner, and we have had many nice conversations. While we have occasionally disagreed philosophically on some things, I did agree with her that if this amendment passes and survives the conference, passes and then is signed into law, I have no intention of bringing up any other legislation or amendments affecting the national ambient air quality standards; that is, barring anything totally unforeseen. I can't imagine what that would be. 
Mr. President, my amendment today addresses the EPA's revised Particulate Matter and Ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standards. As you know, I have been a vocal critic of the EPA's revised Particulate Matter and Ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standards. My subcommittee has held extensive hearings on both standards, and I am convinced, based on the record developed in those hearings, that those standards are not needed to protect the health of our citizens, or our environment, and that the implementation of these standards will impose huge costs on the country, that are completely unjustified. For these reasons, I have sponsored legislation that would require EPA to reconsider these standards, before they are implemented. 
I rise today to pursue a narrower objective. The administration has announced an implementation plan for both standards. However, a number of concerns have been raised about EPA's ability to implement this plan under the Clean Air Act. One key concern has been whether EPA can hold off on designation areas as not meeting the new standards--i.e., as nonattainment areas. 
With regard to PM 2.5 (the new Particulate Matter standard), three years of federal reference method monitoring data are necessary to designate areas, and a monitoring network--funded by EPA, not the states--needs to be put in place to generate these data. 
With regard to the ozone standard, EPA needs to develop guidance on nonattainment boundaries, before the designation process can even begin. EPA says that this guidance will be available in 1999, but, the states still must submit their recommended designations to EPA this July unless something is done. 
The amendment I have offered is designed to address these concerns by giving the Agency clear authority to proceed with the schedule announced by the President last July. I am offering it because I believe it would be unacceptable for the Congress to allow a situation to develop where uncertainty about EPA's legal authority could result in confusion and chaos. 
I caution, however, that this legislation does not affirm the standards. Whether those standards are lawful, appropriate, and necessary is still an open question that is being considered by the Courts. We can't realistically expect this question to be answered in a year or more. This legislation is designed to assure that the agency has clear authority to proceed with its implementation schedule, while the very important questions about the legitimacy of these standards are still debated. 
This legislation addresses only the timing of attainment designation under the President's implementation plan for these standards. EPA recently proposed to order the states to develop plans, that, among other things, would require reductions in inter-state emissions that might be contributing to exceedances of the 8-hour ozone standard. A number of legal and factual objections to this proposal have been raised by states, industry, and others. Since this is only a proposal, I have not addressed in this legislation EPA's authority under the Act to require any reductions before state plans are developed after areas have been designated. 
I thank very much Senator Baucus, Senator Chafee, and Administrator Browner, as well as some of the staff: Chris Hessler, Jimmie Powell, with whom I worked closely, Barbara Roberts, and Tom Sliter. They have been very cooperative and very helpful in bringing this to the point where we are today. 
At this point I yield for questions.

Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I rise today in opposition to the nomination of Dr. David Satcher to the position of Surgeon General of the United States. In my view, Dr. Satcher represents many of the problems undercutting the moral fabric of American life. Too many, including myself, Dr. Satcher is outside the mainstream of public opinion. 
I understand that Dr. Satcher is a remarkable man, with many years of distinguished service as a doctor. My position on his nomination does not stem from his history of service or his qualifications. Rather, my opposition comes from the ideals that Dr. Satcher represents. It is unfortunate that the office of the Surgeon General, America's family doctor, has become politicized. Due to this increasing political role, Dr. Satcher remains unfit to fulfill the position of Surgeon General. As head of the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Dr. Satcher's actions and decisions have wandered into the political arena time and again. 
Dr. Satcher has publicly supported the President's position on partial-birth abortion. His position is completely at odds with over 80% of the American public and the America Medical Association. The AMA has said that there is never any medical circumstance where this particular procedure should be used to terminate a babies life. I find the elitism and arrogance of Dr. Satcher on this issue completely irresponsible. When asked by the Labor and Human Resources Committee about his support of the President's position, Dr. Satcher re-affirmed his support for this procedure. I need not remind my colleagues the description of this outrageous procedure. Even Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, an abortion rights supporter, has termed this procedure `infanticide.' Continued support for this barbaric procedure borders on the ridiculous. 
Dr. Satcher also has apparently adopted the opinions of his predecessor, Dr. Jocelyn Elders, on many sensitive cultural issues as well. As head of the CDC, Dr. Satcher has endorsed the distribution of condoms to our children in public schools. This is Dr. Satcher's way of teaching our kids how to deal with problems like teen pregnancy and AIDS. Mr. President, I must say I am appalled at this blatant attempt at undermining the concept of abstinence as the best form of disease prevention and birth control. Are we truly teaching children responsibility by providing them with condoms in their classrooms? 
Dr. Satcher also supports using tax-payer dollars to promote this dangerous agenda. In 1994, Dr. Satcher began an $800,000 national advertising campaign aimed at out nation's youth promoting condom usage. This was all done in the name of AIDS prevention. I find this egregious use of precious resources disturbing. By promoting condom usage, we are simply encouraging our children to become sexually active. I understand the issue of responsibility, however, I have never heard the word abstinence associated with Dr. Satcher. To me, abstinence is truly the responsible way to prevent unwanted pregnancies and AIDS. 
It is interesting to that note Dr. Satcher's view of responsibility is convenienent when it conforms with his political beliefs, when in reality his actions often appear to be irresponsible from both a moral and scientific point of view. I say this because much has been made recently of Dr. Satcher's morally questionable African HIV study. As we have all become aware, as head of the CDC, Dr. Satcher approved of research conducted in Africa and Asia that called for a groups of HIV positive pregnant women to receive placebos (sugar pills), without their knowledge, while others knowingly received valuable lifesaving medication (AZT). Those receiving the placebo served as the control group and those receiving the medication the study group. All this, despite the fact that it was known that AZT decreased by 2/3 the likelihood that the disease would be transmitted from the mother to the child. 
This experiment is both repulsive and morally questionable. It violates every know protocol from the Hippocratic Oath to the Nuremberg Code and the Declaration of Helsinki which requires doctors to provide any and all lifesaving measures. The Declaration of Helsinki states: `In a medical study every patient--including those in a control group, if any, should be assured of the best proven diagnostic and therapeutic method.' Apparently, Dr. Satcher viewed his research outside established international ethical protocols.

Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, it is my understanding that tomorrow we are going to be voting on the confirmation of Mrs. Margaret Morrow, Judge Margaret Morrow, who has been nominated for the position of U.S. District Judge for the Central District of California. While I will be opposing her nomination, it is not because of her academic qualifications, nor her credentials, but her philosophy that she has expressed in the past from the bench. 
Lately a lot of people have said that the state of our judiciary is somewhat deplorable, and I think it is, although I do not think it is because of the lack of judges being confirmed. I do not think that is the problem. I think it is the philosophy, the dangerous philosophy of elitism which pervades the judicial branch of the Federal Government. This elitism is dangerous and undercuts our belief in courts throughout America. Regrettably, Mrs. Morrow is representative of that elitism. 
I am most concerned more than anything else with statements she has made about direct democracy. It seems to be her position that we in America are not able to rule for ourselves, not able to make intelligent decisions, but those decisions would have to be made in some protected ivory tower. She condemns direct democracy. She says, `Ballot initiatives,' and this is a quote, `render ephemeral any real hope of intelligent voting of the majority.' 
What she is saying here is that the people are not capable of making these decisions. And, of course, they do have problems out there in the ninth circuit, and the position she is seeking to gain would put her in a position to actually promote some of those things that have been taking place there. 
Recently, in Bates v. Jones, a three-judge panel--Reinhardt, Sneed, and Fletcher--affirmed a decision by Judge Wilkins to throw out California's ballot initiative, Proposition 140--that's the term limits for State officials--declaring them unconstitutional. 
There have been other efforts such as proposition 209. Last year Judge Henderson struck down the voter-approved referendum ending State affirmative action programs, and fortunately for the 20 million California voters Henderson's original ruling has been struck down, restoring their faith in the voting process. 
Proposition 187. Judge Richard Pfaelzer declared a State law denying benefits to illegal aliens unconstitutional because it conflicted with the 1996 welfare reform law. That was overturned. 
Proposition 208. Judge Carlton has recently blocked enforcement of the popular initiative that has imposed limits on campaign contributions at the State level. 
During her confirmation, Mrs. Morrow claimed never to have publicly opposed a ballot initiative in the past decade with one exception and that was proposition 209. In fact, in 1988, Morrow wrote an article urging lawyers to support or oppose various ballot initiatives. She denounces three others later that year and spoke publicly against two others. So I think it is fairly evident that Margaret Morrow, in addition to these problems, has a problem with the truth. And I certainly think if there is anything we do not need in our judiciary it is someone of that philosophy. 
I like the way Senator Ashcroft said it the other day. He said, `Morrow's writings make it clear that she believes people cannot be trusted with the fundamental powers of self-government.'

Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I see the Senator from Texas. I would ask him, although it would elicit probably too long a response, if he has ever done anything that is really politically stupid. And I am sure he has either knowingly or not knowingly--as I am about to do--done something that would fall into the category of political stupidity. 
Tomorrow an execution is scheduled to take place at 6 p.m. in the State of Texas. The young lady's name is Karla Faye Tucker. It happens we have an individual we know in common, so I became somewhat familiar with this case, and I will just give a thumbnail sketch as to what happened. 
Karla Faye Tucker, when she was a very, very small child, went into heroine at age 10. She is the daughter of a prostitute. Karla Faye went into prostitution when she was 13 years old. She never had a childhood, I guess we could say. Fourteen years ago, while living in a drug cult, an individual on a motorcycle came riding into her living room, dripping oil and breaking things and stealing things and rode out. And the next day, Karla and an accomplice broke into the apartment of the motorcycle rider, who was in bed with a girl, and murdered both of them--a brutal murder. 
I do not think there is anyone in the Senate who has a stronger record and background in punishment as a deterrent to crime than I have, nor is there anyone here who has been more active in establishing stronger death penalties than I have. The Furman case took place in 1972, and that is what struck down most of the States' capital punishment laws. I was in the State Senate at that time, and for 5 consecutive years I was the author of the capital punishment bill in the State of Oklahoma. I have always felt that punishment should be severe, it should be swift, and it should be equal. 
We had a person who became very famous after 15 years on death row, Roger Dale Stafford, who brutally murdered nine Oklahomans. This guy was left on death row for 15 years. No one ever questioned that he was guilty. He never had any remorse. He just sat there and got fat. He gained 100 pounds while he was in there watching color TV. I have often said the longer the length of time between the conviction, the sentence to death and the carrying out of that sentence, the less that punishment serves as a deterrent to crime. So I have always felt that punishment should be carried out immediately. 
But as I watched developments unfold with Karla Faye Tucker, I came to the conclusion that I have reached in a very unusual way. It is something I never thought I would do. It occurred to me that if Carla Faye Tucker had been a man, Carl Tucker, already either he would have been executed or would have been commuted to life and we would never have even known about it. Nobody would have cared. 
The controversy that has been stirring around this--which I think probably would have gotten a lot more controversial if it had not been for the sex scandal that has dominated the media in recent days--was, I think, primarily because Karla Faye Tucker is a woman. It would not have happened if Karla Faye Tucker had not been a woman. Now there is all the public and political pressure to execute this person for this heinous crime she committed that I don't think there would be if she had not been a woman. 
I took the time a few weeks ago through the Richmond Law Review to check to see how many cases have been commuted to life imprisonment from death row since the Furman case of 1972. I found that there have been 76 cases. I have not reviewed all of these cases because I have not had the time to do it, but I did look at several of them. I found that there are a lot of circumstances in the Tucker case that were similar to those which caused these other cases to be commuted, 76 of them since 1972. And I will use as an example, in the State of Georgia, William Neil Moore whose sentence was commuted to life imprisonment. 
There were several reasons, but the four that kept coming up in his case were, No. 1, an exemplary prison record; No. 2, a strong feeling and expression of remorse for the crime he committed; No. 3, a religious conversion; and, No. 4, pleas from the families of the victims of the crime for clemency. I looked at Karla's case to find that all four of those are there, but it is much more so than it was in the case of William Neil Moore whose sentence was commuted to life imprisonment. 
In the Tucker case, it is not just the sister of one of the victims and the brother of the other, but three of the four prosecutors who have made a plea for clemency. The homicide detective, J.C. Moser, the guy who put her away, has quite a passionate story that he tells on how he has never felt any kind of remorse for anyone he has sent up and now he is lined up with several others. Even the prison guards have actually passed a petition around asking for clemency. 
I have a letter here I just received this morning from Mr. W.C. Kirkendall, who is from Seguin, Tx. I will read the first and last two sentences of this letter. This is a letter of December 9 to Governor Bush. `I have been a prosecutor since 1984, favor the death penalty in the appropriate cases and have prosecuted many people who I believe deserved the ultimate penalty that society can inflict.' 
The last paragraph says, `In sum, there is nothing that her execution will accomplish and much that commuting her sentence to life will do to show both the efficacy and justice of the Texas death penalty system. Please spare her life.' 
In this letter he goes into all kinds of detail as to how strong he feels about the death penalty and why he would be asking the Governor for an exception in this case. 
Having looked at this, I think there can be a case made that if Karla Faye Tucker had been Carl Tucker, there would not have been all of the public and political pressure applied to demand the death penalty. 
We went through something very similar in Oklahoma. In Oklahoma 2 years ago we had the most cruel, I guess, mass murder or terrorist act in the history of America when 168 innocent Oklahomans were murdered. And Timothy McVeigh went through the necessary trials, and they found him to be guilty, and they gave him the death sentence. And then Terry Nichols, who was an accomplice in the case, went through the trial, and they did not give him the death penalty. 
I never try to second-guess what juries do. I had an experience myself back in the 1970's after the Furman case. I was in the State Senate, and I was the author of the death penalty bill, and I was called for jury duty. There I was. And it was a murder case. And so when they were trying to decide whether or not we should qualify as jurors, they asked me a series of questions. I said, `Look, I can save you a lot of time. I am a member of the State senate. I am the author of the death penalty bill. I already know this guy is guilty. I have been reading about it, and the guy ought to fry.' 
They did not disqualify me, and I ended up being the chairman of the jury that acquitted him. So a long time ago I stopped trying to second-guess the decision. Anyway, in the case of Terry Nichols, they did not do that. I wondered quite a bit since this case came up if Terry Nichols had been a female, would there have been so much pressure applied to everyone who would be listening to 
make sure that Terry Nichols got the death penalty because we didn't want an exception being made because Terry Nichols might have been a woman. 
And so I look at what's happened. Just a few minutes ago, the Texas Pardons and Parole Board made a decision, and I think it was a decision that we all knew they would make, that they would deny any clemency to Karla Faye Tucker. In fact, a guy named Victor Rodriquez--I do not happen to know him, he is the chairman of the Texas Pardons and Parole Board--said way back on the 6th of January on the `Rivera Live' show that it did not make any difference what they came up with, that he was not going to be willing to offer commutation to Karla Faye Tucker. And the commutation petition was not even filed until January 22. So that decision has been already made. It was a done deal. And, of course, they came out and said she should not be granted clemency. 
I do know Governor Bush. He is a very fair and very compassionate individual. I have looked at the constitution of the State of Texas. It is a little bit different. It gives a lot more power to the Pardons and Parole Board than some of the other States, but in the case of the Texas Pardons and Parole Board, after they have said they would deny clemency, article 4, section 11, of which I will read one sentence that is significant, says:  
The Governor shall have the power to grant one reprieve in any capital case for a period not to exceed 30 days. 
All Governor Bush can do right now is to make that recommendation. And during that time he would be able to look at some of these cases. What I think I would do, if I were the Governor of Texas, and knowing what I know so far, is go ahead and grant that 30 days reprieve; nothing would really be lost by that, and then in the meantime during that period of time I would send for--in fact, I would be glad to send them to him--the 76 cases in America where clemency has been offered in the form of commutation of a death sentence into life imprisonment and then look at the standards to see if those standards are not at least met or exceeded by Karla Faye Tucker. I think he would be able to do that. 
In the absence of that, of course, tomorrow at 6 o'clock Karla Faye Tucker will be executed. I hate to think that we would wake up on Wednesday morning and go back and start researching and find that those standards were at least met or exceeded. I guess we could call this gender backlash. 
The other day I was watching someone on TV--I cannot remember who it was right now, but they said on the 3d of February at 6 o'clock Karla Faye Tucker will be executed in Texas and O.J. Simpson will be playing golf. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I have a great deal of concern over some of the things that we have been hearing during this interim when we have been considering what we would do if a surplus should become a reality. And we and many people have talked about problems in child care, in Medicare, in the environment, and in education. But the one thing, the one area, that we have the greatest deficiency in America in, and the great threat facing us, is what has happened with the demise of our defense budget and what has happened to our defense system. 
Being the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Readiness Subcommittee, we have had occasion to go around and pay visits to a number of our installations. Mr. President, this is not something that has just come on recently. Although now is when the public has finally a wake-up call, thanks perhaps to Saddam Hussein and Iraq, and realizes that there is a great threat out there. 
I would like to read just one paragraph out of the 1998 Defense Authorization Act under, `The Storm Clouds Are On The Horizon.' 
There are two key factors that threaten to undermine the readiness of our forces--a lack of adequate funding and the over commitment of a greatly reduced force structure. Unless we take necessary steps to correct these problems our military capability will incur significant degredation as we enter into the 21st century. 
Mr. President, during this interim period, I visited a number of installations, including Nellis Air Force Base out in the Mojave Desert, and national training systems: The Army Advanced Training System, the Marine Advanced Training Center at Twentynine Palms, and the San Diego naval operations. Also, I have had occasion to be in Camp Lejuene, Fort Bragg, and Fort Hood, and these installations that are trying to keep us prepared throughout America, and throughout the world. 
I can tell you that we really have a serious problem. We find that our operations are up, that now we have U.S. forces that have been used in 36 countries in the last 9 years. In the 9 years prior to that there was only 22 countries. We have had over a 300-percent increase in the pace of operations since 1990. We have 26 Army contingency operations in the 7 years since 1991 compared to 10 operations in the 30 years prior to that time. There were 26 operations in just 7 years compared to 10 over the previous 30 years. What this means is we have a `op tempo,' or a first tempo, which is a term that is used to measure how busy our people are that are out there and how this is going to affect all of our other operations. 
So we actually have two problems that we are faced with. One problem is the fact that we have reduced our budget to an artificially low rate that puts us in the position where we cannot carry out the minimum expectations for the American people. And to be specific about it, we have roughly one-half of the force strength today that we had in 1991. I am talking about one-half the Army divisions, one-half the tactical air wings, and one-half of the ships floating out there. So that is a serious problem. 
Then we have stood on this floor time and again and talked about the problems of our deployment on these contingency operations. I can remember standing on this floor in November of 1995 and saying that we cannot afford to send our American troops into Bosnia, and that if we do send them into Bosnia we 
will incur an operation and an obligation that will sustain the next two decades. The President assured us and promised us. He didn't estimate it, Mr. President. He said that this operation will not exceed 12 months, and that all of our troops will be home from Bosnia for Christmas in 1996. Of course, we knew that wasn't true. We knew the President was not telling the truth. I remember going over there and talking to them. When I told them up there in the northeast sector, the U.N., that it was going to be a 12-month operation, they laughed, and they said, `You mean 12 years.' They said it is like putting your hand in the water and leaving it there for 12 months. Take it out, and nothing has changed. The President also said that the cost would be $1.2 billion. Guess what? It has now gone over $8 billion in that effort. 
That is not even a part of it. When the American people are told that we only have 8,500 troops over there in Bosnia, that is not true either because if you count the troops as of last week that are in Croatia and the Moravian countries, it is well up to over 12,000 troops. You go over to the 21st Tatical Command in Germany that supplies the logistics for the operation in Bosnia, and they are at 100-percent capacity, and their op tempo rate is 60 percent higher than it should be. What that means in normal terms is that if something happens in Iraq they have to support that logistically on the ground from the 21st Tactical Command. You go 10 miles down the road to Ramstein Air Force Base where they have the 86th Airlift operation, and I defy you to go there and find any ramp space that isn't being used as the C-141s, C-5s and DC-17s that are bringing in everything going to Bosnia are transferring onto C-130s, and off they go. We are using 100 percent of our capacity there. So that is a very, very serious problem that has to be corrected. 
We cannot do that and continue to try to rebuild a defense operation that has been decimated mostly by this administration. As we go around to these installations, we find that our retention rate is down, the divorce rate is up, and that we are approaching the hollow force days of the late 1970's. We know the two reasons: the budget cuts and the contingency operations. 
We have stood on this floor for the last 5 years and talked about the threat that is facing the United States of America. It is not just that we are not adequately prepared in our state of readiness to take care of normal operations should something erupt, for example, in Iraq or Iran or Syria or North Korea, but we also do not have a national missile defense system. In 1983 we started one that should have been deployable by the year 1998. That is now. Someone was pretty smart back there. And yet this administration stopped that in 1992. We are now 5 years behind, if we get right back in, which I think we will now because there is a wake-up call that the American people have heard. And that is, I would have to say, some good news, that even right now this administration is agreeing with what they have refuted over the last 5 years. 
I was very pleased to hear Secretary of Defense Bill Cohen stand up and say that we now know there are over 25 nations that have weapons of mass destruction, either biological, chemical or nuclear, and are working on the missile means to deliver those as far as the United States of America. When Bill Cohen stood up and said Saddam Hussein--keep in mind, here is a guy who murders his own grandchildren--and Iraq under our close supervision still has enough DX gas to kill every man, woman and child on the face of this Earth in 60 seconds, finally America is waking up, and I am very pleased that has happened.

Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, we are going to have to do something and do that something pretty quick. Unfortunately, as the chairman of the Readiness Committee, I recognize the fact that we are going to have to come up with some money right away, in this coming fiscal year budget, in the defense authorization bill and the defense appropriations bill. We are finding that the Defense Department has engaged in policies that have caused us to foolishly use money that should have been used for readiness. So I am standing here saying we are going to have to do--the money can only come from one place. If we are going to try to keep our retention rate or get it back up, if we are going to stop the divorce rate going up, we are going to have to put some money in quality-of-life and force strength, and the only place that can come from is modernization. 
As a strong supporter of the F-22, I can only stand on the floor of the Senate and say we are going to have to delay that program unless we are able to come up with some money to put into our budget for the coming fiscal year. 
People who are very wise say, well, that is what we depend upon for future readiness, the F-22. Yes, we do, but we have to make a tradeoff for current readiness or future readiness. It has to be current readiness, with the threat that faces us. 
I am here to tell you that we are facing a greater threat today than at any time since World War II. We have a reduced force, and we cannot meet that threat. It has to be changed. 
I yield back the remainder of my time.

Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, the amendment that we just agreed to is an amendment that addresses the very competitiveness issue that is facing us right now. It is an amendment to the fast-track legislation. What it does, is to delay the implementation of severe changes in the ambient air standards, until such time as the science justifies it. It does impose a 4-year moratorium. I think it is very significant that this be made a part of this legislation.

Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, it is unfortunate, since we have a bill that is the most significant bill that we will be dealing with during the course of this year, that it has gotten bogged down into a debate and discussion about depot maintenance. This is very unfortunate. However that has been the case. 
Let me just devote a little bit of time to that, because, having listened to the arguments as put forth by the two eloquent Senators from California and the Senators from Texas, I didn't hear any new arguments. But I do think that we need to, once and for all, respond to these arguments. I was hoping to be speaking last because I know what will happen, since I am obviously not speaking last. But let me just go ahead and bring up four arguments that I heard. I think these four are pretty much the total argument of those who want to stop competition in ALC's. 
First of all, I heard the quote saying, `We are telling the DOD that you can't have real competition.' This bill does allow competition. This allows competition and takes into consideration all direct and indirect costs. 
They said that `The bill was crafted by Members seeking special protection, whose sole purpose is to block private competition.' I suggest that everyone in this Chamber knows, and certainly everyone on the Senate Armed Services Committee knows, that when we had our language in there that did clearly carry out the intent and the letter of the BRAC recommendations, we felt we were going to lose the bill because the two Senators from both Texas and California wanted an opportunity to privatize in place. Then we agreed to have open competition. 
I was not even in on that. The ones who agreed to that language--that was drafted by members of the committee who were totally neutral on this subject. They didn't have a dog in this fight. But they got together and came up with the agreement that this is the way to do it. Let's take all costs into consideration. We did that. I think the eloquent remarks of Senator Levin pointed this out. 
They were the ones who put this together so that, yes, even though this is not what the BRAC committee wanted, still it did open up an avenue for privatization-in-place if they took into consideration all the costs. And then they voted and it was 18-to-nothing, all Democrats and all Republicans voted for it. 
Closely related to that, I have been quoted as to a statement that I made in Oklahoma. Let me say that is an accurate statement. That is true. I wasn't misquoted. And I was stating it as a businessman. I spent 33 years in the real world and I know, as Senator Bennett has pointed out several times, that you can't operate and leave three out of five ALC's at 50 percent capacity and have any kind of competitive operation. 
So I said very definitely that, in my opinion, those individuals who were interested in competing in McClellan in California and in Kelly in Texas, wanted to compete on a basis where they had a tremendous advantage which is paid for by the taxpayers. 
So they did two things. They put two considerations in. First of all, if they want to bid and privatize in place and bid at Kelly or McClellan, they had to pay for a fair value for that facility they are using. In other words, you can't take a $200 million facility and give it to a private contractor for a dollar a year and say now that's fair competition. That is not fair competition. 
The second thing we did was say, according to the GAO--and this has been pointed out already by several Members here--that if you leave three air logistics centers operating at 50 percent capacity, the cost annually to the taxpayers is $468 million. So that has to be considered. 
Those are the two major changes that were made. I agree I think they did a good job coming up with these. Even though that would still violate the intent of the BRAC system, that at least made that fair. 
There is one last thing I will say and then I will put this to rest. I am not going to say anything more about this. I am going to read this one more time, because I think it is really significant. 
I came to the U.S. House of Representatives, before I was elected to this body, in 1986. That was a year that a Congressman--I might add, and say to the senior Senator from Texas, he also is a Ph.D. He got his from Oklahoma, you got yours from Texas--he came out with an idea how we can close the excess capacity, the infrastructure, and do it without political interference. So he came up with the idea of the BRAC committee. The BRAC committee was supposed to be free from political interference. 
I hope every Member who is watching on their tube right now, anyone who is going to come down here and vote on this, will listen to this. This is what Representative Dick Armey, the author of the BRAC process, said on June 23, 1997:  
We had three rounds of base closing, and we are all very proud of the process because politics never intruded into the process. That ended in round four. And all of my colleagues knew at the time, and we know now, that the special conditions for McClellan and Kelly, California and my own State of Texas, where you might think I have a parochial interest, were in a political invention. 
We talk about this being privatization. No, it is not. It is a new concept. It is privatization in place, created specifically for these two bases in an election year for no purpose other than politics. 
With that, Mr. President, I think we beat up that issue. We have argued and debated this hours and hours on the floor. I know Senators from Texas and California would like to have an opportunity to have more jobs in their States, but that is exactly what the BRAC process was put in place to prevent. 
In the remaining time, let me just make a couple of comments. I am the chairman of the Readiness Subcommittee, and I can tell you right now, during this process it was very civil, in our Senate Armed Services Committee, but we didn't agree on everything. 
Quite frankly, I agreed with the Senator from Alaska as far as the National Guard was concerned. I did not agree with Senator Levin, the ranking minority member, as far as the B-2 was concerned, but we voted on it. I lost and they won. So we went through this very arduous process and successfully came up with a bill. 
In the meantime, I have been spending my time as chairman of the Readiness Subcommittee all over America and all over the world going to our various installations. I can tell you right now, we have a very serious problem in defending America. We can't do it. 
As pointed out by the Senator from Connecticut, for 13 consecutive years, we have reduced every year our defense budget at a time when most people realize, finally, that we have a greater threat facing America than we have had since World War II. Yet, we are at one-half the force strength that we were in 1991. I am talking about the number of Army divisions, the number of Air Force wings, the number of ships floating out there. 
So it is a very critical thing, and it is exacerbated by the fact that we have troops in places like Bosnia. It is very, very expensive. The President said it wouldn't be over $2 billion. It is now looking at closer to $6.5 billion to $8 billion. Where does that come from? It comes from the defense budget. 
While this is not a perfect product--can I have 1 more minute from the Senator from South Carolina?

Mr. INHOFE. I thank the senior Senator from Texas. 
Mr. President, I will only conclude we do have a very serious problem in talking to the troops out there about tempo. We have these guys operating at about 60 percent higher capacity than they are supposed to be operating. Sure, they can handle it for a while, but the divorce rate is up, the retention rate is down, and we have a serious problem in our underfunding of our military. 
I would like to have done a better job than we did in this bill, but this was the best we could do in the spirit of compromise on a bipartisan basis. I strongly support the passage of our Defense authorization bill. Thank you.

Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, this morning the Senate will be in a period of morning business until 11 a.m. At 11 a.m. the Senate will proceed to the cloture vote on H.R. 2646, the A-plus education savings account bill. If cloture is not invoked, the majority leader hopes consent will be granted to set the cloture vote on a motion to proceed to S. 1269, the fast-track legislation, at 2:30 p.m. If that is not possible, the Senate will recess following the 11 a.m. vote until 2:30 p.m. Otherwise, under the consent the Senate will recess from 12:30 p.m. to 2:30 p.m. for the weekly policy luncheons to meet. When the Senate reconvenes at 2:30 p.m., the Senate will proceed to the cloture vote on the motion to proceed to S. 1269, the fast-track legislation. If cloture is invoked, the Senate will begin debate on the motion to proceed to S. 1269. 
In addition, the Senate may also consider and complete action on the D.C. appropriations bill, the FDA Reform conference report, the Intelligence authorization conference report, and any additional legislative or executive items that can be cleared for action. Therefore, Members can anticipate rollcall votes throughout Tuesday's session of the Senate. 
As a reminder to all Members, the first rollcall vote will occur at 11 a.m. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senators will have until the time of the vote for filing of second-degree amendments to H.R. 2646, the A-plus Education Savings Act.

<TEXT>
Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, let me just real quickly cover some of the things that have been said in the last 10 or 15 minutes. 
First of all, I do not like the way this ended up because we had to agree, in order to bring everyone in and to have a unanimous vote in the Senate Armed Services Committee, to allow the President of the United States to interfere and to politicize the BRAC process for the first time since it went in place in the round of 1989. 
Second, a quote has been attributed to me that I do not think that the private sector is going to want to bid on this. I think that is accurate, because the private sector would have liked very much to bid if they could get free--for maybe a dollar a year--a huge facility down in Texas or one in California. Sure, that would be certainly to their advantage, but the taxpayers would lose. 
All we are saying is: If you want to have free and open competition, let us take all costs, direct and indirect costs, to the Department of Defense and throw them in there. 
Two big costs: No. 1, the cost of the installation that would be used if privatization in place took place; and, No. 2, the cost of the excess capacity in the remaining three air logistics centers, which the GAO said would be about $468 million a year. 
Third, in terms of charges that have been made about competition, no one in this Chamber is going to be able to stand any higher than I do on my background in privatization. When I was mayor of Tulsa, I privatized everything that wouldn't move. 
This is different. This is our Nation's defense. However, this bill provides for privatization. It just says that we are going to have to take all costs into consideration. 
Fourth, there is one other area in the bill. It is called `teaming.' Right now under the current law, if this should be defeated, the private sector would not be able to go to the air logistics center in Georgia or anyplace else and compete because they are precluded from doing so. This defense authorization bill provides for much greater opportunity for the private sector to compete. 
The issue that the junior Senator from California brought up on privatization in place--she was not in here when I covered the details in that. The BRAC recommendations specifically precluded privatization in place for the air logistics centers. She quoted words out of the BRAC language, but she neglected to read the last sentence, which I will read to you: `Move the required equipment and any required personnel to the receiving locations.' 
Mr. President, you, of course, are a businessman. We have already heard your pitch. I agree with everything that you said. But the cost of keeping three air logistics centers at 50 percent capacity is a huge cost and has to be considered in the consideration of this. 
I came to the House of Representatives in 1987. That was my first year. One of the persons I had the most respect for was a Congressman by the name of Dick Armey. And Dick Armey, for the first time, convinced me that we have a real serious problem with excess capacity. We have never been able to do away with it because of the political interference of the local Congressman, of the Senators, and sometimes of the President. 
So he set up a system called the BRAC process. This process was to be free of any political interference--any political interference. He said, `Someday I'm going to regret this because I'm going to have to go against my own State when we have to close down some type of installation.' 
But you know, Mr. President, it worked. We went through, not three, as the senior Senator from Texas suggested, but we went through four BRAC rounds--1989, 1991, 1993, and 1995. During these BRAC rounds, we closed over 100 major installations. 
I suggest to you, Mr. President, that we would not have been able to close one of them if it had not been for Dick Armey from Texas, the Congressman who established the whole BRAC process. So while we talk about not having parochial interests, I can assure you that I do not. In fact, I am on record in the State of Oklahoma, in 1994, in my election to the Senate, the first time I was elected, they used it against me, because I said, `I will not use political interference and will not try to politicize the system.' That was used against me. 
So Congressman Armey prevailed. As a result of that, we have been able to close a lot of excess capacity. The other day he made a speech on the floor. Mr. President, I do not have the time--I was going to read the entire speech, but there isn't time remaining to do that. But I will just read one paragraph out of it. This is Congressman Dick Armey from the State of Texas:  
We had three rounds in base closing, and we are all very proud of the process because politics never intruded into the process. That ended in round four. And all of my colleagues knew at the time, and we know now, that the special conditions for McClellan and Kelly, California and my own State of Texas, where you might think I have a parochial interest, were in a political intervention. 
We talk about this being privatization. No, it is not. It is a new concept. It is privatization in place, created specifically for these two bases in an election year for no purpose other than politics. 
That is a quote from Texas Congressman Dick Armey, the founder of this system. 
Finally, Mr. President, they keep talking about, `We had a deal.' There was never any deal that was had. We have been 
negotiating this thing now for well over a year. And we negotiated it in years prior to this. We are trying now to get a defense authorization bill. We have caved in. We have provided for privatization in place so long as we take all costs into consideration. 
When it has been stated several times by the distinguished senior Senator from Texas that only a small number or group of people are concerned about this, I suggest to you that this bill that we are talking about, this conference report was passed out of the Senate Armed Services Committee by a vote of 18 to zero--18 to zero. 
A couple of nights ago--last night I guess it was--it was voted on in the House of Representatives. The vote was 286 to 123. I suggest to the senior Senator from California, if she is convinced that the President is going to veto this, we have the votes to override a veto. We are not going to allow the President to say, `I'm vetoing a bill because I want to politicize the system for the first time since its inception in 1988.' 
So, Mr. President, I feel very strongly that we have an opportunity here to have a defense authorization bill that does far more than correct a problem that has been there in the depots. It takes care of many, many needs to try to keep America strong. I agree with the Senator from Texas when he talks about the fact that our defense has been decimated. It has been decimated. We are going to try to do something about saving, in this case with this change in the air logistics centers, some $468 million a year. 
Mr. President, there are two individuals who are here who have not been heard from. I ask unanimous consent that both the chairman and the ranking minority member of the Senate Armed Services Committee be allowed to speak for 1 minute each.

seems customary on this floor to say how much you appreciate and love somebody and respect them. Of course, there is no better evidence of my affection for the senior Senator from Texas than the fact that back when--some may have forgotten that he ran for President. In the primary, he ran against the then majority leader Bob Dole. I openly supported the senior Senator from Texas over Senator Bob Dole, which was politically pretty dumb for me to do. But I did it because I felt he is a very capable individual. 
Having said that, I would like to respond to the items that he has stated in his statement. Let me cover a couple of things that the distinguished Senator from Texas talked about. 
For openers, the Senator from Texas stated that the BRAC Commission, during their process in 1995, offered as an alternative to privatize in place. Let me suggest to you, Mr. President, that is not the case. It was the case in Newark, it was the case in Louisville, it was the case in the Naval Air Warfare Center in Indianapolis; but it was not the case in either McClellan Air Force Base or Kelly Air Force Base. The reason I say that is that, specifically in those first three instances where they did privatize in place, the BRAC report said specifically `privatize in place.' Contrary to that, in the 1995 round, it specifically said that whatever happens, whether it is privatization or anything else, you have to move the required equipment and any required personnel to the receiving locations. 
I think we all know why that is the case. If you have five air logistic centers, each one operating at 50 percent capacity and you close the two least efficient ones, according to the BRAC Commission, you then would transfer that workload, and if you didn't transfer that workload, you would have to somehow account for paying for 50 percent of overhead that isn't being used. 
Now, when we talk about what this bill does, it is true that we are including in any competition a value for the vacancy that occurs, or the 50 percent capacity that is not being used in the remaining ALC's. There would be three remaining. That is only reasonable because there is a tremendous value to that. 
Second, we are also providing a value of the actual real estate value of the facilities that would be used. For example, if the Senator from Texas wanted competition to come in and use Kelly Air Force Base, it would not be fair competition to say, fine, you could have it for $1 a year. Instead, the bill provides that it would have to be for the value of that institution. Those are dollars that otherwise would be spent on our defense system. 
Third, I mention the question as to whether or not President Clinton made a political statement when he suggested out in Sacramento, CA, that they were going to leave that alone, I would like to read his statement to you. It says: 
On July 1, you were dealt a serious blow when the independent Base Closing Commission said that we ought to shut Kelly down. At my insistence and my refusal to go along with that specific recommendation, the Air Force developed the privatization in place plan that will keep thousands of jobs here at this depot. 
That is right before the Presidential election. If you look at this one sentence which says, `At my insistence and my refusal to go along with that specific recommendation * * *' that in and of itself is a very clear violation of both the intent and the letter of the BRAC process. 
I yield to the majority leader.

Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, today we will be having some conversation on the floor concerning the global warming treaty. I will make a few comments concerning that in that I am the chairman of the Clean Air Committee of the Environment and Public Works Committee. We have had extensive hearings on this. I will review just very briefly what we have learned from the hearing that we held in our subcommittee in the Environment and Public Works Committee insofar as global warming is concerned. 
In July, the Environmental Committee had a hearing on the global climate change treaty and we heard from five top scientists. 
The conclusions I found were very interesting, particularly since last night when I watched Administrator Carol Browner talk about the scientific evidence that is conclusive concerning global climate change. That is not at all what we found in our hearing. We had five of the top scientists around. While there is a large body of scientific research, there is much controversy and disagreement in scientific facts being misrepresented by the administration and the press. 
Four things that we came to a conclusion on were, No. 1, we don't know how much human activity has influenced the climate. One scientist before our committee said it could be as much as 6 percent. 
Second, if you look at satellite data, we are not sure if there has been any global warming. We had a very interesting session that lasted more than an hour with viewing the satellites and what conclusions could come, and there was no conclusive evidence that there has actually been any global warming. 
Three, even if we eliminate all manmade emissions, it may not have a noticeable impact on the environment, and the treaty may only eliminate emissions here in the United States and not in the entire world. 
Four, when asked, all five scientists stated that we would not have the uncertainties understood by this December, when the administration plans on making a decision regarding the treaty. 
Now, we found out yesterday that the President came and made his announcement. It is kind of interesting, Mr. President, because we passed a resolution on the floor of the Senate, by 95 to 0, that said we would reject any type of a treaty that came from Kyoto that didn't treat the developing nations the same as the developed nations. So the President came out with something where he is calling for a binding 30 percent reduction in emission levels by the year 2012. He calls this an important first step, with more reductions to follow. 
As chairman of the Armed Services Readiness Subcommittee, I can tell you that this is going to have a profound negative affect on our ability to defend America, as the President stated yesterday that the military accounts for 43 percent of the Federal energy use. The Federal Government cannot reduce by 30 percent or more without significant cuts in the military. I think this equates to something like a 3 to 7 times greater cut than the Btu tax of 1993. 
One of the things that bothered me more than anything else is the moving target that we are dealing with. In March of 1995 in a House Commerce Committee hearing, Congressmen Dingell and Schaefer raised concerns that the new targets may not apply to all countries equally, and on behalf of the administration, Mr. Rafe Pomerance, a Deputy Assistant Secretary of the State Department said, `Our goal, Mr. Chairman, is that all parties participate in this next round of negotiations. We want to see that all governments participate and help define the post-2000 regime.' 
One month later, the administration signed on to the Berlin Mandate to review the commitments made to reduce the greenhouse gases and adopt targets for further reductions. The conference differentiated between developed and developing nations. They signed on to this, totally at odds and contradicting the commitment made to the Congressmen. 
In June 1996, Mr. Pomerance stated, `Are we going to agree to legally binding instrument in Geneva? No way.' One month later, Under Secretary Wirth announced that the United States supported a legally binding emissions target. 
I want to also say that this has not changed since September 1996. It is before the same Commerce Committee. Assistant Secretary of State Eileen Claussen told Congressman Dingell and the committee that the United States would not be bound before we have completed the economic analysis and assessments. We have just learned that the administration's efforts to analyze the economic effects has failed. The models they used did not work, and we will not understand the effect on our nations's economy certainly before December. 
The reason I am concerned about this is, there is a very interesting parallel between what they are trying to do in the absence of any scientific evidence in global climate change, which has a dramatic deteriorating effect on our ability to be competitive on a global basis and on the ambient air changes promulgated by this administration. We all know that, just about a year ago, Carol Browner came out and unilaterally suggested--and now has promulgated--the rule change to lower the ambient air standards in both particulate matter and in ozone. We find that during the various hearings that we have had that Mary Nichols, who is immediately under Carol Browner, said that the cost would be $9 billion to put these standards in--the cost to the American people. At the same time, the President's Economic Advisory Committee said it was $60 billion a year. The Reason Foundation estimated the costs between $90 billion and $150 billion. This would cost the average family of four some $1,700 a year. 
They talk about the deaths, and Carol Browner reused this yesterday. There would be 60,000 premature deaths. Those deaths were lowered by the EPA last November to 40,000; then in December to 20,000, and in April to 15,000. Then the scientist who discovered the mathematic mistake now says it's less than 1,000. In our committee, Mary Nichols admitted these regulations would not save any lives over the next 5 years. 
I have watched how Carol Browner goes around and makes promises. She says to the mayors of America, `This isn't going to affect you.' She says to the farmers, `This isn't going to affect you.' She says to small businesses, `This won't affect you.' To some of the parishes in Louisiana that were found to be out of attainment, she said, `This isn't going to make you do anything because the problem is for the neighboring State of Texas to the west; they are going to have to do this.' 
So, Mr. President, I only ask the question, why is this obsession taking place in the administration if there is no scientific justification on either global warming or ambient air standards? Why are they trying to do this in eroding our personal freedoms? I think probably the best way to answer that is to read an article in Forbes magazine, called `Watch Out For This Woman; The EPA's Carol Browner is exploiting health and the environment to build a power base.' 
If you read this article, Mr. President, it says:  
If science isn't Browner's strong point, political tactics are. Her enemies can only envy the way the EPA uses the courts. 
. . . For her part, Browner often dismisses as simple male chauvinism any criticism of her hardball tactics. 
. . . She learned politics working on Gore's Senate staff, where she rose to be his legislative director before heading back to Florida to head the State environmental commission. 
. . . She is an environmentalist zealot.

Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, tomorrow we will be holding public hearings on a bill that is very significant. It is Senate bill 1084. 
Back almost a year ago, in November of last year, the Administrator of the EPA, Carol Browner, came out with the recommendation and the rule change to lower the ambient air standards as they pertained to particulate matter and to ozone. 
After looking at this, we found that there was at that time no scientific justification for lowering the ambient air standards. Consequently we started having hearings. 
Our first hearing was with the scientific community. We had representation there from CASAC, that is the Clean Air Science Advisory Committee. It was somewhat unanimous among all the scientific community that there is no scientific justification for lowering standards. 
One of the things that was rather interesting that came up in that first hearing was a group of young children, we understand now, that came from some hospital who came in wearing masks, as if to say, `You must lower these standards or we're not going to be able to breathe.' 
I think a great disservice was done because it came out during the course of that hearing that these children used breathers, respirators; they were using various medical equipment that has the chemical CFC in it that allows them to breathe. At precisely the same time that the Administrator of the EPA was saying that we had to do something about lowering the ambient air standards so these young people could breathe, I asked for a show of hands as to how many of them used, in their particular medical devices, CFC's. Every hand went up. 
I asked, `How many of you are aware of the fact that Administrator Browner, the same one who is advocating lowering the standards, has said she's going to take CFC's off the market so you folks would not be able to use these in your breathers?' 
I was pleased to find out this morning that Senator Tim Hutchinson from Arkansas has introduced legislation that will keep the EPA and the other various bureaucracies from taking this chemical off the market. I certainly applaud him for that. I will join him in that effort. 
Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, 10 days ago was the 25th anniversary of a policy in this country that was articulated in a treaty called the ABM Treaty. It was a treaty that many of us at that time did not think was in the best interests of this country. It was a treaty that came from the Nixon administration, a Republican administration. Of course, Henry Kissinger was the architect of that treaty in 1972. 
Essentially what it did was say to any adversaries out there that we will agree to disarm and not to be prepared to defend ourselves if you agree to do the same thing. Some people refer to it as mutual assured destruction, a policy I certainly did not adhere to at the time, did not feel was good policy for this country. However, there was an argument at that time, because we had two superpowers--we had the then Soviet Union and of course the United States--and at that time we had pretty good intelligence on them, they had pretty good intelligence on us, so I suppose we would be overly critical if we said there was just no justification for that program, even though I personally disagreed with it at that time. 
Since that time, starting in 1983 in the Reagan administration, we have elevated the debate that there is a great threat out there and that threat is from the many countries that now have weapons of mass destruction. Over 25 nations now have those weapons, either chemical, biological, or nuclear weapons. The critics, those who would take that money and apply it to social programs as opposed to defending our Nation, use such titles as `star wars,' and they talk about the billions of dollars that have been invested. 
Anyway, we are at a point right now where something very interesting has happened just recently. That is, on this 25th anniversary, we have found that the Clinton administration, just about 10 days ago, agreed to create new parties to the ABM Treaty. That would be Belarus, Kazakhstan, Ukraine, and Russia. This is going to have to come before this body. I think this is an opportunity that we need to be looking for, because all it would take is 34 Senators to reject this multilateralization of the ABM Treaty. 
Right now we have a number of systems that we are putting into place to defend the United States of America, both the national missile defense as well as a theater defense. Certainly, with what is going on right now in Russia and Iran, the need for such a system has been elevated in the minds of most Americans. 
We have right now, as we speak, 22 Aegis ships that are floating out there in the ocean, already deployed. They have the capability of knocking down missiles when they are coming in. All we have to do is take them to the upper tier, and we will have in place a national missile defense system. Certainly that is something that could take care of our theater missile needs. So several of us feel that we should go ahead and conclude that is the system that we need. However, that does violate, probably violates, the ABM Treaty, as it is in place today. So I believe we should take this opportunity that is there, when it comes before this body for ratification, to reject this and thereby kill the ABM Treaty, which certainly is outdated. 
By the way, it is interesting, the very architect of that treaty, Dr. Henry Kissinger, someone whose credentials no one will question, even though they may question some of his previous policy decisions, Dr. Kissinger, who is the architect of the 1972 ABM Treaty, now says it is nuts to make a virtue out of your vulnerability. He is opposed to continuing the ABM Treaty at this time. 
So I hope we will take this opportunity to get out from under a treaty that imposes restrictions on our ability to defend ourselves and reject the upgraded system, or the treaty, as it comes before us and take this opportunity to defend America. 
We have an opportunity to get out from under the restriction imposed upon us by the ABM Treaty. 
We have an opportunity to elevate our Aegis system. 
We have an opportunity to defend America. 
After all, Mr. President, isn't that what we are supposed to be doing?

Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate has seen fit to pass the Oklahoma City National Memorial Act of 1997 (S. 871). I believe this was an important piece of legislation and one deserving immediate enactment. Once again, I would like to thank my colleague, Senator Nickles, for being the originating and driving force behind this piece of legislation in the Senate and Representative Lucas for shepherding through similar legislation in the House. 
Earlier, when we considered this bill, we were given the opportunity and the responsibility of remembering a unique group of American heroes. To most, these individuals are nameless, faceless victims of a savage terrorist attack. However, to friends and family of the victims they are remembered as far more. They are remembered as husbands, wives, and children. It was important for the rest of us to recognize the lives of these men, women, and children in their proper context. 
The 168 individuals who were killed during this cowardly attack, as well as those who were fortunate to survive, deserve our honor and utmost respect. It is fitting that the memorial was designed to honor them both in an appropriate and visible way. The victims of the bombing represent the true backbone of America. Their lives serve as a testament to what this country is, what it can be, and what will be. As heroes, they will be honored. As individuals, they will be missed, mourned, and remembered as the true embodiment of our great American spirit. 
In addition to the immediate victims of the bombing, we have also recognized the law enforcement officials, the emergency rescue personnel, and the countless volunteers who rushed to our aid in our moment of crisis. The proposed memorial's acknowledgment of not only the victims, but the others involved in the rescue process, was artfully done to remind all of us that we are part of a nation that cares and responds to those in need. 
The establishment of the memorial is not only appropriate but an important tool for teaching future generations of Americans what we are all about--coming together. It is also a reminder to us that the price of our freedom is eternal vigilance against those who would rob us of our sense of security through acts of terrorism. 
Throughout the entire legislative process, I was pleased to note the extent of involvement by the survivors and the families of those who tragically lost their lives, as well as the larger community. This type of cooperation is not only indicative of how Oklahomans get things done, but will result in a Memorial that is aesthetically designed and truly meaningful to all those who will visit the site for generations to come. 
In closing, I would like to thank my colleagues for recognizing the importance of this legislation and giving it their immediate attention. We can all be proud we will now have a suitable memorial to honor the lives of the men, women, and children killed in the bombing.  
Mr. FAIRCLOTH addressed the Chair.

 Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I rise today to commend Maj. Gen. Ray E. McCoy, USA, upon his retirement from the United States Army after more than 32 years of distinguished and dedicated service to our Nation. 
Major General McCoy, a native son of the Oklahoma farmland, graduated in 1965 from Oklahoma State University, where he received the prestigious Drummond Saber Award as the year's outstanding ROTC graduate. That honor was the harbinger of an extraordinary military career. 
After completing Infantry School and Ranger training, Ray McCoy served in a variety of combat and command assignments stateside and overseas, including two tours in Vietnam and one in Korea. In the operations theater, his abiding concern for his charges, his roll-up-your-sleeves approach to getting the mission done, and his tempered-steel military bearing earned him the respect of all who soldiered with and for him. 
As his career progressed, he served in a number of high-level staff positions at the Department of the Army, Joint Chiefs of Staff, the Army Material Command, and the Defense Logistics Agency [DLA] America's combat support agency. For the past 2 years, Major General McCoy has served as DLA's Principal Deputy Director. His vision and leadership were vital to the agency's business-process reengineering, which incorporated the best public and private sector practices. These initiatives elevated material readiness and strengthened the management and oversight of Defense contracts--and at markedly reduced cost to the taxpayers and the warfighters. Blending combat experience with business acumen, Ray McCoy was instrumental in the agency's successful efforts to accelerate logistics response and improve weapons-systems readiness. With Major General McCoy having led the charge, DLA is now a front line partner with combat and contingency operations forces in Bosnia and around the world. 
Whether it was on the rough terrain of the combat theater or behind a desk, Ray McCoy served his country with valor, loyalty, and integrity. With the physical stature of a sturdy oak and the energy of a southwestern tornado, Ray McCoy demonstrates time and time again that he truly deserves to be called a soldier's soldier. On the occasion of his retirement from the U.S. Army, I offer my congratulations and thanks to this esteemed son of the Sooner State, and wish him well in his future pursuits.

Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I was in the chair when I heard the very eloquent speech, of course, as always, by Senator Lieberman. One thing he said at the very last surprised me a little bit. I think kind of out of desperation he said, `We are only talking about $7 million. We try a lot of things that cost a lot more than that.' 
I am here to inform Senator Lieberman--and I believe he knows it already--that it has been tried. I started with our mutual friend, Tony Coelho, in 1993, who established an organization called the Washington Scholarship Fund. There were many Democrats and Republicans involved. Senator Kerrey, at that time, was an honorary chairman, and Bill Bennett was one of the honorary chairmen, also. Directors and advisors included Boyden Gray and Doreen Gentzler, a local Channel 4 TV news anchor. 
Our goal was to help needy or low-income families send their children to private school--the very thing we are talking about here. We were trying it through the private sector to see if it would work. What we did was not pay the entire scholarship, as we are talking about here, for a number of students, but to pay half of it. I think the average tuition is around $3,000 a year. Now, what we did was, we would offer a scholarship of $1,500 a year, so that the parents would have to pay half of it, so they would have to have an interest in that. To be eligible, they had to be residents of the District of Columbia. Ours was K through 8, as opposed to K through 12. I think K through 12 is probably better. They must be low-income by Federal standards. 
Anyway, we went ahead with this program on the half tuition. We had people lined up in the school year of 1993 and 1994, and we had 57 students. That is about $75,000 that we raised privately for these one-half scholarships. Last year, we were up to 250 students that we helped. That is a substantial increase. But the interesting thing is that we have over 800 now on a waiting list. I am sure that there are probably more out there waiting that are not familiar with the program. But it is overwhelmingly successful. In the schools, they concentrate on strong values, basic reading and writing and math skills, and we have a lot of parental involvement. 
A lot of people are not aware that in Washington, DC, there are at least 25 private schools with tuitions less than $2,500 a school year. They average about $3,000. Most of the private schools in the District of Columbia operate way below capacity, or their average tuition probably could come down, they would estimate. 
The Washington Scholarship Fund is one of 32 private school scholarship programs nationwide in cities like Milwaukee, Los Angeles, New York, and, in fact, there is one in the home State of Senator Coats, in Indianapolis. They are currently helping approximately 12,000 needy children, and they have 40,000 on a waiting list. 
Well, when I heard the Senator from Connecticut say he didn't know exactly how much it was costing the public school system in Washington, DC, I think he is right because the accounting system, as he points out, is very poor. However, I have heard the range to 
be somewhere between $7,700 and $10,000. So here we are talking about being able to give a better education at approximately one-third of the cost--in other words, for the same cost, reaching three times the number of children.

Mr. INHOFE. I am sorry, I have to use my time. The dropout rate is a problem. I will read a couple of things that I think are significant. 
One of the mothers, named Voni Eason, said: 
My son loves the school. He even likes the uniform. He feels like he's a grown man. Without an education--and a good, strong education--he's not going to have a job. Without the Washington Scholarship Fund, he wouldn't be able to go to his school. 
That is a mother making a testimonial. 
Tanya Odemns' son actually tried the public schools system in Washington, DC. She said: 
My son wasn't learning anything. He didn't know his ABCs, didn't know how to spell his name . . . public school didn't give him any homework. I know my son is very intelligent and wants to learn. When I heard about the Washington Scholarship Fund, I just hopped on it real quick. [Now] he's excited when he comes home, wants to do homework. 
Mr. President, it has been tried and it is successful. It works. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, Mother Teresa, truly a saint, died last week at age 87. I think we have all talked about her and the fact she dedicated her life to helping the poor and the sick, the dying around the world, particularly in India. But I remember so well a morning on February 3, 1994. It was a National Prayer Breakfast. We had invited Mother Teresa to come and be our speaker. She did not reject. She just said, well, if the Lord is willing, I will be there. And we said, do you think he will be willing? And she wasn't too sure. 
Nonetheless, she did show up and we had an audience of 3,000 people in the hotel, including the President and his wife, and the Vice President and Mrs. Gore, and congressional leaders, people from all over the Hill and from all over America. Every State was represented, almost every country was represented, and, of course, in addition to that there was a television audience of millions. 
Mother Teresa gave really an extraordinary speech. It was referred to by columnist Cal Thomas as `the most startling and bold proclamation of truth to power I have heard in my more than 30 professional years in Washington.' 
I think a lot of us know Peggy Noonan. She was the speech writer for Ronald Reagan. She called it `a breathtaking act of courage.' 
In describing it she said Mother Teresa was introduced and spoke of God and love and families. She said, `We must love one another and care for one another.' And she described it that there were `great purrs of agreement' from the audience. And I remember that so well because I was one who was purring. 
But the speech became more pointed at that moment. 
Mother Teresa--and I am quoting now, Mr. President--said: 
I feel that the greatest destroyer of peace today is abortion, because it is a war against the child, a direct killing of the innocent child, murder by the mother herself. And if we accept that a mother can kill her own child, how can we tell people not to kill one another? 
She said: 
By abortion, the mother does not learn to love but kills even her own child to solve her problems. And, by abortion, the father is told that he does not have to take any responsibility at all for the child he has brought into the world. That father is likely to put other women into the same trouble. So abortion just leads to more abortion. 
Then she said: 
Any country that accepts abortion is not teaching its people to love, but to use any violence to get what they want. This is why the greatest destroyer of love and peace is abortion. 
Mrs. Noonan described the scene: 
For about 1.3 seconds there was complete silence, then applause built up and swept across the room. But not everyone: the President and the First Lady, the Vice President and Mrs. Gore looked like seated statues at Madame Tussaud's, glistening in the lights and moving not a muscle. 
I remember when Mother Teresa then looked over at President and Mrs. Clinton and she said: 
Please don't kill the child. I want the child. Please give me the child. I am willing to accept any child who would be aborted and to give that child a married couple who will love the child and be loved by the child. 
From here, a sign of care for the weakest of weak--the unborn child--must go out to the world. If you become a burning light of justice and peace in the world, then really you will be truest to what the founders of this country stood for. 
Mr. President, we must revere Mother Teresa for what she was, the saint that she was, and we must remember her. But I think most of all we must listen to her. I repeat: `Any country that accepts abortion is not teaching its people to love but to use any violence to get what they want. This is why the greatest destroyer of love and peace is abortion.' 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, my amendment would provide $2,225,000 to establish a demonstration project to assist persons with disabilities due to the loss of a limb to return to work. 
According to a 1996 GAO report on SSA disability programs, `[r]eturn-to-work strategies and practices may hold the potential for improving federal disability programs by helping people with disabilities return to productive activity in the workplace and at the same time reduce program costs.' 
The GAO report goes on to note that the three most important strategies to mainstream individuals back into the work force are: intervene as soon as possible; identify and provide necessary return-to-work assistance; and structure benefits to encourage people to return to work. 
Using these GAO suggestions as a guide, I have attempted to address the medical, rehabilitative, and job training needs of individuals who have lost their limbs. 
Experience has shown that for people who have lost limbs, access to appropriate medical rehabilitation can mean the difference between prolonged dependence and a successful return to the work place. Due to advancement in modern rehabilitation medicine, persons who experience limb loss can now routinely expect to attain high levels of independence and functionality. 
Over the last several years, I have worked with Limbs for Life Foundation which provides financial help to amputees nationwide. As a result of my association with them, I have observed that a significant percentage of people who lose limbs do not return to the work force and subsequently become dependent on Social Security's Supplemental Security Income [SSI] and Disability Insurance [DI] programs. A leading cause for this dependence has been the inability to gain access to appropriate rehabilitation care. 
According to the Social Security Administration, less than half of 1 percent of Social Security beneficiaries return to work. Yet, they also estimate that as many as 3 out of 10 persons on disability may be good candidates for return to work but the system does not encourage it. 
I believe this partial due to the Social Security Administration's process for determining disability which does not generally assess the individuals functional capacity to work, but rather presumes that certain medical conditions are in themselves sufficient to preclude work. However, the link between medical condition and work incapacity is weak. While there are certainly some medical impairments which prevent individuals from working, others factors such as vocational, psychological, economic, environmental, and motivational are often more important determinants of work capacity. 
My proposed demonstration program will result in a better rate of return to work because it will provide people with the tools needed to successfully overcome many of the impediments which have traditionally held them back from main streaming into the work place. 
Specifically, by providing appropriate prosthetic and rehabilitation services, followed by an intensive regimen of occupational therapy the demonstration program will prepare amputees to meet the physical demands of the work place. Practical assistance such as job training and job placement are also critical for successful main streaming and would be a part of the program. 
Not only will we be helping people who want to work, but will more effectively spend our limited disability money. The Social Security Administration's estimates that lifetime cash benefits are reduced by $60,000 when an individual receiving Disability Insurance returns to work; $30,000 when an individual receiving Supplemental Security Income returns to work. 
The Limbs for Life Foundation has estimated that they could provide services for 775 individuals with the proposed $2,225,000 demonstration program. Under their proposal, this money would be combined with the Foundation's own funds and services and result in a net savings of $9 million. 
Mr. President, I believe this is a sound investment and I urge my colleagues to support my amendment.

Mr. INHOFE. I thank the senior Senator from Oklahoma. 
Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator Nickles in support of S. 871, the Oklahoma City National Memorial Act of 1997. I think it is a compassionate piece of legislation that deserves and will receive support for immediate passage. 
I thank, not just my colleague, Senator Nickles, for being the driving force behind this, but also express my appreciation to my colleagues on the Energy and Natural Resources Committee for acting so quickly to bring this matter before us. 
Mr. President, it is very easy for us to stand here and for people who were not out there at the time to be compassionate, to be sensitive to the needs of Oklahoma. But I can tell you, after having been there when it happened, it is indescribable when you go through a building that has parts of human bodies stuck to the walls and you see things that are crumbling. 
My son is an orthopedic surgeon. One of his partners actually had to go in during this thing and amputate a lady's leg, with no anesthetic, to extract her from that. 
Good friends, my closest friends, Don and Sally Ferrell lost their daughter. She was an attorney for HUD. Polly Nichols was not even in the building and came within a quarter of an inch of dying from flying glass. 
This is an opportunity for us to say to these people how much we love them. The 168 individuals who were killed during this cowardly attack and those who were fortunate to survive deserve our honor and respect. It is a fitting memorial that has been designed to honor not just the individuals who lost their lives, but the families of those who lost their lives and those who are survivors. 
Beyond the immediate victims of the bombing, we also recognize law enforcement officers and emergency people. I can remember on the first night, as I was walking toward the building, hearing this thundering cadence behind me. I turned to see several hundred firemen, all dressed up with their emergency equipment. They were not just from Oklahoma; they were from all over America, from as far away as right here, from Maryland. They were going in there, each one of them taking 30-minute spells. They were volunteers. They did not have to do this. They went in knowing they could very well lose their lives crawling through the rubble of a building still crumbling to save lives. 
So there are many, many heroes in this thing. And this is certainly a fitting tribute. 
I can only say, on behalf of all Oklahomans, we thank you for your generosity, your promptness, and your compassion.

Mr. INHOFE. Let me make a couple comments. Since we are down to a few minutes, there will not be the time for detail which I will go into later. 
Yesterday, Senator Breaux and I introduced S. 1084 entitled the `Ozone and Particulate Matter Research Act of 1997.' This bill offers a simple solution to a very serious problem. I think there is a large segment of the population out there that will consider this bill to be singly the most significant of this legislative session. 
In essence, this legislation provides the authority and resources to conduct the necessary scientific research and monitoring for the national ambient air quality standards for ozone and particulate matter. It reinstates the preexisting standards for both pollutants and requires the agency to wait until the research is complete before they revise the standards. 
The bill creates an independent panel which will be convened by the National Academy of Sciences to prioritize the needed particulate matter research. This would take the politics out of setting research priorities. Next, a panel will be created to oversee the Federal research program in order to ensure that the priorities set out will be followed. 
Mr. President, just to bring us up to date here in this short period of time, last November the Administrator of the EPA came out with a message on behalf of the administration stating that we should change our ambient air standards so far as ozone and particulate matter are concerned. In particulate matter, it would mean that we would drop it down from 10 microns to 2.5 microns. In ozone, which is measured by parts per million, it would drop it down from .12 to .08. 
While that sounds technical and a little confusing to some people, the bottom line is that many counties throughout the United States would find themselves out of attainment with these new standards. I can tell you, when I was mayor of the city of Tulsa and we were out of attainment, how difficult it was. There was not any possibility of recruiting any new industry. A lot of industries had been shut down or had to reduce the number of shifts they had. We had to impose various requirements for car pooling and impose things that really changed the lifestyle of our citizens. 
The problem is that when the Administrator came out with the proposed new standards in November, we did some research only to find out that there is no scientific justification for lowering the standards. In fact, as the chairman of the Clean Air Subcommittee of the Environment and Public Works Committee, I held my first hearing, a scientific hearing, where we had members of CASAC--that is the Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee--to come in and advise us as to what the science is behind these recommended changes, only to find that there is no scientific consensus behind these recommended changes. In fact, these experts said there is no bright line, as they call it, for ozone levels beyond which it can be said to be detrimental to human health. As far as particulate matter is concerned, they say there is no science that concludes that there is any causal relationship between any level or type of 2.5-micron particulate matter and respiratory diseases. When asked how long it would take to establish such conclusions, they said it would be approximately 5 years before we should know. 
Consequently, we feel that legislation is warranted to postpone any decision to set an arbitrary new standard for these pollutants. Instead we need more study and this bill provides for it. Clearly, as you can see from the original sponsor and cosponsor as well as from those behind a corresponding bill in the other body, this is a bipartisan effort. It is a bipartisan effort that wants clean air, that wants us to make sure that we do not impose any hardships on the American people which are going to be costly and make us noncompetitive on a global basis, inconvenience the American people, and cost us billions of dollars unless there is some scientific justification for it. 
I have been critical of EPA. When their proposed rules first came out, the Agency claimed the new standards were needed to prevent 40,000 premature deaths per year due to respiratory problems. Then some months later they changed that to 20,000 deaths, and then recently they knocked that down again to a much smaller amount. At the same time, a research group called the Reason Foundation out in California concluded that a more accurate figure would be no more than 1,000 premature deaths, if that. So there has been a lot of scare talk around. And a lot of misinformation. 
We hear many say that those of us who differ with the EPA don't want dirty air. Let me assure you, Mr. President, I have four kids and six grandkids. I do not want dirty air either. I care about their health and well-being as much, I dare say, as any public servant shuffling paper in some Federal agency. What I am concerned about is that we approach this issue in a rational and orderly manner. We should do the science first, we should know what's causing the problem, we should be clear about what is needed to address the problem and then take action with a proper consideration of all the consequences--both wanted and unwanted. What we don't want to do is put ourselves in a position where our philosophy is `ready, fire and aim' instead of the more reasonable `ready, aim and fire.' Unfortunately, the EPA wants to shoot first and ask questions later. This is not right. 
In the House of Representatives, on a bipartisan basis, H.R. 1984 was introduced, and this bill is very similar to the bill we are introducing. 
So I would like to suggest to you, Mr. President, that there is going to be a lot of activity during the August recess, a lot of education going on to make sure that people understand what is about to happen and to make sure we don't go ahead and adopt standards that are artificially reduced with inadequate science to justify those reduced standards. 
Mr. President, 12 o'clock being near, I yield the floor.  
Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.

Mr. INHOFE. I thank the Senator from New Mexico. 
To give you an idea of how this issue has been distorted, it was stated by the administration that, in the event that we do adopt the lower standards for ozone and particulate matter, they said it would only cost $9 billion. Yet, last week, when we had Mary Nichols, the EPA's Assistant Secretary for Air, she stated that the cost would be $9.1 billion, a very uneven number, making us believe there is some scientific reason for that, when, in fact, the Reason Foundation, out in California, concluded, in its study, that the cost is not going to be $9.1 billion if we adopt these standards. Instead, they say it is going to be somewhere between $90 and $150 billion. In fact, the President's own Council of Economic Advisers put the cost at $60 billion for the ozone standard alone. 
If we split the difference between the $90 and the $150 billion, that means that for a family of four on average income, it would cost them approximately $1,600 a year--$1,600 a year--to do something for which there is not adequate science to justify it. Second, the administration, in their scare tactics, back in November, said in the event we do not do this, it is going to result in 40,000 premature deaths a year. In December, they dropped that down to 20,000 premature deaths a year. In April, it came down to 15,000 premature deaths a year. Again, many groups now say it is less than 1,000. 
It was kind of interesting, because when we had the people who are trying to claim the number of premature deaths that would be there if we did not lower these ozone and particulate matter standards, I described the death of my beloved mother-in-law, which took place on New Year's Day. She was 94 years old. It was one of those deaths that was a real blessing; the time was here. Yet, the circumstances under which she died would have qualified her, according to these so-called experts, to be counted as a premature death. 
I think we have also been told things that are not true by the administration, when they say how many people are going to be affected. I have a chart here that we found by some accident, of the Southeastern part of the United States. This came out of the EPA. This is not my chart. What they are trying to say is only the counties, if we lower these standards, in the dark green would be affected in terms of having to come into compliance. Now we see these concentric circles around here covering more than half of this whole region, admitting at one point there would have to be some controls. They call this level 1 control region; level 2 control region--this would be level 2. In other words, the areas actually subject to some form of regulation under these new standards are much larger than people are sometimes being led to believe. So we are getting information that is certainly not consistent with the facts. 
Another criticism I have with the administration is how they have tried to sell this idea by singling out certain people. Certainly the Presiding Officer, being from Kansas, and the former chairman of the House Agriculture Committee, understands that this would have a tremendous effect on the agricultural community throughout the United States. You would have Government saying when you can disk, when you can till, when you can burn off a field, when you can use fertilizers, when you can harvest a crop. I can tell you right now, if you ask the average farmer in America what his biggest problem is, it's not the taxes; it's the overregulation that takes away his freedoms. I have often said, every time you increase regulation, you take away a degree of individual freedoms. That is exactly what they have done. 
So we have an administration which now says to the farmers, don't worry, we are going to exempt you; you are not going be affected by this. Then they went to the U.S. Conference of Mayors--and I have to say that I used to be the token conservative on the board of directors of the U.S. Conference of Mayors when I was mayor of Tulsa, OK. It's not really a conservative operation. Yet, they voted, in San Francisco, overwhelmingly, to reject these standards, and these are the mostly Democrats talking, not Republicans. 
Why are they concerned about it? They are concerned about it because they know if we bring these standards down, those mayors are going to be running cities that will be out of attainment. This will be another, probably the most severe, of what they call the unfunded mandates that has been out there. 
The administration also tried to single out small business, to say this is not going to affect small business. They even said that to one of the Congressmen from Louisiana: Well, you have seven parishes, but don't worry, we won't make you do anything, we'll get the people to the west so when the air flows over it is going to clean up your air. So it has been a very dishonest campaign by the administration. I really believe during the August recess we are going to be able to show the American people what this is really all about. 
Last year we passed two significant laws. One is called SBREFA, the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Act--SBREFA. The thrust of this bill is you can't pass a new rule, a new regulation, unless you explain its effect on small business. So, during one of our committee meetings, we asked the Director of the EPA, `Why is it that you have not explained what the effect of this will be on small business?' The response was, `There is no effect on small business.' 
I can assure you, Mr. President, all these farms that are small businesses--I can assure you, any small business that has an electric bill, when they say this is going to increase the electric bills by somewhere between 8 and 10 percent, that's an impact on small business. The response of the EPA is, `Wait a minute, all we are saying to the States is you have to come into attainment. You have to figure out how to do it. And whatever you do to your citizens to make that happen is your responsibility. So we--the EPA--are not the ones saying we are imposing a hardship.' 
We passed another bill, the unfunded mandates bill, that says we cannot pass regulations here that result in an unfunded mandate to political subdivisions below the Federal Government. Consequently, I can assure you, the U.S. Conference of Mayors, the National Association of Governors, and the National Association of State Legislators, the National League of Cities and all these groups that are so concerned about this, they know exactly what an unfunded mandate is. 
I anticipate, when the time comes that these standards are put into effect, or set, that there are going to be some lawsuits. I think the American Truckers Association already stated they are going to be suing the EPA. So my concern is, with all these lawsuits that will take place, that we resolve this issue to some satisfaction now, before we get locked in endless litigation. the best way to avoid this happening, the best way to avoid these arbitrary, onerous, and unjustified regulations, would be to go ahead and pass this legislation, which is S. 1084. 
I believe S. 1084 and H.R. 1984 will be passed, and I think they will be passed with a large enough margin to sustain a veto. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I saw a very interesting article in Friday's Washington Times that has brought to surface the truth that is so often avoided around here concerning our state of readiness in our Nation' defense system. 
As the chairman of the readiness subcommittee of the Senate Armed Services Committee, I have had occasion to visit many, many of the installations around the country. I have been in the European theater, most of the installations in England, Italy, Hungary, and, of course, several times to Bosnia, Camp Lejeune Marine Corps Base; Fort Hood, TX; Fort Bragg, NC; Corpus Christi Navy Air Base, and several others. What I am finding is that there are very serious problems they are facing. 
Mr. President, I know you are aware, as chairman of the personnel subcommittee, of some of these problems and how they are affecting our state of readiness. One of the contributing factors, of course, is our contingency operations. We have two serious problems with contingency operations. First of all, they are very expensive. We had occasion to narrowly lose our resolution of disapproval in order to keep our troops from being sent over to Bosnia here back in December 1995--only by four votes. And one of the determining factors was they said it would be a 12-month operation, which we all knew better, but they also said that the cost of the operation would not exceed $2 billion, it would be somewhere between $1.5 and $2 billion. At that time we felt, with mission creep and the fact it was easy to go in and very difficult to come out, that it would cost more. 
Well, sure enough. We are up there now, close to $7 billion it is going to cost us. 
Where does that money come from, Mr. President? It comes from our readiness accounts. This has become a very serious problem. 
The other problem is that it is using up our troops, keeping them from being able to be trained properly should an emergency come along, should some type of war operation become necessary to face. I have been going around, and they have been bringing out problems such as equipment is wearing out well before its projected lifetime, excessive usage of spare parts, pushing our people so hard they no longer have time to train. At almost every unit I saw maintenance personnel cannibalizing perfectly good, new equipment to keep other equipment working, which may solve the problem for today but it is very labor intensive by the time they get the machines working again. 
An Air Force maintenance officer told me, `Our lack of spares has caused us to cannibalize perfectly good engines to keep others operating, requiring my maintenance troops to work even more hours to keep our planes flying. Our normal workweek is now 50 to 56 hours a week.' 
With regard to OPTEMPO--when we talk about OPTEMPO, we are talking about the tempo of operations--an F-18 squadron commander told me, `The high OPTEMPO at which our personnel are operating is definitely causing a strain on our people's families and the strain also affects my pilots' job performance.' 
We know our retention is low. In my State of Oklahoma, we will spend--we actually save $86,000 a primary student. That is the savings. Imagine what it costs to put someone in training. Right now the airlines are coming along and taking some of our very best. And the ones I talked to, Mr. President, do not want to leave. They want to stay in. They are soldiers, they are fighters, but they have to do it. And their family situation is demanding that they do. 
An Air Force F-16 squadron commander said, `The number of days we fly to support Bosnia doesn't leave us with enough time to train. The only areas where we get training from our Bosnia missions is in reconnaissance and close air support. The rest of our training areas are suffering.' 
This goes on and on. An Air Force C-130 squadron commander told how they are now up to 160 days in their TDY as opposed to their goal of 120. 
Now, what does this do? It is quite obvious. When you talk to the services, you give them choices. You say, well, if you are going to have to take money to put in these contingency operations, it is going to either have to come out of force strength, readiness, quality of life, or modernization. Those are the only four areas over which we have control. And I can tell you that each one of the chiefs has said we cannot take any more money out of any of these areas. 
Now, there is an assumption around here that somehow we have a state of readiness that would allow America to protect itself in two regional contingencies. I can tell you right now 
that this is not the case. In fact, it has been stated by most of the chiefs now that we could not fight today the Persian Gulf war. 
I will just read a couple excerpts from the article that came out Friday morning. It is the first time I have seen it in print. It was in the Washington Times Friday morning. It said, `The Air Force is suffering from pilots who have lost faith in their generals, jet engines that still don't work after repairs, and maintenance depots with little quality of work being produced. Pilots complain of poorly equipped fighter wings, too much time away from their families, and air patrol types of missions that do little to hone their air combat skills.' And it goes on and on.

Mr. INHOFE. In conclusion, Mr. President, right now I think we are facing a very serious threat. I know there are people in this Chamber who would like to believe that the cold war is over and that there is no longer any real serious threat out there when, in fact, as I have said several times before, I am not the only one who looks back wistfully at the days of the cold war; at least then we had two superpowers and we had an idea of what the Soviet Union at that time had. We could predict what they were going to do. They have a more predictable type of personality. Our intelligence knew more about what their capabilities were. Today we have 25 or 30 nations out there, run by the type of people who murder their own grandchildren, and here we are in a position where we could very easily be challenged in two geographic areas. 
So, Mr. President, I hope as we progress here and as we follow through the rest of the year we can change some of the attitudes in this Chamber and over in the other Chamber and in the White House as concerns our ability to defend America.

Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, as chairman of the Clean Air Subcommittee, we have had about 40 hours of hearings on this subject, on global warming as well as ambient air quality standard changes that have been proposed by this administration. I think it is unrealistic to try to condense that into 2 minutes. There is not any way it can be done. 
I will just say, Mr. President, that as 1 of the 66 cosponsors of this resolution, I support it, although I would say also it doesn't go far enough. And I would also say that regardless of what happens--this is going to pass, but regardless of that, I am still going to oppose the ratification of this treaty. I am going to do so for two reasons. First, is that the science is not there. This is analogous to the proposal by the administration to lower the ambient air standards in both particulate matter and in ozone, unrealistically costing the American people billions and billions of dollars a year without any science to back it up. 
Mr. President, I am going to read real quickly and enter the entire statement in the Record, but before my committee, Dr. John Christy of the Department of Atmospheric Science and Earth System Science Laboratory, University of Alabama, Huntsville, said--I don't think there is anyone who is considered to be a greater authority than he is-- 
The satellite data show that catastrophic warming is not now occurring. The detection of human effects on climate has not been convincingly proven because the variations we have observed are not outside of the natural variations of the climate system.

Mr. INHOFE. The second reason is the administration has not been honest on this, as well as the ambient air, when they come along and they say, as Mary Nichols, Deputy Secretary, said yesterday, that the cost to the American people for the changes in the ambient air would be $9.1 billion when the President's own Council of Economic Advisers puts the price tag at something over $60 billion and the Reason Foundation out in California has it somewhere between $90 and $150 billion. 
So anyway, Mr. President, it is not realistic to do this. I would also observe I can't imagine that anyone who would be opposed to the ratification of this treaty wouldn't also be opposed to the changes in the ambient air standards. We will be introducing legislation next week. It will be bipartisan. Senator Breaux and I will be introducing legislation to reject these changes.

Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I am not sure what else can be said concerning the dilemma we find ourselves in right now. I think the distinguished junior Senator from Texas has really said it all. 
It was just last week that we had our defense authorization bill up before this body. We talked at that time about the desirability of putting some type of amendment on to stop the funding for the Bosnia operation for any time after June 30, 1998. Of course, I think we decided that it wasn't going to work out that way because if that happened, it might jeopardize not just the bill but would probably have caused a filibuster, and we didn't want that. We wanted to keep it moving. We need to have our authorization bill. It is imperative to our Nation's defense that we have it. 
So I think against the better judgment of several people we agreed to not have that position in. But that is the way it is going to have to be. I don't know any other way we are going to be able to bring our troops back. Clearly, the President has us over a political barrel right now because any time our troops get out of there--I don't care if it is tomorrow, if it is June 30, 1998, or if it is 10 years from now--the fighting will start again, and anyone with any common sense, with any knowledge of history, knows it has happened that way, and it is going to continue to happen that way. And so the question is do you do it sooner or later. 
Those of us who were concerned about mission creep back when they made the decision to send troops over to Bosnia back in December of 1995, they were to be there for, of course, 1 year. They kept saying, `They will be home for Christmas December 1996.' And all of us knew they would not be home for Christmas in December of 1996. It just didn't make any sense that that promise was made. So they went over there to provide safety for the corridors, to keep people from crossing over them, and supposedly that was going to take care of the problems that existed. 
Well, this is not the first time in history that this has happened. Here it is now. We have made a commitment of 2 1/2 years instead of 12 months. Now the President is trying to renege on that and go beyond to an undetermined period of time. 
I can remember in history when we sent our Marines into Nicaragua in 1909, and that was supposed to be for a 6-month period in 1909 because there were some problems with the government down there and they felt our intervention would stabilize things, and we did have some national security interests at that time, not as great as they were in other parts of the world, but nevertheless we sent our troops in for that short period of time and they were still there 13 years later. In fact, they never really came back until 1933. That is 24 years. 
As to Haiti, the Senator from Texas was talking about the fact that we still have troops in Haiti. People forget about that. We did not have any mission over there in the first place that was strategic to any of our problems in this country and yet we sent troops over to Haiti to supposedly try to clean up their government and run it better than they can run it. And now we have the same problems over there as we had before and we still have troops over there. We sent Marines to Haiti in 1915 and the same problems existed at that time. They were going to help with some of the stability there in Haiti and they stayed there until 1934. 
So now we see that we are in the middle of a classic case of mission creep. We are enlarging the mission. We are exposing U.S. troops to a whole new set of risks, and it is all without the permission of the American people or the permission of the Senate, but they are going to do it. 
Let's review for a minute the timeline in Bosnia. The President and administration officials pledged on numerous occasions in 1995 and 1996 that the United States military forces would be out of Bosnia by 1996 in the hearings that we had in the Senate Armed Services Committee. The Secretaries of Defense and the Secretary of State, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, John Shalikashvili, all of them said that the IFOR mission would be concluded in 1 year and that there were no plans to extend United States presence in Bosnia beyond a 1-year timeframe. And they kept repeating it. 
I can remember, since I serve on the Senate Armed Services Committee, a meeting we had October 17, 1995, Madam President, and that was when General Shalikashvili said, and I am going to quote his words, not my words--this is General Shalikashvili, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. He said on October 17, 1995: 
From a military perspective, as I evaluated the tasks we wished this force to accomplish, it was my judgment that it in fact can be done in 12 months or less. Secondly, when tied to the equipping and training issue, it was my judgment that that, too, can be accomplished in less than a year. And so I felt it was important that we, therefore, set a target of one year and then bring the force back. In the absence of that, you just find yourself staying there, and that's how very often mission creep comes in. The force needs to be brought home and they need to resume normal training and be ready for other operations. And I just think one year--I saw no military justification for that force to stay longer than one year, and that is why that was my recommendation. 
This is a guy who is supposed to be running the military, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. 
I was over in Bosnia several times, but the last time I talked to Gen. Monte Miggs up in that northeast sector and it is his job--he is doing a great job, by the way, of trying to carry on some type of training during the time that those troops are stationed over there. You have two big problems that exist when you have, when you are leaving troops in an area. One is in the case we are in right now where we have just decimated the military budget, our defense budget, we are spending all of this money. I can remember standing on this floor in November 1995 when the President had made the statement that the cost of the deployment to Bosnia would be somewhere between $1.5 billion and $2 billion. 
It is now going through $7.3 billion, and where does that money come from? It comes from readiness, it comes from modernization, it comes from force strength, and it comes from quality of life. That's the only four places it can come from. 
Now we have an optempo rate, where our troops are being asked to do things that human beings really can't do. Instead of being deployed for the normal 115 to 120 days a year, in some cases it is twice that. And we keep hearing stories from the field that it is even worse, because with the depleted budget we are now having to cannibalize perfectly good F-15 engines, that's F-100 engines, to get spare parts to keep the ones running that are in planes right now. Of course, that is very labor intensive. So from the field we hear these guys are working, some of them, 15 and 16 hours a day. They cannot keep that up for a period of time. 
But I think General Miggs up there, if there is ever anyone who can do it, up in the Brcko area, near the Posavina corridor, he is carrying on training. Of course, to carry on training and perform these humanitarian or peacekeeping or peacemaking missions, whatever they are supposed to be doing over there, it means longer and longer hours. So they are trying to do it. But there is not one general I have talked to who has not said that, if we should need our troops, if something should happen in North Korea at the same time something happened in Iran--not totally inconceivable--or Iraq or anyplace else, but if we were challenged in two regional fronts, we would have to take those people, withdraw them and retrain them, before we could send them into combat. So it's a real serious problem. 
In that same Senate Armed Services Committee meeting of October 17, 1995, I might add, Secretary Bill Perry said:  
I cannot conceive of the circumstances which would motivate me to come back and ask an extension of that time. 
This is an extension, he's talking about, beyond Christmas of 1996. 
. . . 12 months is sufficient to do the job we're describing. And I believe there is a great value, a great management value to putting a definite time scale on it and sticking to that time period. 
Again, he said later, in December, this is 6 weeks later, he said: 
We believe the mission can be accomplished in 1 year, so we have built our plan based on that timeline. This schedule is realistic because the specific militarily tasks [which are changing all the time, and that's the justification they are making for leaving them over there] in the agreement can be completed in the first 6 months, and thereafter IFOR's role will be to maintain the climate of stability that will permit civil work to go forward. We expect these civil functions will be successfully initiated in 1 year. But, even if some of them are not, we must not be drawn into a posture of indefinite garrison. 
Madam President, we are in a posture of indefinite garrison. 
Look at this in yesterday's paper, `Clinton keeps door open to extending U.S. role in Bosnia.' 
Here's the problem we have. I was disturbed we had to go beyond 12 months. Now they say we will make it 2 1/2 years and we will be out of there on June 30, 1998. I went over to the NATO meeting in Brussels and found we had Members of Congress, Members of the other body, who were walking around telling our NATO friends, whispering to them, `Don't worry, we won't leave you. We'll be there.' 
There is plenty of time, adequate time now to make this as the policy, which is the accepted policy, that is we are getting out on June 30, 1998. Because there is a lot of time between now and then. 
I was watching the Senator from Texas and remembering what happened when we had a resolution of disapproval back in October 1995. Because we knew, once they went over there, it was going to be very difficult to bring them back. Sure enough, we lost that by four votes. It was interesting, because the main argument that was used by the other side was that our troops will be back in 12 months. So who can object to 12 months? 
I heard Senator after Senator say to me, and say privately, `Well, I was going to support the resolution of disapproval and not send troops over there, not agree to that, but after all, the President has promised it will be 12 months. He's promised it would not exceed on the outside $2 billion.' 
I made a speech on the floor at that time and stated it would be closer to $8 billion. And sure enough, we are creeping through right now $7.3 billion. Looking back, I remember what I stated on the floor. And I will repeat that now, because I think it is appropriate now, 18 months later. This is quoting myself in the Congressional Record, December 13, 1995. 
My conviction that the administration's intention to put troops in harm's way in Bosnia is a huge mistake rests on three broad arguments. First and above all, the conflict in Bosnia imposes no real threat to vital American interests. Simply put there is nothing in Bosnia that Americans should die for. 
Second, the Dayton talks have produced a false peace, that is inherently unstable and politically doomed. 
Here I was talking about the fact we go to Dayton and we have all these factions in there, supposedly coming to a peace agreement, but who wasn't at Dayton? Karadzic was not in Dayton, that's the Bosnian Serbs. Sure, Milosevic was there. That's Serbia. But that wasn't where the problem was. Those individuals who were creating the problem were not there. The Bosnian Serbs were not represented. Not only were they not represented, but none of the rogue elements were represented. We still had the mujahidin, the Arkan Tigers, the Black Swans, and the rest of them, who are still over there right now. 
So you have a flawed meeting with a flawed attendance making an agreement that we cannot live with. 
Finally, quoting from my statement on the floor on December 13, 1995: 
The Implementation Force [that's IFOR] plan is self-contradictory, and hopelessly optimistic and will expose our soldiers to unreasonable risk even as they diligently pursue its unrealistic objectives. 
So, that is where we are today. I think, if you look and see what they agreed to and what was supposed to have happened in the first 12 months in the Dayton accords, they talked about `we were going to have the elections.' They have not had the elections. They had flawed elections. They said, `The refugees would all be able to go home before 12 months.' Guess what, the refugees haven't gone home and it's 18 months. We keep finding violations of arms agreements, in the 18 months into the 1-year agreement, and we can't pull out. I am very thankful we have not suffered precious casualties at this time, but I tell you, we predicted on the floor if we continue this mission creep we may not be so fortunate in the future. 
I would conclude, Madam President, that we have a responsibility to be responsible. If this were a time when we didn't have the distinguished Senator from Alaska, the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, having a very difficult time coming up with the money to keep America strong enough to meet the minimum expectations of the American people, which we can't, that is to be able to defend America on two regional fronts--if that weren't the case, maybe we could afford to be sending troops around the world on humanitarian missions, on peacekeeping missions. But we can't afford to do that, Madam President. 
So I conclude by saying we need to make it very clear that we are going to be out of there, and give a date certain that is still 12 months from now. There is still plenty of time for our allies to make time to make that happen. I have been agonizing with this concern. 
This is not a partisan thing, by the way, Madam President. Because when we sent troops into Somalia, George Bush was President. That was in December. After he had been defeated but while he was still in office, we sent troops over there, if you'll remember, for a period of some 3 months to 6 months. Then, once President Clinton got in, he kept extending it. So we sent resolutions and resolutions, `We want to bring the troops back.' Month after month, every month we sent resolutions, and the years started going by, and it was not until 18 of our rangers were brutally murdered and their naked corpses were dragged through the streets of Mogadishu before the American people got concerned enough to force the administration to bring the troops home from Somalia. 
Madam President, I don't want that to happen in Bosnia. I don't want our troops to be dragged through the streets of Sarajevo or Tuzla or Brcko or any of the rest of them. 
We have experienced mission creep. We are now in a situation where our troops are there for an indeterminate period of time. Now is the time to draw the line and say that June 30, 1998, is our time that our troops will be coming home. Are they going to be safe over there when that happens? No. If we brought them home tomorrow, there would still be fighting once our troops were out, or June 30, or 10 years from now. 
Madam President, I yield the floor.

Mr. INHOFE. I thank the Senator for yielding. 
It would be awful difficult to try to express my beliefs on this in 2 minutes. I would only say that this euphoria that we seem to enjoy around here that there is no threat is one that is of more concern to me than anything else we talk about. 
When you say, can we afford it, I often wonder can we afford not to do it. The whole argument that has been made on this space-based amendment by the distinguished Senator from New Mexico has been that right now there is nothing targeted at the United States. And I know the President has said in his State of the Union Message that there is nothing targeted at the United States for the first time in contemporary history when in fact we do not have any way of knowing that. 
I suggest you might remember the hearings on Anthony Lake when he was trying to become the Director of Central Intelligence. We made a very conclusive point that right now there is no way of telling. There is no verification. I would suggest you remember what Gen. John Shalikashvili said. He said there is no verification process. Then he went on to say, `But I can tell you we don't have missiles pointed at Russia.' 
That is really comforting, isn't it, to think it is just kind of a gentleman's agreement that you do not aim at us and we will not aim at you. But let us assume that we could verify today or at the beginning of this debate that there is nothing aimed at the United States. It can be retargeted in a matter of minutes. 
I would like to quote from Gen. Igor Sergeyev, the Commander in chief of the Russian Strategic Forces. He said, `Missiles can be retargeted and launched from this war room mostly in a matter of minutes.'

Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I agree wholeheartedly with the distinguished junior Senator from Texas. I would like, for a moment, to put this in historic perspective, because it was Senator Hutchison and I who had a resolution of disapproval in November 1995. We lost that by four votes. I remember so well why we lost that by four votes. We lost it because there were several Members who said, `Well, the President and the Secretary of Defense have promised that we are going to be out of Bosnia in 12 months, that will be Christmas of 1996.' So a few of them said, `I guess that it's all right to go over if we can accomplish whatever mission we thought we were going to accomplish by that time.' 
In preparation for that, I went over to Bosnia in the northeast sector. I can remember so well going into the Tuzla area when no Americans were up there, no Americans had been up there, and those who would go ahead to see what we were getting into had not been there yet. I talked with General Haukland from Norway who was in charge of the northeast sector for the United Nations in Bosnia. That was the area we were assuming responsibility for. 
When I told them we were going to be out in 12 months, they all started laughing. They said we were not going to be out in 12 months. He said, `You must mean 12 years.' That is the situation we are in now. It is like putting your hand in water and leaving it in there for 12 months, taking it out and nothing has changed, it is the same as it was. 
We have made that commitment. We went in there and didn't come out as we promised. This was not just a projection by saying by December 1996, things should be done and we should be out. It wasn't that at all. The President said we will be out. In fact, I have statements from our Senate Armed Services Committee where the Secretary of Defense said it is an absolute. General Shalikashvili said it was an absolute, we will be out of Bosnia by Christmas 1996. 
Now we are debating about whether to be out, not in 12 months, but 2 1/2 years after this thing started. 
The one thing that the distinguished Senator from Delaware did not mention is, what are our national security interests that we are there for? It would be nice, it would be wonderful, and it would be compassionate of us if we had the money and the resources to go around the world and go to Ethiopia and go to all these places where they would like to have our help, but we do not have those resources. 
Now, the problem we have is this. We have a political problem--I recognize that--that anyone who is opposed to getting out on June 30, 1998, is going to say, `If we pull out, they're going to start fighting again.' You know what? They are right. But the same argument could be used, Mr. President, if it is 10 years from now. So how long is this commitment going to go on? 
You know what they said in November 1995? They said the cost is going to be between $1.5 billion and $2 billion. Now it is passing through $6.5 billion. Where is the money going to come from? The money is going to come from the defense budget, a defense budget that right now, while our distinguished chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee has put together a very good authorization bill that we have to pass, it is still inadequate, still does not adequately arm America for the threats that face us out there. 
People who say the cold war is over and there is no threat anymore, I can assure you the threat is much greater than it was then during the cold war when we could identify who the enemy was and our intelligence knew something about that enemy. 
So here we are now making a commitment. And how long is it 
going to take? I can tell you right now, if we do not adhere to the June 30, 1998 deadline, we are not going to get out until something very bad happens. I suspect that we would still be in Somalia today if it were not for the fact that 18 of our Rangers were brutally murdered and their nude corpses dragged through the streets in Mogadishu. I do not want that to happen anywhere in the streets of Bosnia. 
So it was not long ago I was in Brussels. I found there were many Members of Congress that were going around whispering to our NATO allies, `Don't worry about it. We won't leave at that time.' That is the most dangerous thing we could do at this time. We need to draw that line and say we are going to be out by that time. 
We made a mistake. We should have been out by December 1996, as we promised, as the President promised, as the Secretary of Defense promised, as we promised the American people. We have to keep the promise this time and make it June 30. What we do in terms of a commitment for June 30, 1998, right now I am not real sure. But I can tell you right now, with every fiber of my being I will fight to make sure that our troops are home after June 30 of 1998.

Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I have been in the chair for the last few minutes listening to some of the comments that have been made. I would like to read one paragraph that I saw in yesterday's Wall Street Journal. 
I would like to ask everyone, Mr. President, to listen very carefully, because we are only talking about three of a long list of things that are being investigated right now as far as the alleged transgression of the President. 
Yesterday's Wall Street Journal has the editorial of which this is just one paragraph: 
Travelgate, trumped-up Billy Dale prosecution, the secret health-care task force, the 900 FBI files and bouncer/security chief Craig Livingstone, alerts to the White House from high Treasury officials on Resolution Trust Corporation investigations, the guy who told the congressional committee he lied to his diary, the brightest minds in the Democratic Party suffering massive memory loss at congressional hearings, the `lost' Rose Law Firm billing records, Webster Hubbell's passage of the Justice to jail, Vince Foster's torment, the Lincoln Bedroom rented out, Charlie Trie on the run, John Huang taking the fifth, Jim and Susan McDougal convicted, the Buddhist monastery/money laundry, the drug dealers let in for the White House photo-ops, the routinely cavalier treatment of legal and judicial procedures, and independent counsels appointed for three members of the Cabinet, one sitting American President and, for the first time in history, one First Lady. 
Everyone does it? We don't think so. At least up to now. 
In this long list of alleged transgressions, the investigation right now is really only dealing with three things. 
It is interesting for me that every time something comes up concerning campaign contributions that have been taken illegally, the President comes out and says we need campaign finance reform. 
I would only comment, as did the Senator from Alaska, Senator Murkowski. How do we know that we need reform of campaign contributions until we live under the laws that we have today? 
Currently it is illegal--under our current law--to accept foreign money from foreigners. It is illegal to launder money. It is illegal to solicit or accept money on Federal property. 
That is what this is all about. 
So I just hope as the debate goes on about campaign finance reform that we adopt an attitude that we should comply with the laws that are on the books right now and see how far that goes to resolving the problems. 
Mr. President, I see that there is no other Senator seeking time, so I ask unanimous consent that I be recognized as if in morning business on another matter.

Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I am very honored to be serving as the chairman of the Readiness Subcommittee of the Senate Armed Services Committee. 
Today at 11 o'clock we will begin again the discussion on the passage of the defense authorization bill. 
As chairman of the Readiness Subcommittee, I have jurisdiction over the readiness of our forces to defend America: Such things as military construction, such things as military pay, such things as training, and the like. 
In carrying out my responsibilities, I have visited many, many bases throughout the world and here in the United States. I have had occasion to be recently in Camp Lejeune Marine Corps Base; Fort Hood, TX; Corpus Christi Naval Base; and the Dyess Air Force Base. 
My concern is that with all the people we have talked about and talked to in the committee meetings that we have had in the Readiness Subcommittee of the Senate Armed Services Committee, we keep getting assurances from the administration that we are in a state of readiness that would meet the minimum expectations of the American people, and yet the information that we get as we go around certainly contradicts that. We have statements made by a number of people who are in the field. When you get past the top brass here in Washington, we find that we have very, very serious problems. 
Mr. President, I plan to make several statements concerning this as the development of and discussion on this bill takes place after 11 o'clock, but I would just suggest that we have not found ourselves and put ourselves in a state of readiness that meets the minimum expectations of the American people. The administration has said many times we are in a position to defend America on two regional fronts, and I can assure you that is not the case. In fact, as we watched the Persian Gulf war, I regret to say that we are not in a state of readiness today to be able to defend America against that type of aggression. 
With that, I will yield the floor.

Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I want to thank Senator Chafee and his staff for the willingness to work in a cooperative manner with myself and the staff of the Subcommittee on Readiness. 
The Sikes Act Amendment is a significant item of legislation that will directly impact the Department of Defense management of the 25 million acres of land it controls. 
While Senator Chafee has highlighted some of the positive environmental aspects of this legislation, I would like to stress the need to ensure the preservation of the military mission, readiness and training. 
The Sikes Act Amendment makes the preparation of integrated natural resource management plans mandatory for the military departments. 
I have reluctantly agreed to the mandatory language of this provision because the Department of Defense and military departments support it and have insisted that this new environmental requirement will not undermine the military mission and will not increase funding for such planning activities. 
It should be made clear that: 
The Sikes Act Amendment is not intended to enlarge the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service or State fish and wildlife agency authority over the management of military lands. 
Natural resource management plans should be prepared to assist installation commanders in conservation and rehabilitation efforts that are consistent with the use of military lands for the readiness and training of the U.S. Armed Forces. 
It is understood that many installations, about 80 percent, have already completed integrated natural resource management plans in cooperation with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and appropriate State fish and game agencies. 
Given the level of agency cooperation, the time, the personnel, and funds involved in the completion of existing natural resource management plans, it is expected that most of these plans will satisfy the requirements of the Sikes Act Amendment and will not have to be redone. 
I want to close with an emphasis on the need to ensure that the amendment will not result in an increased funding level for natural resource management plans and will not undermine military readiness and training. 
As chairman of the Subcommittee on Readiness, I intend to follow the implementation of this amendment, and its impact on military readiness, very carefully. 
Senator Chafee, I want to thank you again and express my appreciation for our ability to work together on the Sikes Act Amendment and other environmental issues.

Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, first of all, I wish to thank you and those who are participating in this discussion for bringing this up. This is a very difficult and frustrating time for all of us, and I think the Senator from Nebraska, Mr. Hagel, gave a pretty good outline of what this is all about, what we want to accomplish, and what we have offered. And when I say `we,' I am not talking about the Republican Party. I am talking about Congress. 
To put it in perspective, the House passed the tax cut bill on June 26--just June 26--and it passed by a fairly substantial margin, 253 to 179. There was a substitute that was offered by Congressman Rangel that has come in the nature of what the President is announcing now, and it was rejected by 197 to 235. Then the Senate, on the following day, June 27, passed a tax cut bill 80 to 18. When the minority leader, Senator Daschle, offered a substitute, it was rejected 38 to 61. 
So we went through a long and arduous process of having 29 amendments. We finally came up with a product, and we went out for the Fourth of July recess. And after we were out, the President announced a different, totally different tax cut plan while Congress was out of town, when we did not have any chance to react to it, and now he is saying that he wants his plan. His plan doesn't really provide tax cuts that are meaningful and will have a positive effect on our economy. 
I have to ask the question, Mr. President, what has happened to the Democrats in their philosophy? The whole idea that we can cut taxes and increase revenue is not a Republican idea, and yet it is totally rejected by this administration. I can remember when President Clinton was first elected. His chief financial adviser, Laura Tyson, was quoted as having said there is no relationship between the level of taxes that a country pays and its economic productivity. 
I suggest that if that is true, if you carry that to its logical extreme, you could tax everybody 100 percent and they will work just as hard, but we know that does not happen. And up until this administration, the Democrats knew that that could not happen. 
I have to credit a Democrat with the whole idea that you can increase revenue by cutting taxes, exactly what we are trying to do, looking at taxes in general. President Kennedy said in 1962, and this is a direct quote: 
It is a paradoxical truth that tax rates are too high today and tax revenues are too low, and the soundest way to raise the revenues in the long run is to cut rates now. 
The soundest way to raise revenues is to cut rates now. That is exactly what we are trying to do. And we remember what happened during the Kennedy administration. The first year he was in office, the total revenues that came in to support government, that we used to spend on government, amounted to $79 billion. After he went through his series of tax reductions, it had grown to $112 billion. We remember what happened during the Reagan administration. And we always hear from the other side that the Reagan administration came up with tax cuts and the deficits went up. 
Well, sure, the deficits went up--not because of the tax cuts but because the liberals who dominated the Congress at that time voted for more government spending. And so in 1980, the total revenues that came in to run Government amounted to $517 billion. In 1990, the total revenues that came in were $1.03 trillion. It exactly doubled during that 10-year period. 
Now, what happened during that 10-year period? During that 10-year period, we had the largest tax reductions in contemporary history. It has been shown--in fact, if you look at marginal tax rates, the revenues developed in 1980 were $244 billion; in 1990, it was $466 billion. And that happened during the time the tax rates were cut. So we know that we can increase revenues by reducing taxes and also relieve the burden on the American people to allow them to have more money--and not the rich. We know better than that. We have been playing that game and demagoging it for so long now that I think the American people are aware we are not talking about the rich. 
With just a couple minutes remaining, I want to be more specific as to one of the particular tax cuts I feel very strongly about. In fact, Mr. President, you had made a comment about some of the farms in Wyoming. I had the same experience over the break. I was down in Lawton, OK, and I had a guy come up to me saying they were selling their family farm to a corporate farm because they could not get the price for some of their acreage in order to pay the estate taxes, and that's happening all over the country. They say, what is happening to the family-owned farm? That is what is happening. 
I remember in our history, when this country was first founded and the pilgrims came over here and risked their lives--half of them did die--they came over for economic and for religious freedom. When they got over here, they established a system where each one had a plot of land to do with as he wanted and to be able to pass that wealth on from generation to generation. And it was so great, the wealth that was accumulated as a result of that, that in one of his letters 
back home John Smith said, now 1 farmer can grow more corn than 10 could before--because of that freedom that they had to be able to pass it on. It is called productivity, motivation, knowing the Government is not going to come in and take the money away from you that you have worked so hard to pass on to future generations. 
Mr. President, I have six grandchildren, four children. I quit working for me. The motivation is for the future generations. When the estate tax was first formed, it was formed as a temporary tax. The maximum rate was 10 percent, and it was supposed to be dropped down. 
I conclude by reading something that I found, an excerpt from a 1996 Heritage Foundation study that said if the estate tax were repealed, over the next 9 years the Nation's economy would average as much as $1.1 billion per year in extra output and an average of 145,000 additional jobs would be created, personal income would rise by an average of $8 billion per year above current projections, and the deficit would actually decline due to the growth generated by its abolishment. 
So I think we need to reject the failed notion that has been proposed and stated over and over again by members of this administration, including Laura Tyson and the President himself, that we need to raise taxes and not lower taxes. We could actually raise revenues by lowering tax rates, and that is exactly what we intend to do and should do for ourselves, for the American people and for our country. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, throughout each year we address a number of Medicare issues. This year, we have a Medicare issue within the reconciliation bill which is related to military health care, specifically, Medicare subvention. Without Medicare subvention, military treatment facilities cannot receive reimbursement from Medicare for care the facilities provide to military retirees who are also eligible for Medicare. With Medicare subvention, we can continue to improve the quality of life for military personnel, their families, and retired service members and their families by providing them with alternative access to treatment. 
Because health care is such an important aspect of quality of life in the military, it is imperative that we continue to provide our military personnel and retirees with the access which they were promised. Currently, because the access of military retirees age 65 and over is on a space-available basis and due to overcrowding of military treatment facilities, finding adequate medical care has proven increasingly difficult if not impossible. Clearly, this is not a trend we want to continue if we hope to retain and recruit the quality and quantity of men and women needed to fight and win wars in the future. 
Medicare subvention would fulfill the commitment made to our former service members by allowing Medicare to reimburse the Department of Defense [DOD] for care provided to members who are Medicare-eligible beneficiaries. I believe that Medicare subvention would be fiscally beneficial to Medicare and would make available an important revenue source that will enable and encourage DOD to provide care to over-65 retirees. Further, Medicare will save money because DOD can provide care less expensively than civilian providers. This is clearly a win-win situation for both the DOD and Medicare. 
Clearly, ending access to military medical facilities when beneficiaries reach an age when they will most need it is fundamentally unfair. Our veterans have earned our support, and they deserve the best access to medical care that we can make available. I believe that Medicare subvention is a necessary step in the right direction, and I fully support the Medicare subvention provisions found in the reconciliation bill.

Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, first of all, let me thank the very distinguished chairman of our committee, Senator Thurmond, for the hours and hours that he put in and the way he ran the meetings. He was very fair and open. I appreciate personally very much his remarks that he just made. Thank you, Senator Thurmond. 
As chairman of the readiness subcommittee I want to thank Senator Robb who is the ranking minority member. We took care of a lot of the problems out there. I must say, Mr. President, that I think that our readiness is desperately underfunded. We did the very best we could in this bill with the resources we had but we are not going to be able to continue on the course we are on right now. We have problems. 
As I go around the Nation, and around the world, actually, and visit bases, I have been in bases in the State of Alabama, and throughout the Nation, as well as some of the foreign bases, and I can tell you we are in an OPTEMPO rate which is unacceptable. Our divorce rates are going up, our retention rates are going down, and we need to do a better job of funding not just readiness but modernization and quality of life. I am very concerned about quality of life. As I go around I find that some of these kids are working about double the normal tempo that we have found to be acceptable. While they can sustain it for a while, and while the troops can sustain it, the spouses cannot. There will come a point in time where they will have to have more time with their families and have a more civil type of existence. We cannot do that with the way this administration has not allocated the proper amount of money to keep our system going to meet the minimum expectations of the American people. That is, to be able to defend America on two regional fronts. 
Having said that, I say again that we did the very best that can be done, and in our readiness subcommittee we were able to reinstate money for flying hours. We are losing pilots on a daily basis to the airlines. So we will have to do a lot more than we have done, but we have done the very best that we can. 
Let me make one comment about the depot issue. I know it is a difficult issue. A few years ago when one of the House Members, Congressman Armey, I believe, originally came up with the whole idea of the Base Realignment and Closing Commission concept, which means we know we cannot reduce excess infrastructure by doing it through the normal political process because everybody is concerned about jobs in their States. So they appointed an independent commission to be totally free from political influence to make recommendations and they went through, with round one in 1991, in 1993 another round, in 1995 a third round, and in doing this there is hardly a Senator in this Chamber that did not have major installations that have closed in their States. Certainly the State of Alabama lost a major one, and there were two major installations in the very State from which our chairman comes from, South Carolina, and virtually all the other States. So, we all bit the bullet. 
However, it appears there is an effort now to disregard that and leave air logistic centers in California as well as in Texas open. While it is a difficult thing to go through we have to accept the fact, sooner or later, that you cannot have in the case of any specialty area, and specifically in this case, air logistic centers where you have five operating at 50 percent capacity. You cannot continue to do that. So they recommended closing two of them that they determined to be the least efficient of the five and transferring that workload to the remainder which would be around 75 to 80 percent capacity. 
That makes a lot of sense. According to the GAO, that would save $468 million a year, and over 5 years, Mr. President, that is $2.34 billion. When I think about that and think about where those dollars are desperately needed in quality of life, in readiness, in force strength, in modernization, it breaks my heart to think we are maybe willing to just throw it away. 
So I did make the gesture that the chairman referred to and no one asked me to do it. I felt it was the right thing to do because we have to have an authorization bill. Under the rules of the Senate, it is very possible for one Senator to keep a bill from coming up. I did not want that to happen to Senator Thurmond's bill. I did not want that to happen to our defense establishment. So I pulled the objectionable portions of how we treat depot maintenance out of the bill, but at the same time I announced I have every intention of reestablishing language that will accomplish what we want to get accomplished, and that is to be able to save that money that the GAO states is at risk. 
So I do not know whether it will be an amendment on the floor by which I will try to do this or in conference but I think everyone understands clearly there will be an effort to reinstate language that we have had to take out. 
With that, I will say this is a good bill and I want to move forward with it. I want to get a chance to really consider these amendments, and I know there will be a lot of amendments. 
As the new chairman of the Readiness Subcommittee of the Armed Services Committee, I have a devoted a significant amount of time during the past few months traveling to military bases to discuss issues that impact the readiness of the Armed Forces and their ability to carry out assigned missions: European theater, including installations in England, Italy, Bosnia, Hungary; Camp Lejuene, NC; Fort Hood, TX; Corpus Christi Naval Base, Texas; Dyess Air Force Base; and Fort Drum. 
We have also received testimony from the Secretary of Defense, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the service chiefs, the unified commander-in-chief, and several other high ranking military and civilian officials from the Department of Defense. 
While the administration claims to have provided strong support for training, maintenance, supplies and other essentials needed to keep U.S. Forces ready to fight and win decisively, its budget request reduced real funding for these areas by $1.4 billion. 
Nothing I've heard during my base visits has made me feel like we are as ready as the administration asserts. 
At each unit, maintenance personnel have resorted to cannibalizing good equipment to keep other equipment operating. These additional maintenance actions result in 12-hour average work days for our young troops--only because of a lack of good spares. 
If readiness truly remains the administration's highest priority, then I have to wonder about the shape of the other accounts--modernization, quality of life, research and development--are they even more seriously underfunded? 
Military units and the personnel within them, are being overused and underfunded to the point that I am afraid we are returning to the days of the hollow force. And the military personnel with whom I've spoken agree. 
It is also apparent to me that our Forces are being stretched to the limit to support humanitarian and contingency operations such as the deployment of IFOR/SFOR in Bosnia. 
Our high OPTEMPO is particularly troubling, since it results in more than just time away from home for the troops--it results in more equipment wear and tear; higher than planned consumption of spares; and canceled training. 
At every base visited, I heard concerns about the quality of equipment.  
Our lack of spares has caused us to cannibalize perfectly good engines to keep others operating, requiring my maintenance troops to work even more hours to keep our planes flying. Our normal work week is now 50--56 hours/week: Lakenheath, AF Maintenance Officer. 
Letter to Senator Thurmond from a non-commissioned officer: 
We have old, worn out equipment that is difficult to maintain because we cannot always get the parts needed to repair them. It is the same way wherever we go; outdated, broken equipment, a lack of spare parts, overworked and underpaid GIs, resulting in an inability to perform our mission. 
I do not question the fact that our military forces are the finest in the world. They are clearly performing their assigned missions superbly and they are capable of defeating any potential enemy of today. 
But what about tomorrow? If this trend continues, I am concerned about how long we can maintain the present pace of operations. I am not alone in my concerns--they were echoed by many of the military personnel I had the pleasure of meeting. One officer summed it up nicely when he said `the storm clouds are on the horizon.' 
The Pentagon continues to omit these concerns from official reports we receive from the Committee--to the contrary, their reports reports indicate readiness levels are at an all time high. I find the remarkable discrepancy between what I see in the field and the official statements coming from the administration and the Pentagon very troubling. And I am concerned that unless we take the necessary steps to correct these problems now, our military capability will erode as we enter the 21st century. 
The most troubling challenge is the need for additional modernization funding, for lack of new procurement has dramatic affects across all the other accounts: As our military equipment ages, it requires increased maintenance and thus more operations and maintenance [O&M] funding; since additional funding is not available to increase the O&M accounts, dollars are often robbed from training accounts; unfortunately, as the equipment ages, the problem will only get worse, and we will find ourselves in a death spiral. 
The funding crisis is further aggravated by the continual deployment of forces to contingency operations such as Southern Watch and Provide Comfort. I have spoken many times, about the huge cost of these operations--between $6.5 and $8 billion for Bosnia alone--and the fact these expenditures will come at the expense of our defense budget. 
While dollars are the most obvious issue in defense, I suggest that what we often overlook is the huge burden we are placing on our people and our equipment. We are wearing out our equipment and pushing our people so hard they no longer have time to train. 
I heard comment after comment during my visits: 
The high OPTEMPO at which our personnel are operating is definitely causing a strain on our people's families. Ultimately, this strain also affects my pilots' job performance: Marine F--18 Squadron Commander. 
`The number of days we fly to support Bosnia doesn't leave us with enough time to train. The only areas where we get training from our Bosnia missions is in reconnaissance and close air support. The rest of our training areas are suffering.'--Air Force F-16 Squadron Commander. 
`Our average crew goes TDY 150--160 days per year--the Air Force goal is 120 days. These excessive taskings are straining my peoples' families as well as impacting the ability of my crews to receive adequate training.'--Air Force C--130 Squadron Commander. 
Clearly, there are situations when the deployment of the U.S. military is necessary to protect America's vital interests. Unfortunately, it appears the Clinton administration will continue to keep a very low threshold for determining the need to commit our forces. 
My friends, the United States cannot force its military to expend more resources than we are willing to provide and still expect it to remain a viable force for the future when it may be called upon to defend American interests. I am concerned, the committee is concerned, our military personnel are concerned, and the American people should be concerned. If we are to avoid losing our military edge, we must act decisively and begin providing the resources necessary to support the missions we continue to ask of our Armed Forces.

Mr. INHOFE. I do agree with that. I want to give my assurance to the Senator from Georgia I have been living with this problem for a long period of time. We need an ultimate solution. In the interim, we need to make sure the recommendations of the BRAC Commission--that we protect the integrity of that system and they be acted upon--that we go ahead and fulfill the expectations. Again, it is not just the money involved here. 
I think about all of the Senators who had closures, and if we start making exceptions now I think it is very unfair to every Member of this Senate body who has had a closure to now say for political reasons we can take exceptions. 
I know it is controversial when you say this, but if you just read the statements that the President made in August of 1996 right before the election, saying we will make sure those jobs do not leave, so what does that mean? It means regardless of what they do, whether it is competition or anything else, if the jobs stay in those areas we will still have five air logistic centers, so you have the same problem operating at 50 percent capacity.

Mr. INHOFE. That is correct. In responding to the Senator from Georgia, we had a committee meeting on this with the GAO and we looked at how much that has cost so far. That has been 2 years ago. And still, almost the same number are there. 
Now, there are other problems that come in, as the junior Senator from Utah brought up yesterday, that we are having a flight of expertise out of these areas, getting into other occupations, and if we do not do something quickly we are not going to be able to ever solve this problem. 
I think for that reason we need to address this, address it in this bill. But again, to protect the bill so that we would have an authorization bill, I, personally, was willing, as you were willing, to take that out so we could come to the floor and take it up and work in a different work form--it may be the same form or a different form--but take it up as a floor amendment or in conference.

Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, we are going to be taking up hopefully today our DOD authorization bill, I believe at 1 o'clock. Sometimes it is important to look beyond the bill itself. 
There are several provisions of this bill that were very critical which were taken out, and one of them was taken out because I think it is certain that the President would have vetoed it, and it has to do with Bosnia and with our withdrawal from Bosnia. I think it is important that we talk about that a little bit because, while we are taking up our Department of Defense reauthorization bill, I can tell you right now it is not adequate. It is the very best that we could come up with, with the resources we had to work with, but as chairman of the Readiness Subcommittee of the Senate Armed Services Committee, I can assure you that it is not adequate. We are really at a critical time right now, and, quite frankly, I hang this one on the administration. This has been a very nonmilitary, nondefense administration. We have had a difficult time getting any attention to our military, for the duties that they are trained to perform. 
I would like just for a moment to cover a couple of things and how this is going to affect our DOD authorization bill for this year and probably next year, too. 
As chairman of the Subcommittee on Readiness, we have jurisdiction over training, over military construction, over all readiness issues including the BRAC process. As I have traveled around to various installations, I have found that we are really in serious trouble. I have never been so proud of our troops for doing what they are doing under adverse conditions. 
I was a product of the draft many years ago. I came here believing in compulsory service, and I still think it is a good idea for our Nation. However, I am so impressed with the quality of troops we have in this all-voluntary military. However, I wonder how long they can hold on the way they are going right now with this `Optempo' rate. `Optempo' is a term that is used in the military that refers to the number of deployment days, the number of days that these troops are away from their wives, husbands, and families, and it has gone up now in some areas double the amount that is considered to be the optimum. For example, we normally talk about approximately 115 days a year, and it is up now to well over 200 in many areas. While seemingly they are holding on, they are dedicated, you cannot expect it to continue indefinitely because our divorce rate is starting to go up right now and our retention rate is starting to drop right now. 
The quality-of-life issues are really a very serious problem. I think both the chairman and the ranking member of the Subcommittee on Personnel--Senator Dirk Kempthorne and Senator Max Cleland--are doing a great job, but I assure you when you are talking about readiness, the personnel issues and the quality-of-life issues are very, very significant. 
Going back in time just a little bit, I can remember being here on the Senate floor back in November 1995 when we found out that the President of our country, Bill Clinton, was proposing to send troops over to Bosnia. I got to thinking at that time, are we going to go through this same exercise again? Right now, we have more troops deployed in more parts of the world than we have had at any time since World War II, and yet they are not over there for any purposes that relate to our Nation's security. Our strategic security interests are not being served. They call them peacekeeping missions. They call them peacemaking missions. They call them humanitarian missions. 
Mr. President, with the scarce resources that we have right now--and, of course, you know because you serve on the Senate Armed Services Committee--we cannot continue to do this. 
I can remember the debate that took place on this floor in November 1995 when the President was suggesting that we send troops over to the northeastern sector of Bosnia, and I remember going over there and seeing what it was like and seeing what our mission would be like, and supposedly we were going to go over there to make peace, to draw the lines out so that we would have these lines of demarcation where the Serbs had to be over here and the Croats had to be here and the Muslims had to be here, forgetting all about the fact that there are many other factions there. I do not think it is even a remote possibility we could the stop the Serbs, Croats, and Muslims from fighting with each other. They have been doing it for 500 years. 
Let us assume we could. If we could, we still have the Mujaheddin, Arkan Tigers, Black Swans--we have all these rogue elements, and the only thing they have in common is they hate us. Here we are sending troops, proposing at that time in 1995 to send troops over when we have been sending them other places. 
I remember--and I am not hanging this one on President Clinton because it was President Bush who initially sent troops into Somalia, and he sent them over in September, before he was defeated and before the new Clinton administration took over. They originally were sent over for 45 days. Each month--and you and I were both serving in the other body at that time. We passed a resolution calling for the withdrawal of our troops from Somalia because they were spending our precious defense dollars and they were endangering their lives. And month after month after month President Clinton said, we are going to leave them over there indefinitely. And it wasn't until 18 of our Rangers were brutally murdered and their nude corpses dragged through the streets of Mogadishu that finally the American people woke up and applied enough pressure, and we were able to bring back our troops. I do not want that to happen in the streets of Sarajevo. I do not want that to happen in Bosnia. 
But if you will remember, Mr. President, it was in November when they were trying to sell the idea of having the support of Congress to send our troops over there, we had a resolution of disapproval saying we can't afford to do it. We were not without compassion. We were not unconcerned about the plight of those poor people over there. But that has been going on for many, many years. The problem was we just could not afford another mission like that, and so we had a resolution of disapproval. And the President and the Secretary of Defense and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. John Shalikashvili, said that they would be over there for only 12 months. They go over in December, come back in December of the following year. 
That was 1996. Well, anyway, this was not just approximately 12 months. This was not simply a suggestion that maybe we can get our mission, whatever our mission was--I still don't know what our mission was over here--maybe we can get that mission accomplished in 12 months. It was an absolute promise by this administration, and I have it down in the words of Secretary of Defense Bill Perry that they said this is an absolute, there are no conditions under which our troops will be there beyond 12 months. I knew it wasn't true. They lied to the American people. 
We missed passing a resolution of disapproval, Mr. President, by four votes--four votes. I can remember several, at least four people standing on the floor of the Senate saying, well, it is only for 12 months, because that was an absolute at that time. We said it was not going to be 12 months. 
I went to Bosnia. Nobody had been over there at that time. Sure, they were firing guns and all of that, and I wanted to go up to the northeast sector because the northeast sector of Bosnia is where we were going to send our troops, we were proposing to do it at that time. That's where Tuzla is, Brcko, up in that northeastern sector. I went up there. In fact, I wasn't able to get up there any other way, so I borrowed a British helicopter and went up to the Tuzla area and landed up there only to find that there were some troops up there that were U.N. troops, not American troops, and the commanding general of the northeast sector was a guy named Haukland from Norway, a great guy. 
So I went in there. I said, `I hear gunfire out there.' `Yeah, it's been going on for a long time. It's still going on.' I said, `Well, you know, we are proposing to send troops over here and have this joint effort to cause the divisions to stop the fighting up here.' I said, `Of course, it is only going to be 12 months.' And he started laughing. He said, `Twelve months. You mean 12 years.' He said, `It is different here than it is most other places.' 
This is the analogy that he drew. I have mentioned it in this Chamber before, but it is so accurate today to remember. We knew this in November 1995. He said, `It's like putting your hand in water and leaving it for there 12 months. Then you take it out and nothing has changed. It is the same.' 
I would suggest to you, Mr. President, that when we pull out ultimately--and I hope we can do it safely, I hope that we can have a minimum of terrorist activity at that time, but we know that they are just in a period of rest right now and they will go right back. This is the dilemma we find ourselves in. The President promised we would be out in 12 months. He broke his promise, and we were not out. Then he said we are not going to stay 18 months beyond the 12 months, so June 30, 1998, would be the withdrawal date. 
I have to say that the President has us, those of us who are conservatives, those of us who are for a strong national defense--and I have to say in a not too charitable way that we have a lot of Members of this body that sincerely in their hearts are not all that concerned about our Nation's defense because they don't think there is a significant threat out there. How many times have you heard from this administration that the cold war is over and so there is no longer a threat. And I said before, I look back wistfully at the days of the cold war when we had one opposition, we had two superpowers, and the other one was the U.S.S.R. and intelligence knew pretty much what they had, what kind of resources they had; they were predictable in what they were doing. They were people you could predict. 
Now, we are faced with a world environment where we have, admittedly, and it is not even classified, over 25 nations that currently, today, have weapons of mass destruction, either biological, chemical or nuclear. And they are working on the means to deliver them. 
Just in yesterday's Washington Times there was an article about how now China is working on a joint project on a missile with Iran. Is Iran a friend? No. All these people talking about how friendly China is, yet we know that both China and Russia have a missile that would deliver a weapon of mass destruction from any place in the world to the continental United States. That is there today. We know that. It is logical, if we also know--again, it is not even classified--that both Russia and China are selling and have sold both systems and technology to countries like Iran and other countries, then why would they stop at this fine line, this bright line, you might say, and say they are not going to sell them a missile that would reach the continental United States? That does not do anything for my comfort level. Nonetheless, we are involved in a situation in Bosnia right now where the President has said we are going to extend it to June of 1999. 
Then I keep hearing whispers from these people who do not see any threat out there, `That's all right, when that time comes, when June gets here, we are going to go ahead and extend it for another 6 months, and another 6 months.' I can tell you right now, Mr. President, there are people in this Chamber and people in the White House who have no intentions of any kind of withdrawal from Bosnia. So I serve notice, as I have many times and as have other Members, when that date gets here you better be ready because we are going to be pulling out. 
I think it is going to be necessary to be talking about this between now and through the entire next year, so they can be prepared. We do have NATO allies. We do not want to be insensitive to the fact that a lot of our NATO allies have strategic interests in keeping troops in Bosnia. Those people in the Balkans, those in the eastern part of Europe that are our allies in NATO, they certainly have reason to want to have peace in Bosnia because it serves their strategic interests. We are across an ocean. It does not serve ours. While we would like to have the luxury, we are faced with a depleted, almost a decimated, military in this country. We are in a position where we cannot meet the minimum expectations of the American people, which is to be able to defend America on two regional fronts. We know we cannot do that. Let's not kid anybody, we know we could not fight the Persian Gulf war again, even if we wanted to today. We do not have the resources to do that. 
It is not just that we do not have a national missile defense system, it is conventional forces, too. We have approximately one half the force strength that we had in 1991. I am talking about one half the Army divisions, one half the Air Force wings, one half the boats that are floating around out there. Yet people think we are in a position to adequately defend ourselves. 
So, I think we need to think of this problem that we have around the world and specifically in Bosnia in terms of, No. 1, what it is doing to our overall defense system in terms of money and personnel. If we should have to call our troops in for something in North Korea and simultaneously for something perhaps in Iran or the Middle East, we would be in a position of having to retrain these troops that have been sent to Somalia or Haiti or Bosnia or one of the other places, all these missions we are sending them on, because the rules of combat are different. There is not a general out there who would not tell you we would have to retrain our troops. That would take time, that would cost money, and that directly affects our state of readiness. 
But what else? There was another promise that was made back in November 1995, and that is we would send our troops over there and this whole mission, this 12-month mission, would cost between $1.5 and $2 billion. It is all in the Record. That is what they said. It was repeated here on the Senate floor. `It is not going to be that expensive. It's going to be between $1.5 and $2 billion.' At that time, on the Senate floor --and it is in the Record--I said it is going to end up costing $8 billion before it is over. And guess what, we are now going through $6.5 billion. 
There are four elements of a defense system that we can control. We cannot control these missions because the White House has control over these missions. But what we can control are readiness, troop force strength, quality of life, and modernization. Those are the four elements that we can control. When we now are down to the point where we have an optempo of almost double what is considered to be the acceptable level and we have the troops that are deployed in all these places where there are no strategic interests at risk, we are spending that money over there for these missions that has to come out of the defense budget. 
The other day we had a committee meeting. We had all four chiefs of the services. I asked each one of them, one at a time, I said, `We are going to come in for an emergency 
supplemental. We are going to have to nickel and dime this thing and pay for all this fun we are having over in these areas and all this good we are supposedly doing. It is going to have to come out of defense somewhere. You have four choices: readiness, troop strength, modernization, or quality of life. Where is it going to come from?' Not one--finally the Marine general said, `I'd say quality of life, because we are tough.' So maybe that was the only answer that we got. 
But there is no way we can take it out of quality of life and still retain people. Right now in this authorization bill, by the way, we have money that is in there for flight hours, which is very critical because we are losing our trained pilots. It costs $87,000 just to go through primary training for one of these pilots. What we are doing is training them for the airlines, because we are losing them. We cannot compete. We don't have to be able to pay the same money the airlines pay, but we have to be able at least to have a respectable level of optempo and be competitive, so we do have some money for flight hours in this authorization bill. Again, to do that we have to take it from someplace else. I, as chairman of the readiness subcommittee, can tell you I am not at all comfortable with our state of readiness as it is right now. 
I believe we should have in the authorization bill--and I had an amendment ready but decided, since it would be certain it would draw a veto, that we would handle this as a separate issue--but we need actually to have a resolution of withdrawal, giving our commitment to make sure our NATO allies know and can prepare today for our withdrawal on June 30, 1998. 
I went to Brussels where they had the last NATO meeting and made a speech there making it abundantly clear. I found at the same time I made a statement which I feel I can make on behalf of the U.S. Senate, there were other people who were walking around whispering, saying, `Don't worry, we will not leave you high and dry.' 
I am very much concerned. Normally we do not address these things until it gets hysterical around here. But rather than to wait to that point, I am going to say right now, a year ahead of time, that we have enough people in this body and the body down the hall who are going to stop the effort to extend beyond the June 30 deadline for our troops remaining in the former Yugoslavia. As I say, there are two reasons for it. One is our state of readiness that is suffering as a result of it. And the second thing is the risk of the people and the cost of that risk. That cost, that $6.5 to $8 billion it is going to cost us, is going to have to come out of somewhere, out of our defense budget. 
The last thing I would say that is impaired by this, this issue we have talked about many times, is the fact we need to finish our national missile defense system that we started in 1983. In 1983--of course, that was the Reagan administration. There were a lot of people at that time who were very, very--they were very concerned over what was going to happen. They had the foresight to say we are going to have to have a system to defend America against a missile that would come in, an ICBM, by the year 2000. So we set up a system whereby we would have something deployable by 1999. 
Up until 1992, when the Clinton administration went in, we were right on schedule. We had an investment. We have a $50 billion investment in the Aegis fleet of 22 ships right now that have rocket-launching capabilities. You can stand on the floor and talk about the four different types of potential systems that we now have an investment in that would offer us a defense against a missile attack from overseas, but perhaps the Aegis system is the best one because it is a matter of protecting an investment, a $50 billion investment. It would only cost $5 billion more to be able to take the launching capability and go out of the atmosphere. 
Why is that important? Because if a missile is launched from China or from North Korea or from Russia--and certainly don't assume something couldn't come from Russia. It could be an accidental launch. We know that. We went through that. When we had the hearings not too long ago, we talked about how long it took to retarget over there and what the risk was of an accidental launch or an unintentional launch from Russia. But if that happened, if we have this system in place where we can go up beyond the atmosphere, we would have about 30 minutes to shoot down a missile that is coming in our direction. We know it works. There is not anyone in America who did not watch on CNN what was going on in the Persian Gulf war. We know that rockets can knock down missiles. So it is a matter of getting it out of the atmosphere. 
If you wait until it comes into the atmosphere, you have about 2 minutes. So the choice there is 30 minutes or 2 minutes. When you have a system that is 90 percent paid for and it takes about $5 billion more and we are spending $6 or $8 billion over in Bosnia, we have to get our priorities straight. Unfortunately, we have a very biased media in this country that does not allow a lot of this stuff to get out. 
We can say it on the floor of the U.S. Senate and we know that we have the facts. But by the time it gets reported, it shifts through the beltway media and people do not realize that risk is out there. 
So I will just say, Mr. President, since we are dealing with the DOD authorization bill today, I would like to serve warning we are going to have a resolution, well in advance, so our allies will know that when June 30, 1998, comes, we are going to be out of Bosnia. I think it is better to go ahead and serve notice early rather than to wait to the last minute. 
Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I would like to just take a couple of minutes to respond to the best of my memory to some of the things that were stated by the senior Senator from Texas [Mr. Gramm]. 
First of all, he mentioned that personality should not enter into this. I certainly hope that will be the case. Unfortunately, Mr. President, all too often in both bodies if we get wrapped up in things we honestly believe in, it becomes personal. I do not think this will be the case, certainly in the case of Senator Gramm. He is a man I have respected for many, many years even before I served in the other body or this body. In fact, I was one of the individuals who strongly supported him in his bid for President of the United States because I thought he was the best choice. And it was not an easy thing for me to do because, unfortunately, our majority leader in the Senate was running. 
However, I think some things need to be brought out and some things I have access to because of the fact that I serve on the Senate Armed Services Committee and chair the readiness subcommittee of the Senate Armed Services Committee. 
First of all, on this issue of the depot caucus we hear so much about in the other body, I hear some statements attributed to them that sound a little bit extreme from time to time, but I have to say also that that is a group of people with a genuine concern over how depot business should be handled. 
All too often we start thinking of parochial concerns, about what is the effect of a certain action going to be on the population of my State, and forget about the fact that there is a reason for a depot and there is a reason for core functions to be performed in a depot. All too long we have gone without a definition of core, and core, Mr. President, as you well know, is those functions that have to be performed to enable us to defend the lives of Americans. 
That is what it is all about. When you talk about the depot caucus over on the other side, I did some things in this bill, and, of course, the Chair is fully aware of it because he was there at the time, made some compromises that the so-called depot caucus found very offensive. I agreed to change the 60-40 formula to 50-50. Also, I did something else that not many people really are aware of because it gets a little bit technical but provided for allowing teaming to be done by a public depot. This is extremely significant and it shows that I of all people am not against private sector competition. 
The Senator from Texas [Mr Gramm] talked about this as one of the backbones of the philosophy of the Republican Party and the conservative movement. Certainly no one can do more than I have done in the effort for privatization. The difference that has to be distinguished in this case is you can't privatize business, you can't privatize functions that are necessary for the survival of this country. 
Let us just say, for example, that in the F-100 engines which are used in some of our combat machines that are necessary to defend America and we saw performing so well in the Persian Gulf war, that has to be done, we have decided, as a policy for America in public depots. And the reason is even if it costs more money--I do not think it does. I think I can come up with an argument that will say that we can do things more efficiently in some of those functions in the public depots; we are set up to do that. But even if we were not able to do that, there is another reason why they have to be done in the public sector, and that is the strategic interests of the United States, the defense issues. 
We have all agreed as the policy of this country that core activities, core functions, must be done by the public sector. And so we established this somewhat arbitrary, which it is arbitrary, 60-40, and I was willing to accommodate one of the very prominent Senators from Arizona on the committee, Senator McCain, and Senator McCain did appreciate that very much. So we changed that, and not only are we going to give the ability to the public depots to team, and that is to go outside and subcontract some work, I am willing to count that in any formula as public sector work, even though it is done by the private sector. 
Now, that is a great, I think, compromise that we made in order to accommodate some of the Senators who had concerns, and consequently that Senator is in support of the language that is found in this bill. 
So I think that if we could present the argument, there is no way you could give even a 20-percent advantage to the public sector in depot maintenance and still have a level playing field. We are fully aware of the process that is written into our system that allows the disposition of Federal properties to 
be first offered to the Federal Government, then the State government, then ultimately to local subdivisions such as Tulsa, OK, or San Antonio, TX. And so in the event they at no cost in the case of a San Antonio, TX, are able to acquire Kelly Air Force Base and have that multi, multimillion-dollar facility at no cost, they in turn then can give that to a contractor who will bid with no overhead whatsoever. 
Now, that is something with which we cannot compete in Tinker Air Force Base or they could not compete with in any other military installation. And there are many other--I have already talked about this and talked about those things that are in the bidding process which make it so that we cannot do it. 
I was a little bit surprised when the junior Senator from Texas was talking about John White. During the committee meetings that we had, John White was not able to answer questions about how to level the playing field and provide for real competition if it is desirable. 
Keep in mind, Mr. President, it is not desirable because we have established as a policy that those core functions that are necessary to protect the lives of Americans should be done in public depots. If you do not do that, you are going to have a situation where we can be held hostage in times of war, and we know what that could mean for us. 
Given the manner in which competition is structured, everyone already knows that private sector bids will come in well below depots, and there are two reasons why. The private bidders can use marginal pricing. We know what marginal pricing is in Government work. Private bidders, unlike the public sector, are allowed to use marginal pricing to underprice something to get their foot in the door, and once the foot is in the door we become reliant upon them and then they run off. I am not saying the people who are the private sector are unscrupulous or in any way demeaning what they do. They are out in the competitive world, and they are willing to use their assets to bid below cost just to get in there so that the public sector would no longer have the ability to provide that work. I think the Senator from Utah made a very good point. We are losing that ability today. As the skilled workers, whether they are located in Oklahoma or Utah or Georgia, are leaving, getting into other professions, so we would have--every week that goes by we would have a more difficult time in having this as public sector work that would defend America. 
So I conclude, Mr. President--and I do not want to be redundant--by saying that another bottom line is right here. This is a GAO report. The GAO report agrees with what the Air Force initially said on how much money would be saved by closing the two bases and transfer that workload to other ALC's. Then they later on, when this administration took a position against it right before the election, they rescinded that report, but the GAO, which is independent of that political influence, came out and said very clearly if you do it, it is going to cost the defense system an additional $468 million a year. And certainly the man who is presiding right now, the honorable Senator from Virginia, who is one of the highest ranking members of the Senate Armed Services Committee, is fully aware that if we have to somehow come up with $2 billion over a 5-year period to take out of the defense budget in order to accommodate an exception to the BRAC recommendations, where is it going to come from? He will remember very well we had the chiefs of the services there, and we gave them the alternatives. It has to come from quality of life, modernization, force strength or readiness. There are only four places it can come from. We cannot predict the contingencies this administration will get us into that are very expensive. We can predict these, and there is no place we can come up with this money. So this is an extremely important fiscal issue, and I wanted to have the opportunity to respond to the senior Senator from Texas. 
Mr. President, I observe the absence of a quorum.

Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I think we all know certain things are true and incontrovertible. One is that a base closing is a very difficult thing to do politically and a very difficult thing to endure as a Member of the U.S. Senate or a Member of the other body, because people look to us and they 
look to us and say, `You are responsible for saving what we have here.' 
I am not eloquent enough to describe the anguish that people go through, that cities go through, that counties and the States go through during a BRAC process. They go out and they hire consultant after consultant and they spend hundreds of thousands of dollars. They go through all of this and, finally, the recommendations come down. We have gone through that in 1991, 1993 and 1995, and it was necessary. It was, I guess, the Army that came up with the initial idea that we try to eliminate excess capacity and infrastructure. But we haven't been able to do it because politically it can't be done. There is no better evidence of that than what is happening today. 
They established a process that was to be totally free from political interference. Seemingly, it worked for a while. I don't have the exact number of installations that have been closed down, but we all understand that we are going through a difficult time with our defense. We all understand that we have a President of the United States who is not strong on defense. He would like to have us think there is no threat out there, that the cold war is over, so we can start reducing down to the point where we cannot begin to defend America on two regional fronts. We all know that is true today. 
The bottom line is that we had too much infrastructure. It was up here. So we brought it down, in 1991, 1993 and 1995, to a level that is down now and still a little bit above our force strength. As far as future BRACs are concerned, I contend that I don't want to get this infrastructure down so artificially low so that when we rebuild, we will not have the infrastructure to accommodate that. I agree with the Senator from Georgia, who says that we have to position ourselves so that we know if we go through all of this anguish again, we will not have political interference. 
Anyway, I am going to tell you a story, Mr. President, and you may not believe me. I think you know me well enough to know that I do tell the truth. I was in a very tough election when I was in the other body, and I ran for the Senate in 1994. I ran against a guy who is young, articulate, and a very smart young man. He was a Member of the House of Representatives, a member of the other party. He was on the House defense committee at that time, which was called the House Armed Services Committee, now called the House National Security Committee. He said, `Elect me and I will use political influence to make sure that none of the bases are damaged in the BRAC processes.' We have five installations in the State of Oklahoma. 
I made a public statement in the newspaper. I said, `I will not use political influence because I know we have to do something about this infrastructure. What I will do is I will stay out of it until the recommendations are made, and when they are made, I will walk through fire to defend the recommendations of the BRAC committee, because the system has to work. We can't allow this to become a politicized system.' 
So we did that pretty well. I have a list here of various States and Senators that cooperated when they came through in 1991, 1993, and 1995 and said they wanted to close certain bases. They said, well, it is going to hurt at home, hurt me politically, but we are going to have to do it. They bit the bullet. 
Now we are asked to make two exceptions. I agree with the Senator from Georgia when, certainly, the Senator from Texas is put in a very awkward situation by our President because, in August of 1996, right before the election, when President Clinton was campaigning out in California with a huge number of electoral votes, he said this to them and made a commitment that `I will see to it that no jobs are lost in California and no jobs are lost in Texas, and we will privatize.' He grabbed that out of the air. So that commitment had to be--I don't think there is anybody in America today that doesn't know that that was a highly politically charged commitment and statement he made. He made that statement. Then that puts everybody in the position that, wait a minute, if you have the President agreeing that we are not going to close those installations, McClellan and Kelly, in California and Texas, what about you Senators, aren't you going to stand behind the President? You have that leverage. 
That is where we are today. So we went through this process. I find myself in the situation now that the recommendations have been made that we are going to have to stand behind the recommendations. 
I want to suggest to you, Mr. President, we have made some compromises. Senator McCain from Arizona had some objections and concerns in our committee. I am chairman of the Readiness Subcommittee of the Senate Armed Services Committee. We went through this and debated these issues for hours and hours on how to protect the integrity of the BRAC system because it became a dollar decision. We were going through the marking up of an authorization bill where we are trying to rebuild our defenses and sustain a level that will adequately protect America. We have considerations on modernization programs that cost money. We have barracks out there needing replacement. There are quality-of-life issues and modernization issues. These things are maybe $100,000 or maybe $1 million a lick. We have had to turn them down. 
Now we have an opportunity to follow the recommendations of the BRAC committee and save the defense system approximately $468 million a year. Now, if you carry that out to 5 years, you are talking about $2.34 billion. If you don't do that, where is the money going to come from? If they are successfully able to compete and end up with the jobs in Texas or California, or privatize in place, it is the same thing. We don't want to confuse people. Those people advocating competition realize that they want competition because they want to protect the jobs there. I understand this. Just because it is dealing in semantics, privatization in place, or competition, where they will be able to leave the jobs there, it doesn't make a difference. The bottom line, as the Senator from Georgia said, is that we will still have five air logistic centers. So it came out with the recommendations. GAO said that if we don't do it, it is going to cost $2.34 billion over a 5-year period. That is money that has to, realistically, come out of the defense system. I don't know where it is going to come from. 
Mr. President, we had several hearings where we had the chiefs of services. So I asked each of the four chiefs of services, `Where are you going to come up with this money?' 
If we end up having to violate the BRAC and it ends up costing us $2 billion, where are you going to come up with the money? It can only come from four areas: Modernization, quality of life, force strength, and readiness. So I asked each one. They said, `We can't take it out of any of those because we are underfunded if all four areas.' They said at one time that it was going to cost another $2 billion in 1 year to bring us up to meeting the minimum of the expectations of the American people to protect America on two regional fronts. 
So we have the recommendations. They said, `All right. If you have five ALC's located in Georgia, Oklahoma, Utah, Texas, and California, we will select two of those to close.' And they used the criteria to operate more efficiently. And we could get into 2 or 3 hours of discussion on how this process works, and how they used the criteria in evaluating the effectiveness of various installations. They came up with the conclusion that we are going to have to close two, and those two should be McClellan and Kelly in California and in Texas. 
When you do that, you redistribute that so that workload goes on to the remaining ALC's. Of course, that will increase the number of jobs in other States. I understand that. But, if you do not do that, you will still be operating five ALC's at 50 percent capacity. The only difference is they will be owned--two of them--by the private sector. You still have the same problem that existed. 
So, if you look at what the alternatives are and look at what we have gone through in the committee process, you will see that we have really given in a lot. I suggested to the Senator from Texas that it was the QDR--Quadrennial Review Defense--review that we went through, and the Secretary of Defense came in, and said, `We think that we should change 60-40 to 50-50.' He made some other recommendations. He said, `We also need to have two more BRAC.' It so happens that the Senator from Arizona, Senator McCain, said, `I think we ought to change it to 50-50.' 
So we sat down, and worked it out. And we agreed to do that. So there have been compromises during this process. We debated this. We went through the whole committee system. We came out, and finally said that even though as individuals it is going to be politically very difficult as it is, and every time you shut down a military installation--we have done over 100 of them so far--it is always difficult to do. It is difficult for the local House and Senate Members. But it has to be done. So the committee voted unanimously to do that. 
Some people have suggested that the GAO report is not accurate. We actually had the committee meeting where we had the GAO people there. 
We said, `We want you to be sure that we understand you correctly. You are saying this is going to cost $468 million. Do you still stand by that today?' 
They said, `The data, as near as we can determine, indicates that that is what the cost will be.' 
I said, `Have you considered everything; privatization in place?' 
They said, `Yes, we have considered that. That is part of the report.' 
So we have an extensive report right here by the GAO that comes up with these conclusions. Some people have suggested that perhaps it was not a part of that report. I will quote something from the report. According to GAO, `The cost to operate the other depots at 50-percent capacity will far exceed any projected savings through public-private competition, $468 million. This fact begs the question: What is the real objective of public-private competition? The only feasible answer is to save jobs, and Texas and California are to appease the private sector appetite for new business. Neither is an acceptable answer.' 
So we did this. We went through this thing. We looked at what the GAO was recommending, and decided that we were going to have to do that. 
This hearing that we had lasted about 3 hours. They said there is no question about the fact that we are going to have to do something to build the others up to a reasonable respectable capacity. 
So that gets into the next issue. `What is the respectable capacity of the remaining ALC's in order to have this logistics system function in a prudent manner in the United States?' GAO said somewhere between 75 and 85 percent. 
You might ask. Why not get them up to 95 or 100 percent? The reason is very clear. If something should happen that we should have to go to war, we are going to have to have that excess capacity to take care of the needs to meet the new threat that is out there. 
That sounds very reasonable. So we have left it there. It is not exactly the same in the House bill as the Senate bill. In the House bill it was 80 percent, and in the Senate bill it was 75 percent--75 percent because Senator McCain thought that 75 percent would be a better number. 
So again, we caved in a little bit on that. So we are now talking about what to do with this and whether or not we should 
allow this process to be violated for the first time. 
I would just suggest to you that almost every State has had to undergo the closure of some type of installation. It would be very difficult. 
I saw Senator Sessions walking through here just a minute ago. For him to go back to the State of Alabama and say that we now are going to go ahead and make an exception, and they would say, `Wait a minute. Why wasn't the exception made in Alabama, in fact, where we really wanted to keep our bases open?' 
So it is difficult when you lose jobs. We have had to bite the bullet and go through this. A majority of the Members of this U.S. Senate have had to go through with that. 
Mr. President, there has also been some discussion that perhaps they left an option open. I know several people who for political reasons would like to believe that there is another option that is out there, and they clearly said they had been closed out. 
Let me read a couple of the things that I think are necessary for us to understand. If it had been the intent of the BRAC Commission to leave an option to privatize in place, they would have said there is an option to privatize in place. In the case of 1993 BRAC round in Newark, the Newark Air Force Base, they said, `The workload can either be contracted out to one or more of several existing manufacturers, or privatize in place.' 
They said in the 1995 Naval Service Warfare Center in Louisville, `Transfer workload equipment and facilities to the private sector for local jurisdiction, as appropriate, if the private sector can accommodate the workload on-site.' That is privatization in place on-site. But what they clearly intended in this case was not to have privatization in place--not to leave the jobs on site because they want to consolidate them. 
Last, I want to mention that this should not be a jobs issue. This is a national security issue. The whole reason, Mr. President, that we came up initially on this 60-40, which was a ratio--it was arbitrary, and I am the first one to say that it is arbitrary and needs to be changed at a date when we can correct the national security ramifications of this issue. But until then we are trying to keep some type of a ratio in place that would allow the public sector to be able to know that in case of war we are not going to be held hostage by one supplier. 
That is the big issue. Should that be 60 percent? I was willing to go 50 percent. But I think a better solution is to do what we did in this bill. We have a good bill. In this bill for the first time we have defined what core is. Core is for those functions that are performed that are necessary for us to defend America. That is a fairly simple definition. But that is it. 
So, if we define core, then we say that we are going to have to do the core work on site. That would solve the problem. We wouldn't be talking about 60-40 or 50-50. 
So I made a commitment to Senator McCain that, if we can go ahead and drop the 50-50, let's give it a couple of years. Let's allow them to see how this works with our new definition of core, and see if we can't solve it that way and get away from this somewhat arbitrary type of a formula. 
So the real issue here is twofold, I would say. One is we have involved a lot of money, and, if we do not do this, we are going to have to come up with it somewhere. It is going to be a very costly process if we agree that we are going to violate the intent and the letter of the BRAC. 
No. 2, this is even more important than just the money; that is, we are talking about defending America. We are talking about having a capability in the public sector to be able to have air logistics centers. That will keep our airplanes in the air, and will keep our soldiers fighting in the event that war comes up. 
People would like to say there is not that threat out there. I am not going to go into my normal speech that I make when we talk about this. I have to tell you. I look wistfully back to the days of the cold war when we had one other superpower, and our intelligence knew pretty well where they were. We knew what threat was out there, and we defined that threat. We could predict how the Soviets were going to act. That is not true anymore. We have some 25 nations that have weapons of mass destruction. We have a country that was just written about in yesterday's newspaper in the Washington Times that the Chinese now are selling more and more technology in systems to deliver those weapons of mass destruction to countries like Iran. 
So we are faced not with just one single predictable superpower who poses a threat to us but also to many, many powers out there. 
So as a member of the Armed Services Committee, as chairman of the Readiness Committee, I can say that the big issue here is we have a country to defend and as difficult as the process is, as difficult as it is to go through, as upset as I am with the President for politicizing this in August 1996, nonetheless, we are going to have to try to stay as close to the recommendations as possible. Because, if we violate it just one time, I can tell you right now it is not only going to be the Senator from Georgia who said, `If we do not go ahead and carry out the recommendations of the 1995 round, I am going to oppose any future BRAC recommendations.' I can assure you that I will do the same thing. I imagine the majority of the Members of this Senate are going to come up with the position that if we do not carry out the recommendations that were clearly identified in the 1995 round that we are not going to have any more base closure rounds. 
So for the time being, I yield the floor, and will stay engaged here.

Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I have some comments to make in response to the very eloquent comments of the Senator from Texas, but first I ask if she would answer one question that I have. I think it is probably the most important question that could be asked, in these terms. We all understand. Although the Senator is not on the Armed Services Committee now as she was last year, she knows the significance of an authorization bill. I think we all agree that this, the defense authorization bill, which the Senator presiding right now was a very important part of, is a very significant bill. 
While she gives a compelling case--and I know it comes from the heart--on privatization, on changing what our interpretation of what the BRAC recommendations are, would she be willing, in order to protect the authorization bill, to go ahead, let's take the bill up in the form that it is and offer an amendment to strike that provision that she finds objectionable so we can then isolate that one problem and still have an authorization bill, not hold the entire authorization bill hostage, which I am sure she would agree would not be in the best interests of the country? Would the Senator be willing to do that?

Mr. INHOFE. I thank the Senator from Texas for that answer, but it is really a shorter answer I was looking for. That is, would the Senator be willing to take up her issue, that which she finds objectionable about the defense authorization bill, and debate that thoroughly on the floor--and if she is 
more persuasive or has a better case, then, of course, she would prevail on that--instead of blocking the entire authorization bill? This is my concern. The Senate is different than the other body that I served in for 8 years. Over there, you cannot do that. But in the Senate I guess one person can just block a bill from being passed. I hope the Senator from Texas would consider offering her position as an amendment to strike the language that was put in by the committee. 
I will not ask for a response now, but I hope she would consider doing that.

Mr. INHOFE. I thank the Senator from Texas. She brings up a very good point, and that is we are in the middle of a process now that is very complicated. First of all, we have our defense authorization bill. It is very, very significant that we get this passed because we have pay raises for those people who are serving right now in Bosnia and other places. We have military construction projects that, if we do not pass this authorization bill, can be in jeopardy. This goes far beyond depot maintenance. I just hope, instead of holding up the entire authorization bill, that we could address this in a way where an amendment could be crafted by the Senator from Texas that would take out the offensive language and then debate it openly, for hours and hours. Because these are critical decisions. 
I have to respond to a few things that were said. First of all, the idea of privatization in place--no one is going to exceed my efforts for the past 30 years for privatization in place. I can remember when I was mayor of the city of Tulsa, I was privatizing everything that would not move. I remember our trash system--we privatized it in place. Of course, people do not like change. I can remember they ended up dumping in my front yard. However, now it is the greatest system we could have had--privatization in place. 
There is a big difference between privatizing a trash system and privatizing a core responsibility of the military. So here we are trying to defend America and putting ourselves in a posture where, if we follow all the way through with the privatization argument and privatize everything in the military, then we would not have a core capability within the public sector to defend America. That is clearly what this issue is all about. 
I would also like to talk a little bit about the committee process that we have gone through. The Senator from Texas talks about the committee perhaps not coming out with the right conclusions. We have been going through this every year. Certainly I, when I was in the other body, sat through this process. Am I happy with it? No. I would like to have a better process. The committee process is a very difficult one and it is one of compromise. We have compromised. 
In this process our committee--first of all, in the Subcommittee on Readiness we discussed this issue, we aired it. It was not partisan. It was not Republicans versus Democrats. It was how can we address the issue of having enough of the critical workload, core workload in the public sector so we know if a war comes up we will not be in a hostage situation by one supplier or one contractor who might be in a position to undercut the public sector a little bit at the present time. That is really what it is about. 
So we discussed this and we aired this in committee. I see now that Senator Thurmond, the chairman of the committee, is here in the Chamber. I am just reminded that, back when it was very difficult for the Senator from South Carolina to comply with it, they came along and closed, in the 1993 BRAC round, the Charleston naval shipyard. He does not have to answer this question, but I can tell you right now he was not very happy about that. But he bit the bullet and said we have to eliminate excess capacity. 
I can say the Senator who is presiding right now, Senator Coats--Mr. President, you can remember when you had to close 
Fort Benjamin Harrison in Indiana. Was that fun? No, it was not fun. But you were very strong at that point and said we have to protect the integrity of this nonpoliticized process and close excess capacity. There is hardly a Senator in here who did not have to bite the bullet. All of a sudden, we are saying the system is not good and we are going to have to ignore the BRAC process for facilities in two States. There are 50 States. There are still 50 States. This is just two States we are talking about. So we went from the subcommittee into the committee, and Senator Thurmond will remember that we debated this hour after hour. We had amendments that were offered that would strike the language that we put in, saying in order to protect the integrity of the BRAC system, we have to close two of the ALC's and move that workload so others are going to have at least 75 percent capacity. The House said 80 percent, the Senate said 75 percent, and we debated that. We had some votes that were really close votes. 
If you remember, Mr. President, we debated these and had the votes, and then there were amendments that were offered, and in the final analysis, we came out and said this bill is a good bill. This bill does things we have been trying to do for a long time. We have been trying to define what is core. Always before we have had a very loose definition that the DOD has used, and that has been acceptable, and we took their definition and put it into this bill so we will have a definition of what is core, what is necessary to be performed by the public sector in order to protect us in times of war so we do not become dependent upon some outside contractor. 
So we have that definition in there. We also have another compromise that I made, and that is, one of the reasons--in a minute I am going to talk about the bidding process--we can't have any kind of bidding on this thing that is fair to the public sector is because they cannot do the same things the private sector can do. So we put in a teaming provision. That is to say that the public sector can do what the private sector can do. Let's take Tinker Air Force base in Oklahoma City. If Tinker Air Force base wants to compete for some of the workload that private contractors in Texas are currently trying to hold, they cannot subcontract out or have teaming arrangements with other subcontractors on work that they would like. In this bill, when we pass this authorization bill, we put a provision in here that says, yes, they can go ahead and contract out. So, if they find the private sector can do one particular function or one product more efficiently than the public sector can, then they can go ahead and do that and that work will be counted as public work in any formula. 
That is a great concession, and it is one I don't mind making, because in that situation, the private sector could do the work, but we could not be held hostage because the public sector would control the contracting out of that work. They want to do it. There is not an ALC in America that doesn't want to have the capability of contracting out small parcels that might be better done while they can still protect the core condition or concern that is there. 
We have things such as bundling in a package. I can tell you right now that if they continue the way they are doing it right now in trying to induce competition for these core responsibilities, that they are going to win. You cannot compete when you are operating on a playing field that isn't level. 
Right now they can bundle it, and they have bundled these projects, for example, in Texas, so that only those in Texas could come out realistically and win this thing. 
In our statutes, we have depreciation schedules, where the private sector can use a different schedule than the public sector. We have another provision, which I don't disapprove of, which is one that I, as mayor of Tulsa, actually had the opportunity at one time to participate in, and that is when they decided that Air Force Plant No. 3 in Tulsa, OK, was no longer inventory that the Air Force wanted and wanted to have to keep up, we went through this process, the process of divesting ourselves of inventory we do not want: First, we let the Federal agencies look at it to see if they want it. If they want it, it is taken up there. If not, it goes to the State, and if not there, it goes to the local communities and counties. 
In the case of Air Force Plant No. 3, the city of Tulsa ended up with it. What can we do now? We can take that and, at no cost, offer it to a contractor to go out there and compete. This is, I suggest, exactly what can happen and will happen if they are successful in what they call competition down at Kelly for some of the ALC work. They would be able to pick up that base that is closed, that resource worth many, many, many millions of dollars, give it, for all practical purposes, to a contractor. That contractor can submit a bid and bid against any of the remaining ALCs at no cost for overhead. 
So here we are in Utah or Georgia or in Oklahoma saying we are going to have to pay for all of this overhead in our bid, we have to account for that some way, and they get something free. No, we can't bid. I don't care if we gave them a 20-percent advantage, there is no way we could do that, and we shouldn't be talking about that anyway because the issue here is national defense. Are we going to be capable, Mr. President, of defending America, of handling those core issues and concerns within the public sector? 
I have to share something, because the very eloquent Senator from Texas quoted a number of people, and I would like to suggest to you, Mr. President, that of the eight members of the BRAC committee, only one who came out for privatization in place as something that is reasonable. I would like to read to you what some of the other Commissioners said. This comes from Commissioner Steele. She said:  
The Commission was, in general, supportive of privatization of DOD industrial activities where appropriate. However, privatization as a concept and forced privatization in place of what is clearly excess depot capacity are two very different issues. 
In the specific case of Sacramento and San Antonio ALCs, the Commission was very aware that we were recommending the closure of two very large industrial activities. The Commission's recommendation to consolidate these workloads, other than common-use ground-communication and electronics work, `to other DOD depots or to private sector commercial activities as determined by the Defense Depot Maintenance Council. Move the required equipment * * * to the receiving locations'-- 
`To the receiving locations,' that means a location other than Kelly Air Force Base and other than McClellan out in California, because you still don't resolve the problem, if you merely privatize in place and end up with five, so to say, ALCs all operating at 50-percent capacity. 
Forced privatization in place of all of the workload is contrary to the intent of Report language. 
She says, further reading toward the end of the letter: 
The Commission clearly did not intend to privatize in place all of the workload from the 2 ALCs we voted to close, as noted in our Findings, `closure * * * permits significantly improved utilization of the remaining depots and reduces DOD operating costs.' Where the Commission encourages privatization in place, our Report addresses it directly * * * 
And she cites the page numbers. 
Such was not the case with the ALCs. 
Finally: 
If any Commissioner had offered a motion-- 
Listen, Mr. President-- 
If any Commissioner had offered a motion to privatize in place, as the President proposes, I am 100-percent certain that such a motion would have been defeated handily. 
This is Wendi Steele, a Commissioner who went through all the processes. I won't go through the whole letter from Commissioner Lee Kling, but I will read the last paragraph of his letter. Now keep in mind, these are two of the eight Commissioners. We have letters from all but former Senator Dixon. 
He says: 
The Commission's review clearly documented significant excess capacity in the five Air Force Air Logistic Centers. Privatization in place of all of the workload of Sacramento and San Antonio Air Logistic Centers could result in little or no savings to the Air Force by the closures. Further, it might result in privatizing excess capacity rather than eliminating it and could also miss the opportunity to improve the efficiency of other DOD depots by increasing their utilization.

Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, this is taken directly out of the BRAC language. It is critical that we find ourselves in a situation where we are going to be able to actively interpret the intent of the BRAC Commissioners. Eight Commissioners, and they used the same criteria everywhere they went. They visited all the installations. They were in Oklahoma. It was very tense. We have five installations in Oklahoma. They went to all of them. These people worked for years to try to come up with conclusions, so I am going to read some of the conclusions they have, and then I would like to yield to the Senator from Georgia, if it is his desire to be heard on this subject.

Mr. INHOFE. I appreciate you calling that to our attention. I also, Mr. President, call to your attention the Commissioner in question is a resident--was a resident, I assume is still a resident--of Houston, TX, and she had not been on the staff of Senator Nickles for some time. 
I think when we went through this process of determining whether or not anyone was prejudiced on that Commission, I asked every Commissioner questions. I asked them: `Are you going to use the criteria in an unprejudiced manner?' And they all responded yes. There is not one person who objected to Wendi Steele. 
I will also say, I also quoted extensively Lee Kling. I don't believe Lee Kling was ever on Senator Nickles' staff. 
I want to yield to the Senator from Georgia, but since it is so critical we know what the intent was, not just by reading the reports from the Commissioners, let me just go ahead and read a few things that actually came from the BRAC commission report. These are quotes, Mr. President, if you will bear with me for just a moment. 
. . . significant excess capacity and infrastructure in the Air Force depot system requires closure of the San Antonio ALC. 
They addressed separately the question in California. But the point here is, I keep hearing, don't worry about it, they are already closed. No one is going to be naive enough to say 
by closing it, they didn't fully intend to stop the excess capacity from taking place in Texas and in California. It was assumed that that would take place. 
Second: 
. . . closure of the San Antonio ALC and related activities in Kelly AFB, including the defense distribution depot and information processing megacenter, permits significantly improved utilization of the remaining depots and reduces DOD operating costs. 
Third, another direct quote from the BRAC committee: 
The Commission found the cost to realign Kelly AFB to be less than that estimated by the DOD and the annual savings to be significantly greater than DOD's estimate. 
I heard someone, I believe it was the Senator from California, just a short while ago make a statement--maybe I am not attributing that to the right person--saying that the GAO study did not take into consideration relocation. The GAO study clearly did take into consideration relocation. 
Quoting further: 
The Commission assumed that a depot closure and consolidation of work would permit a personnel reduction-- 
Listen, Mr. President-- of 15 percent of selected ALC personnel and a 50 percent reduction in management overhead personnel. 
Further quoting: 
The decision to close the San Antonio ALC is a difficult one, but given the significant amount of excess depot capacity and limited defense resources, closure is a necessity . . . The San Antonio ALC closure will permit improved utilization of the remaining ALCs and substantially reduce DOD operating costs. 
I could go on all day with these things. There is a lot of redundancy here. 
But it clearly expresses to us what their decision was and what they meant. 
The Commission staff presented data indicating large annual savings could be realized by consolidating engine maintenance activities at Tinker Air Force Base, OK. Both Kelly and Tinker are operating at less than 50 percent of their engine maintenance capacity. * * * The Commission urges the Air Force to consolidate engine maintenance activity at Tinker to reduce excess capacity. The Commission firmly believes that consolidation of engine activities will result in lower costs and increased efficiencies. 
Again, Mr. President, there can be no doubt that even if you tried to isolate certain things that were said or maybe a rumor that was heard down in Kelly Air Force Base, I do not think we should be talking about statements that cannot be documented and rumors that someone said this or someone said something else. 
If you just stop and realize, if you have five ALC's operating at 50-percent capacity, and you close two, and, as the bill calls for, you do not privatize anything in place there until the remaining, more efficient--according to the BRAC process--certification of ALC's located in Oklahoma and Utah and in Georgia are operating at a minimum of 75-percent capacity, I do not care if it is 65 percent, but the bottom line is anyone who has any business background knows that you cannot operate at 50-percent capacity and do so efficiently. 
I do not think we need to attack the integrity of the independent commissioners. I feel that people like Wendie Steele and Lee Kling and the rest of them have spent time, their valuable time--sure there is compensation, but there are very few people who would be willing to take 2 years out of their lives to do nothing but evaluate the operation of literally hundreds of military installations. 
Now, I have a lot more things to talk about. I would like to yield to the Senator from Georgia. You know, I commented several times, as he sat in there with us in the Senate Armed Services Committee, that this not a partisan thing. This is about defending America. 
So I yield the floor. 
Mr. CLELAND addressed the Chair. 
</TEXT>
</DOC>

<DOC>
<DOCNO>105-inhofe-ok-18-19970618</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
Mr. INHOFE. That is my understanding. 
Before the Senator from Georgia got in here, I commented on several of the States. For example, Indiana, where the presiding office is from, he lost, and did so with grace, as much grace as he could, a major installation in Indiana. 
Our own chairman, Senator Thurmond, I mean, no one, no one can have more political influence to stop the closing of a base in his home State than the chairman of the Armed Services Committee. And Senator Thurmond was willing to say, all right we have to bite the bullet. 
The big issue here is, we need to use the money that is used on excess capacity to be spent on such things as modernization, quality of life, on readiness, on force strength. These are the things that we need to be talking about. 
So, yes, the whole thing on privatization in place, it was anticipated someone might bring it up. So the GAO in their report, when they came to the conclusion that if you privatize that excess capacity in place in Sacramento and in San Antonio, it is going to cost the taxpayers, and I say cost the defense system, because that is what it is going to come out of--$468 million a year. Over the 5 years, they said that is $2.34 billion. 
In further responding to the Senator's question, I would say, you sat there in those committee meetings when we had the service chiefs in there and said, `Where are we going to come up with the money if we don't carry out the recommendations of the BRAC system?' We have to come up with several hundred million dollars. Is it going to kill the force stream and quality of life and come out of modernization. `Where is it going to come from?' What did they say? They said, `We don't have anything for it to come out of.'

<DOCNO>105-inhofe-ok-19-19970618</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
Mr. INHOFE. That is a very good point. 
In fact, several people, who would like to have us believe that--referring to the privatization in place--very conveniently leave out one sentence when they talk about realigning Kelly Air Force Base, including the air logistics center. The last sentence says, `Move the required equipment * * * [and any required personnel] to the receiving locations * * *.' 
That means not there. Do not privatize excess capacity where you maintain the problem of having five locations, each operating at 50-percent capacity. It is very, very clear. 
</TEXT>
</DOC>

<DOC>
<DOCNO>105-inhofe-ok-20-19970618</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
Mr. INHOFE. You know, that is one of the three bottom lines here. It is just so logical that if you have five operating at 50-percent capacity--as they said in this overdraft quoted out of their report; they said it over and over again--you have to close two and transfer the workload. 
Now, the whole idea of privatization came up--and I hate to say it, but it was highly political. We all get political right before an election. This is what happened right before the election. And it happened out in California. There are a lot of electoral votes in California. The administration said: `We want to privatize in place.' 
But clearly you are right. The Senator from Georgia is exactly right. That does not resolve the problems. 
A minute ago I said there are three bottom lines. That is one bottom line. Another bottom line is the fact that this is a national defense issue. How can we be sure that if there is a war, if Iran decides they are going to use some of that technology and the systems they are getting out of China or Russia and go to war with us, that we are going to be in a position to fight that war? It is a national security issue so that if we do get in a war, we will not become dependent, for those core activities, on a private contractor. 
You know, I am all for privatization in place. But that is the other issue. 
The third, of course, is cost. Those who say that GAO did not consider privatization in place, they did. The GAO was before our committee. You were there with me. We sat there for several hours. We cross-examined this gentleman. He said, and repeated over and over again, `Yes, the costs. It is going to be to the taxpayers or to the defense system. We proximate $468 million a year.' Then I said, `Is that old information? Is that new?' `No; we brought it up to date.' 
So that is their current position. That is their past position. The GAO was set up to be an independent agency to evaluate these things free of political interference. They came out with this, that third-cost thing. The Senator from Georgia knows the problems that we are suffering from right now in our defense system. He knows that we cannot come up with $2 or $3 billion and take it out of something that is existing. So the Senator from Georgia is exactly right.

<TEXT>
Mr. INHOFE. I respond to the suggestion of the Senator from Georgia that in capacity, there is potentially enough capacity so there will be a public depot in the event of war and 
have some capacity to grow into it. That is the reason that, again, it is somewhat arbitrary as to whether it is 75, 80, or 85 percent. The GAO again said that you should operate the three remaining air logistics centers somewhere between 75 and 85 percent capacity to leave enough capacity so that, as the Senator suggests, in time of war we would have that capacity and then we would be at full capacity. Clearly this is a national defense issue.

<DOCNO>105-inhofe-ok-22-19970618</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
Mr. INHOFE. Before the Senator yields the floor, I would like to respond, in a way. We are talking about this as being a major national defense issue. That is what it is really all about. 
I am deeply concerned because I understand, certainly not as well as some of the others around here, that the Senate rules do provide that any one Senator can stop the train, can stop and can kill a bill. 
I see Senator Thurmond down there, the chairman of our committee, the hours that we put into this thing. I just hope that those who disagree with one small part--this is a tiny part of this bill. We have pay raises for our guys in Bosnia. We have modernization programs in there. We have barracks that are starting construction right now that we have to continue. We have literally hundreds of things that are totally out of this realm, not associated with the depot maintenance, that are in this bill. 
So I just hope that those who are opposed to this part or any part of the bill would not use the Senate prerogative that each Senator has to stop the bill altogether so that we will not have the defense authorization bill, but merely offer amendments to take out those parts that they find offensive. I am prepared to debate against such amendments that might cause this to come out. 
So, I just respond by saying, I hope that you share my concern that we do not want to hold up the defense authorization bill. Let us go ahead, as Senator Thurmond had suggested in a meeting yesterday and said we have a good bill here. A lot of good things are in it. If somebody does not like some provision, they have every right to stand here on the floor and argue that case and be as persuasive as they can to take that out. I think that is the process, for the sake of America's defense, that should be used. 
I assume the Senator from Georgia would agree with that.

Mr. INHOFE. Of course, the Senator from Georgia being the ranking member of the Personnel Subcommittee, and Senator Kempthorne, being the chairman, as I go around and make the base visits, it is very distressing. You mentioned flight pay. 
We are losing our quality pilots to the private sector because there is a great demand out there. How can we compete, when these guys are willing to do it? They want to fly the F-16's, the F-14's and the F-18's, and the equipment we have, the heavy equipment, the B-1's and B-2's, and so forth, but they also have families and they have children and we have to provide them with the pay that is somewhat competitive. We are way below that. However, you are able to get in some provisions that will, I think, retain some of these pilots. 
Right now we are in the middle of an incredible housing shortage and we have troops on food stamps, we have housing that they would not let prisoners live in. 
We have a lot of improvements here due to your hard work and that of Senator Kempthorne. To jeopardize all of that work just because of one small provision--I suggest there are some things I do not like in this bill. If I do not like them I will offer an amendment to take it out. That is the process. I just hope we can follow that process.

Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill to address the situation encountered when certain members of our Federal law enforcement community are no longer able to perform their assigned duties. These members of the Federal law enforcement community to which I refer are not people, but canines. 
The purpose of this legislation is simple. The bill will streamline the regulations that govern the adoption of Federal law enforcement canines by their handlers. Currently, these animals are considered Federal property and when their tenure of service has ended, they are considered surplus Government property. Under current Federal regulations, Government agencies are forced to comply with procedures to ensure maximum return for the Government's investment in the animal at auction. 
These animals have received special security training to best equip them for the demands of their duties. Because of the hazards associated with their duties, this specialized training often makes these animals unsuitable as pets for those not trained to handle these animals. 
Because of the highly specialized training these animals receive, they should not be simply auctioned to the highest bidder. Currently, if no trained handler comes forward and offers the highest bid for the animal, the possibility exists that it will spend the rest of its life caged, or even worse, destroyed. 
Under this legislation, the eligible animals would be donated to their handlers, who would then assume all costs and responsibilities associated to the care of that animal. This practice is commonplace for local law enforcement agencies nationwide. 
This is not a drastic departure from previous Government procedure. In 1993, the General Services Administration granted a waiver for Border Patrol canine handlers to purchase their partners for a nominal fee. Unfortunately, this waiver has expired and has not been renewed. 
Mr. President, this is a commonsense solution to a very simple problem. I urge my colleagues to support this bill and ease the restrictions concerning the adoption of Federal law enforcement canines.

Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I know there is some misunderstanding over what is happening right now in terms of this emergency supplemental, and I believe maybe some clarification would be in order. 
The very distinguished Senator from Minnesota spent 30 minutes expressing his anxiety over the passage of this emergency supplemental legislation. Let me assure you, Mr. President, if you were listening to that, that there are not any people in North Dakota or in Minnesota right now who are going without the emergency provisions that are authorized. And, as a matter of fact, there are some things that won't really be done, such as the outright replacing of infrastructure and some of those things. 
So it is not as if those people are being ignored. It is not as if we went off and took a vacation during the time that was happening. 
But I think it is important to mention a couple of other things that are in this emergency supplemental. I am hoping that the President won't veto it. It is not at all unusual that the bill is not sent to the President. If it were sent to the President after it was only passed on Thursday night, by Monday morning, then, that would probably set some new kind of a record around here. Things don't move that fast. There is nothing unusual about the fact that this bill has not been sent to the President. But this presupposition that the President is going to veto it, I think, is really wrong. I think the President will have to look very closely at whether or not he wants to veto this emergency legislation. 
For one thing, it is the President that got us into the situation that we are in in Bosnia right now. But we should never have sent troops over to Bosnia when you have a military budget that is suffering and while we have great threats that are out there to send troops on humanitarian missions and peacekeeping missions all around the world where we don't have strategic interests at stake. 
I can remember 18 months ago standing on this floor when the President of the United States said that the cost in Bosnia would be somewhere between $1.5 and $2 billion. At that time I said, `I bet it will be $8 billion before it is over.' Guess what? It is already passing through $6.5 billion. And some of the money that is in this emergency supplemental is going to be going to support the effort in Bosnia. It has already been paid. 
But this is replenishing, the same as it is up in North Dakota and for some of the flood victims. They have been addressed. Problems have been addressed. Of course, we do need to replenish that emergency fund, which we intend to do. 
But I think the main thing is the idea that the President is going to automatically veto this. I think you know that the automatic continuing resolution is on this, which I think is very, very good. It wasn't too long ago that the President shut down the Government and blamed the majority party for it, and if we had this continuing resolution in place, that couldn't happen again. All we want to do is to be sure that we are going to be able to carry on Government and let Government operate in the event there is an 
impasse between Congress and the President of the United States on some appropriations bills. That is exactly what this is all about. So, if we had the continuing resolution that is passed, which is a part of this emergency supplemental legislation, then the continuing resolution will provide that Government won't shut down, that it will continue to operate at last year's funding level, which I think is very reasonable. We don't want to shut down Government. That way, we can ensure it won't happen. That is all in this emergency supplemental. 
So I am hoping, of course, that the President doesn't use the automatic continuing resolution as an excuse to veto this bill, because if he does, what he is saying is, I want Government to be able to be shut down. It is as simple as that. 
Lastly, I say that I have the utmost respect for the Senator from Minnesota. Quite often you see different philosophies expressed on this floor. Of course, his is quite different than mine. I think the basic difference is that when we look at money that Government spends, we look at it as coming from the taxpayers rather than just some big pot of money that is owned by Government. So we have conservatives and we have liberals. And the distinguished Senator from Minnesota, Senator Wellstone, is very liberal, and we are very conservative. 
So this is a forum where those things can be heard. I think, in good time, the President will get this emergency supplemental, and I am certainly hopeful that the President will not veto the supplemental. 
I yield the floor. 
Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I just wanted to share a few thoughts with you on something that came up this last week. 
I was quite distressed when I heard that the President of the United States--the administration--suggesting that maybe our troops in Bosnia are going to be there for a longer period of time than the deadline having been established of June 30, 1998. This bothers me a great deal, for one reason in particular, and that is, I am chairman of the Readiness Subcommittee of the Senate Armed Services Committee. Back when the decision was made in 1995 to send troops to Bosnia, many of us felt this was not a good idea--not that we are not compassionate, but that we were using our very rare, precious resources, after this administration has decimated virtually our defense budget to send troops over to areas and endanger their lives where we have no national security interest at stake. 
This is something that bothers quite a few of us. So we introduced back in November 1995 a resolution of disapproval to stop the President from sending troops over to Bosnia. This only lost by four votes, or we could have perhaps kept our troops from being sent over to Bosnia. 
I was concerned about this because I went to Bosnia to see what our interests might be over there. When I went up to the northeast sector, the northeastern part of Bosnia, where it would be under the jurisdiction of the support of the United States for our station troops to be stationed, I got up there, and when I told the people up there that it was going to be 12 months, as the President promised, that our troops would be over there--this is November 1995, keep in mind--General Hoagland, in charge of the 
northeast sector for the United Nations, made this statement. He started laughing. He said, `You mean 12 years, don't you?' I said, `No, 12 months. The President has promised that this is a 12-month operation, that if we deploy the troops to Bosnia, they would be back in 12 months.' 
So nobody really believed rationally that would happen. However, because of the President's promise that the troops would be back in 12 months, they were able to get enough votes to defeat our resolution of disapproval. And they sent the troops over to Bosnia. 
Now we are in a position where we will do everything in our power to support the troops over in Bosnia. But at the time when he said they would all be back by December 1996, all of a sudden, as soon as the election was over, we find that the troops are going to be extended over there another 18 months, or until June 30 of 1998. 
This is kind of a creeping thing that we go through, such as we experienced many years ago with our Marines in Guatemala. We have many other examples where we have gone in for a limited period of time. I can remember when we sent troops over to Somalia and they were going to be over there for a short period of time. And they stayed. It wasn't until 19 of our Rangers were murdered and their bodies dragged through the streets of Mogadishu that finally there was enough pressure to bring our troops back home. 
I am very concerned now because, as I suspected would be the case, the President, who, again, has promised the second time that all the troops would be back home now by June 30, 1998, has started to renege on that. We can't let this happen. 
The cost they talked about for the Bosnian operation initially was $2 billion. It has now turned out to be closer to $8 billion, as I predicted over 18 months ago it would be, and we are at least creeping up to $6.5 billion. 
Where does that money come from? We are going to be asked to vote for an emergency supplemental. That is to pay for the additional cost over there, along with other problems, other flood problems and emergencies that existed, and a few cats and dogs thrown into the bill. However, in this case, we have to spend the money. 
Where does it come out of? It comes out of our defense budget, which is already strained to the point where we can't carry out the minimum expectations of the American people, and that is to defend America on two regional fronts. 
So we have a second reason. Not only are we endangering the lives of our troops over there, but we are also spending money that should be going into building and rebuilding our Nation's defense system. 
So, Mr. President, I want to get on record, as I did in Brussels when I gave the speech to NATO, that I would do everything, with every fiber in my being, to make sure that the troops come back. 
I would suggest this, however. I think the President is in the bully pulpit on this. I think he keeps continuing to want to leave them over there knowing full well that once the troops leave, it will go back to just like it was before. The Croats, Muslims, the Serbs, the Mujaheddin, the Arkan Tigers, the Black Swans--all of the other rogue forces--will be over there fighting as they were before. 
And then he can say, well, if we had left them their longer, that would not have happened. Recognizing that is going to happen regardless, I still say, Mr. President, we should all resolve to ourselves that our troops should come on the second deadline that we have standing. That is June 30, 1998. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I have been working with representatives of the aviation industry on legislation that will address a problem with the Federal Aviation Administration. Let me, first of all, say that back in real life I have been a professional pilot for some 40 years. I am a little bothered, too, at some of the things taking place in the aviation industry. I have seen great injustice done many, many times, having to do with the emergency revocation powers of the FAA. In a revocation action, brought on an emergency basis, the certificate holder loses use of his certificate immediately, without an intermediary review by an impartial third party. The result is that the certificate holder is grounded and, in most cases, is out of work until the issue is adjudicated. I believe the FAA unfairly uses this necessary power to prematurely revoke certificates when the circumstances do not support such drastic action. A more reasonable approach, Mr. President, when safety is not an issue, would be to adjudicate the revocation on a nonemergency basis, allowing the certificate holder to continue use of his certificate. 
Please don't misunderstand me. In no way do I want to suggest that the FAA should not have emergency revocation powers. I believe it is critical to safety that the FAA can ground unsafe airmen and other certificate holders. However, I also believe that the FAA must be judicious in its use of this extraordinary power. A review of recent emergency cases clearly demonstrates a pattern by which the FAA uses their emergency powers as standard procedure rather than an extraordinary measure. 
Perhaps the most visible case is that of Bob Hoover, who happens to probably be the best pilot in America today. He is up in age. I have watched him and have been in a plane with him. He can set a glass of water on the panel of an airplane and do a barrel roll without spilling any of the water. He is highly regarded as an aerobatic pilot. In 1992, his medical certificate was revoked based on alleged questions regarding his cognitive abilities. After getting a clean bill of health from four separate sets of doctors--just one of the many tests cost Bob $1,700--and over the continuing objections of the Federal air surgeon, who never even examined Bob Hoover personally, his medical certificate was reinstated only after then-Administrator David Henson intervened. And I want to take this opportunity to tell David Henson what a great job he did for aviation, and for one person. 
Unfortunately, Bob Hoover is not out of the woods yet. 
His current medical certificate expires on September 30, 1997. Unlike most airmen who can renew their medical certificate with a routine application and exam, Bob has to furnish the FAA with a report of a neurological evaluation every 12 months. 
It is a very expensive and unnecessary process. 
Mr. President, Bob Hoover's experience is just one of many. In a way, his wasn't as bad, because some of them do this--like professional airline pilots--for a living. 
I have several other examples of pilots who have had their licenses revoked on an emergency basis. Pilots such as Ted Stewart who has been an American Airlines pilot for more than 12 years and is presently a Boeing 767 captain. Until January 1995, Mr. Stewart had no complaints registered against him or his flying. In January 1995 the FAA suspended Mr. Stewart's examining authority as part of a larger FAA effort to respond to a problem of falsified ratings. The full NTSB board exonerated Mr. Stewart in July 1995. In June 1996, he received a second revocation. One of the charges in this second revocation involved falsification of records for a flight instructor certificate with multiengined rating and his air transport pilot [ATP] certificate dating back to 1979. 
Like most, I have questioned how an alleged 17 1/2 -year-old violation could constitute an emergency; especially, since he has not been cited for any cause in the intervening 
years. Nonetheless, the FAA vigorously pursued this action. On August 30, 1996, the NTSB issued its decision in this second revocation and found for Mr. Stewart. A couple of comments in the Stewart decision bear closer examination. First, the board notes that:  
The administrator's loss in the earlier case appears to have prompted further investigation of respondent . . . 
I find this rather troubling that an impartial third party appears to be suggesting that the FAA has a vendetta against Ted Stewart. This is further emphasized with a footnote in which the Board notes: 
[We,] of course, [are] not authorized to review the Administrator's exercise of his power to take emergency certificate action . . . We are constrained to register in this matter, however, our opinion that where, as here, no legitimate reason is cited or appears for not consolidating all alleged violations into one proceeding, subjecting an airman in the space of a year to two emergency revocations, and thus to the financial and other burdens associated with an additional 60-day grounding without prior notice and hearing, constitutes an abusive and unprincipled discharge of an extraordinary power. 
Joining with me today is John Breaux of Louisiana. John has a constituent, Frank Anders who has taken the lead gathering other examples of FAA abuses with regard to their emergency revocation authority. One in particular is Raymond A. Williamson who was a pilot for Coca-Cola Bottling Co. Like Ted Stewart, he was accused of being part of a ring of pilots who falsified type records for vintage aircraft. 
As in all of the cases received by my office, Mr. Williamson biggest concern is that the FAA investigation and subsequent revocation came out of the blue. In November 1994, he was notified by his employer--Coca-Cola--that FAA inspectors had accused him of giving illegal check rides in company owned aircraft. He was fired. In June 1995, he received an emergency order of revocation. In over 30 years as an active pilot, he had never had an accident, incident, or violation. Nor had he ever been counseled by the FAA for any action or irregularities as a pilot, flight instructor or FAA designated pilot examiner. 
In May 1996, FAA proposed to return all his certificates and ratings, except his flight instructor certificate. As in the Ted Stewart case, it would appear that FAA found no real reason pursue an emergency revocation. 
Mr. President, I obviously cannot read the collective minds of the NTSB board, but I believe a reasonable person would conclude that in the Ted Stewart case the Board, believes as I do, that there is an abuse of emergency revocation powers by the FAA. 
This is borne out further by the fact that since 1989, emergency cases as a total of all enforcement actions heard by the NTSB has more than doubled. In 1989 the NTSB heard 1,107 enforcement cases. Of those, 66 were emergency revocation cases or 5.96 percent. In 1995, the NTSB heard 509 total enforcement cases, of those 160 were emergency revocation cases or 31.43 percent. I believe it is clear that the FAA has begun to use an exceptional power as a standard practice. 
In response, I and Senators Craig, Hutchinson, and Breaux are introducing legislation that would establish a procedure by which the FAA must show just cause for bringing an emergency revocation action against a certificate holder. Many within the aviation community have referred to this needed legislation as the Hoover bill. 
Not surprisingly, Mr. President, the FAA opposes this language. They also opposed changes to the civil penalties program where they served as the judge, jury, and executioner in civil penalty actions against airmen. Fortunately, we were able to change that so 
that airmen can now appeal a civil penalty case to the NTSB. This has worked very well because the NTSB has a clear understanding of the issues. 
Our proposal allows an airman within 48 hours of receiving an emergency revocation order to request a hearing before the NTSB on the emergency nature of the revocation. NTSB then has 48 hours to hear the arguments. Within 5 days of the initial request, NTSB must decide if a true emergency exists. During this time, the emergency revocation remains in effect. 
That means that the pilot does not have his certificate and cannot fly an airplane. In many cases, this is a means of a living. But that is for 7 days. 
In other words, the certificate holder loses use of his certificate for a maximum of 7 days. However, should the NTSB decide an emergency does not exist, then the certificate would be returned and the certificate holder could continue to use it while the FAA pursued their revocation case against him in an expedited appeal process as provided for by the bill. If the NTSB decides that an emergency does exist, then the emergency revocation remains in effect and the certificate holder cannot use his certificate while the case is adjudicated. 
This bill is supported by: the Air Line Pilots Association, International; the Air Transport Association; the Allied Pilots Association, Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association; the Experimental Aircraft Association; National Air Carrier Association; National Air Transportation Association; National Business Aircraft Association; the NTSB Bar Association; and the Regional Airline Association.

Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, in closing, this bill will provide due process to certificate holders where now none exists, without compromising aviation safety. This is a reasonable and prudent response to an increasing problem for certificate holders. I hope our colleagues will support our efforts in this regard.

Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I was shocked a little bit this morning to read in the Washington Times a story by Ralph Hallow in 
which he quotes a statement that was supposedly attributed to me by Mr. Paul Weyrich. I would like to read it. 
Hallow writes that: 
Mr. Weyrich said that at his regular Tuesday meeting for conservative leaders, Senator James Inhofe, Oklahoma Republican, accused Mr. Lott of having `betrayed the national-security interests of the country.' 
I have to tell you, Mr. President, that I don't think anything like this has ever happened to me. Even though I don't have thin skin--I have been beat up by the liberal media quite often--this is not the case. I never made such a statement. 
I even checked the tape of a TV show that I had with the gentleman, Mr. Weyrich recently, and I find nothing but compliments which I made about Mr. Lott. I did say on a couple of occasions that I disagreed with him on the chemical weapons stand. I disagreed with him on his suggestion in terms of potential punishment for Lt. Flynn. However, I was very complimentary of him. 
Just a few minutes ago I received a memo from Paul Weyrich which clarifies the matter. I want to read into the Record the first half of that memo, dated this morning.  
Once again Ralph Hallow has caused a problem. He called me on my private line and asked my views on Lott and Lt. Flynn, which I was happy to give. He asked me about the rest of the movement, and I told him that at the Wednesday lunch we gave Senator Inhofe a message to take back to the Steering Committee which was supported almost unanimously by the 65 or so in attendance. I then quoted Frank Gaffney as saying that twice in a month Senator Lott had betrayed the security interests of the United States. Instead, he attributes this quote to Senator Inhofe, who refrained from criticizing Lott even though he disagrees with him. Believe me, Hallow did not misunderstand what I told him because he even called me back and said he had interviewed Inhofe and he--Inhofe--refused to be critical of Lott. 
Thank you, Mr. President.

Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I do not plan to take a long time. I would like to make a couple comments about some of the things that have been said here. 
I do not question the sincerity of any Member on this floor, but I think it should be obvious to you, Mr. President, and anyone else who may not be worn out right now, that there is a difference of philosophy often expressed on this floor. I think it goes back to the role of Government. 
I not only remind my friend from Minnesota that every country that has tried to take care of all these ills from a government perspective has not made it. I wonder sometimes, all these people who come to school supposedly that are hungry, how many of those parents perhaps are not able to feed them because they are overtaxed, or how many of those parents might have fallen into this mentality that permeated the 1960's that Government has the responsibility of taking care of all the human social ills? 
I agree with one thing the distinguished Senator from Minnesota said when he said we have lost our way. I think we have. I think that is what this is all about, trying to find our way back. 
I have to say, Mr. President, that I have not been supportive of this compromise, but for a totally different reason than the Senator from Minnesota. I look at this, and I have to correct the distinguished Senator from New Mexico about one thing that he said. He said we gave the President everything he wanted in his social programs. We actually gave him more. This is $5 billion more than his request was last year. It is not a matter of not having enough in this bill. I feel the spending is too high. I do not agree with all the assumptions, but I am very confident that this is going to be adopted and going to be adopted tonight. 
Also, I am not sure we are going to be able to accomplish all the tax decreases that we have promised some of the people. I had occasion this morning to talk to two large groups, both of whom are endorsing this, and they are endorsing this because they believe they are going to get an estate tax reduction; they believe they are going to get capital gains reductions. I do not believe there is going to be enough money to do that. But that is not the point of standing here now. 
What I would like to see happen with this, ultimately, in the year 2002 is to accomplish the goal that many people believe in their hearts we will accomplish with this. I am not that confident. I am going to assume that will happen and we will reach a balanced budget by the year 2002. 
I have offered amendment No. 301 because I think by just oversight, something was left out. Let's assume that everything we are trying to accomplish with the adoption of this budget agreement becomes a reality. Let's assume that the economic assumptions produced an additional $225 billion. Let's assume that these spending programs are going to stay within the limits and that we are able to do the tax cuts. And let's assume that we find ourselves with a balanced budget. 
Now, here is the problem that I have with this. One of the problems is, if we reach the year 2001 and we see, in fact, it is doing what we projected it would do, doing what we told the American people it would do, and that is balance the budget, eliminate the deficit, what happens in the next year? With that as a concern, I don't think there is anyone in this Chamber who is going to vote for this bill on the basis that they want to balance the budget who does not also want to keep the budget in balance in the years following that. So I have this very simple resolution that I wouldn't think there would be any opposition to. That is, if this passes, and that becomes a reality--I am going to read the sentence from the bill. This is, in essence, my entire amendment.  
It shall not be in order in the Senate to consider any budget resolution or conference report on a budget resolution for fiscal year 2002 and any fiscal year thereafter that would cause a unified budget deficit for the budget year or any of the four fiscal years following the budget year. 
So, what we are saying is, once we get it in balance and we have eliminated the deficit, I would like to go further and say, let's then start spending down and paying down the debt. Instead of that, with this, all we are saying is once we eliminate the deficit, let's keep it eliminated. In the absence of this, all of this, that is on this plan, this road map can become a reality in the year 2001. But if that happens, then they can turn around and say, `Good, that's over with, now let's start raising deficits again.' 
That is the essence of it. I am prepared to yield the remainder of my time, but I understand the Senator from New Jersey wants to use some of his time.

Mr. INHOFE. I thank the Senator from New Jersey for the spirit in which he is addressing these things. I know there is a difference of opinion. But I would only say, in closing, that we have a list here of 66 people, Democrats and Republicans--you were not one of them--that voted for the balanced budget amendment.

Mr. INHOFE. I would say it would be very difficult for me to understand how anyone could have voted for a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution and not support this. Because we are talking about, if you do not do this and you are saying, let's make the plan work, come up to 5 years from now, and then let's start in again on deficits. And we do not want to do that. 
With that, if the Senator from New Jersey would like to yield back his time, I will do the same.

Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, this is the last amendment of the evening. I would like to have your attention for a short period of time. 
I have not been a strong supporter of this budget deal, the basis of the assumptions and other things. But in the event it does come up with a balanced budget in the year 2002, I see one frailty with this, and that is, you can come into balance in the year 2002, only to find out that in 2003 you come along and go back into deficits again. 
So I am going to read one sentence very carefully. I would like to have you listen to it. 
[I]t shall not be in order in the Senate to consider any budget resolution . . . for fiscal year 2002 and any fiscal year thereafter . . . that would cause a unified budget deficit for the budget year or any of the 4 fiscal years following the budget year. 
I would like to reserve the last 10 seconds of my time.

Let me just say that if it is the intent of anyone to vote for this in hopes it would achieve a balanced budget by the year 2002, and then coming back and starting into deficits again, of course you want to oppose it. 
This is your last opportunity to say that we want to reach that balanced budget by 2002, and then keep it in balance thereafter.

Mr. INHOFE. I thank the Senator from Pennsylvania for yielding time. I think he made one of the best presentations I have heard on the floor of this body. I want to say that, when he deals with the facts, he is dealing with the facts but, you know, we are also dealing today with perceptions. I tried to make a list of those things I have heard over and over. There is a lot of redundancy on this floor but there are some things that have not been stated. I would like to share a couple of those with you. 
I am going to do something that is a little unusual, because I am going to read some Scriptures to you. It is not totally unprecedented in this body. In fact, the distinguished senior Senator from West Virginia does it quite often. So I would like to read a couple of Scriptures, just for those who care. Anyone who does not, don't listen. 
First of all, I have used this a number of times, Jeremiah 1:35 says, `Before I formed you in the womb I knew you; Before you were born I sanctified you.' 
Or the 139th Psalm, no matter which interpretation you use, it makes it very clear when life begins. 
Then, I was, not too long ago, at the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum. I had been to the museum in Jerusalem, and I found the same thing was printed on the last brick as you are going through. This is Deuteronomy 30, verse 19. It said: `I call heaven and earth as witnesses today against you, that I have set before you life and death, blessing and cursing; therefore choose life, that both you and your descendants may live.' 
And, last, I am always concerned that something that is as dramatic and is as significant as this issue is going to go unnoticed; that maybe there are Senators out there who are not really into this issue and they might want to vote the party line, or they might want to say, well, maybe there aren't as many of these procedures out there, so they just really are not knowledgeable of the subject. So, I will read Proverbs 24, 11 and 12: 
Rescue those who are unjustly sentenced to death. Don't stand back and let them die. Don't try to disclaim responsibility by saying you didn't know about it, for God knows. Who knows all hearts knows yours, and He knew that you know. 
Mr. President, I was listening to the Senator from Massachusetts who said it does not do any good if we pass this because the President is going to veto it anyway. But I suggest to you that the President may not veto it, and if he does veto it, maybe some people will come over who were not here a year ago on this side of the aisle. 
Ron Fitzsimmons who just last year insisted that the number of partial birth abortions were a relative handful now admits `I lied through my teeth.' 
He was lying. So if the President is predicating his decision to veto this ban on the basis of what was told to him by Ron Fitzsimmons, there is every reason he could turn around on the issue. I suggest also that we are talking now not just about a procedure, but a culture. 
I have a very good friend by the name of Charles W. Colson who gave these remarks upon winning the prestigious Templeton Prize for contribution to religion. Listen very carefully. He puts it all together, not isolating one procedure or one issue: 
Courts strike down even perfunctory prayers, and we are surprised that schools, bristling with barbed wire, look more like prisons than prisons do. Universities reject the very idea of truth, and we are shocked when their best and brightest loot and betray. Celebrities mock the traditional family, even revile it as a form of slavery, and we are appalled at the tragedy of broken homes and millions of unwed mothers. The media celebrate sex without responsibility, and we are horrified by plagues. Our lawmakers justify the taking of innocent lives in sterile clinics, and we are terrorized by the disregard for life in blood-soaked streets. 
I think that kind of puts it into a context, which we are now approaching, that this is not just a normal type of an abortion. 
I have a great deal of respect for one of the most intellectual Members of this body. It is Senator Patrick Moynihan from New York, who is a self-proclaimed pro-choice Senator. He said: 
And now we have testimony that it is not just too close to infanticide, it is infanticide, and one would be too many. 
This is where we get into the numbers game. I heard it said on this floor many times that we are talking about maybe 1 percent or maybe talking about those that are in the ninth month may be an infinitesimal number. But, in fact, one is too many. It was said on the floor that we may be only talking about 200 lives being taken during the normal delivery process. That is when a baby is given a natural birth and, yet, they take the life by using this barbaric procedure. We have all kinds of documentation that it is being done in the ninth month and during the normal birth process. They say only 200. 
Mr. President, I am from Oklahoma, and we lost 168 lives in the Murrah Federal Office Building bombing. This was the largest domestic terrorist attack in American history. Did anybody say that is only 168 lives that were lost in Oklahoma City? No, the entire Nation came with compassion and mourned with us. One life, I agree with Senator Moynihan, is too many. 
One other issue that has not been discussed in this debate this year is that of pain, and rather than go into it, I do not think anyone refutes the fact that a small baby, if that baby is certainly past the second trimester, feels pain every bit as much as anybody who is in here, as any Member of the U.S. Senate would feel pain. There was a study conducted in London, and I have the results here, but I think everyone understands that this is something that is very real, that these babies do feel pain. 
I have a picture of a good friend of mine with me. His name is Jason--James Edward Rapert. Back when people our age were having babies, they would not even let you in the hospital, let 
alone the delivery room. When my daughter, Molly, called up and said, `Daddy, the time is here, could you come over,' and I went over to the hospital, she said, `Would you like to come into the delivery room?" 
`Wow, yes, I would.' 
So I saw for the first time what many of you in this room have seen, and many of the women have experienced personally, but I was there when this little guy was born. It is hard to describe to some of the men here who have not been through that experience of seeing this wonderful life begin, and I can remember when, in that room where the delivery took place, it occurred to me that when Baby Jase, my grandson, was born, that that is at a moment when they could have used this procedure inflicting all of the pain you have heard described so many times: Going into the cranium with the scissors, opening up the scissors, suck the brains out, the skull collapses. Awful. And there are individuals who want to keep a procedure like this legal. If you did that to a dog, they would picket in front of your office. Somehow we have developed a culture that puts a greater value on the lives of critters than human life. 
So I watched Baby Jase being born, and I suggest to those of you who are concerned about choice that this is really the choice. It is either that choice or this choice. Those are the choices we are faced with today. 
Mr. President, this is something on which I agree with the Senator from Pennsylvania. We should not be having to talk about it. To think 100 years from now they may look back and talk about that barbaric society that killed their own young, and here we are just trying to save a few lives from a very painful death. But nonetheless, that is the issue we are faced with today. I yield the floor.

Mr. INHOFE. Thank you, Mr. President. I will probably not take the 12 minutes. 
The Senator from Arizona is exactly right. I think even the strongest opponents of the ratification of the Chemical Weapons Convention have said this is not going to affect terrorist activities. Obviously, by the very title `terrorists' they are not going to be complying with this. 
I have to say I feel the same way about these countries that we are discussing right now. The condition which is under debate at this time is whether or not to strike that portion with regard to Iran, Syria, Libya, North Korea, and China. It would be, if we were only concerned about those countries that have signed or have ratified or have an expressed intention to ratify, that would be very nice, because we would be talking about Canada, the Fiji Islands, Costa Rica, and Singapore, Iceland. That is not where the threat is. The threat is the rogue nations. That is what we are talking about right now. 
I will for a moment bring this up to date by quoting a couple of things. General Schwarzkopf, during a press conference in Riyadh said: , 
The nightmare scenario for all of us would have been to go through this [the Iraqi tank barrier], get hung up in this breach right here, and then have the enemy artillery rain chemical weapons down on the troops that were in the gaggle in the breach right here. 
General Hughes said: 
In any attack in the south, Pyongyang could use chemical weapons to attack forces deployed near the DMZ, suppress allied air power, and isolate the peninsula from strategic reinforcement. 
Four days ago in a Seoul, North Korea, newspaper there was an article quoting very high North Korean officials as saying they now have adequate chemical weapons to annihilate South Korea. This is going on as we speak. 
So we are talking about nations that are not going to be our friends. These are the ones that, whether they are signatories, or whether they ratify or not, it doesn't make too much difference. It tickles me when they talk about, `Russia is going to do that.' Last night, I was on a talk show and we finally agreed that on the 1990 Bilateral Destruction Agreement, they have been found in noncompliance of that, and of the START I, of the Conventional Forces in Europe. Even though my opponent denied it was the INF, in fact, they were. In the 1995 Arms Control Disarmament Agency report, it says they were not in compliance with that; the ABM Treaty, they have not been in compliance with that. 
But let's assume if a country like Russia doesn't comply when they ratify, what about these rogue nations? I can tell you for sure that those proponents of the ratification have gone to every extent possible to make it look like--or to make us believe that the Reagan administration, if they were here today, would be in support of this Chemical Weapons Convention. I can assure you that they would not. Coincidentally, I happened to be on a talk show--`Crossfire'--with a very fine gentlemen, Ken Adelman. He had been in the Reagan administration. We found out, after he gave his testimonial as to why we should ratify--and he admitted it was not verifiable nor is it global, but he still thought we should do it--that Mr. Adelman might be prejudiced by his membership on two boards of directors, the International Planning and Analysis Center and on Newmeyer and Associates. These companies, which he directs, have clients in many foreign countries, including China and Japan, and they represent companies that deal in chemicals such as those from the UpJohn Co. People say this is just chemicals. It is not just chemical companies we are talking about. In this chemical association that gets so much attention, it represents 192 chemical companies. These are the large ones, the giants. There are some 4,000 other companies, and you can expand it beyond purely chemical companies to some 8,000 other companies, most of whom are opposed to this, because they would be shut out in the competition. 
I think the whole thing on this particular amendment is whether or not this would have any positive effect on the rogue nations if we should ratify the Chemical Weapons Convention. I don't think there is anybody here who is so naive to think that, voluntarily, if they are a part of it, they would reduce their chemical behavior. I think those of us in this room can argue and debate that. 
So I go back to the people who are the real authorities. You have heard Dick Cheney quoted several times on the floor, in his letter that we have quoted several times. He said, `Indeed some aspects of the present convention--notably, its obligation to share with potential adversaries, like Iran, chemical manufacturing technology that can be used for military purposes in chemical defense equipment--threaten to make this accord worse than having no treaty at all.' That is Dick Cheney, not some guy that read a couple of articles and determined it was wrong. What is he talking about? He is talking about something that will be debated here shortly, and we will get into that in more detail. Part of article X says, `The technical secretariat shall establish not later than 180 days after entry into force of this contract, and maintain for the use of any requesting state party, a data bank containing freely available information concerning various means of protection against chemical weapons, as well as such information as may be provided by states' parties.' 
Well, I can remember in the Armed Services Committee when Schwarzkopf was here. I said:  
General, you are in support of the Chemical Weapons Convention. 
I read that, and then I will read a transcript, because I think everybody who might be basing their vote on what General Schwarzkopf said, here is a transcript from that meeting: 
Senator Inhofe. Do you think it wise to share with countries like Iran our most advanced chemical defensive equipment and technology? 
General Schwarzkopf. Our defensive capabilities? 
Senator Inhofe. Yes. 
General Schwarzkopf. Absolutely not. 
Senator Inhofe. Well, I'm talking about sharing our advanced chemical defensive equipment and technologies, which I believe under article X (they) would be allowed to (get). Do you disagree? 
General Schwarzkopf. As I said, Senator, I'm not familiar with all the details--you know--you know, a country, particularly like Iran, I think we should share as little as possible with them in the way of our military capabilities. 
I am not critical of General Schwarzkopf. It is a very complicated thing. I don't know how many people read the whole thing. I haven't, but I read enough to know, as far as our treatment with rogue nations, I would not want to be ratifying this contract unless they ratified it. Then I would not trust them any more than we would trust Russia, and if they do ratify, I question if they will honor it. 
One of the other conditions we are going to talk about is, should we do it, should we put in a requirement that they would have to ratify before we will. Well, we had that requirement 2 years ago when I voted against the START II treaty. They said we have to do it before Russia because they won't ratify unless we do. Guess what, Mr. President, they still haven't ratified. 
Lastly, to kind of express the urgency of this, former Secretary of Defense, James Schlesinger, said, `To the extent that others learn from international sharing of information on chemical warfare defenses, our vulnerability is enhanced rather than diminished. Finally, this treaty in no way helps shield our soldiers from one of battlefield's deadliest killers. As indicated earlier, only the threat of effective retaliation provides such protection.' 
What he is saying there is not that we would use chemical weapons, but by the fact that we are not a party to this treaty is one that would at least offer some type of a deterrent. So I think, Mr. President, when you look and read of the hostility that is over there--James Woolsey said, in 1993: 
More than two dozen countries have programs to research or develop chemical weapons, and a number have stockpiled such weapons, including Libya, Iran, and Iraq-- 
Three of the countries we are talking about: 
The military competition in the always volatile Middle East has spurred others in the region to develop chemical weapons. We have also noted a disturbing pattern of biological weapons development following closely on the heels of the development of chemical weapons. 
Mr. President, the threat is there, and we know that other countries can sell their technology, as well as their systems, to rogue nations. We know Russia has done this, to specifically Iran and other nations, not when they sold their technology, but also their equipment. So it is a very scary thing to think that we might be putting ourselves in a position that would increase our exposure to the threat of chemical warfare and would increase the proliferation of chemical weapons in the Middle East. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. INHOFE. The first one is a Wall Street Journal editorial of September 9, 1996. I will just read the last paragraph. 
Ultimately the treaty's most pernicious effect is that it would lull most responsible nations into the false belief that they'd `done something' about the chemical weapons problem and that it now was behind them. Yes, the world would be a better place without chemical weapons. But this treaty's attempt to wave them away isn't going to make that happen. 
The other two, one by Frank Gaffney, Jr. and the other by Douglas Feith, address the regulation problems that would come from this to literally thousands of companies throughout America. In fact, the Commerce Department guidance on recordkeeping for affected businesses runs more than 50 pages. 
Mr. President, you have run companies. You know one of the major reasons we are not globally competitive here in the United States is that we are overregulated. There is a tremendous cost to these regulations. If the requirements exceed 50 pages, imagine what the companies would have to do. 
Mr. President, in a way I think the other side of this has perhaps used the wrong argument. There is an argument they are overlooking, and that is it does not seem to make a lot of difference whether Russia ratifies this or not because, as we have said several times during the course of this debate, they ratified a lot of treaties, including the 1990 Biological Weapons Destruction treaty, the ABM Treaty--that goes all the way back to the 1970's--the START I, CFE, INF. And while they have ratified these, they have not complied. 
There are three steps you go through. One is you have to sign them. Second, you ratify them. But, third, you have to comply. And they have been found out of compliance. I cannot imagine why we would expect that they would comply with this one if they ratified it if they have not complied with the previous ones. 
The distinguished Senator from Michigan quoted, somewhat extensively, Gen. John Shalikashvili, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, as saying that this would have the effect of reducing the proliferation of chemical weapons. 
I would only say, trying not to be redundant, if that is the case, then you are taking his word over four previous Secretaries of Defense: Dick Cheney, James Schlesinger, Don Rumsfeld, and Cap Weinberger, all four of whom said this would have the effect of increasing the proliferation of chemical weapons and their use in the Middle East. 
But, one of the statements that was made by the distinguished Senator from Michigan I thought was interesting. He said, if I got it right, and correct me if I am wrong: `The single most important reason to ratify the treaty is to encourage Russia to ratify it.' Again, if they do, it really does not seem to make that much difference because of their past history on what they have done. 
I would like to clear up something because I think we have gone through a lot of debate on this issue. It has been clearly implied by both Republicans who are supporting the ratification of the Chemical Weapons Convention as well as Democrats who are supporting it that this was started in the Reagan administration and that Ronald Reagan was in support of a chemical weapons treaty. 
I happened to run across something here that I am going to read. These are the conditions--I am going to save the best one until last--the conditions under which Ronald Reagan said he would agree to the ratification of a chemical weapons convention. 
First, the condition was that strategic defense initiative and theater missile defense systems would be deployed and operational 
as one safeguard against cheating. 
As we know, currently we do not have those in place. 
No. 2, that the Chemical Weapon Convention's international executive council would consist of 15 members, including the United States as one of the five permanent members, just like the U.N. Security Council. The current treaty gives us a 41-member executive council, each with 2-year terms, and no permanent members; hence, no veto. 
Third, that the United States would have absolute veto power over all CWC decisions. Obviously, in this one there is no veto power. Obviously, the President would not have supported this. 
President Reagan also, even though it is not on my list, verbally indicated on more than one occasion that one of his conditions would be that we would not have to incur the financial responsibility, in the United States, of other countries complying with it. In fact, right now our compliance costs on this convention appear to be, according to the Foreign Relations Committee report, $13.6 billion and the cost of Russia complying with this would exceed that. 
It has been stated on this floor many times that Russia has somewhere between 60 and 70 percent of all the chemical weapons in the world, so, obviously it would be more than that. What is Russia going to do? Are they going to comply? Let us say they go ahead and ratify. If they ratify it, you know, everyone in this Chamber knows, that they are going to look to the United States to pay for their obligation under the treaty. That is what they are doing on START II. In fact, I have to go back and make that statement also, that we are hearing this same argument all over again right now that we heard 2 years ago. Mr. President, 2 years ago we stood in this Chamber and they said: If we don't ratify this, Russia won't ratify it. Here it is 2 years later and Russia has not ratified it. 
So I think this is a very significant requirement, the fact that Ronald Reagan said--and this is a direct quote, coming out of his committee at the time--for ratification, `All Soviet obligations of previous arms control agreements would have to be corrected.' And we have five such agreements that have not been corrected to date. 
So, I hope no one stands on the floor the rest of the evening and talks about how Ronald Reagan would have ratified this Chemical Weapons Convention. 
Exhibit 7 
From the Wall Street Journal, Sept. 9, 1996  
Poisons for Peace 
The greatest misperception about the Chemical Weapons Convention, which comes before the Senate this week for ratification, is that it can't do any harm and might do some good. Former Reagan defense official Fred Ekle aptly calls this mind-set `poisons for peace.' Who could possibly be against making the world safe from the horrors of poison gas? In fact, this treaty would make the horrors of poison gas an even greater possibility. 
The first problem is that many of the nations we have cause to worry about most aren't about to sign. What good is a treaty that doesn't include Iraq or Libya or Syria or North Korea? Somehow knowing that New Zealand and the Netherlands have both ratified it doesn't help us sleep more soundly. 
Worse, the treaty would give all signatories access to our latest chemical technology, since Article XI enjoins signatories from keeping chemicals, information or equipment from one another. This means not only countries such as China and Russia, but also Cuba and Iran, which have both signed. In other words, forget about the trade embargoes and forget about foreign policy. The treaty would require the U.S. to facilitate the modernization of the chemical-weapons industry in a host of countries that just might use them. 
The second problem is verification. No one, not even its most ardent supporters in the Administration, is naive enough to claim that the treaty is verifiable. Chemical weapons are easy to make and easy to hide. The sarin that was used in the attack in the Tokyo subway last year was concocted in an 812 room. Instituting snap inspections of companies that make or use chemicals isn't going to stop a future Aum Shinri Kyo. Nor is it going to stop a determined government. 
In addition, the inspection and reporting procedures required under the treaty would be a huge burden on American business, which of course would become even more nervous about industrial espionage. Senator  Jon Kyl estimates that up to 10,000 American companies would be affected at a cost approaching $1 billion a year. Every company that uses or produces chemicals would fall under the long arm of the treaty--companies like Pfizer and Quaker Oats and Strohs Brewery and Maxwell House Coffee and Goodyear Tire. Dial Corp., which uses 5,000 different chemicals to produce an array of household products, estimates that it will have to spend $70,000 a year to meet the treaty's reporting requirements. 
The small number of chemical companies that make the lethal stuff would of course be covered, too, and much has been made of the treaty's endorsement by the Chemical Manufacturers Association, which represents just 190 member companies and had a hand in formulating the treaty's verification procedures. The industry is already very heavily regulated, and the treaty's inspection and reporting requirements wouldn't be much of an additional burden. It also can't hurt that the treaty would increase its members' trading and sales opportunities thanks to Article XI. 
The list of problems with the treaty goes on and on. Constitutional scholar Robert Bork raises the possibility that the verification requirements might violate the Constitution's ban on search and seizure, and its property rights guarantees. The Pentagon isn't happy with it since, under the Clinton Administration's interpretation, it would prohibit the military from using non-lethal chemical agents. It's not hard to imagine a scenario in which the Army is forced to shoot people because it's not permitted to use tear gas. 
Ultimately the treaty's most pernicious effect is that it would lull responsible nations into a false belief that they'd `done something' about the chemical weapons problem and that it now was behind them. Yes, the world would be a better place without chemical weapons. But this treaty's attempt to wave them away isn't going to make that happen.    
From the Washington Times, Sept. 4, 1996  
Impending CWC Debate  
There is a certain irony to the timing of the looming Senate debate on the Chemical Weapons Convention. After all, in a sense this treaty was the direct result of one of Saddam Hussein's earlier genocidal operations against the Kurds of Northern Iraq. It came about after the abysmal 1989 conference in Paris where scores of nations could not being themselves even to cite--let along condemn or sanction--the Iraqi government for its use of chemical weapons against its own people, let alone the Iranian military. Such attacks directly violated the existing `international norm' on chemical warfare: the 1925 Geneva Protocol banning the use of chemical weapons. 
In a bid to deflect criticism for the international community's failure to enforce one relatively verifiable arms control treaty, the politicians and diplomats decided to negotiate a new, utterly unverifiable agreement. After four years of further negotiations in Geneva, a brand new `international norm' against chemical warfare was minted: the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC). 
Now, readers of this column learned last week that, quite apart from the problems with this treaty from the standpoint of its verifiability and enforceability, there are a number of questions that have been posed about how the CWC has been affected by Russian bad faith and other changed circumstances since the United States signed up in 1993. Such questions were supposed to have been answered before the Senate considered this accord on or before Sept. 14. As the answers are inconvenient (for instance, confirmation that Moscow is welching on a 1990 Bilateral Destruction Agreement and demanding that the West pay the estimated $3.3 billion it will take Russia to dismantle its vast chemical arsenal), it has employed its favorite tactic with regard to congressional information requests: Stonewall. 
Since that column was written, however, the administration's machinations on behalf of the Chemical Weapons Convention have, as Alice said of Wonderland, become `curiouser and curiouser.' This is particularly evident in the Clinton teams's efforts to dissemble about what the CWC won't do--and what it will. 
For example, the administration convened a series of briefings for Senate staffers over the August recess. In these lopsided sessions, a gaggle of 15 or more executive branch officials harangued three of four folks from Capitol Hill, in some cases for hours on end. Unfortunately, the briefers repeatedly misled the staffers--notably with respect to the costs of the CWC to American taxpayers and to thousands of American companies. Among other things, the administration is significantly low-balling the U.S. portion of the expenses associated the new U.N.-style international bureaucracy created to gather data and conduct inspections. Clinton officials have also minimized the likely loss of proprietary data when a company's sensitive facility is gone over for up to 84 hours by inspectors who will be, likely as not, detailed from foreign commercial espionage organizations. 
Incredibly, even some of the companies at greatest risk appear to be susceptible to the administration's disinformation on this score. Take, for example, an Aug. 7 letter to Sen. Richard Lugar from the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhARMA), a trade association for some of the nation's most cutting-edge biotech firms. Clinton officials reportedly induced PhARMA's president to tell the treaty's top Senate cheerleader that it supported the CWC with the promise that the administration would not allow the CWC's verification protocol to be extended to the existing (and similarly unmonitorable) Biological Weapons Convention. 
PhARMA's members clearly understand an important reality: If, under the biological weapons treaty, America's pharmaceutical manufacturers were subjected to a reporting and inspection regime similar to that of the CWC, they could lose their shirts. After all, on average these companies invest 12 years and some $350 million to produce a new breakthrough drug. Trial inspections suggest that a single on-site, inspection by a trained intelligence operative could greatly reduce, if not wipe out, the competitive advantage acquired at such a high price. 
The only problem with PhARMA's stance is, that many of its member companies will find themselves subjected to precisely that danger under the terms of CWC. So might a great many other companies having nothing to do with chemical weapons and in industries as diverse as automotive, food processing, electronics, alcohol distilling and brewing, oil refining, soap and detergents, cosmetics, textiles and paint and tire manufacturers. Among the companies listed on a recent Arms Control and Disarmament Agency list of businesses `likely' to be affected by the CWC's various requirements are: Eli Lilly, Sherwin-Williams, Nutrasweet, Jim Beam, Archer Daniels Midland, Lever Brothers, Kaiser Aluminum, Goodyear Tire and Rubber, Xerox Raythoen and Conoco. If the trade associations representing these major American businesses are operating under illusions similar to PhARMA's their member companies may wish to join the call for a `time-out' on Senate action on the CWC. 
Some senators may be tempted to ignore the administration's stonewalling of legitimate and troubling questions relevant to the CWC that have been posed by their own leadership. Some may consider the administration's understanding of the treaty's associated costs and its inflating of the claims benefits to be business as usual for the Clinton team. It is, however, very much to be hoped that at least 34 members of the U.S. Senate will refuse to tolerate such behavior and, insist that consideration of the Chemical Weapons Convention be postponed until corrective action can be taken and, failing that, that the convention be defeated outright.   
From the San Diego Union-Tribune, Sept. 8, 1996  
`Open up in the Name of the . . . Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons?'  
The Chemical Weapons Convention would be the first arms control agreement to reach into the lives of non-military U.S. businesses and impose costs and regulatory burdens. 
It would oblige the government to adopt implementing legislation to compel a wide range of American businesses--including tire, paint, pharmaceutical, fertilizer and electronics manufacturers, distillers, food processors and oil refiners--to keep special records. (The Commerce Department guidance on record-keeping for affected businesses runs more than 50 pages.) 
Affected businesses would be forced to submit to routine and possibly `challenge' inspections by officials of an international organization--the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons. The warrantless inspections, which may run afoul of U.S. constitutional rights under the Fourth and Fifth Amendments, could jeopardize important private proprietary information. 
The regulatory cost is just one of a number of flaws. In the final analysis, what the CWC amounts to is a general declaration, a statement of disapproval of chemical weapons that would be made sincerely only by the world's law-abiding nations. The treaty would accomplish little more than the typical United Nations General Assembly resolution. Such rhetorical exercises are not necessarily bad or useless, but they do not amount to a whole lot. 
We would favor paying a substantial price for a ban on chemical weapon possession if such a ban covered the relevant countries and it could be made effective through reliable detection of illegal production and stockpiling. But such results hardly seem likely. We tend to think of the Chemical Weapons Convention this way: Even a price you may be willing to pay for a new car will appear ridiculously high if you learn that the car cannot be made to drive.

Mr. INHOFE. Thank you, Mr. President. 
First of all, let me say that there have been a lot of charges made back and forth. And certainly I don't question the sincerity of any Senators who have spoken on the floor, nor any positions they have taken, nor do I question their motives. They clearly think that they are right and that I am wrong. I think I am right. And the right position is not to ratify the Chemical Weapons Convention. 
The distinguished Senator from Massachusetts talked about `lulling' people into a false sense of security. There is a very interesting editorial in the Wall Street Journal on that subject--that people are going to believe that something is going to be done with this, that it is going to eliminate or dramatically reduce chemical weapons. We have testimony from very distinguished, well-known, former Secretaries of Defense--four of them--who say that this, in fact, could increase the proliferation of chemical weapons around the world, and particularly in the area of rogue nations. 
Let me just address one other thing because my beloved friend, Bob Dole, came out and changed the position that he had previously had. I certainly don't question his sincerity. But in his letter he said that the conditions or the concerns that he had previously had been met. 
I happened to stumble onto the letter that was dated September 11, 1996, from Bob Dole to Trent Lott. I will read the last of one paragraph. He says, `I have three concerns. First, effective verification. Do we have confidence that our intelligence will detect violations? Second, real reductions. In this case down to zero.' 
He is putting an expectation of reducing the use of chemical weapons `down to zero.' 
`Third, that it will truly be a global treaty.' 
Mr. President, none of these three have been met--not one of these three conditions; certainly on verification. There is not one person who has stepped onto the floor of this Senate and said that this is a verifiable treaty. Nobody claims that it is. It is not verifiable. People who give us their word that they are not going to do it. That is fine. We can believe their word. Are we going to believe countries who have not lived up to their other treaties? Certainly not. 
In the case of real reductions, `down to zero'--getting one to say there are going to be any real reductions. Certainly not down to zero. Nobody has made that statement. 
And will it be truly global? We have talked about the countries that are not a part of this treaty. And there are countries that are not like we are. We are talking about people who murder their own grandchildren, we are talking about Iraq, Syria, Libya, North Korea. So obviously, it is not a global treaty in any sense of the term. 
In verifiability, it is kind of interesting. After the Persian Gulf war we set up a very meticulous system of verification within the United Nations that gave the inspectors from the United Nations far greater authority than the inspectors would have under this treaty. Yet we find out that in the midst of all of this that Iraq is making chemical weapons as we speak. If you can't do it with the information that they have, and the ability that they have from the United Nations, certainly it is not something that can happen under this treaty. 
I have another concern. Mr. President, it is not just those who have not signed or who have not ratified the treaty. I look at some of the countries that have signed and they may or may not ratify. The distinguished Senator from Arizona, Senator Kyl, earlier said that 99 percent of the known chemical weapons are in three countries: United States, China, and Russia. And not one of those countries has ratified this treaty. I doubt very seriously that they are going to ratify this treaty. 
So we have all of these conditions that we are talking about that assume that, No. 1, those who are signatories to this treaty are going to ratify it; and, No. 2, the ones that ratify it will do what they have said they will do. 
I think it is kind of interesting when you look at Russia, for example. I am not singling them out other than the fact that we have had more treaties with Russia. We have the 1990 Biological Weapons Destruction Treaty; the ABM Treaty that goes all the way back to the 1970's; we have the Strategic Armaments Reduction Treaty, START I; the Conventional Forces in Europe Treaty, the CFE treaty; and the Intermediate Nuclear Forces Treaty. In each one of these cases, the country involved--this country being Russia--has not lived up to the provisions of the treaty. In other words, they ratify a treaty. They are a signatory. Then they ratify, go through that elaborate process, and then they turn around and don't live up to it. They have been found in noncompliance by our State Department--this country--in each one of these five. 
You have to ask the question: If Russia ratified five treaties and did not comply with any of the five, why would we expect that they would ratify this and not live up to it? 
One of the conditions that we have is that the Russians will ratify the treaty prior to the time that we would do it. People are saying oh, no, Russia will ratify but only if we do. I would like to remind my friends in this body that I was one of, I think, three Senators who voted against the START II Treaty and they used the same argument at that time. They said you have to ratify this thing, you have to ratify it before Russia because Russia is not going to ratify it if we do not ratify it. This is 2 years later, and they still have not ratified it. So we are still waiting. 
So why will you expect if 2 years ago we passed the START II Treaty--and I think the Senator from North Carolina and I were two of the four votes that were against it--they said they were going to ratify after we did, and they didn't do it--why would they necessarily do it? 
This global thing is very significant because here we talk about those who have signed the treaty and those who have ratified the treaty and, quite frankly, I do not care if a lot of those who have to ratify this treaty ratify it. I am not at all concerned about Canada, Costa Rica, the Fiji Islands, Switzerland, Togo, Singapore, Iceland. They are not threats to this country, but there are threats out there. 
And a minute ago, someone, the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts, quoted James Woolsey, former CIA Director. It is also James Woolsey who said we know there are somewhere in excess of 25 nations that currently have weapons of mass destruction, either biological, chemical, or nuclear and are working on the vehicle means to deliver those weapons. And so if these countries have them, these are not countries that we are friendly with or think like we do. 
I have said on the Senate floor several times in the past that I look back sometimes wistfully to the days of the cold war, Mr. President, when they had two superpowers, the U.S.S.R. and the United States of America. We had an intelligence system that was pretty well informed. We pretty much knew what they had, and they pretty much knew what we had. Even though they were a threat to this Nation, certainly they were a threat and a quantity that could be measured and we could anticipate. Now we have countries like Iraq, and we have people, as I said before, who murder their own grandchildren and we are talking about the Qadhafis, Hafez Assads and those individuals who, I think, are a far greater threat in terms of what is available in technology out there with weapons of mass destruction including what we are addressing today, and that is chemical weapons. So the threat is a very real threat that is out there. 
I understand from some of my close friends, Republican friends, that there are some of these conditions that they could either take or leave and are not as concerned about whether Russia ratifies the treaty in advance; they are not really concerned about whether there are no inspectors from terrorist countries. I can't really understand that, but they are concerned understandably about article X. And while everyone has put their own interpretation on article X, and instead of putting an interpretation on it let me just read. I hope that all of America could hear the exact wording of this treaty that we are being asked to endorse and to ratify. Section 3 of article X says:  
Each State party undertakes to facilitate and shall have the right to participate in the fullest possible exchange of equipment, material and scientific and technological information concerning means of protection against chemical weapons. 
Wait a minute now. We are talking about they would be able to look at what our defenses against chemical weapons are, not just what we have, what our technology is, how they might be able to copy our technology. 
Moving on to section 5, it says: 
The technical secretariat shall establish-- 
Incidentally, Mr. President, does it bother you, that technical secretariat? I always wondered what happened to sovereignty in this country. We have a group sitting over there someplace; we are not sure who they are going to be, but they are called the technical secretariat-- 
Not later than 180 days after entry into force of this convention and maintain for the use of any requesting State party a data bank containing freely available information concerning various means of protection against chemical weapons as well as such information as may be provided by State parties. 
Now, I look at this as a sovereignty issue again, because I do not know who these people are, but I do know this, that we have a lot of chemical companies in this country that have not been talked about very much. You talk about the CMA. That is, as I understand it, 192 chemical companies. They are the large ones, but there are somewhere between, it is estimated, 3 and 8,000 companies that would be affected by this treaty. Not all of them are chemical companies but about half of them, so you may be looking at 192 large chemical companies and maybe 4,000 small chemical companies and maybe it would be to their advantage to have very stringent requirements like this that would be a lot easier for large companies to stand behind than 
small companies. 
Finally, Mr. President, I have so much respect for the three former Secretaries of Defense who testified before Senator Helms' committee, James Schlesinger, Don Rumsfeld, and Cap Weinberger. In fact, I have talked to each one of them, along with Dick Cheney, who would have been there to testify, but he was unable to make that schedule. But he has sent a letter that has been quoted from several times. These individuals all say essentially the same thing. They say that we are being asked to ratify a treaty that is not verifiable, that is not global, that does not have any effect on those countries that are considered to be our enemies, our adversaries out there. And they are out there, Mr. President, and also even those who say they will ratify and comply have demonstrated over and over again, such as Russia, that they have not complied with previous treaties. 
By the way, speaking of Russia, it was interesting; last week in Janes Defense News, I read that the Russians had developed a type of chemical weapon, and they have developed it out of precursors that are not under this treaty. In other words, there are three precursors that they are using that they can develop these weapons with. So they would not be covered by this. I think maybe that is just a coincidence. Maybe there are other countries out there also that are saying all right, if this Chemical Weapons Convention goes in and we intend to comply with the provisions of it, which they probably are not, what can we do to build chemical weapons without using those precursor chemicals? And they are already doing it. 
I would like to share lastly something that all four of these former Secretaries of Defense have said. They have said that there is a very good chance being a party to this treaty and ratifying this treaty could increase the proliferation of chemical weapons as opposed to reducing them. I would read one paragraph out of Dick Cheney's letter, and I do not think anyone is more respected than Dick Cheney in these areas.  
Indeed, some aspects of the present convention, notably its obligation to share with potential adversaries like Iran chemical manufacturing technology that can be used for military purposes and chemical defensive equipment, threaten to make this accord worse than having no treaty at all. In my judgment, the treaty's article X and XI amount to a formula for greatly accelerating the proliferation of chemical warfare capabilities around the globe. 
So I would just say, Mr. President, that there has been a lot of lobbying going on, and I know the President's been very busy. I do not know what kind of deals have been made, but I do know that this is not something that is in the best security interests of the United States. I do sit on the Senate Armed Services Committee. I am the chairman of the readiness subcommittee. We are very much concerned about our State of readiness in terms of how to defend against chemical warfare. We deal with this subject every day. I am on the Intelligence Committee. We talk about this. But none of us on those two committees know about this as people such as Dick Cheney. I agree with them. We cannot afford to take a chance on a flawed treaty that could have the effect of increasing the proliferation of chemical weapons. 
I thank the Chair.

Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation that attempts to level the playing field for transit donor States across the country. In addition to myself, Senators Tim Hutchinson, Helms, Cochran, Nickles, and Sessions are all original cosponsors. 
Federal Transit dollars are distributed according to the Federal Transit Act as amended by the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act [ISTEA]. Similar to highway dollars, transit dollars are collected at the gas pump and are distributed by both formula and discretionary grants. 
States such as Oklahoma that do not receive back all of the revenues that they send to the Federal mass transit account are considered donor States. Unfortunately, these States are not getting nearly as much back in Federal funding as they contribute. In 1995, Oklahoma contributed about $30 million and only received back about $8 million from the mass transit account of the highway trust fund. This inequity allows for States with more urban centers to receive more dollars back than they actually contribute to the Federal account. Basically, donor States are subsidizing large metropolitan areas with the portion of the funds that we never get back. This puts smaller and rural areas at a disadvantage in trying to maintain transit systems whether it be buses or light rail. Rural areas are, too, interested in conserving fuel and contributing to better air quality. 
My proposal is designed to address this critical transit problem as we move deeper into the ISTEA reauthorization debate. Under my bill, each State that contributes $50 million or less into the Federal Mass Transit Account will be guaranteed to receive back no less than 80 percent of its apportionment. 
States should reasonably be able to expect that local dollars will be used for local transit needs. A large portion of Oklahoma-generated revenues should be remitted back to our State to provide for improved public transportation in Oklahoma--not urban mass transit systems in other States. My bill will put equity into the mass transit apportionment system by returning locally generated dollars home.

Mr. INHOFE. I think something that is very significant that has not yet been said was touched upon by the distinguished Senator from Arizona [Mr. Kyl], when he approached the economics of this issue. Unfortunately, when we talk about tax reductions, there is a mindset that if you reduce taxes, you reduce revenues. History has shown us very clearly that is not the case. 
In fact, it was a Democrat who first came up with the idea that you could actually increase revenues by reducing taxes, and that was President Kennedy back in the early 1970's when he said we have a problem in this country; we have to increase revenues, but we also are overtaxed, so the best way to increase revenues is to reduce the tax rates. 
Now, today, the Democrats do not think that way. The liberals in Congress think that it is a static situation, and that if you raise taxes nothing else happens. 
That, of course, is not true. I remind my colleagues that in 1980, the total amount of money used to run Government was $570 billion, the total revenue that came in in 1980. In 1990, the total revenue that came in to run Government was $1 trillion 30 billion. That is almost exactly double what it was in 1980. 
Well, what happened during that decade? During that decade, we had the largest tax reductions we have ever had in 
this country's history. So the same thing that happened back during the Kennedy administration when he had the wisdom to say we have to increase revenues and the best way to do this is to reduce taxes happened again in the 1980's. Unfortunately, we have an administration in the White House that does not understand this. 
In fact, I was amazed early in this administration when Laura Tyson, who is the chief economic adviser to the President of the United States, President Clinton, back in 1992 said--and this is nearly a direct quote--there is no relationship between the level of taxes a nation pays and the amount of economic productivity of that nation. 
That is saying they believe if you tax everybody 100 percent, they are going to work as hard as if you taxed them 10 percent. This is what Senator Kyl was getting to, that there is a relationship between the level of taxation and the productivity of a nation. In fact, to be specific, for each 1-percent increase in economic activity of a country it increases new revenue $24 billion. 
So those of us who are conservative, those of us who believe that what history has taught us is very factual are standing here saying we want to lower taxes, we want to do as Senator Kyl suggested and make it more difficult for people to raise taxes. I suggest, if you go back and look at the votes that took place to raise taxes, at least in the 10 years I have been here, it has always passed by maybe 1 or 2 percent. If you put a supermajority on that, I believe we can accomplish a lot. 
And so as the speakers before me have indicated, there are a lot of advantages here to get this machine working and to become more productive, and if for no other reason than the distinguished Senator from Minnesota said--we who are elected to the Senate, that is, those of us in the Chamber right now, in 1994 committed and promised that we would vote for a balanced budget and reduce taxes, and we are going to do that. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I have the utmost respect for my distinguished colleague from North Dakota, Senator Dorgan. I have to admit, however, I seem to disagree with him more than agree with him. Let me just cover a couple of things that he said that I feel quite strongly--I am sure he believes them, but they are certainly not true. 
First of all, as far as the deadline is concerned, it seems like every time you want to get something done you impose a deadline and say we have to do it by--in this case, the 29th of April. There is no deadline on this. Once this thing goes, the vote takes place, we can become a part of it if we want to wait until June or July or August. There is no deadline. 
I am reminded a little bit of the deadline they had when we had, I believe it was, the GATT Treaty. We had a special session of the U.S. Senate that was held in November, before the new Senate came in--this was in 1994--that would allow those individuals who were defeated or who retired to vote on something and not the new person who was elected. My daddy taught me a long time ago if the train is coming fast, slow it down. That is what we need to do with the Chemical Weapons Convention. We had a debate on this last fall. I think the debate was a very fruitful one, and a lot of things came out. So let us not talk about a deadline of the 29th. I look forward to debating this and discussing this with the Senator from North Dakota this afternoon. 
The next thing that he said that I take issue with is the idea that it is easier to oppose than to support the Chemical Weapons Convention. He is saying it is easier. Maybe it was easier for Mark Twain. This is not easier, because I will tell you I have been very outspoken in opposition to this Chemical Weapons Convention, and all I hear from people is, `You mean you are for chemical weapons?' That is not the issue at all. It is a lot easier to demagog this thing and say, `Let's sign this and do away with chemical weapons.' We are not going to do away with chemical weapons, and we all know that. 
As far as this is not a matter, as he stated, between the fuzzies and those in favor of a strong national defense, let us wait until the vote takes place and make that determination. I will wager that when the vote takes place, we will find out that those individuals with the highest American security ratings would be the ones who will oppose the Chemical Weapons Convention. That is a very easy thing to do. Just take the ratings and look and see how the vote comes out. Those individuals who consistently vote against such things as the National Missile Defense System, Theater Missile Defense System, vote for all of these disarmaments. A lot of the motive there is to put that money into social programs. I think we all know that. 
Let me just cover a couple of things in this brief period of time. First of all, this is not global. The Senator from North Dakota talked about Spain and about France and about all these countries. We don't have a problem with these countries. Let us look and see who is not a part of this. Iraq is not a part of this. 
North Korea is not a part of this. Libya is not a part of this. Syria is not a part of this. If you ask any `in' person, in a logical manner, `Who do you think would be the greatest threat to the United States,' and you name the top 15, those countries would be there. It is not global. Those countries that involve themselves in terrorist activities are countries that are not a part of this. Of course, I think we all understand it does not cover terrorist activities anyway. 
Let's look at the countries that are a part. Iran is now a signatory here, and yet Iran, if anyone here believes that they will keep their word in destroying all of their chemical arsenal, then I have a bridge I would like to sell them, because that is not going to happen. We know it is not verifiable, and there is no better evidence of that than after the Persian Gulf war when the United Nations was given incredible power to go out and examine and inspect and try to determine whether or not Iraq, who we had just defeated, had chemical weapons, then we find out through our intelligence community, that even with those very stringent inspection abilities that the United Nations had, that Iraq, still, was developing various weapons of mass destruction, including chemical weapons. 
I think it is important to show that it is not effective, that it will not banish poison gas or shield our soldiers, as Clinton claims. Jane's Defense Weekly came out last week and reported that Russia has developed three new nerve agents without using any of the precursor chemicals banned by the Chemical Weapons Convention. What does that mean, Mr. President? It means that they are already out there trying to figure out and trying to develop chemical weapons that can be used that are not using the precursor chemicals that would be banned. In other words, let's assume everybody is honest and everybody is complying, it is all verifiable, and all the countries belong to it. When it gets down to it, the bottom line is, you can still come out with chemicals that do not use these precursor chemicals. So, it would not be effective in that respect. 
I think we should also look at the constitutionality of this. I know a lot of times things are passed around here over the fact that it is a violation of the Constitution. I happen to be the chairman of the Clean Air and Private Property and Wetlands Subcommittee of the Environment and Public Works Committee. It is almost a daily thing that the Government takes land away from people without due compensation. So we know that there are things happening that violate constitutional rights. But in this case, it would permit searches and seizures without warrants or probable cause. I think this is a very serious thing. 
And as far as trade secrets, we would be giving up something here. We all hear we are going to all destroy our chemical weapons. We have not stopped to realize what we are giving up in order to have this utopia that we seem to think is going to appear. One is, we have to open up and allow countries, like Iran, to inspect our chemical companies and our fertilizer companies and our cosmetic companies to see if there is anything in there that they are using and they would be able to get a lot of technology from this. This is something with which we have to be concerned. 
Then we have more regulations on American business. This is something that we deal with. I have often said there are three reasons we are not globally competitive in this country. One is we are overtaxed; the other is our tort laws; and the other is we are overregulated. How can we compete with other countries when we are overregulated? This is one more regulation, one more set of forms that all these companies--cosmetic companies and others--will have to fill out. 
Then, of course, we have the thing that is talked about quite often, and that is, this is going to make us much more comfortable in terms of our defense against any type of chemical weapons.

Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleagues, Senators Nickles and Leahy in getting through the Senate H.R. 924, the Victim Allocution Clarification Act. This is an important issue for victims and their families of the Murrah Federal Building bombing. Clearly, we would not have been able to get this through unless there was widespread support for clarifying congressional intent with respect to the rights of victims and their families. 
Although the Victims Rights and Resolution Act of 1990 provided that victims have the right to be present at all public court proceedings, it conditioned that on a court determination that the testimony by the victim would not be materially affected if the victim heard other testimony at the trial. Recent courts decisions have held that victims cannot attend the trial and submit a victim's impact statement. H.R. 924 clarifies congressional intent by allowing the victim and their family to both attend the trial and submit a statement during the sentencing phase. 
I believe this language has reached a delicate balance between protecting the rights of the victims while maintaining the constitutional protections of the defendant. As noted by Senator Nickles, it is critical that we pass H.R. 924 before the trial in the Oklahoma City bombing case begins on March 31. I appreciate the efforts of all involved in getting through the Senate and House expeditiously.

Mr. INHOFE. I thank the Chair. 
I think this is a very significant day. We had a very blessed event over the weekend at my house. We had our fifth grandchild. And when little Mollie Elizabeth Inhofe was born, I say to Senator Thurmond, she inherited a $20,000 personal debt. I remember it was only a year before when little Jase, our fourth grandchild, was born. He inherited a $19,000 debt. So it is going up every year. 
When I look over, I see Senator Hagel from Nebraska. You do not have to go back just to the Reagan administration. If you go back long before that, one of our very fine Senators, Carl Curtis, had an idea that he would balance the budget by getting the States to preratify it. It was an ingenious idea, and it did not work, even though in the State legislature, I was the first State legislator to get it preratified. 
So we have something we are faced with today that we have been fighting for 20 or 25 years. This is our opportunity to do it. If we do not do it now, I do not think we will be able to do it in the near future. This is a moral issue, Mr. President, we have to meet.

Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, thank you, 
Mr. President, I have been watching this debate over the last few days, and I heard some of the opponents to a balanced budget amendment talk in a very eloquent way, as I have heard throughout the years. It seems like the arguments never change. So what I have done is picked up a few of these, and I would like to respond to some of these arguments. 
The other day one of the Members who has argued against a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution for as long as I can remember made the comment that proponents want to treat children like children, hiding the hard truth from them, and then went on to elaborate about all of the things that are going to happen if we don't fully disclose what is going on with the proposition of a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution. 
I can remember so well back when my No. 2 child was learning to ride a bicycle back in Oklahoma. I can remember when he got on. He was wobbling. Maybe, Mr. President, you have gone through the same thing. I finally got him so that he was able to go in a straight, narrow line. Then he made his first trip around the neighborhood. He is a hand surgeon today. He came back, and he said something to me that is very profound. He said, `You know, daddy, I wish the whole world were downhill.' 
I think what we need to do is be fully honest with everyone and let them know that it is not going to be easy if we pass a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution because, in fact, the whole world is not downhill. It is going to take some sacrifices. We have demonstrated very clearly what is going to happen if we do not do it. 
I heard the other day opponents saying they are tired of Washington telling people what to do and the Washington-knows-best mentality, that the balanced budget amendment is the ultimate Washington mandate. I suggest to you that just the reverse is true. We can talk about this all we want, but what we are saying to the American people when we deny them the opportunity to have ultimately a balanced budget is we want to keep control of all of these things in Washington. 
Reference was made yesterday to the Governors who are talking about how they are cutting taxes in their States and the successes that they have had and suggested that the budget balancing amendment, if passed, would force the States to have massive tax increases. Let me tell you. That just isn't true. The problem that we have right now is there is a mentality that I think prevails in both bodies of Congress, or did at least up until 1994, and certainly does today in the White House; that is this direct relationship between taxation and the deficit. 
I can remember when this President was sworn into office and he appointed Laura Tyson to be the chief financial adviser to the administration. She said--and this is a direct quote--in direct contradiction to 12 years of Republican ideology, `There is no relationship between the level of taxes a nation pays and its economic performance.' To me this is really 
the key to the whole thing--somebody who actually believed that. If you carry it on to its logical conclusion, you would say that all you have to do is have a taxation level of 100 percent, and everyone is going to be motivated the same and our revenues would go up. We know, obviously, that is not true. There are many Democrats who knew that wasn't true back when President Kennedy was President. He came out and said that we have to raise revenues, that we have needs, and that the best way to raise revenues is to reduce taxes. He did, and it happened. Of course, we look throughout history and we see it has happened over and over again. 
In the case of all those who are critical of the administration and say that back during the 10 years or the decade of the Republican administrations in the White House, the tax increases, or the deficit increases, came they say as a result of the tax decreases when in fact the total revenues that came into the Federal Government in 1980 was $517 billion. In 1990 it was $1.031 trillion, exactly doubled. That happened during a decade of the greatest tax reduction in the history of this country. 
Mr. President, I know that we are coming up toward the end of the time. But I would like to respond to just two more of the statements that have been made. 
First of all, they said that the balanced budget amendment will give politicians the `license to cut and slash needed programs.' 
The Heritage Foundation not too long ago came out--and they have updated it since then--with a study that came to the conclusion that if we took all of the Federal programs and had a built-in increase of 1 percent, or 1.5 percent, or 2 percent, you could actually balance the budget, that you could eliminate the deficit without cutting one Federal program. The problem is that programs come in--and we have seen it happen over the years--historically, they will come in and say this is going to meet a problem that we have, the problem goes away, and the program stays on. 
I am always reminded of one of the great speeches made in our time called a `rendezvous with destiny' when Ronald Reagan made that speech long before he was in public office. He said, `There is nothing closer to immortality on the face of this Earth than a government program once formed.' That is what we have seen over and over again. This has been going on for a long time. 
I can remember when there was a very prominent Senator from Nebraska, Carl Curtis. Carl Curtis back in 1975 had a bright idea. He said, `We are going to have to do something about this debt.' I think the whole debt was less than $400 billion at that time. He said, `In order to do something about this, we are going to have to show that the States want it and that the people want it.' So he decided to come and ratify an amendment to the Constitution in advance. I remember when he came to Oklahoma. I happened to be in the State senate at that time and introduced a preratification resolution where we ratified it in advance. Then all of the rest of the States came in. 
I would suggest to you that there is a great groundswell out there of people who want this to happen, and they recognize that it is not going to happen otherwise. We listen to people stand on the floor. I have not heard one person stand up here and say, `We want larger deficits. We want to increase the debt.' They don't say that. They say, `We will do the responsible thing. We need to make the hard decisions.' 
The problem is that for the last 40 years we have not made the right decisions, and we have not made the tough decisions. Now that we have an opportunity, a rare opportunity, one that is realistic, it could actually happen, because we only missed it by one vote a year ago. 
Let me finally conclude by saying that one Senator stood on the floor the other day. This is a quote. He said, `The budget balancing amendment is nothing more than a vague and empty promise. Most Senators who support it will not even be here in the year 2002 when it will take effect.' 
Let me suggest to you that as a result of the vote, it is very likely that there will be a lot of Senators who will not be here. I will make a statement that sounds a little bit extreme. But I have to make it. 
If you look back at the voting behavior of those U.S. Senators who do not want a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution, you will find that those are the ones who are the liberals. By `liberals,' I am talking about individuals who vote for greater tax increases, who want more Government involvement in our lives. I have a chart here that shows that. Those who voted against the balanced budget amendment last year--and there were 33 of them--of those 33, all of them, 100 percent of them, voted for the largest--this is called the tax stimulus program--the largest tax increase that we had in 1994. And all of them have either a D or an F rating by the National Taxpayers Union. 
A lot of people forget that we don't have to guess how people perform up here because there are all kinds of organizations that are giving us ratings. How is that going to affect some of the other elections? If you look back and you look at the Members of Congress that were defeated or retired in 1994, in the Senate there are 11, and 8 of them fell into this same spending class. In other words, those individuals who are getting defeated now in the polls are individuals who are big spenders and individuals who are for tax increases as opposed to cutting the size of Government. 
So I think there are some very real ramifications to this that are political ramifications. I suggest to you, Mr. President, that there are a lot of Members in here who, if they vote against our effort--it is a genuine effort for a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution--will have to pay the political price for that.

Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I am pleased to share my feelings on a bipartisan basis for the man who is probably the best qualified individual going into the job of Secretary of Defense in a very difficult time in this Nation's history. I 
will single out four areas where he has demonstrated, in my opinion, a type of courage that many do not have, not to be encumbered by partisan politics or by politics in general, but to be concerned only with protecting this Nation from attack from outside. 
The first area is, under the BRAC Commission, he has made the statement in the past that the burden of BRAC, the Base Realignment And Closure Commission, was to reduce the excess capacity and move that excess capacity into consolidated functions. I have no doubt in my mind but he will do this and keep that system free from political interference. 
The second area is we really cannot afford in this Nation to have more defense cuts than we have already cut. I read a quote this morning out of a new book by Caspar Weinberger called `The Next War.' 
Even to think about, much less propose, further cutting our Armed Forces, betrays a clear lack of real world thinking bordering on denial and delusion. 
I believe Bill Cohen understands this. 
The third area is the practice of sending our troops into areas where we do not have vital strategic interests at stake. This is something we have had a chance to talk about. We stood on the floor with Bill Cohen as a U.S. Senator, and he expressed himself very clearly that we not dilute our very scarce military assets by sending our troops to places that are not strategic, vital security interests of the United States. 
Very closely associated with that is I am hoping we are going to be able to get away from a problem we have had for quite some time, and that is the administration coming in, encumbering us, putting our troops into areas such as Bosnia and approximating what it will cost, which was supposed to cost somewhere between $1.5 and $2 billion and now we are finding out it is going to be closer to $6 billion, $6.5 billion. This is in a way disenfranchising the U.S. Senate. We should be in on that decision, and I have every confidence we will be in on those decisions from this point forward. 
Then the last area is one I have been very much concerned with, and that is our need for a sophisticated theater missile defense system and a national missile defense system. I have stood on this floor and shared thoughts with Senator Bill Cohen concerning this problem. This morning during the confirmation hearings I was just delighted to hear Senator Cohen make his statement as he characterized the proliferation of nuclear weapons and weapons of mass destruction to be the gravest problem facing the world today. 
I am looking forward to voting for his confirmation.
