   Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, tonight, we pass and clear for the President's signature a fitting tribute for a pair of American heroes, the Congressional Gold Medal. I am privileged and deeply honored to have been joined and supported by so many of my colleagues and others in this effort. 
   In his first inaugural address, President Reagan encouraged a nation by stating, ``Let us begin an era of national renewal. Let us renew our determination, our courage, and our strength. And let us renew our faith and our hope.'' 
   Former President Ronald Reagan spoke these words almost two decades ago at his first inauguration ceremony, inspiring a generation. During his 8 years as President of the United States, Ronald Reagan successfully reshaped America's hope and sparked a national renewal, marked by unprecedented global peace, economic growth, military superiority, and the spread of freedom and liberty. 
   Serving as the leader of the world's greatest superpower, President Reagan preferred to see himself as a simple citizen who had been called upon to aid the Nation he so loved. He believed fervently in the American dream and wanted the American people to realize it fully. 
   Through every historic fight and landmark decision, the ever-gracious First Lady, Nancy, was by President Reagan's side. A distinguished leader in her own right, she traveled tirelessly throughout the country promoting her famous ``Just Say No'' campaign. The project is aimed at preventing alcohol and drug use among our youth. 
   In his tenure, President Reagan restored America's sense of pride and set us squarely on the course of prosperity we still enjoy today. He facilitated the collapse of the Soviet Union that brought an end to the cold war. Who could forget his ringing challenge from Berlin's Bradenburg Gate, ``Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this Wall!'' By 1989, to the amazement of the world, Germany was unified, and the Wall was a memory. Reagan's character, wit, and eloquence as the ``Great Communicator'' brought honor to the Office of the President and endeared him to all Americans and, indeed, all the world. 
   Former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher once commented, ``Not since Lincoln, or Winston Churchill in Britain, has there been a President who has so understood the power of words to uplift and inspire.'' Mr. President, I couldn't agree more. 
   His one-time rival for superpower dominance, Mikhail Gorbachev, described honoring the Reagans with the Congressional Gold Medal as ``..... a fitting tribute to the fortieth President of the United States, who will go down in history as a man profoundly dedicated to his people and committed to the values of democracy and freedom.'' 
   Together, the Reagans selflessly dedicated their lives to promoting national pride and bettering the quality of life in America. Together, they continue their battle with Alzheimer's disease, displaying the dignity for which they are famous. Mrs. Reagan remains committed to community service. In his honor, she has become a national advocate for heightening Alzheimer's disease awareness. Their fight inspires hope in millions of Americans who share their struggle. 
   The leadership and dedication that President and Mrs. Reagan provided this Nation undeniably abides with us still. It is fitting for a grateful people and Nation to say, ``Thank you.''

   Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, on behalf of the leader, today the Senate will complete the final 2 hours of debate on the motion to proceed to the Death Tax Elimination Act. By previous consent, at 11:30 a.m. the Senate will begin a vote in relation to the Bennett amendment to the DOD authorization bill. Following the 11:30 a.m. vote, the Senate will resume consideration of the death tax legislation. However, if no agreement can be reached regarding its consideration, the Senate may resume the Interior appropriations bill. A finite list of amendments has been agreed to with respect to this bill and, therefore, votes could occur throughout the day in an effort to complete action on this important spending bill. 
   As a reminder, an agreement was reached regarding the DOD authorization bill, and it is hoped that the Senate can conclude that bill by the close of business today or first thing tomorrow morning. The leadership has announced that the Senate will consider and complete the reconciliation bill during this week's session. 
   I thank my colleagues for their attention.

   Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, this tax has been discussed at length over the last several years. Several years ago, we reduced some of the impact of this tax, but not much. This tax is among the most often raised issues when I am among constituents. 
   A number of people have said during the course of the debate that the tax does not affect many Americans. Statistically, that is accurate, it does not. Therein lies something very important for us to consider about this tax, and there is good news in this. 
   The fact is that while there are a limited number of Americans affected by it, the vast number of Americans, a huge majority, think it should be eliminated. Why is that? Why would a tax that is rather isolated cause a vast majority of Americans to want to do away with it? It is because Americans are still fair about these things, and they do not think this is a fair tax. They do not like the concept of any family working its entire life, building a business, and then the Government, which did not do much to make the business successful--if it was not in the way--tapping in saying: Now that belongs to us, not you who produced it, but us. They do not like that. 
   I suspect a lot of Americans contemplate there will be a time when they will have grown their business, and they know it is going to take years to do it and hard sweat and worry and anxiety. Then the idea that because the founder or the developers of that business had reached the end of their lives and it no longer belonged to that family, it is inconsistent with the way Americans think. They do not think it is fair, and they do not like it hanging over their heads. 
   I have always taken that as a sign of great news that 
   Americans still hold a fundamental American value that it belonged to those who worked and earned it and that the Government ought not impose an egregious and unfair tax. Even if it does not affect me, I do not think it should happen. We should take heart from that because therein lies our ability to ultimately make the tax system more fair across the board. No one has much faith in it. They are cynical about it. They are paying the highest taxes they have ever paid. There is a latent desire to fix the system, and it shows itself vividly in the death tax, or the estate tax. 
   Another thing which causes me to want to see its elimination is I do not  think it is imposed fairly. An undue burden, as with many taxes, falls on the small business person, the small business family, the reasonable size family farm or ranch. A lot of people who are ensnared by this tax do not even know it has hit them because their assets are in property or equipment of which they really do not know the total value. They get pushed over the edge. Suddenly, this reaper comes through and falls on this small family business, small family farm, or ranch. 
   It is devastating because you have to pay the tax in 9 months--I think that is correct--and those kinds of businesses and those kinds of farms do not have a huge cash account at some financial institution. The value in that estate is in land and equipment and goodwill. 
   So when the Government says: It is worth $4 million, and you owe us over $2 million. What are the family's options? Very limited. There is no $2 million. So the business has to be sold or half the farm has to be sold or broken up, components of it sold, so they can raise enough cash to pay this insatiable appetite in Washington, DC, to get hold of everybody's assets, which means the people who are employed by that business or farm are typically looking for another job; they are in a job line somewhere. 
   It is disruptive. It is not useful for the economy. It costs jobs. There are millions and millions of dollars spent by larger businesses, mostly, to avoid this; and to some extent they can, which is again why I say it is pushing this down on what we would call the small business or farm. They are taking the principal hit here. 
   First, they cannot afford the consultants to figure out how to minimize it. Often they do not know they are going to be impacted by it, and they do not have the cash to pay it. So the assets have to be turned over and sold. And if you have to do it in 9 months--I do not know how many people around here have ever gone through the process of selling even a home, but sometimes that ``For Sale'' sign stays out there a long time. You can take your ``For Sale'' sign down, but the Government does not allow you to delay this tax. You are going to pay it. So if you have to sell that farm or that business at a fire sale 
   price, you have to sell it. Tough luck, says Uncle Sam. 
   I ran a small business for about 38 years. That is a long time. I do not remember anybody from Washington ever coming in to help me run it. In fact, more than once I almost got the idea they would just as soon we did not run it; we were fighting them off. Somewhere they got the idea they would own half those assets. I know I am joined by millions of Americans who do not agree with that. 
   Just to restate it, it does not affect a large number of Americans, but a huge number of Americans want it gone. They do not think it is fair. They think it is inappropriate, and it is. They think it is confiscatory, and it is. I think they hold to the American dream and figure one day that could impact them, and indeed it might.

   Mr. COVERDELL. I appreciate the Senator citing the poll. I have known from previous data of its overwhelming support. I think the point that 2-1 they favor eliminating it and 2-1 they think it probably will never affect them--as I said, I always take heart in this because it demonstrates the deep reserve of fairness among Americans about tax policy and about their Government. 
   This is not a fair tax, nor is it implemented fairly. It discriminates against those who do not have the resources to try to ameliorate it. So it just really builds up on the small farmer, small businessperson. They are paying an unfair burden here, on top of which, I would add, it creates turmoil in the workplace. It costs us jobs. It creates enormous anxiety and puts an undue and unnatural pressure on the financial decisions those who are impacted by it have to make. 
   You cannot manage the transaction of the sale of a business typically in 9 months; there are too many forces at work. It is very difficult to do. I have been through that, too. So you are creating a timetable that is unnatural and, therefore, you create another burden on the family in about as difficult a time as you can imagine. They have already suffered an enormous personal loss, and then here comes Uncle Sam: OK, 9 months, belly up. 
   So I appreciate the work of the Senator from Arizona and all those others who have come to speak in favor of the elimination of the tax. I know we are going to be successful. I do not know how long it is going to take. Because Americans do not want this tax. So whether it occurs in this current debate, which I hope it does, or one to follow, I know this is going to be changed. 
   I end with this. I do not go to a single meeting in my State where there are not several people who raise this question. My State is deeply agricultural, so we have thousands of small farmers. This is like a loaded gun pointed at their head. So they are waiting for us to do something about this because they know it is unfair. And it is creating an unnatural worry in a community, I might add, that is already under enormous stress. Agriculture is all across the country. This adds to that burden. It does so in a very dramatic way. 
   I thank the Senator for according me some time here this morning and wish him luck on the success of this legislation. 
   I yield the floor.

    Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to a constituent, a distinguished public servant, and a friend--Wayne Shackelford, who recently retired as Commissioner of the Georgia Department of Transportation. 
   During his tenure, Commissioner Shackelford presided over the reshaping of Georgia's transportation network, helping build up our state's infrastructure for the 21st century. As one of the fastest growing states in the Union, with a population rapidly approaching 8 million, Georgia will face many challenges in the coming decades. We are well prepared to meet those challenges in large part thanks to the vision and leadership of Wayne Shackelford. 
   Since taking office in 1991, he has overseen the construction of more than 5,000 miles of new roads throughout the state, while stewarding such innovations as Georgia's first express lanes for buses and car pools and a computer system to monitor and manage traffic movement. In fact, Georgia DOT's Advanced Transportation Management System, NAVIGATOR, is the most complete model of an urban transportation management system in the United States and is being studied by transportation leaders worldwide. 
   Commissioner Shackelford is recognized for his interest in multimodal and intermodal transportation issues. He has refocused the efforts of Georgia DOT on the movement of people and goods, not just vehicles, and has looked beyond roads by initiating the development of passenger rail service and expanding rural airports to accommodate commuter aircraft. 
   His leadership extends to regional and national transportation policy development. He served as President of the Southeastern Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials in 1993 and was President of the American Association of State Highway and  Transportation Officials in 1995. He was also Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Intelligent Transportation Society of America from 1998 to 1999 and continues to serve on the Board. In addition, he became Chairman of the Executive Committee of the Transportation Research Board of the National Research Council in January, 1999 and was a member of the President's Council on Year 2000 Conversion. 
   He has earned many national and state awards, including the Key Citizen of 1996 Award from the Georgia Municipal Association. In September, 1997, the State Transportation Board dedicated the Transportation Management Center in Atlanta as the Wayne Shackelford Building. 
   The Georgia DOT has also won many top national awards under Commissioner Shackelford's leadership, including the top national awards for asphalt and concrete paving for 1996 and the top quality construction awards from the National Asphalt Paving Association in 1997 and 1998. Georgia has been rated for two consecutive years--and for many of the past 15 years--as having the best-maintained roads in the nation. 
   For these and many other achievements it is my great pleasure to commend Commissioner Shackelford, to thank him for his many years of hard work and dedication on behalf of the people of Georgia, and to wish him well in all his future endeavors.

   Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the amendment offered by my colleague from Connecticut, Senator DODD, to increase funding for the U.S. Peace Corps. 
   This amendment will increase funding for the Peace Corps by $24 million, restoring funding to the enacted FY2000 level of $244 million. Even with passage of this amendment, $244 million is well below the amount authorized under the four-year Peace Corps Authorization Act which I sponsored with Senator DODD and that passed Congress with overwhelming bipartisan support last year. The Act authorizes an FY2001 level of $298 million to expand the Peace Corps to 10,000 volunteers, just as President Reagan originally intended fifteen years ago. This amendment will allow the Peace Corps to keep pace in reaching this important goal of 10,000 Volunteers within the next five years. 
   I remind my colleagues that the Peace Corps represents just 1 percent of the international affairs account. Over the past several years the Peace Corps has worked to increase the number of Volunteers through modest increases in its budget and more efficient management that reduced costs and staff. 
   As former Director of the Peace Corps, I have learned first-hand of the tremendous impact that the relatively small amount we spend on the Peace Corps has throughout the world. Not only does the Peace Corps continue to be a cost effective tool for providing assistance and developing stronger ties with the international community, it has also trained over 150,000 Americans in the cultures and languages of countries around the world. Returned volunteers often use these skills and experiences to contribute to myriad sectors of our society--government, business, education, health, and social services, just to name a few. 
   This amendment will help put the Peace Corps on the firm footing it needs and deserves as we enter the 21st century. I firmly believe that a rejuvenated Peace Corps will help ensure that America continues to be an engaged world leader, and that we continue to share with other countries our own legacy of freedom, independence, and prosperity. This is an investment in our country and our world that we need to make.

   Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce bipartisan legislation, the Medical Research Investment Act, or MRI Act, and privileged to be joined today by Senator TORRICELLI. The American people are unique in the world in their spirit of volunterism and charitable efforts. Unfortunately, the Federal Tax Code quite often gets in the way. 
   Congress has made impressive strides to increase resources for medical research. Last year we passed and enacted an increase of $2.7 billion in funding for the National Institutes of Health. This fourteen percent increase means this Congress is well on its way to doubling the Federal support for medical research, as we promised. At the same time, however, we should not diminish the critical role of private donations. This is why the MRI Act is so necessary. 
   While researchers have indeed made impressive breakthroughs in finding cures. The fight is far from over. For instance, 16 million Americans live with diabetes mellitus. In fact, I met today a courageous child, Caity Rigg, who suffers from Juvenile diabetes and requires four shots of insulin a day just to survive. Diabetes is the leading cause of kidney failure, blindness, and amputations, and is a major factor for heart disease, stroke, and birth defects. It shortens average life expectancy by 15 years and costs the nation in excess of $100 billion annually. 
   Cardiovascular diseases, heart attacks and strokes, claimed nearly 1 million lives in the United States in 1997. A third of these deaths were premature. In 1996, a third of all hospitalization expenditures were made to Medicare beneficiaries for hospital expenses due to cardiovascular problems. 
   This year approximately half a million Americans will die of cancer--more than 1,500 people per day. It is the second leading cause of death in the United States, and since 1990, approximately 13 million new cases have been diagnosed. In 2000, over 1 million new patients will be stricken. 
   The MRI Act makes very simple, but very significant changes. First, it encourages charitable gifts of cash or property for medical research by increasing the limitations on deductibility from the current 50 percent cap to 80 percent of adjusted gross income. Individuals could give 30 percent for medical research and 50 percent of income for other purposes. Or they could give as much as 80 percent of income for medical research alone. Not only would this benefit medical research, but it presents the opportunity for other charities to similarly receive greater support. Further, those who can give more than 80 percent in a year  may extent the carry-forward for excess charitable gifts for medical research from five years to ten years. 
   Second, the MRI Act allows medical research to benefit from incentive stock option, or ISO's, giving by ending disincentives for taxpayers who contribute stock from ISO's to medical research. Current law taxes such transactions at a rate of almost forty percent if stocks are not held for more than a year. Because of the tax on their gifts, many taxpayers find they must sell $140 in stock for every $100 they wish to donate because of the taxes on their gifts. In addition to this change, no ordinary income, capital gains or alternative minimum tax would be imposed on medical research gifts. 
   Accordingly to an estimate by Price Waterhouse Coopers, the MRI Act would release more than 1 billion in new donations to medical research over the next 5 years. For many research efforts, it could mean the difference between finding cures or not. Our proposal enjoys broad support from the medical research community. 
   Alliance for Aging Research, American Association for Cancer Research, ALS Association (Lou Gehrigs's Disease), American Society of Cell Biologists, Cancer Treatment Research Foundation, Coalition of National Cancer Cooperative Groups, Cure for Lymphoma, Friends of Cancer Research, International Foundation for Anticancer Drug Discovery, Juvenile Diabetes Foundation for Parkinson's Research, Oncology Nursing Society, Prevent Blindness America, Research to Prevent Blindness, and Society for Women's Health Research.

   Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I yield myself up to 10 minutes of our time and, of course, reserve the remainder of the time when I conclude my remarks for our side. 
   We have heard a lot of interesting remarks. I rise against the amendment of the Senator from Minnesota. I associate myself with the remarks of the Senator from Delaware. 
   I would like to try to not repeat everything that has been said but try to underscore several fundamental basic points with regard to these issues. 
   The first is that over the last 8 years, funding for drug treatment and drug prevention has increased by $1.6 billion. I repeat, it has increased over the last 8 years. The amendment of the Senator from Minnesota would increase it even further. 
   On the interdiction side of the ledger, during the same 8 years, there has been a decrease in the funding for interdiction. So interdiction is dropping and treatment and prevention is growing. 
   What happens when the Federal Government moves away from its responsibilities to protect our borders and to  engage international narcotics entities? I can tell you what happens. The United States is flooded with more drugs--because there is nothing there to stop that--the price of those drugs plummets, and more of our children become addicted to narcotics. Almost the reverse of what this amendment seeks to achieve happens. 
   As of Friday, June 9, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention gave us these alarming figures. In 1991--so this is the same timeframe I have been talking about--14.7 percent, about 15 percent, said they used marijuana. Who is ``they''? They are 9-year-olds to 12-year-olds--children 9 years old. By 1999, the figure was 27 percent. 
   This is the period we are all talking about here, where our interdiction dropped and where we increased treatment and prevention. What has happened? We have had more and more youngsters--kids, children--using drugs. 
   In 1991, 31 percent of students reported they tried marijuana at least once. By 1999, when we cut off the interdiction, it had grown to 47 percent. 
   In 1991, 1.7 percent of students said they used cocaine. By 1999, 8 years later--no interdiction--4 percent said they used cocaine. It doubled. 
   What we have essentially seen is that, while we have increased the prevention, while we have increased the treatment, and lowered interdiction, more and more kids have taken up using drugs. 
   I have to tell you, the greatest prevention program in the world and the greatest treatment program in the world is to keep the student--the child--from using them in the first place. 
   Point No. 2, our borders and our work with international partners, whether it is Colombia or Bolivia, or Peru, or Panama--you name it--is the sole responsibility of the Federal Government. No other entity can practice the interdiction. Georgia cannot do it. California cannot do it. Minnesota cannot do it. Only the U.S. Federal Government can exercise the muscle to protect our borders and to work with our alliances. 
   Prevention and treatment require Federal support, which has been growing rapidly, with State support and community support. It is a multifaceted effort and should be there. But only the Federal Government can do what this underlying bill suggests has to be done. 
   Point No. 3, the battle in Colombia is not an ideological 
   battle. It started out that way, but it isn't anymore. This is a battle against a narcotics insurgency. They have 3 percent support in the entire country. In that country, 33,000 people have been killed fighting this. And 800,000 Colombians are displaced, as in Kosovo, and we are going to turn our back? 
   Colombia sits in the center of the Andean region and has already pushed its trouble into Panama, into Ecuador, and into Peru. The entire region is being affected by this struggle to maintain a democratic government in Colombia. War is a very ugly thing. It is particularly ugly when it is driven by narcotics and narcotics money, by people who care for no life, none of these 9- to 12-year-olds, no person, not even their own citizens who would be laced with armaments and blown up. 
   Will this be a perfect exercise? No. It isn't a perfect world. And this is a very imperfect circumstance. 
   We have told the people of Colombia--the President of the United States; his representatives, from Ambassador Pickering to General McCaffrey--that we understand the scope of this problem, both its relationship to Colombia, the United States, and the entire hemisphere, and that we are going to help, and that we are going to join the Europeans, and we are going to join the Colombians in the struggle; that we are going to train; that we are going to work on human rights; that we are going to work on social institutions and the fundamentals of law and the judiciary. 
   Legislation to do that was introduced last October. The President and the White House endorsed their version of it--it is very similar--in February. Here we are in nearly July and we are tied up in knots. You can only say, ``The cavalry is coming'' for so long. 
   The funds for drug treatment and prevention that the Senator from Minnesota seeks have been growing and growing rapidly. The interdiction has been collapsing. When it collapses, more drugs are available. The number of kids using drugs has almost doubled--9-year-olds, 10- and 11- and 12-year-olds. 
   The Federal responsibility is to not allow that into our country, and no State can do that. This amendment undermines the sole purpose the Federal Government has on this issue. This amount of money can be sought in 50 different States in 1,000 different communities, which they ought to contribute. 
   Interdiction has collapsed; utilization by our children has doubled. It is a Federal responsibility to address this problem. We better get on with it. Colombia is the heart of it. If we lose there, we lose everywhere. You can't win a war by just treating the wounded. 
   I retain the balance of my time for the chairman of the committee.

   Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I think that a brief chronology of events regarding U.S. efforts to provide assistance to Colombia would be instructive. For years, the Administration has neglected the growing narcotics crisis in the Andean Region. Funding for international interdiction declined rapidly under the Clinton Administration. For example, international counter-narcotic funding dropped 56% from 1992 to 1996. Also Department of Defense air assets for counter-narcotics were slashed 68% from 1992-1999. As a result, drug production abroad and drug usage at home increased dramatically. The statistics are devastating. From 1992 to 1999, for example, cocaine use among 10th graders increased 133% 
   Republicans have long argued for a restoration of balance in the U.S. counter-drug strategy: the 1980s showed that eradicating and interdicting illegal drugs outside our borders is a necessary part of a successful drug strategy that also includes strong investments in demand reduction and domestic law enforcement. 
   The Colombia crisis emerged as an international crisis last spring, 1999. I had the opportunity to travel to Colombia in August of 1999 to see the drug-fueled crisis first-hand. Upon my return, Senator DEWINE, Senator GRASSLEY and I introduced an assistance package, the Alianza Act, in October of 1999. The Alianza Act authorized $1.6 billion over 3 years to support anti-drug efforts, the rule of law, human rights, and the peace process in Colombia and neighboring countries. This was, in my view, a balanced and comprehensive approach to the crisis in Colombia. 
   Unfortunately, the Administration was nowhere to be seen. Except for several Administration envoys who arrived to Bogota empty-handed, the White House did little. Finally, after months of delay, in January 2000 the White House announced a response to Plan Colombia, though failed to provide details until early February. The Administration plan largely mirrored the Alianza Act, though fell short in two critical areas; it failed to take a truly regional approach by providing sufficient funds for other countries in the Andean region and it also failed to adequately provide for our front-line law enforcement agencies such as the Customs Service and the Coast Guard.  
   In March, the House passed a $13 billion Supplemental Package, which included $1.7 for Colombia. The Colombia portion is a good bill that rectifies many of the shortcomings in the Administrations proposal. Then in May, the Senate Foreign Operations Appropriations Subcommittee marked up its bill, which included almost $1 billion for Colombia (the Milcon Appropriations Subcommittee also marked up more than $300 million for Colombia as well). 
   I strongly urge passage of this assistance. There is no doubt that the crisis in Colombia is an emergency that directly affects our national security and threatens to destabilize the entire Andean region. While we may not all agree on every detail of this package, immediate passage of counter-narcotics assistance is crucial to reduce the flow of drugs onto our streets and to bring stability to the Andean Region. It's time to realize that the emergency in Colombia threatens an important source of U.S. oil, continues to fuel the flood of illegal drugs entering America's streets, and endangers our hemisphere's common march toward democracy and free enterprise.

   Mr. COVERDELL. First, I would like to thank Senator WARNER and Senator LEVIN for their continued leadership on the Senate Armed Services Committee. Your efforts have helped reverse fourteen consecutive years of real decline in defense spending--a decline that has affected all aspects of our military, from morale to readiness. Our troops and our Nation are grateful for your leadership in stopping this decline. 
   I would like to take a moment to engage the chairman in a colloquy on one particular area within this bill--military construction.

   Mr. COVERDELL. Of course, we are all appreciative of what the committee has done for our bases across the Nation. As the chairman knows, Georgia has a proud military tradition. Currently it is home to thirteen military installations representing all branches of our military and housing some of our armed service's most vital missions. As is the case at military installations across the country most of the bases in Georgia are in need of new infrastructure. 
   Through my travels to Georgia's bases, I was struck in particular with the condition of the buildings at Fort Stewart in Hinesville, Georgia, home of the 3rd Infantry Division. As the chairman and ranking member know, the 3rd I.D. is the heavy division of the Army's Contingency Corps. It is ready to go at a moment's notice and is part of our Army's ``tip of the spear'' force. 
   Despite this crucial mission, it is my understanding that Fort Stewart is the only major FORSCOM installation that still performs corps functions in World War II wooden buildings.

   Mr. COVERDELL. It is clear to me that Fort Stewart needs more military construction dollars. However, I also understand that the committee and the Pentagon have certain parameters within they work to determine military construction dollars. I understand that one of the reasons Fort Stewart is not gaining authorization for military construction projects is that the projects I requested were not in the Pentagon's FYDP and that the committee uses the FYDP as its guide for authorizing military construction dollars. Is that correct?

I understand the Chairman's concern with modernizing the C-5A and believe that we must take a serious look at how it fits into our nation's airlift requirements--an effort that is currently underway. At the same time, I believe it is important for us to keep our options open and slowing C-5A modernization efforts now might prove costly in the future, for the very reasons given by the Senator from Delaware.

   Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, the Senate just conducted two very significant and unprecedented votes--unprecedented in the respect that, as the good chairman of the Senate Armed Services committee has pointed out, this is the first time that the Congress has taken steps to provide health care equity for our Nation's military retirees. This effort was not led by the White House. It was led by Congress and by military retirees across the country. 
   I have been deeply involved in this issue for many years now. As my colleagues know, I am the lead cosponsor of S. 2003, Senator JOHNSON's bill to restore the broken promise of lifetime health care made to military retirees. The mere presence of this bill, as Chairman WARNER noted, drove the debate on military retiree health care this year and moved us to the point where we are today--on the verge of enacting the first comprehensive solution to the military retiree health care issue. This is a matter of fairness for military retirees, but our goal must be accomplished without destroying the fiscal discipline that has made this day possible. 
   As a result, even though I am the lead cosponsor of S. 2003 and fully support its objectives, I could not vote to waive the budget point of order raised against the amendment today. The Senate has budget rules that must be protected if we want to ensure, year-in and year-out, that all of the Nation's priorities are fairly and appropriately funded. These are the fiscal rules of the road that have enabled us to balance the budget, to create unprecedented surpluses for the first time in decades, and to contemplate any funding for a military health care proposal such as this. Once the rules are broken, fiscal discipline will evaporate. Deserving long-term priorities would be pitted against the politically popular causes of the moment in a rush to tap the surplus dollars first. 
   We must also remember that we are working with the fourth consecutive balanced budget that protects Social Security--a tremendous exercise in fiscal restraint that the Senate must not abandon. Preserving Social Security has been a priority for the American people for a long time and it took the Congress many years to make it a reality. If we begin our fiscal work by  eviscerating the budget rules, we will put the Social Security surplus and the retirement benefits for millions of senators at great risk. 
   I could have taken the politically expedient route, the easy route by casting my vote to waive the budget rules. But that vote would not have changed the outcome or brought us closer to passage of S. 2003. Had the motion to waive the budget rules prevailed, it would have set a dangerous precedent and ultimately would make it more difficult to protect the funding needed to restore the broken promise. My vote today to preserve the budget rules, notwithstanding my strong support for military retirees, represents my view that the work of the Nation must move forward and that it will not unless the Senate works responsibly within the budget process in order to balance competing demands for funding. 
   There is no doubt in my mind that the gains on this issue today would not have been achieved without the introduction of S. 2003. At the beginning of this Congress, we were at ground-zero on this issue--the same place as in every previous Congress. We made headway this year in the Armed Services Committee and with our colleagues on the Budget Committee. Today, Senator WARNER's amendment, while not everything we wanted, did take an important step forward by giving military retirees one part of what they deserve--the ability to keep their military health benefits when they reach Medicare eligible age. I believe the Senate has demonstrated a new found commitment to our Nation's military retirees and I look forward to continuing our work to restore the broken promise in full.

    Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I am pleased to inform my colleagues that a young man from my state, Charlie Howell, won the individual National Collegiate Athletic Association golf championship this past weekend. Charlie hails from Augusta, home of the Masters Golf Tournament, and his achievement marks the beginning of another chapter in the great golf tradition of the Augusta area. 
   Charlie, a junior at Oklahoma State University, finished the event with a final score of 265, a full 23 strokes under par. His score shattered the previous championship record of 17 under. Given the number of talented players who have won the title, including Tiger Woods, Charlie's accomplishment is nothing short of phenomenal. 
   Along with his win in the individual tournament, Charlie helped the Oklahoma State team win the National Championship as well. This marks the first time since 1990 that the individual champion was also apart of a national championship team. 
   While success on the professional golf circuit almost certainly awaits Charlie, he has decided that his future can wait. Charlie will return to OSU for his senior year, helping to lead his team in defense of their title, and more importantly, to complete his college education. 
   Charlie's hard work and dedication to the sport have paid off handsomely. He now joins an elite group of golfers that can call themselves NCAA champions. I commend Charlie for his tremendous accomplishment, and wish him well in all of his future endeavors.

   Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, it is fortuitous that the Senator from Ohio would make his remarks before mine. I share and agree with most of what he has said with regard to trade. 
   I rise on a point that could be a troubling cloud that, even if the next President and even if the next Congress were to take the suggestions of the Senator from Ohio, and if certain events that are unfolding this very minute were to take a wrong turn, could dramatically and negatively affect these trade opportunities. 
   The Andean region--Colombia, Peru, Ecuador, Bolivia, Panama, and Venezuela--is experiencing difficult times. I rise specifically today about events that are under advisement this minute in Peru. 
   As those who follow events there know, very aggressive behavior by President Fujimori led to a constitutional override of a two-term limitation on his Presidency, and he is seeking a third term. The elections on April 9 were viewed as flawed by the international community. 
   Severe questions occurred as to whether or not a fair election had occurred. The OAS, the Carter Center, NDI, and other international observers have argued that the runoff election which will occur this Sunday, unless postponed, is in severe doubt and question. The Organization of American States, along with others, has said that the computer system--which is crucial to the vote count and crucial to monitoring the election--is not in a condition for which a fair election can occur and as a result they would not be able to accredit the election. If an election occurs this Sunday, for which all national and international interests have said you cannot appropriately observe the election, you can't tell whether it has been fair or not, if the government proceeds with that, it will be a serious blow to the democratic countries that the Senator from Ohio alluded to and to constitutional law and to the growth of democracy in our hemisphere. 
   Very recently, Senator LEAHY from Vermont and I authored a joint resolution on this matter which reads: Resolved by the Senate and the House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled that it is the sense of the Congress that the President of the United States should promptly convey to the President of Peru, if the April 9, 2000, elections are deemed by the international community not to have been free and fair, the United States will review and modify as appropriate its political and economic and military relations with Peru and will work with other democracies in the hemisphere and elsewhere towards restoration of democracy in Peru. This is passed by the House. This is passed by the Senate. This is signed by the President of the United States and, therefore, this is the policy of the United States with regard to these elections. 
   The situation has not improved. As I said, we have a computer system that is flawed. We have the opposition candidate who has withdrawn from the election. We have the Organization of American States saying we will withdraw all observers. We are hours away from a very serious turnback and reversal in our hemisphere in the country of Peru. Constitutional law, the hemisphere of new democracies, will have suffered a blow. 
   Supposedly, in the next 2 or 3 hours, their electoral commission will make a statement as to whether they will listen to the world, listen to the OAS, listen to the United States Congress, the President of the United States, and delay these elections or not. 
   I rise only for the purpose of saying that it will be an acknowledged blemish on so much progress that had been made in this last decade. It will have dire and long-reaching consequences if the Government of Peru does not hear a world talking to it. 
   I can only pray that in the next hour or two, the government will recognize that it must have an environment under which elections will be fair and observers will have the ability to adjudicate this was a fair election or this was not. To my colleagues, I say, there are events unfolding in this hemisphere to which we must pay far more attention. As the Senator from Ohio said, the vast majority of our trade now is in this hemisphere. It exceeds Europe and it exceeds the Pacific. It had better be a healthy place because it means a great deal to us and our fellow citizens. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I applaud the Stevens/Coverdell amendment submitted tonight by the Senator from Alaska, appropriating funds for six C-130Js for the Coast Guard. Senator STEVENS knows first hand of the Coast Guard's need for additional maritime patrol aircraft to meet the multiple aviation missions with which they are tasked. Through my close work with the Coast Guard and their efforts in our nation's war on drugs, I have also seen the need for these planes. 
   In 1998, Senator DEWINE and I introduced the Western Hemisphere Drug Elimination Act which restored a balanced drug control strategy by renewing our nation's commitment to international drug eradication and interdiction efforts. A crucial component of this strategy is the work the Coast Guard performs in guarding America's shores from drug dealers. One of the many areas the Coast Guard identified as needing improvement to fulfill this mission was their maritime patrol aircraft fleet. Coast Guard Commandant Admiral Loy said, in reference to the demands placed on the C-130 ``We've lost a full 25 percent or our availability while piling on additional mission requirements.'' It should also be noted that the Coast Guard flies their C-130s a third more hours than do the military services each year and the services own significantly more C-130s than the Coast Guard does. 
   Mr. President, the Western Hemisphere Drug Elimination Act passed the Congress just two years ago and now, through this amendment Senator DEWINE and I have cosponsored with Senator STEVENS, we are seeing the fruits of that effort. I am pleased to see that Congress is working to help the Coast Guard meet its many missions, particularly its efforts to end the scourge of illegal drugs plaguing this country.

   Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, sections 112 and 211 of the act will create new import programs for apparel produced in the Sub-Saharan and CBI countries which have been carefully crafted to bring significant benefits both to those regions and to the U.S. textile and apparel industry if the new programs are administered as intended. These programs could, however, fail to provide the intended benefits if they are not administered as intended. 
   Obviously, the intent of the Senate managers in crafting the textile and apparel provisions in sections 112 and 211 is very important, and is worth discussing in some detail as we consider the conference agreement today. 
   I would now ask my distinguished colleague from Iowa, Senator GRASSLEY, if it is his understanding that the conference agreement adopted the operative provisions of the Senate bill commonly referred to as ``807A'' and ``809'' with respect to both Africa and the Caribbean Basin, provisions which afford duty-free and quota-free treatment to apparel articles made from American fabric.

I understand that it is the managers' intent that under the Caribbean Basin portion of the Act, an apparel article containing elastomeric yarns, including elestomeric filament yarns, shall be eligible for the de minimis rule set forth in section 211 only if such yarns, whether covered or uncovered, are wholly formed in the United States.

   Mr. COVERDELL. Now, with respect to the provisions of the Africa and Caribbean Basin programs that deal with fabric or yarn not widely available in commercial quantities, am I correct that it is the intent of the managers that these provisions should be administered in the same manner, as practicable, as the short supply procedures in the NAFTA?

   Mr. COVERDELL. I will take a second. While the Senator from Indiana and the Senator from Connecticut are here, I would like to state that there are ongoing discussions, on a bipartisan basis, to try to see if this can be brought together. While we do not know what the conclusion is, the beginning of the end is certainly here. They are fruitful, no matter what happens in the long-term nature of the debate. 
   I compliment both Senators for the effort they have extended to reach out, along with Senator GREGG, Senator GORTON, and others, who have been instrumental in this ongoing work. I commend you to keep at it and see if we cannot come to a resolution. 
   I thank the Senator from North Carolina for giving me a moment to compliment these two Senators.

I advise the Senator in Massachusetts that five of the seven amendments he talked about did arrive at our office Friday. I thank him and his staff for that. We are going to try to accommodate him this afternoon in return. 
   At the moment, by previous agreement, we were prepared to move to an amendment by Senator GREGG of New Hampshire. His arrival has been delayed somewhat--I do not think very long. I had a chance to talk with the chairman, and I thought we might accommodate Senator INHOFE, if the Senator from Massachusetts concurs, for some 5 to 10 minutes on an unrelated matter while we are locating Senator GREGG.

   Mr. COVERDELL. Madam President, I rise to speak on behalf of this amendment and, in particular, a core provision of it, which is teacher liability. 
   As schools have become more violent, it is increasingly necessary for teachers to use reasonable means to maintain order and discipline in their classrooms. In order to provide a safe and positive learning environment, teachers and principals must not be afraid to remove disruptive students for fear of becoming the subject of frivolous lawsuits. 
   I forget the exact timing of this, but sometime within the last 2 years, the Senate and House passed the Volunteer Liability Protection Act. I want to use that as a backdrop in preparation for what the provisions of this amendment do. 
   At a time when the Nation was calling on more and more people to step forward and be charitable and be volunteers, we had a huge summit. The President and all the former Presidents were there, as was Gen. Colin Powell. They outlined a call to the Nation to step forward and volunteer. Several days after that summit, I, along with several others, introduced this Volunteer Liability Protection Act. 
   It was based on this premise that voluntarism in the country was declining, even though voluntarism is like a national monument in the United States, but it was declining. And when you looked into why--or among the reasons why--it was the fact that volunteers, such as sports figures, role models who were consistently asked to step forward and volunteer, and major figures in the community, people of substance, or a family who sold a business and, in effect, retired and had the time and the resources to step forward and help the local YMCA or a charitable group, 
   were targeted for frivolous lawsuits. I will give an example of one and then I will get back to the teacher side of it. 
   Picture a YMCA gym. This woman, in particular, who I talked about over and over throughout that debate, was a volunteer receptionist; she was answering the phone. She had nothing to do with the actual rigors of what was going on in the gym. Well, a young man broke either an arm or a leg in some activity in the gym. So you would have thought, well, if there were grounds for a lawsuit--and it wasn't just an accident and it involved no willful neglect--you would go after whoever was supervising the young man. I think that sounds reasonable to most Americans. But, no, the person who was sued was the woman answering the phone because they knew she had assets. Needless to say, people such as that didn't want to volunteer anymore. It is kind of hard to be a phone receptionist for the YMCA and put your whole family on the line, where you might be subject to a lawsuit and you might inadvertently lose it, and everything the family had worked for could be gone. 
   So we introduced the Volunteer Liability Protection Act. After a rigorous debate, it passed here, it passed the House, and the President signed it. It has been welcomed throughout the entire country as a relief that allows Americans, whether athletes or people who have assets, or somebody else, to step forward and be a volunteer. 
   It is directly analogous to the situation that we have in schools. Again, I say in order to provide a safe and positive learning environment, teachers and principals must not be afraid to remove a disruptive student for fear of being subject to a frivolous lawsuit. You can picture it. There is a scuffle going on in the hallway. A teacher has to make a decision. I remember that in the near disaster in Rockdale County, after Columbine, a young man entered the school. He had a weapon and he threatened several students with it, and he fired several shots. No one, gratefully, was either killed or permanently wounded. But the assistant principal appeared and moved directly to the student who had the firearm and pointed the firearm at him. Courageously--in my judgment, he had unbelievable courage--he walked up, calmed the student and took the weapon and held the student, who had become very emotional, until law enforcement officers could arrive. 
   That is an exaggerated incident, but we all know that scuffles such as this occur between students, or a verbal attack might occur in a classroom. A teacher can't be sitting there computing whether or not she or her family is at risk if she does her job. As the Volunteer Protection Act, this legislation does not allow for any willful misconduct. If this teacher were involved in willful misconduct, aggravated conduct, she would be subject to a lawsuit. But what it would end is just picking her out and harassing her or him into a settlement. 
   Listen to these statistics. The percentage of public school teachers in the United States who say they have been verbally abused is 51 percent. Fifty-one percent of all of our teachers 
   threatened with injury, which is perhaps an even more significant percentage, is down. But 16 percent have been threatened they would be harmed; physically attacked, just under 1 in 10. It is 7 percent. 
   In 1992, 33 percent of 12th grade public school students felt disruptions by other students interfered with their learning. In other words, a third of the school population is talking about the disruption another student is conducting that interrupts the schoolday sufficiently to interfere with that student's learning. 
   In my State of Georgia, in 1997, there were 38,000 violent incidents and 2,600 weapons violations. 
   My colleague from Massachusetts cited a survey of teachers which found that 43 percent of high school teachers felt their personal safety was in jeopardy in a 2-year period. A seventh grade student at Lincoln Academy in New York was arrested on June 2, 1999, for setting a fire to his teacher's hair. 
   Two Irving Middle School seventh graders in Lorain, OH, were charged in January of 1999 of plotting to kill their teacher with a 12-inch fillet knife. As 15 students placed bets on the girl's plot, another teacher found out and intervened--in moments. She overrode this situation before the stabbing occurred. 
   In Columbus, GA, my home State, seven students were sent to summer community service after planning to poison a teacher's iced tea and trip her on the stairs because the students thought she was too strict. 
   Recently, I met with a large number of school superintendents. They talked about the multitude of issues that are affecting them and their ability to do the job. But when you mention teacher liability, the threat to them of a lawsuit--whether it is the principal, the administrator, or teacher--is very high on their agenda; that we are creating an environment where prudent decisions might be missed. A circumstance where a teacher's intervention would be useful doesn't occur because the teacher is intimidated by the threat of being sued for having made that decision. 
   Again, I reiterate that in the Volunteer Liability Protection Act, this language does not excuse any willful conduct or any aggravated conduct. The  person is still liable for that kind of behavior. It is the frivolous activity that would apply, just as in the Volunteer Liability Protection Act. 
   I am going to describe for a minute or two the language of this section. The teacher liability protection provisions provide limited civil litigation immunity for teachers, principals, and other educational professionals who engage in reasonable--I repeat ``reasonable''--actions to maintain order, discipline, and a positive educational environment in America's schools and classrooms. It protects teachers from lawsuits when using reasonable means to maintain order, control, or discipline in the school or classroom. 
   What does ``reasonable'' mean? It does not include wanton and willful misconduct. It does not mean a criminal act. It does not mean the violation of State law. It does not mean the violation of Federal civil rights laws. And it does not mean inappropriate use of drugs or alcohol on the teacher's behalf. As I said a little earlier, it is modeled on the Volunteer Protection Act of 1997 and various State laws that seek to provide teachers limited civil liability immunity, including my own State of Georgia. 
   It is narrowly crafted to protect teachers from lawsuits when they are attempting to maintain order, control, or discipline in the school and classroom. It protects teachers from frivolous lawsuits. 
   I always use the word ``teachers.'' But I think I should reiterate that it is teachers, principals, and administrators in the system. It is not only teachers, such as the person I just talked about who interceded to try to contain a student who brought loaded weapons to the school and threatened not only other students of being shot but his own life and the life of the assistant principal. All had been threatened. There is no telling what the outcome might have been without the courage of this administrator to intercede. 
   It protects teachers from frivolous lawsuits when they remove a disruptive or belligerent and possibly dangerous child from the classroom. That ought to be expanded. It is not necessarily from the classroom but from an environment on the school property that is potentially dangerous; a fight in the cafeteria. What do you do? Do you just sit there and watch the fight because you are saying to yourself, if I go over there and interrupt, the parents of one, or two, or three of those children are going to sue us. In this case, that would be considered frivolous. It would be the person doing their job. On the other hand, if the teacher was involved with starting or aggravating a fight, it would be wanton behavior, and that teacher or that administrator would be liable because they did something wrong; something outside the parameter of their job. 
   It would allow principals and administrators to take charge of circumstances in the school and the classroom. It would prevent the overactive trial lawyer community--and I believe by anybody's standard this is one of the great issues of our time with enormous utilization. We have become a society that is ready to sue--your neighbor or the guy who is packing your food at the grocery store. We are just suing everybody. Some of it is very appropriate, but a lot of it is not. It probably has to be dealt with in a lot more places than volunteers in the schoolroom. 
   But it certainly needed to happen. It has to protect volunteers, and it certainly needs to happen on these school properties. It does not, I repeat, override any State law that provides teachers with greater immunity--as I said, some do, including Georgia--of liability protections. 
   This is important: States can affirmatively opt out of Federal coverage by passing State legislation. They have their own view of it. If they want to expand it, they can. But they can opt out. 
   The provision does not address the rights of individual States to prohibit or allow use of corporal punishment by teachers and administrators to discipline unruly and possibly dangerous students. 
   Recently, parents brought a suit against a history teacher at a high school for damages the parents claim their son suffered when the teacher removed him from the classroom after the student refused to go to the vice principal's office. 
   We have a classroom. We have an unruly student. In this case, the teacher steps forward and says, You need to go to the vice principal's office. The student refuses to do so. The teacher removes that student from the classroom--this is not an appropriate interaction going on in the classroom--and gets sued for doing that. 
   That is an individual doing their job. 
   Matt Grimes, a student, went to a teacher's tutorial class. The gentleman's name was Mr. Stringer. Mr. Stringer told him to go to the tutorial he was scheduled to attend. In other words, the student was in the wrong place and needed to be somewhere else. Matt said his teacher would not let him into that class because he was late. That teacher did, indeed, refuse Matt's admittance because of a late arrival. Something was said to the teacher that was disrespectful, and the teacher pointed or touched his chest with his index finger. In other words, he touched him and was sued. The teacher ended up being sued as a result of that incident. 
   Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that a full article be printed into the RECORD from the Wall Street Journal on Tuesday, May 4, 1999, by Kay Hymowitz.

   Mr. COVERDELL. It says:  
   In the wake of the Littleton school shootings, we've heard a lot about educators' need to pay attention to the ``warning signs'' of potentially violent youngsters. In this case such signs were plain to see. Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold produced videos and wrote essays for their classes depicting murderous fantasies.  
   I make a point about the legal culture. A pair of Supreme Court rulings makes it difficult for educators to do anything at all when confronted with such warning signs. The warning sign in the case of the teacher in Georgia was a pistol pointed right at him. That is a little late. But he made a decision and he executed the decision, saved the child, and was not harmed himself. 
   It is difficult for educators to do anything when confronted with the warning signs or, indeed, to even enforce ordinary discipline that kids need in order to be molded into citizens. 
   That goes back to the point I was making a bit ago. Unfortunately, this happens in a lot of walks of life. It happens with employers. It happens with store owners. People stop making prudent decisions or become so overly cautious about the legal costs, which are passed on to the consumer, that they start doing things that do not make sense for society. 
   We pay a price when it occurs in the school, when a teacher sees a disorderly event or something that potentially is dangerous, wrong, or disruptive to the education in the school, and in that teacher's mind they decide not to do anything, not to act; they walk away because they are intimidated for fear of ultimate consequences. Maybe somebody else in the school system was involved in a frivolous lawsuit. We are producing an environment where persons in charge on school property are stopped from doing things we expect them to do. 
   In Tinker v. Des Moines School District, the justices sided with students who had been threatened with suspension for wearing black armbands to protest the Vietnam war. The court believed it was a form of expression. Now we hear about all these articles, one after other, condemning the school for not doing anything because students showed up dressed in a threatening manner in the school. They condemned them for not doing anything. On the one hand, if you do anything, you get sued. It is a Catch-22 situation. 
   This article says:  
   On first sight, these decisions seem balanced and sensible. But their unintended consequence was to help create the world Gerald Grant described in his 1988 book, ``The World We Created at Hamilton High.'' Assemblies often degenerated into catcalls and semiobscene behavior while teachers watched silently.  
   Mr. Grant writes, ``Trash littered the hallway outside the cafeteria, but it was a rare teacher who suggested a student pick up a milk carton he or she had thrown on the floor.''  
   Cheating was widespread, but ``few adults seemed to care.'' Teachers who accused kids of cheating were required to produce documentation and witnesses to counter the other side of the story. One teacher who had failed a boy for plagiarizing a paper had to defend herself repeatedly before a supervisor after being harassed by daily phone calls from the student's parents and the lawyer they had hired on their son's behalf.  
   This is different from the place I went to school. There was no ``chill'' on those teachers. If something this egregious was going on, there was somebody who was going to do something about it. I know I am better off for it and so are all my classmates. This is not the kind of environment--we are talking reform in education--you want going on in schools. 
   Gratefully, it doesn't go on in all schools. But there is a teacher or principal or administrator in every school who has had it register: I am at legal risk here, even if I'm just doing my job. Everybody knows they are at legal risk if they engage in some wanton behavior that is obstructive or damaging. They cannot tell a student to pick up trash off the floor or do something about cheating going on in a classroom without getting sued. The mere threat of a lawsuit is often enough to have a chilling effect on teachers and administrators. Educators are understandably weary of students backed by litigious parents, 
   not to mention the numerous rights manuals with titles like ``Up Against The Law,'' ``A High School Student's Bill of Rights,'' and ``Ask Sybil Liberty''--that is S-y-b-i-l Liberty.  
   These guidebooks enumerate for already disaffected kids, all the impermissible things teachers are going to try to make them do.  
   That is actually published literature out there, that somebody who is disaffected for some reason or other can seize onto to protect themselves from the environment of a stable school.  
   You do not have to answer a school official, if he questions you.  
   This is the advice from all these great documents I have just enumerated.  
   A teacher can't make you do anything that violates your conscience.  
   You know, like the other fellow a little bit ago who was asked to go to the vice principal's office.  
   If you don't like the way the school makes you dress you can go to the court. 
   You can demand to see your school records.  
   In another case, a high school senior in New York State distributed articles urging students to urinate in the hallways, scrawl graffiti on the walls, and riot when the police arrived. 
   In 1997 the school district suspended the boy but only after the legal case had dragged on for 2 years, including an appeal to the State's highest court. 
   Rights-empowered students are not merely a discipline problem; they have also helped dumb down the curriculum. Mr. Grant found that as administrators and teachers became fearful of restless,  back-talking adolescents, they resorted to keeping classes amiable and unthreatening; in other words, unchallenging. All but a handful of charismatic teachers studiously avoided giving low grades, demanding homework, or administering tests. 
   We all came down here last week. We preached. We had different views about what we ought to do. 
   We know there is something badly wrong in K-12 today. We know it. Everybody knows it. The data is just beyond description--the number of students who cannot read, who do not have quality math skills. 
   With this activity going on, it is going to be pretty hard, no matter what we do, to get things reversed. We want quality teachers. We want to recruit quality teachers. How many Senators have come down here talking about wanting a quality teacher? I think just about everybody. How are we going to get a quality teacher with this stuff going on where they work? 
   Over the 5-year period, just 5 years, from 1993 to 1997, teachers were the victims of 1,771,000 nonfatal crimes at school, including 1,114,000 thefts, and 657,000 violent crimes. On the average this would be about 350,000-plus crimes per year. 
   Madam President, I made my point. I want to give the other side some time. For the moment, I yield the floor.

   Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I think we are close to concluding this evening's presentation. I just told the Senator from Massachusetts I think Senator GORTON has a comment or two to make. He should be here shortly. 
   There is some effort underway to have a vote on the Gregg amendment tomorrow between, say, noon and 2:15, if this is ultimately agreed to on both sides. The Lieberman amendment, it is hoped, could be voted on in the same timeframe, but we do not know that yet. There are some negotiations on the other side. This should clarify itself in the early evening here. 
   I thought I would take just a moment, while we are waiting for Senator GORTON, to talk about the amendment for which we are next going to vote, and that is the Lott-Gregg amendment, the Teachers Bill of Rights, and of which the ranking member on the committee, Senator KENNEDY of Massachusetts, has indicated there will be broad acceptance, even though it will be a rollcall vote. 
   The amendment amends title II of S. 2 to ensure that States and local communities are able to use their portion of the $2 billion to hire highly qualified teachers to address the teacher quality shortage facing this country. It adds a strong accountability component. School districts must show they have increased student achievement with the percentage of classes in core academic subjects that are taught by highly qualified teachers. It authorizes a new, up to $350 million recruitment program. This language was inserted by Senator KAY BAILEY HUTCHISON of Texas, Senator FRIST of Tennessee, and Senator CRAPO of Idaho. It encourages midcareer professionals and outstanding college graduates to take teaching positions in tiny 
   public schools and rural schools. 
   It includes the language I discussed at some length earlier this afternoon to protect teachers from frivolous lawsuits so they are not inhibited from doing the job they are supposed to do in school, that is, if they see a problem they avoid it or are silent about it because they are afraid they are going to be the subject, as I said, of a frivolous lawsuit. 
   This is a brief overview of the Teachers' Bill of Rights, the Teacher Empowerment Act as it has been referred to in the past. It authorizes $2 billion a year for States and local districts to enable them to develop a rigorous, professional development program. Federal dollars can only be used on professional development programs that increase teacher knowledge and are directly related to the curriculum and  subject area in which the teacher provides instruction. 
   It enables them to retain, recruit, train, and hire highly qualified teachers and to hire teachers to reduce class size, which has, of course, been a goal of the other side of the aisle, and the President. It enables them to assist innovative teacher reforms aimed at increasing teacher quality, including mentoring and master teachers. The Senator from Massachusetts talked about mentoring earlier today. Studies and teacher polls have found that hiring master teachers who mentor new teachers improves both teacher quality and the likelihood that new teachers will stay and thrive at the school. 
   It enables them to provide merit pay and teacher testing and alternative certification programs. These are programs that provide opportunities for experienced professionals from other fields to enter teaching. It enables them to provide teacher opportunity payments, funds that go directly to teachers so they can choose their own professional development. Teachers could select to use their payment at a university that has a reputation for intensive professional development programs in math and science. 
   It incorporates the language of Senator GREGG of New Hampshire dealing with teacher quality provisions that are included in this amendment, including addressing teacher shortages. Due to rising enrollments, many school districts are having difficulty filling hundreds of teacher slots, and of those teachers already in the classroom, many lack the skills and knowledge to be effective teachers. Earlier, Senator KENNEDY had very interesting data that demonstrates this problem. The amendment clarifies that States and school districts are permitted to not only use the money to hire teachers to reduce class size but to also use the money to hire teachers to address the shortage of high-quality teachers. If a school district wishes to use these dollars to hire a teacher, they should have the freedom to hire teachers to reduce their class size or to address the shortage of high-quality teachers. 
   It includes compulsory language relating to class size, which exacerbates the shortage of high-quality teachers, in our view. 
   Requiring smaller class sizes would only exacerbate the teacher shortage because it forces school districts to hire more teachers when they are already having enough trouble hiring teachers for the classes they already offer. 
   During the next decade, enrollment growth and higher teacher attrition rates mean many districts will have the need for more teachers, obviously. Yet the real shortage in our country is not so much in the number of teachers as it is in getting qualified teachers to work in the classroom, especially in hard-to-serve areas, such as inner cities and rural schools. 
   That reminds me, during the debate on the education savings account, which was a tool this Congress passed at least two or three times and is yet to get past the President--but during that debate, Senator BYRD of West Virginia came to the floor. He ultimately supported the education savings account. He said--and I am paraphrasing it; I hope I am correct; Senator BYRD is pretty much a stickler for being correct--but he indicated he voted historically for all the funding measures over the last 30 years and he was not all that happy with what has happened and he was ready to try some new ideas. 
   The telling thing about his commentary to the Senate that day, in my judgment, was to describe where he went to school. I do not believe anybody would argue Senator BYRD is among the most capable, intellectual in the Senate. When he took us back to his schoolroom, it was a remarkable story. 
   He was educated in a one-room school for much of his early training. It had no heat and no air-conditioning. The plumbing was outside. It had a bucket of water which was the potable water--that was the drinking water--and a ladle. Yet that environment produced one of the most competent, intellectual Members of the Senate. It is something we should all remember. He obviously had a quality teacher. He was educated in those circumstances and went on to become one of our more famous Members of the Senate. 
   I repeat that during the next decade enrollment growth and higher teacher attrition rates mean many districts will have the need for more teachers. Yet the real shortage in our country is not so much in the number of teachers as it is in getting qualified teachers to work in the classroom, especially in hard-to-serve areas, such as inner cities and rural schools. 
   Many teachers lack the necessary skills and knowledge to be a high-quality teacher. More than 25 percent of new teachers in our Nation's schools are poorly qualified to teach. Studies have shown the mastery of the subject is the most tangible measure of teacher quality. Many teachers lack either a major or minor in the subject in which they are teaching. 
   One-third of all secondary school teachers, grades 7 through 12, who teach math have neither a major nor a minor in math or a related field; 25 percent of all secondary school teachers who teach English lack a major or minor in English or a related field; more than half of all physical science teachers did not major or minor in any physical science; and more than half of all history teachers neither majored nor minored in history. 
   The shortages are even more troubling in inner-city schools where students only have a 50-50 chance of being taught by a quality teacher. In high schools where more than 49 percent of the students qualify for free lunch, which are classified as high-poverty schools, 40 percent of all classes in those high-poverty schools are taught by underqualified math teachers. 
   In more affluent schools, only 28 percent of the math classes are taught by unqualified math teachers. 
   I do not think either number is very impressive--the fact that nearly one out of three math classes taught in our more affluent schools can only muster two-thirds of the teachers who have the qualifications to teach the subject and that rises to nearly half in inner-city schools. 
   Nearly one-third of all English classes in high-poverty schools are taught by underqualified teachers. 
   The sad fact is that this amendment actually worsens the shortage of high-quality teachers. 
   I will move on to accountability. The second half of the Gregg provision in this amendment adds a strong accountability piece. The amendment stipulates that States are to monitor the progress of school districts in increasing both student achievement and the number of classes taught by high-quality teachers. If the school district fails to make progress after 3 years, the State is authorized to take control of the teacher dollars and use those funds on rigorous professional development, teacher reforms, such as merit pay, or other teacher initiatives to ensure student achievement increases and the number of high-quality teachers increases. 
   We do not prescribe a Federal ratio as to how much school districts must spend on recruitment versus how much to spend on professional development. We let States and districts set their own priorities. We do not focus on input measures--how much money is spent on what. Rather, we focus on outcomes and outcomes alone--student achievement and teacher quality. This accountability amendment ensures States and school districts will be held accountable for increasing student achievement and the number of high-quality teachers. 
   The recruitment provisions include in this amendment a section developed by Senators HUTCHISON of Texas, FRIST of Tennessee, and CRAPO of Idaho, which focuses on the need to recruit excellent teachers from other professions and from among our outstanding college graduates. Recruiting qualified people from other walks of life to enter the teaching profession will dramatically improve the quality of our teaching pool. 
   I outlined earlier the significant number of teachers teaching outside their subject area in schools throughout our country. The recruitment provisions in this amendment address the serious problem of underqualified teachers by attracting qualified teachers to step in and meet the needs. This amendment gives teacher quality the attention we believe it deserves. 
   I am pleased the other side of the aisle is amenable to the amendment.  
   I yield the floor so the Senator from Massachusetts can make his closing remarks, and then I believe we are getting close to coming to an end.

   Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, the Senator from Washington has asked the wrong question. She is looking for examples as to where merit pay is being used successfully and she just cited California. I am not familiar with that program, but it is a certification that led to a bonus and merit pay. 
   I remind the Senator of the remarks of the Senator from Florida. In Denver, CO, teachers earn additional bonuses if they show student improvement. Secretary Riley, of this administration, previously endorsed merit pay when he served as Governor of South Carolina. Florida law provides bonuses to teachers who are nationally certified by the National Board for Professional Teaching Standards, and can earn additional bonuses if they mentor another teacher in getting nationally certified as an additional bonus. 
   The superintendent of education from the State of Arizona was recently in our Capitol and lauded the concept of merit pay for teachers who have outstanding capabilities, pointing out this concept is important in order to retain people who are getting better and better. You need to be able to reward that teacher and keep that teacher in the system; otherwise, the individual is likely to leave. 
   Let me simply say I am quite taken with the argument given by the Senator from Washington which, in theory, runs against everything we do in this country--that there should be no reward for achievement; everybody has to be treated identically or they won't be able to work together. 
   That message is taught from elementary to high school to college to professional sports, where everybody has to work as a team--but is everybody treated the same way? What corporation in America could function that way? You would pay the salesman who sold 2 vacuum cleaners the same salary as one who sold 10. The American way is one of honest, fair competition and reward. We do not have a system where everybody is dumbed down. Yet this is an argument that people won't be able to get along if one is more successful than the other. The way it has always worked in this country is that person was a role model that made everybody else try to reach that standard to be as successful, to do as well. 
   Competition makes better products, better performers. The competition of ideas in our democracy makes ideas truer and more honest. Competition is healthy, not detrimental. The whole country is built on the back of it. 
   I appreciate the remarks of the Senator from Florida. I think he is probably somewhat stunned someone remembered something that was said months ago, but it was such a compelling story about the role of teachers in education, and he has been kind enough to stay. 
   As part of my remarks, I ask the Senator if he might relate to those in the center of this debate that great story of what he found in a very special school when he went to Los Angeles.

   Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the amendment before us, the Democrat substitute. In that it is a total proposal, it gives us a chance to talk about the context of the total debate. I have to say I am appalled, looking at the scope of the data  over the last 30 years, that anybody could defend the status quo. It is just mind-boggling to think about it. 
   It does remind me of the welfare debate. I never could understand how anybody could look at that system and look at the number of people who were being damaged by it and not recognize that something had to be done to change it and we had to look to newer ideas. Not all the new ideas work, but we know the old ideas did not. 
   Today in America, 41 million adults are not effective readers. They have trouble with a phone book or a prescription drug label, reading a letter from a family member. That is a staggering number. I am going to get into some of these statistics, but I want to step back just for a moment to say I think everybody inherently knows education is an exceedingly important subject for all of us in the country. But from time to time, I think we need to step back and recognize that education and an educated mind are a cornerstone of American liberty. 
   Let's try to frame this for a moment. From our very founding, we have understood that a core component of maintaining a free society is that the population is educated. To the extent that any among us who are citizens do not have the fundamental skills, the basic education, they are truly not free. They cannot enjoy the full benefits of American citizenship because they are denied the ability to participate. They are inhibited in the ability to think for themselves, for their families, for their communities, for the Nation. 
   There have been a couple of assertions made here. One was made by the majority leader. The other I think was made by the Senator from Connecticut. I would like to talk about those for a minute. 
   The suggestion is that these deplorable statistics, that two out of every three African American students and Hispanic fourth graders can barely read, 70 percent of children in high-poverty schools score below the most basic level of reading, and on and on and on--the assertion by the Senator from Connecticut was: But the Federal Government only deals with 7 percent of the funding for schools and 93 percent comes from somewhere else so this blame cannot be directed at Federal policy. 
   That is a little misleading because for the 7 percent of these funds that go to the various States, about 50 percent of the bureaucratic overhead is associated with that 7 percent. 
   All the regulations, all the mandates, and all the forms associated with this Federal investment in education carry with them an enormous and staggering burden. There are hundreds upon hundreds of Federal employees in every State of the Union endeavoring to carry out the programs associated with the 7 percent. 
   Since 1994, by and large, the growth of employment in the public school system has been for administrators, not teachers. We are arguing about how to get the appropriate number of teachers, and a system-oriented program is driving up administrators. I want to make the point that one cannot simply say it is just 7 percent of the money. That is just not the case. It is 7 percent of the money, it is 50 percent of the overhead, and it is mandate after mandate. It has local systems gnarled up. 
   On more than one occasion, there has been an inference that the States do not have the moxie or the know-how to get in there and get this done. Frankly, it is in the States where I see the most innovation. In my State of Georgia, a Democratic Governor is turning the system upside down. Or one can go to Wisconsin or Arizona. Why are they so energized? Why are they asking us for more flexibility and more options? Because they know what we have been doing is ineffective and not getting the job done and damaging our democracy because it is putting out on the street millions of Americans who cannot function properly in our society. 
   The minority leader earlier said that since 1994, we have been doing a whole lot better. First of all, we were doing so badly that it did not take a lot to improve. The point is, there really is no basic improvement. The data is atrocious. In mathematics, American 12th graders ranked 19th of 21 industrialized countries and in science 16th of 21 nations. Our advanced physics students ranked last. Who would ever have thought this to be the case in the United States of America? 
   Since 1983, 6 million Americans dropped out of high school. In 1996, 44 percent of Hispanic immigrants aged 16 through 24 were not in school and did not hold a diploma. 
   In the fourth grade, 77 percent of children in urban high-poverty schools are reading below basic on the National Assessment of Educational Progress. 
   In 1995, nearly 30 percent of all first-time college freshmen enrolled in at least one remedial course, and 80 percent of all public 4-year universities offered remedial courses. 
   According to U.S. manufacturers, 40 percent of all 17-year-olds do not have the math skills and 60 percent lack the reading skills to hold down a production job at a manufacturing company. 
   Seventy-six percent of college professors and 63 percent of employers believe a high school diploma is no guarantee that a typical student has learned the basics. 
   Maybe this is one of the statistics that is thought to have improved: The dropout rate for 9th and 12th graders in 1995 was 3.9 million--rounded off, 12 percent. In 1998, this period for which we were supposed to have seen significant improvement, the dropout rate was 3.9 million or 11.8 percent, or perhaps two-tenths of 1 percent--hardly anything about which to get excited. 
   In grade 4, according to the National Association of Education Progress, poor students lag behind their more 
   affluent peers by 20 percent. The results show no change--I repeat, no change--over the three assessments from 1992 to 1998. From where are we drawing any conclusions that somehow things have turned around? 
   In grade 8, 38 percent are below basic in mathematics; 48 percent of fourth grade students scored below basic. 
   In reading, there are more 12th graders scoring below the basic level; 20 percent in 1992 and 23 percent, up 1 percent, in 1998. 
   One has to be an eternal optimist beyond any description or definition that I can understand to think that somehow this incorrigible data we have received shows that we have a tourniquet on the problem and circumstances are improving. 
   Seventy percent of children in high-poverty schools scored below even the most basic level of reading. 
   Half of the students from urban school districts failed to graduate on time, if at all. 
   Forty-two percent of students in the highest poverty schools scored at or above the NAEP basic level for reading; 62 percent of students in all public schools met the standard. 
   We have been at this for 35 years and have spent approximately $130 billion. In virtually every category, those students who were the targets of this program are not better off. 
   I want to talk about that for a moment. What does ``not better off'' mean? I said 42 percent, 13 percent, 30 percent, 6 million of those, 5 million of these. What does that mean? What if it is a person we know living in one of our cities? It means, to use a figurative name, Billy Smith cannot get a job because he cannot read. He has dropped out of school. He is pushed into probably a very poor environment. The likelihood of Billy Smith going to prison is three times that of a student who stays in school. The chances Billy is going to be the father of a child born out of wedlock are in huge multiples. The average annual income is virtually poverty line or below. Pushed to crime, Billy Smith, one of these millions about whom we talk, one of these percentage points or numbers, one of these people we have turned a blind eye toward for these many years, is just likely, more than anything else, to end up in trouble, end up in prison, end up on drugs, not be a productive element of society, and probably create a family of whom he cannot take care. 
   That is the picture that gets repeated by these millions and millions of people about whom we talk. There are 41 million American adults who cannot read. Look at the prison population and find out their reading skills. Of course, it is not that it is nonexistent, but it is not there. Every one of these children who falls out, and through, this system is being condemned to a very unpleasant and nonproductive future in our society. 
   Now comes this bill that we are considering. I am not a member of the  committee. But it talks about giving local school systems options, performance agreements. It talks about more flexibility. It talks about accountability. It makes it all optional. Nobody has to do it. If everybody is real comfortable with the status quo, with the abysmal data we see every other week, they can stay right where they are. I think they will find that the constituencies--the public--are going to demand that changes start to occur, which is why so many Governors are in the middle of all of this and why they are asking for flexibility and new options. 
   But even the opportunity to try different concepts is repulsed by the other side: No. We can't do that. We have to set the standard right here. We have to tell every one of those Governors they are not capable of knowing exactly what we should do anyway, so we have to tell them exactly what they need to do. 
   This is a classic debate between those who want to go to a new place and those who want to stay in the old, between the status quo and the new, between those who have confidence in the emerging effectiveness of local governments and State governments and those who don't. 
   In the early 1960s, there were a number of critiques written about State governments. You would not recognize any of them today. I think for us to assert that those folks on the ground, in the community, have to be told what to do is uncharacteristic of the American way. 
   I think that the substitute which says, no, let's keep things the way they are--they have bells and whistles in there; but essentially it is a defense of the status quo; let's just keep on looking at this data; let's not try anything different; let's not give some flexibility to these localities and States--ought to be defeated. 
   I compliment the chairman of the committee, who is not here at the moment, and also Senator FRIST of Tennessee, and all the others on the committee who worked so hard to produce the underlying bill we are considering, that does move to a new day, that does offer flexibility and accountability, that does offer new options. I commend them for their work. 
   I hope we will defeat this substitute and move on ultimately to passage of the underlying bill. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

    Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate and honor two young Georgia students who have achieved national recognition for exemplary volunteer service in their communities. Shelarese Ruffin of Atlanta and Sagen Woolery of Warner Robins have just been named State Honorees in The 2000 Prudential Spirit of Community Awards program, an annual honor conferred on only one high school student and one middle-level student in each State, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico. 
   Ms. Shelarese Ruffin is being recognized for her efforts in developing an intervention program that targets at-risk teens. The program is designed to help further educate and discipline teens in overcoming drug and behavioral problems. Mr. Sagen Woolery is being honored for volunteering his time and creating ``The Kid's Kitchen,'' a soup kitchen for needy children and their families which is fully operated by kids between the ages of 8-12. 
   In light of numerous statistics that indicate Americans today are less involved in their communities than they once were, it is vital that we encourage and support the kind of selfless contributions these young people have made. People of all ages need to think more about how we, as individual citizens, can work together at the local level to ensure the health and vitality of our towns and neighborhoods. Young volunteers like Ms. Ruffin and Mr. Woolery are inspiring examples to all of us, and are among our brightest hopes for a better tomorrow. 
   Ms. Ruffin and Mr. Woolery should be extremely proud to have been singled out from such a large group of dedicated volunteers. As part of their recognition, they will come to Washington in early May, along with other 2000 Spirit of Community Honorees from across the country, for several days of special events, including a congressional breakfast reception on Capitol Hill. 
   I heartily applaud Ms. Ruffin and Mr. Woolery for their initiative in seeking to make their communities better places to live, and for the positive impact they have had on the lives of others. 
   In addition, I also salute other young people in Georgia who were named Distinguished Finalists by the Prudential Spirit of Community Awards for their outstanding volunteer service. They are: Vidya Margaret Anegundi of Lilburn, Shamea Crane of Morrow, Lyndsey Miller of Atlanta, Jessica Nickerson of Savannah, Leslie Pruett of LaGrange, and Erin Shealy of Watkinsville. 
   All of these young people have demonstrated a level of commitment and accomplishment that is truly extraordinary in today's world and deserve our sincere admiration and respect. Their actions show that young Americans can and do play important roles in their communities, and that America's community spirit continues to hold tremendous promise for the future.

    Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to one of the great civil servants of my state. On April 14, 2000, Mayor Emma Gresham of Keysville, Georgia, received an Essence Award from Essence Magazine for her outstanding service to the community. This award is a fitting tribute to a lady who has brought so much to her community and Georgia as a whole. 
   Emma Gresham was born on April 13, 1925, the youngest of eight children. As the daughter of a pastor and a missionary, Emma Gresham's desire to help other people was established at a young age. During her youth she served as a scoutmaster, and went on to work as a teacher at her local church. All of her life Emma Gresham has sought to make other people's lives better. 
   While Mrs. Gresham's commitment to the people of Keysville has existed for decades, the town of Keysville has not. Although the town had held a charter since 1890, it stopped having elections and essentially dissolved in 1933. In the mid-1980's the charter was rediscovered and found to be valid, and in 1985 the townspeople chose Emma Gresham as their mayor. 
   Ms. Gresham enjoyed her position for less than a day because the charter was revoked due to concerns over the city's boundary. Following a drawn-out process that involved excavations to discover a long-lost landmark, the city's charter was reactivated and Ms. Gresham was elected again in 1988. Since taking office, Mrs. Gresham has served for free. 
   Once in office, Mayor Gresham set to work. Since the town government had been dormant for so long, Keysville lacked many of the necessities most small towns enjoy. The city lacked clean water, streetlights, and even a fire department. In addition, the town's adult illiteracy rate was dangerously high. 
   Today, thanks to Mayor Gresham's leadership and commitment, Keysville has a water tower and a fire station. The first street lights were recently installed, and the town started a medical clinic. Last, but certainly not least, Keysville has an established adult literacy program as well. 
   The citizens of Keysville are now talking of building a new city hall and elementary school. This is quite a feat for a town that virtually did not exist twelve years ago. 
   Now 75, Emma Gresham is likely to retire when her current term as mayor ends in 2002. We can only hope that her successor will follow in her footsteps and be as effective an advocate for Keysville as Mayor Gresham. 
   Mr. President, the town of Keysville is certainly blessed. Without Emma Gresham's leadership, it is quite possible that it would not have made the strides that it has in the last decade. I offer my sincere congratulations to Mrs. Gresham for the award she earned through years of commitment to Keysville and its people, and wish continued success for her and the community she leads.

   Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, it is with a deep sense of honor that I rise today to introduce legislation awarding former President and Mrs. Ronald Reagan the Congressional Gold Medal. Very few Americans have had as profound an impact upon this Nation and the world as this remarkable couple have. 
   In his eight years in office, President Reagan restored American's sense of pride and set us squarely on the course of prosperity we still enjoy today. He was instrumental in the collapse of the Soviet Empire that brought an end to the Cold War. Who could forget his ringing challenge from Berlin's Bradenburg Gate, ``Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this Wall!'' By 1989, to the amazement of the world, Germany was unified, and the Wall became a memory. Reagan's character, wit, and eloquence as the ``Great Communicator'' brought honor to the Office of the President and endeared him to us all. 
   As First Lady, Nancy Reagan's contributions were equally significant in their own right. She not only bestowed elegance and grace upon the White House, but she also brought critical leadership to righting the scourge of illegal drugs. Tirelessly encouraging our Nation's youth to ``Just Say No,'' Mrs. Reagan was instrumental in successfully reducing the rate of illegal drug use among our children. 
   The Reagans have continued to inspire us even after their years in the White House. President and Nancy Reagan have confronted his Alzheimer's disease with the same dignity and bravery they displayed in office. Their fight inspires hope in millions of Americans who also must struggle with this disease. Our thoughts and best wishes for them are constant. 
   The leadership and dedication that President and Mrs. Reagan provided this Nation will undeniably endure throughout the course of human events. It is now time for a grateful people and Nation to say, ``Thank you.'' I am very appreciative of my many colleagues who join me today in sponsoring this legislation and invite others to join us in honoring President and Nancy Reagan.

    Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, as we approach the 25th Anniversary of the end of the Vietnam War, I rise today to pay tribute to those in my home state who answered the call of duty and were part of this great conflict. 
   The Vietnam War took place over the course of seventeen years, from the first formal American involvement in 1958 to the fall of the South Vietnamese government in 1975. Perhaps no other conflict in American history presented greater challenges to those who fought. A forbidding climate, combined with a tenacious opponent and attempts by some back home to undermine our effort, conspired to present our troops with near-impossible challenges. 
   My home state has a fine military tradition forged over the last 225 years. This legacy was upheld with honor throughout the Vietnam conflict. All told, Georgia sent 228,000 of its finest men and women to serve during the war. 1,584 were killed in action, and 8,534 were wounded. Twenty-one were held as prisoners of war, and to this day, thirty-nine remain missing in action. Youth from places like Snellville and Americus were thrown into an environment that was both unknown and very deadly. To say they did their duty well and with honor would be an understatement.  
   To honor its Vietnam veterans, my state dedicated a three-figure statue on Veterans' Day, 1988. In 1997 the Georgia Vietnam Wall was dedicated, listing the names of the 1,584 Georgians who died in the war. 
   Earlier this year the Georgia General Assembly passed a resolution commending Vietnam veterans and their families for their outstanding service to Georgia, America, southeast Asia, and the world. In addition, the General Assembly recognized that these brave troops did not lose the war, but rather that they simply were not allowed to win, and that their duty was just and honorable. I could not agree more. 
   Georgians have long recognized that freedom is not free and that we must always honor those who were willing to give their lives for it. As this era in our nation's history fades ever farther into the past, it is our duty to ensure that the people of all ages recognize and honor those who fought for the freedom they enjoy today. More so than winning or losing, the soldiers of the Vietnam war proved through their sweat and blood that we are willing to fight to defend the freedom we cherish and enjoy, no matter what the circumstances. 
   Mr. President, my state will observe the 25th Anniversary of the end of the Vietnam War on May 5-7, 2000. I encourage all Americans to take time during these dates to honor and remember those who served in Vietnam and the name of freedom.

   Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, America has a reading deficit! According to the National Adult Literacy Survey (NALS), 41 million adults are unable to perform even the simplest literacy tasks. The most recent National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) conducted in 1998 continues to show that almost 70 percent of 4th grade students cannot read at a proficient level. Even worse, 40 percent of those 4th graders could not read at even a basic level for their grade. 
   In short, Mr. President, unless we treat this situation as the national emergency that it is--and soon--the next decade will see an astonishing 70 percent of our 4th grade students joining the ranks of those 41 million American adults who are unable to perform simple literacy tasks. 
   The ability to read the English language with fluency and comprehension is essential if individuals, old and young, are to reach their full potential in any field of endeavor. As the saying goes, ``reading is fundamental.'' 
   And the statistics bear that out as well. Workers who lack a high school diploma earn a mean monthly income of $452, compared to $1,829 for those with a bachelor's degree. Forty three percent of people with the lowest literacy skills live in poverty, 17 percent receive food stamps, and 70 percent have no job or a part-time job. 
   And make no mistake that the nation itself and not just individuals will suffer. If our children are not taught to read, who will man our high tech defenses or fill the high tech jobs in America's future? 
   Compounding these astounding statistics, Mr. President, the 1998 NAEP also found that minority students on average continue to lag far behind in reading proficiency, even though many of them are in Title I programs of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act or participated in Head Start programs. 
   Clearly, throwing taxpayer money at the problem does not work. Our children's reading scores continue to decline or remain stagnant, even though Congress has spent more than $120 million over the past 30 years for academic enrichment programs under Title I and other federal efforts ostensibly with the primary purpose of improving reading skills among disadvantaged children. 
   It should also be pointed out that more than half of the students being placed in the special learning disabilities category of our Special Education programs are there in large part because they have not learned to read. The national cost of special education at the federal, state, and local levels now exceeds $60 billion each year. The National Institute for Child Health and Human Development says that 90-95 percent of these students could learn to read and be returned to their regular classrooms if they were given instruction using scientifically based reading principles. This would result in over $12 billion in savings nationwide every year by eliminating the need for special education for these children. 
   In response to these disturbing national statistics concerning the inability of so many children to read, I worked with Representative BILL GOODLING--Chairman of the Education Committee in the House of Representatives--to develop the Reading Deficit Elimination Act of 2000, which I am introducing today. 
   By providing funds for teacher training, textbook and curriculum purchases, student assessments, teacher bonuses, and tuition assistance grants to parents, this legislation offers the States a helping hand in teaching students nationwide to read. Unlike the unfunded mandates that have failed in the past, this legislation will give states and communities funds to institute reading instruction based on years  of federally sponsored research, giving them the ability and the flexibility to help our children succeed. 
   The National Reading Panel--requested by Congress and created by the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development--released its report just this morning on scientifically-based reading instruction and research in a hearing of the Senate's Labor/HHS Appropriations Subcommittee chaired by Senator COCHRAN. 
   The report clearly articulates the most effective approaches to teaching children to read, the status of the research on reading, reading instruction practices that are ready to be used by teachers in classrooms around the country, and a plan to rapidly disseminate the findings to teachers and parents. The report also constitutes the most comprehensive review of existing reading research to be undertaken in American education history. Panel members identified more than 100,000 research studies completed since 1966, developed and submitted them to rigorous criteria for their review. 
   A major finding of the report was that systematic phonics instruction is one of the necessary components of a total reading program. Similarly, the NRP also found that the sequence of reading instruction that obtains maximum benefits for students should include instruction in phonemic awareness, systematic phonics, reading fluency, spelling, writing and reading comprehension strategies. We must use the knowledge of reading skills and the principles for teaching reading skills gained from these studies from the government and the private sector to reduce the number of individuals and students who cannot read. 
   The programs and provisions in the Reading Deficit Elimination Act of 2000 are based on these finding by the National Reading Panel. 
   Mr. President, Frederick Douglass, arguably the most influential African American of the nineteenth century said, ``Once you learn to read, you will be forever free.'' Douglass knew the importance of freedom, and he knew the importance of literacy. The ability to read the English language with fluency and comprehension is essential if individuals are to reach their full potential in any endeavor. Again, as the saying goes: ``Reading is fundamental.'' No one should be left behind because they can't read. We must not limit the success of the next generation by allowing them to continue down the path of illiteracy. We must teach them to read and give them this fundamental tool they need to succeed in life as well as in school.

   Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, the Senator from Virginia has been debating this for an extended period of time. School construction and renovation is traditionally the responsibility of local and State governments. It traditionally has been and it still is. 
   The Robb amendment, in effect, has the effect of raising taxes by $4.2 billion over 5 years to have the Federal Government take over part of this responsibility. Even under the President's proposal, which would cost even more, we would only be able to cover about one-fourth of the total cost of improving schools, according to the General Accounting Office. 
   As we have said repeatedly over the last couple of days, this budget resolution includes more money for education than the President--$600 million more in 2001 and $2.2 billion more over 5 years. We have made plenty of room for different options on education policy in this budget resolution. 
   All of these issues will be discussed and debated in the ESEA reauthorization coming up in May. The spending increase in this amendment is unnecessary. 
   In addition, if the Federal Government is going to become a major and direct party in the issue of school construction, along with it will come the same kind of intervention that the last two Congresses have been endeavoring to undo. They have been trying to make it more flexible, not less. 
   It is my personal opinion, given the way school construction has been managed, that any Federal program of this nature will by necessity have the tendency to pick winners and losers because as everybody acknowledges, it doesn't get to the total requirement and it will also have the effect of rewarding local jurisdictions that have been less attentive to the work that they are responsible for or for which they are responsible. 
   Invariably, districts that have gotten the job done or are in the business of doing it will be second-class citizens to those jurisdictions that have overlooked or not been attentive to the nature of their responsibility of school construction. 
   How much time remains?

   Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, the bottom line, whether you call it a tax increase or reduction of a tax relief proposal, the net effect is between $4 billion and $6 billion is not going to be in the checking accounts of American citizens if this amendment is adopted that could theoretically otherwise be there. Taxpayers will have less if the amendment is adopted. 
   The second point the Senator from Virginia makes about underresourced has merit. But so does mine. Yes, there are some school districts that are underresourced; those are the responsibility of those States, not the Federal Government. 
   It is equally true that many of these jurisdictions do have the resources and for whatever reason have not made that the priority it maybe ought to have been. There is no doubt about it. We can name any number of jurisdictions that have underequipped schools that sit in municipalities or counties that have innumerable resources.

   Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, the bipartisan education savings account which was passed in March and had been threatened by a veto from the President makes education more affordable for millions of Americans. I might say, during that debate of our proposal to empower parents, to empower local school districts and communities, there was a similar debate with the Senator from Virginia on a similar subject. We prevailed at that time. 
   At that time, the Senator from Virginia basically was attempting to fund this idea of his by removing the loss of tax revenue that occurs in the education savings account. As I understand the amendment now, it would reduce the tax relief in the budget resolution. So it is a very similar debate that is occurring between the Senator from Virginia and our side. 
   I want to refresh the Senate on what has passed the Senate and will soon find its way to the President's desk. As I said a little earlier, the President has at least given an indication that he would veto it, so I think it is entirely appropriate that we reassert our position in the budget resolution. 
   The education savings account starts with the current law, which allows families to save up to $500 per year while the interest in an account is exempt from taxes as long as the savings are used for college education. We have taken the same proposal and expanded it to $2,000 per year instead of $500, and we have said a family can use the savings in that account anywhere in the education of the child, from kindergarten through college--even after college if the student is a dependent. 
   We have taken what everybody on both sides of the aisle has said is a grand idea and expanded it. Everybody is a winner: 
   Public education, private education, home schooling education, kindergarten through college. It remains puzzling to me that this bipartisan proposal, supported by Members on both sides of the aisle, is now threatened by the President. 
   On State prepaid tuition relief, the legislation makes interest earned on qualified public and private school higher education tuition plans tax free. Some 41 States today--I think soon it will be all--offer a State prepaid tuition plan to help parents prepare their students for the cost of college. The problem is, when those benefits come to the student, they get taxed, so it is diminished significantly. Under this proposal, that tax would no longer hit the savings account. It would be there and available for the family to help that child through college. 
   The proposal extends employer-provided educational assistance for undergraduate studies; in other words, it helps make it possible for employers to assist employees in their continuing education. It is estimated that some million employees will be the beneficiaries of this proposal that has now passed the Senate. 
   I failed to mention that it is estimated those who would open education savings accounts, such as those we are enumerating here, are 14 million families who are the custodians, those who are taking care of 20 million children. That is about 40 percent of the entire population in school in the United States. 
   The proposal repeals the 60-month rule on student loan interest deductions and allows many individuals to claim tax deductions on interest they pay on their student loans without the imposition of a time limit. Currently, you have an exemption on that kind of benefit, but it runs out after a certain number of years. This removes the time limit. 
   With regard to school construction, the Affordable Education Act contains a provision originally offered by Senator GRAHAM of Florida to create a new category of exempt bonds for privately owned, publicly operated K-12 schools. So we do not obviate or ignore the issue of construction problems in the country. This provision would make available up to $2.5 billion each year in school construction bonds, enough to build hundreds of new schools in America every year. But it would be totally controlled locally. It would not be the Federal Government picking which schools, it would be the districts themselves deciding whether they wanted to use this new provision in order to deal with school construction needs in their district. 
   The bill would allow school districts to issue more tax-exempt bonds for school construction without having to comply with complex IRS arbitrage rebate rules. This would lower the cost of school construction for many small and rural school districts. 
   The billions of dollars in Federal assistance are on top of what State and local governments are already doing to build schools without, as I said a moment ago, Federal interference from Washington or any selection being made by Federal bureaucrats. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, State and local governments spent $13 billion in 1999 on public school and university facilities. An American school and university survey shows, between 1990 and 1999, public school construction expenditures increased by 60 percent--that is without the Federal Government; they have done that on their own, making their own decisions--while overall economic activity only 
   increased by 32 percent, and student population increased by only 10 percent. 
   So, in summary, what this sense of the Senate does is ask the President to recognize how many winners are generated by the Senate's idea on the Affordable School Act: 14 million families will benefit, 20 million schoolchildren; there will be $12 billion in new savings without the Federal Government investing a dime; 1 million college students in State prepaid tuition plans; 1 million workers receiving education assistance; countless schools will be built across the country; and countless Americans will receive a break on the interest they pay on their student loans. 
   Reserving the remainder of my time, I yield the floor so we might hear from the Senator from Virginia.

   Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I will be very brief. 
   The Senator from Virginia and I have an honorable disagreement about how the Federal Government ought to respond to being a better partner in education. But the one issue that I would take some exception to and would like to clarify is the question of whether this is designed to be a voucher. It is not a voucher. The good Senator from New Jersey, Mr. TORRICELLI, who vehemently does not support vouchers, is a coauthor because he does not view this as a voucher. 
   I would not say that of the 70 percent of the families who would open an account who are in public schools, some family somewhere with that savings account might not make a change. But it would be statistically insignificant. If they did, I think it is a right that they should have. 
   As the Senator from Virginia said, 90 percent-plus of our students are in public schools. I venture to say that 10 years from now, 90 percent-plus of our students are still going to be in public schools. 
   The proposal is not designed to be a disguise for vouchers. It never has been. As I said, 70 percent of the people who open these accounts are estimated to have children in public schools and 30 percent are in some other school. 
   Of the $12 billion that will be saved and used for schools, it is divided about 50-50. In my view, that is because those families who have the child in the private school know they have a higher hurdle, that they have to pay the local school taxes and the tuition, so they tend to save more. 
   It may not be persuasive to the Senator from Virginia, but I did want to make the point that I never viewed this, and I think generally speaking it has never been viewed, as a voucher. 
   I yield the floor. When the Senator from Virginia concludes his remarks, I think we are both prepared to yield back time on this substitute amendment.

   Mr. COVERDELL. Then, if I might, with that clarification, at the conclusion of my remarks and the remarks of the Senator from Texas or others on marriage penalty, then I will begin to implement the 30 minutes that was assigned to me. 
   Mr. President, first I thank the Senator from Texas for her perseverance in pursuing relief of the marriage tax penalty on so many millions of Americans. I have several general comments to make about this proposal at this time. Again, before she gets away, I thank the Senator from Texas for the drumbeat by which she has continued to pursue this issue because it is an exceedingly important policy issue. That is the first point I want to make. 
   The fact we would have ever come to the point in the United States, given all the problems we have been talking about over these last several years of destabilization in our society, that we would punish people for creating families is unconscionable public policy. It is almost unbelievable it could have ever come to this point. So, as a matter of sound, intelligent, appropriate public policy, there should not be a penalty for people creating families. We should be encouraging, not discouraging, that. We should be making available to those families as many resources as possible to carry out the building of America upon which we have always relied. It is that family that we have depended upon to get America up in the morning, to get it to school and to work, to house it, to provide for the health needs and education of the country. 
   The dreams of America are in the hands of these families. To punish them, to financially punish them, as I said a moment ago, is absolutely unconscionable public policy. It raises all kinds of questions about what kind of thinking goes on in this Capital City, for Heaven's sake. The punishment is not insignificant--about $1,400 a year on average. Start thinking of the things that would do: The home computers, tutors, a new mortgage, transportation. The average American family's disposable income, that which is left after the Government marches through their checking account and takes over half of it --in our State, that family is probably making about $45,000 to $50,000. By the time you take that down by half--then think of all the things they have to do to raise America, to take care of America--we have not left enough there to get the job done. No wonder we see so many problems in our society. 
   If you were to put a graph behind me from 1950 to 1990 and show what the Federal Government was taking out of that checking account in 1950, and then what it is taking out in 1990, you would faint. If you put up a graph of every other problem--SAT scores, teenage suicide rates, you name it--as that graph went up, as we took more and more resources away from those families, bad things start to happen in our country. So there is nothing more important than making a statement that we are not going to punish families and we are going to take steps to leave more value, more of what they work for in their checking accounts so they can do what they need to do for America. 
   If every little family can take care of itself, the country is in great shape. Conversely, if we make it difficult for these families to get the job done, the country starts to wobble a bit. It has gotten right close to wobbling. 
   The other point I want to make is this: If we are going to talk about eliminating the marriage tax penalty, then we ought to be bold about it and serious about it. This proposal that is coming from the Finance Committee, and for which the Senator from Texas has fought, is just that. 
   The President has used the name but no substance--the name, the sound bite--but it is not getting the job done. Clearly, if we are going to go before the country and say we are going to eliminate the marriage tax penalty, it ought to virtually get the job done. 
   The proposal sponsored by the Senator from Texas, and which is likely to come out of the Finance Committee, will do that. The President's proposal does not. 
   I hope this ultimately passes the Senate, that we work out any differences with the House, and it goes to the President's desk and he acknowledges that a marriage tax penalty is a bad thing, it is bad policy. 
   I have one other comment to make about this before I yield back the remainder of the time to the Senator from Texas. I have not heard anybody refer to this, but this proposal is across-the-board tax relief. Why is that? Because it takes the bottom tax bracket where people pay 15 percent and increases substantially the amount of income any family can earn and only be taxed on that income at 15 percent. Every taxpayer will receive tax relief because they all pay 15 percent on the  first bracket. The first bracket is being enlarged. Everybody will benefit. 
   Admittedly, by focusing on these earlier tax brackets, the amount of relief, while the same for everybody, is more meaningful to middle-income families and lower-income families. This $1,500 is the difference between, as I said, the house or not, the car or not, proper education or not. For some of our wealthier citizens, it will not have that great an impact. They would make a different kind of decision about it. It is fair because it is across the board and it affects the entire 15-percent tax bracket. That is good. I want to see us do more of this where we are lowering the tax rates for all taxpayers. 
   One of the things about which I have been most encouraged, because Americans pay vastly different percentages of income taxes--it has actually gotten to a very negative separation of our citizens. About 50 percent pay very few taxes, and the top 5 or 10 percent pay inordinate taxes. That can lead into all kinds of problems. 
   The good thing is, the American people, our culture, demand fairness. They really do. One can ask any American in our country, no matter the walk of life, their gender, or their racial background: What is a fair tax? It is always about the same. It doesn't matter where they come from or what their economic status is. They will say it should be about 25 percent. It should not be 50. Americans are essentially fair, and that is good. That gives us the ground upon which to correct some of these onerous bad policies that are in the Tax Code. This is one of them. This is the right thing to do, as I said the other day, and it is the right time to do it. 
   Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of time to the Senator from Texas.

   Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, before I left the Foreign Relations Committee very recently and going to the Finance Committee, I was chairman of the Subcommittee on the Western Hemisphere. I will address the Senate this morning with regard to those responsibilities and to our hemisphere. I will suggest that we must reinvigorate our partnerships in this hemisphere as we begin a new century. If we work to nurture the political and the economic relationships among the nations of the Western Hemisphere, I am convinced that the next century will be the century of the Americas--a time of unparalleled peace and prosperity. 
   The reason for my remarks, however, is that there are threats, serious threats, to the stability of the democracies in our hemisphere. We need to confront them together--neighbor helping neighbor. 
   There has been a great deal of discussion recently on deciding what event adequately defines the last century. Some would say victory over Hitler in World War II, or the fall of the Berlin Wall, the first man to walk on the Moon, or the invention of computers. You would make a good case for each one of these. 
   But I believe the history of the 20th century cannot be defined by one of these singularly remarkable achievements. The greatest development was not an event at all but a slow and steady march over time. For me, it was the spread of democracy around the world, a movement in which the United States played a leading role. 
   Consider the following: According to the Freedom House, of the 192 sovereign states in existence today, 119 are considered true democracies. In 1950, a date I referred to in the earlier debate, only 22 countries were democracies--22; today there are 119. This means that nearly 100 nations have made this incredible transition over this last half century. I witnessed much of this great transformation as Director of the U.S. Peace Corps under President Bush. Nowhere did I see more dramatic change than in our own backyard. 
   In 1981, 18 of the 33 nations in the hemisphere were under authoritarian rule. By the beginning of the 1990s, all but one--Cuba--had freely elected heads of state. It was the springtime of democracy. 
   In the new century ahead, we must nurture and protect this freedom around the world but with great attention on our own hemisphere. Our welfare is inextricably tied to that of our neighbors in the region. We share common geography, history, and culture. Together we possess unbound potential for regional economic prosperity. 
   To harness this potential, we must continue to extend political and economic freedom to the entire hemisphere. The stakes are very high. If we are successful, I am confident the 21st century will be remembered, as I said, as the century of the Americas. But if we neglect our responsibilities, we could realistically witness a balkanization of Latin America and a stagnation in our own economy. 
   The task is daunting, and becoming more so by the day. Freedom in the hemisphere remains fragile and uncertain. 
   Under the Clinton administration, we have failed to respond to the new challenges facing the region--allowing emerging threats to fester in places such as Colombia, Haiti, and Panama. As a result, some of the hard-fought victories for freedom in Latin America are weakened and in jeopardy.  
   Let me take a minute or two to focus on three core components of health in the Western Hemisphere. I mentioned a moment ago that there are serious threats to these new democracies. I also mentioned there is enormous potential in the hemisphere. 
   If you took the whole Western Hemisphere combined, it is the largest consumer base in the world. There is enormous potential here. Most people do not realize that trade in this hemisphere today is already larger than all of our trade in Europe, almost double our trade with the European Union. Trade in this hemisphere is significantly larger than our trade with the Pacific rim. If you were to ask most Americans, they would undoubtedly say our greatest trading partner would be Europe. It is third. The Western Hemisphere is first; the Pacific rim is second; and a long way back is the European Union. 
   That tells me where we have to be highly focused in the context of the health of the hemisphere. As I said, in the early 1990s, we could look across this area and see all these new democracies. But as we look today, after about 9 years of this wonderful achievement, there are some pretty serious issues on which we need to be focused, and we are not. 
   You see, for democracy to be successful, it has to be more than just an election of a head of state. For democracy to be successful, it has to have a sound judiciary; in other words, a way for disputes to be resolved peacefully and civilly. 
   This is incredibly important to trade and to relations between the countries. I will give you an example. Who is going to make an investment in a country for which there is no appropriate judiciary to resolve differences? Not many because you have put it at too high a risk. 
   Investment does not go to high risk; it runs from it. Investment goes to security; it seeks it. In too many of our new democracies, we have not focused on helping build an appropriate judiciary. 
   Law enforcement: In many of these new countries, law enforcement had previously been the responsibility of the military. In Nicaragua, Honduras, many of these countries, in Guatemala, it was the military that established order. As we all know, that can be without due process. It can be orderly, but you better not cross it. You better not have a disagreement. In other words, you have a condition in which citizens or guests are not safe or could be threatened. Whenever that happens, you have a deterioration of economic mobility and stability. Investments move away from those kinds of situations, not to them. 
   Substantial progress has been made in each of the countries I mentioned to move to a civil form of law enforcement, but this is a daunting task. Look at Haiti today; with the investment that has been made, which is approaching $3 billion, and an attempt by the United Nations to train a civil law enforcement--not a military, a civil law enforcement--it just does not exist. Do we really believe there is a judicial process that would allow an investor to come in and put a high-stake investment in the country and if there were a dispute of some form between the government and that country or between two parties or a native Haitian and a foreign investor that there would be a competent, capable way for that dispute to be resolved? No. Therefore, the investments don't flow. When the investments don't flow, you have a deteriorating economy. When you have a deteriorating economy, then you begin to destabilize everything you have talked about in terms of democracies. They begin to wobble; they can disappear. 
   Today we have a President of one of the more significant countries of Latin America, Peru, who is flouting the constitution. The constitution says a President, as in the United States, may be elected President for two terms. That is not enough for Fujimori; he wants three. Push the constitution to the side; push freedom of the press to the side; ignore the fundamentals of fair elections. Does that remind you of democracy? Does that suggest that the institutions of democracy--constitutional law, civil law enforcement, a fair and sound judiciary--are in order? You would be hard-pressed to answer that question yes. 
   Venezuela has a new popular President who has essentially moved everything to the side and who shaped the government in his own view. The question is still out there, but those are not very encouraging signs. They are worrisome. Where is that all going to lead? Does that make people who believe in constitutional law, civil authority, comforted? Answer: No, it does not. I want to come back to this point, but we must remember that about 13 percent of our oil energy today comes from Venezuela. 
   Colombia: Colombia is in the middle of a raging war. CNN has not found it. There are more refugees in Colombia than there were in Kosovo. No one is speculating on the number of dead. It is 35,000 people. And an insurgency driven by narcotics--not ideology, narcotics--controls 30 to 40 percent of the country and is on the outskirts of Bogota. We and this administration have been talking about this old traditional republic that has been a great ally, supplying over 
   5 percent of our energy, and we have yet to get the assistance through this Congress. We have sent Ambassador Pickering, we have sent General McCaffrey, legislators, myself and others. We know we have to help protect that democracy that sits in the middle of Venezuela and Ecuador and Peru and Panama, the entire Andean region. 
   This is a reflection of our inability--and it is not just this administration, as a people--to understand how important our own backyard is. We tend to get focused off someplace else. I am not saying those are not significant priorities, but for Heaven's sake, if it is at your back door, you better be paying attention. Bogota is a 3-hour flight from Miami. 
   Talking about Mexico and the enormous problems they have had, I admire their leadership. They are struggling. But as President Zedillo said to me: There is no threat to the security of the Republic of Mexico that matches the corruption and the intrusion of narcotics. He is surrounded by it. 
   So we have Colombia, Mexico, then Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, then Georgia and New York and Chicago, right at the back door. You have to open the door. 
   In Paraguay--knock on wood--constitutional law was protected because it was an example of people in the hemisphere paying attention. The Vice President of the country was assassinated, and it looked as if constitutional law was gone. I have deep memories of this. The people of Paraguay overthrew a dictator, Stroessner. I was at the first inauguration of a freely elected President. If you had seen the faces of these people who had accomplished freedom, everybody ought to go through that. Everybody should have that opportunity. If you told me at the time that within a handful of years it would come to the point where their Vice President was assassinated, and it looked as if it was all going to collapse, I wouldn't have believed you, but it almost happened. 
   The institutions that make a democracy really be a democracy are not in place, and we have lost a lot of time--too much time. The nefarious, evil nature of narcotics has intruded the entire hemisphere--all of it--and it is marching. Its ultimate goal leaves nothing but ruins behind it. It corrupts the institutions of democratic principle, and it is doing it in country after country--in our own backyard. 
   We have been celebrating--and this is my third point--enormous trade opportunities. In the nineties, we have experienced it all across the country, across the hemisphere; it is staggering. It helps build a new middle class; it brings economic prosperity to people who have never enjoyed it. As an example, I can remember years ago, in Guatemala, about all that was being raised was corn and beans for self-sustenance. Now, they are truck gardening in fruits, with huge markets for them. Who do you see in the fields? You see 18- and 20-year-old young Guatemalans with a great job, and you know where that leads because we are from America. We know what happens. They start becoming independent. They stop relying on government. They start thinking for themselves. That needs to be nurtured. 
   The trade opportunities are boundless, but we have been knotted up; we have been unable to expand these trade agreements. What is happening? Did you read the newspapers yesterday?  The European Union signed the treaty with Mexico, and Mexico is entering into treaties with Mercosur, the southern cone of South America, and we are tied up in a knot here. So we are inviting this huge economic base to become the customer of other regions of the world because we can't seem to get it together. 
   Now, I assume my time is nearing the end.

   Mr. COVERDELL. My point is that a core component of new democracy in the world occurred right in our hemisphere. There was a marvelous achievement--to survive the institutions that make democracy work have to be put in place, and we have not done a good job on this. It has been sporadic, it is destabilizing, and we can see it. We have to only pick up a newspaper--Peru, Venezuela, Haiti, Colombia, and the list goes on. 
   No. 2, we have an enormous and powerful adversary in the narcotic cartels. They don't care about a single child anywhere, they don't care about any human life, and they do not care about any country. They are as evil a scourge as the world has ever seen. And they are fueling a criminal syndicate in the United States that is more powerful than anything with which we have ever dealt. Undoubtedly, somebody listening to this saw Godfather I and Godfather II--amateurs, rank amateurs compared to what we are dealing with. The economic opportunity is limitless, boundless, sitting right in our backyard, as I have said. Simply open a door. And we have let it get all frayed; we have not stayed attentive. 
   So, as I say, we can get focused in our own home if we can create, I call it a doctrine of the Americas, where all of us as neighbors demand certain standards, that they be upheld, and that constitutional law is a part of this hemisphere, that civil law enforcement is what we have grown to expect, and a fair judiciary must be in place. The Constitution cannot be just thrown across the desk and into a trash can. We all should be together demanding that kind of activity. If we will pay attention to this evil force and respond to it--not simply cover our eyes, but respond to it--we can keep it from doing enormous damage not only in the U.S. but across the hemisphere. 
   They are ruining governments. It will leave democracy in shambles. Mark my word. It must be confronted vigorously. It is a huge threat to our security. If we will pay attention to the trade opportunities and be vigorous about it, if we will do these three things, they will call this century the century of the Americas, and all of us will be rewarded tenfold in every country, and we will be an enormous force for world peace. Conversely, ignore all of these things and it will breed a problem and a trouble that will haunt us throughout the century. 
   I am for a century of the Americas. I get excited about it. I think we have to, as a nation, make a step forward; we have to be bold and we have to pay attention. 
   Mr. President, I yield back whatever time remains. I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a joint resolution urging free and fair elections and respect for democratic principles in Peru. I join with my colleagues, Senator LEAHY, Senator HELMS, and Senator DEWINE to express concern about the transparency and fairness of the current electoral campaign in Peru. 
   Several independent election monitors have issued distressing reports on the conditions surrounding the upcoming April 9 elections in Peru. A Carter Center/National Democratic Institute delegation has concluded that conditions for a free election campaign have not been established. Their report states that ``the electoral environment in Peru is characterized by polarization, anxiety and uncertainties ..... Irreparable damage to the integrity of the electoral process has already been done.'' The Organization of American States (OAS) has come to similar conclusions. An OAS special rapporteur recently concluded that ``Peru lacks that necessary conditions to guarantee the complete exercise of the right to express political ideas that oppose or criticize the government.'' 
   These reports, and others, detail the Peruvian Government's control of key official electoral agencies, systematic restrictions on freedom of the press, manipulation of the judicial process to stifle independent news outlets, and harassment or intimidation of opposition politicians--all with the aim of limiting the ability of opposition candidates to campaign freely. Such reports raise serious concerns about the openness in which the electoral campaign is being conducted and whether free and fair elections will actually occur. 
   Mr. President, this is a disturbing, though not necessarily surprising, trend for a government that already has an inconsistent record on democracy and the rule of law. Despite his many accomplishments, President Fujimori has often demonstrated little respect for democratic principles--his infamous ``auto-coup'', or dissolution of Congress, and his current bid for a third Presidential term being the best examples. In addition, the current crackdown on independent media highlights Peru's dismal record on press freedom under Fujimori. Freedom House rates only two countries in the Hemisphere, Peru and Cuba, as having a press that is ``not free.'' According to Freedom House, since 1992 media outlets have been pressured into self-censorship or exile by a government campaign of intimidation, abductions, death threats, arbitrary detention, and physical mistreatment. The case of Baruch Ivcher is a good example. In September 1997, a government-controlled court stripped Ivcher of his media business and his Peruvian citizenship after the station ran reports linking the military to torture and corruption. In 1998, Ivcher was sentenced in absentia to 12 years imprisonment. 
   The continued intimidation of journalists, and the lack of truly independent judicial and legislative branches threaten democracy and the rule of law in Peru. Indeed, Peru, could be said to be undergoing a ``slow-motion coup.'' Though not under attack in a violent or conspicuous manner, democracy and the rule of law in Peru are increasingly in question. 
   Mr. President, if one considers the incredible spread of democracy around the world over the last century, and in particular over the last twenty years, such a development is indeed disturbing. Consider the following: according to Freedom House, of the 192 sovereign states in existence today, 119 of them are considered true democracies. In 1950, just 22 countries were democracies, meaning that nearly 100 nations have made the transition over this half century. Nowhere was there a more dramatic change than in our own back yard. In 1981, 18 of the 33 nations in the hemisphere were under some  form of authoritarian rule. By the beginning of the 1990's, all but one--Castro's Cuba--had freely elected heads of state. 
   Despite these gains, freedom in the hemisphere remains fragile and uncertain--Peru being just one example. After 7 years of neglect by the current administration, some of the hard-fought victories for freedom in Latin America are weakened and in jeopardy. There is no doubt that if the elections are not deemed to be free and fair, it will represent a major setback for the people of Peru and for democracy in the hemisphere. 
   Mr. President, we must recommit ourselves to nurturing and protecting the gains of freedom around the world, but with great attention on our own hemisphere. A message must be sent to President Fujimori that if democratic processes are not respected, their economic and diplomatic relations will suffer. This message should be unanimous from every nation in the region, and not just from the United States. A breach of democracy, especially in this hemisphere, must not be allowed to stand.

   Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I commend the Chairman for moving this issue forward today. One of Georgia farmers' biggest complaints has been the inadequacies of the crop insurance program. The current program does not work and needs to be substantially reformed. Georgia farmers and ranchers continue to experience severe financial difficulties as a result of the lowest commodity prices in a decade, the devastating loss of international markets, and back to back disasters. They need a crop insurance program that provides the most economic benefits possible. While Congress helped stave off disaster in rural America by providing economic and weather related loss assistance in the fiscal year 1999 and 2000, it is evident that more needs to be done. Farmers need risk management programs that provide some protection against weather related and economic losses beyond their control. As it currently stands, crop insurance is too expensive for most farmers and has resulted in a low participation rate by many Georgia farmers. 
   The legislation before us today, while not perfect by any means, is a step in the right direction. I am reluctantly supporting this measure in an effort to move the debate forward. I would like to thank the Chairman for all his efforts on this important issue. While we are disappointed, of course, that the Chairman's mark did not prevail in committee. The Chairman's bill would have allowed Georgia farmers to choose whether or not traditional crop insurance was a viable risk management tool for their farms. There is $6 billion at stake though, and we need it to reform the program. The House has passed a bill with favorable provisions  for the Southeast. We intend to fight for perfections to the bill we pass today, so our region of the country is treated fairly. 
   The Roberts/Kerry bill has many important reform provisions that were included in the Cochran/Lincoln bill, of which I was proud to be a cosponsor. Some of these provisions included are increased subsidy rates for farmers, affordable specialty crop insurance policies, multi-year APH adjustments, equal prevented planting for all crops, and rating methodology reform. This bill also includes over $400 million for a risk management pilot program which we hope to tailor to the Georgia farmers' needs. All in all, this bill needs to go forward. We will ultimately arrive at a program that will be much better for our farmers than the status quo.

   Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, it is interesting that so much of our labor law dates back to the mid-1930s. H.R. 5 is a measure that deals with modernizing attitudes about work habits and workers and bringing them into the new century. 
   It was in 1935, during the Great Depression, that it was decided to discourage people who were 65 and older from working. That was done by saying: If you do work, we can't keep you from working, but for every $3 you earn, we are going to take $1 of it, or charge you a surtax of 33 percent. It was a very arduous and imposing tax on individuals on Social Security. 
   There are a number of major changes that have occurred in the workplace, but two I emphasize have become uniquely significant for this group of workers, age 65 to 69. 
   No. 1, the United States is effectively unable to fill its workplace. We deal with that issue on a daily basis. We need workers. We need people who are highly trained, who have developed an expertise, as senior workers have done. And we need them to stay in the workplace, if we are going to fill the American workplace. 
   The second issue that has created a very serious and significant change is that many of these workers must do so in order to keep up with the financial pressures of this time, with the increase in costs of medicine and other matters dealing with senior years. 
   It is inherently unfair to tax these earnings over $17,000 and to punish people for entering the workplace when, indeed, we want them to enter the workplace; we want them to stay in the workplace. They are no longer keeping somebody else from getting a job. We can walk down any street in America today and see: ``Now hiring.'' ``Now hiring.'' Company after company in our country cannot find sufficient workers. 
   We also don't have to spend much time in an audience anywhere in America that we do not hear a senior object to the fact that if he or she believes they must continue to work or want to work, they are so deeply penalized by Federal tax law. By repealing the earnings limit, we will be providing tax relief to about 1.2 million seniors in America between the ages of 65 and 69. It will amount to about $23 billion--not a small number--over 10 years. 
   This is the right thing to do, and it is the right time to do it. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce legislation that is of the utmost importance to a group of homeowners in my state. They face one of the most chilling scenarios that could confront a property owner--the condemnation and destruction of their home by the federal government without compensation. 
   The series of events that led to this unfortunate situation began nearly fifty years ago. In 1957, Lake Sidney Lanier was completed by the United States Army Corps of Engineers to serve as a reservoir for Atlanta and as a flood management project for northeast Georgia. Over the years this lake, located near the head of the Chattahoochee and Chestatee Rivers, developed into one of the great landmarks in my state. More importantly, many families have chosen to build homes on property adjacent to the lake. 
   When the lake is full, water rises to 1,071 feet above sea level. When the lake was completed in 1957, the Corps established a flood control easement, or ``flood line,'' of 1,085 feet above sea level. The Corps decreed that no structures could be built below this line. Unfortunately, the Corps did not make an accurate initial survey of this easement. Between 1967 and 1972, a second survey of the lake was made by foot, and beginning in 1983, yet another survey was begun to determine if private structures were violating the Corps easement. This survey is about halfway complete. 
   In the meantime, properties which were based upon the early surveys were sold to families looking to build a home along the lake. Many, if not all, of these home owners were unaware of this easement when they purchased property along the lake. Therefore, I believe many homes, which were believed to be compliant with all Corps property lines when constructed, in fact encroach upon the easement. No one is entirely sure how many of the thousands of homes along the lake accidentally encroach on the Corps' easement. 
   Last year, the Corps began enforcing the easement in some areas. They decreed that homes which violate the easement must be brought into compliance or be destroyed. Now, Mr. President, you and I know very well that it is very difficult to move a house. Therefore, destruction is often the only option for most home owners. 
   To make matters worse, property owners lack legal recourse. Because they were unaware of the easement requirement, means for dealing with it were not built into their property deeds. In short, numerous home owners face a dire situation should the Corps decide to enforce the easement all around the lake. 
   To solve this problem, today I introduce the Lake Sidney Lanier Home Preservation Act. It is both simple and fair. My legislation allows home owners who accidentally violated the easement to sign a release exempting them from the Corps requirement. In exchange for this, the home owner surrenders all rights to legal recourse against the United States if the Corps is forced to flood the lake to the easement level. At this point, I would like to point out that Lake Lanier has never approached the 1,085 foot easement line--its historic high was a full seven feet below the flood line, which was recorded in spring 1964. In recent years, the lake has been below full pool almost year round. 
   Upon enactment of this bill a home owner will have one year to request that the Corps survey their property and determine if they need to seek a waiver. The home owner not the Corps, pays for the survey. If a home is found to be in violation of the easement, the home owner has 90 days to decide whether to seek a release from the easement, or to bring the structure into compliance. 
   My bill also applies only to homes built or begun prior to January 1, 2000. This will provide closure to this issue and discourage any more homes from being built below the flood line. 
   Mr. President, I wish there were a simple answer to the dilemma facing home owners along Lake Lanier. While the Corps has a responsibility to fulfill its responsibility to protect citizens in the event of a flood, we simply cannot allow hard working families to lose their homes in response to a hypothetical situation that could never arise. 
   My colleague in the House of Representatives, Mr. DEAL, introduced companion legislation. It is my hope that we can move the Lake Sidney Lanier Home Preservation Act forward as quickly as possible, and bring peace of mind to home owners caught in a situation beyond their control.

    Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. was an extraordinary man who left a legacy for each of us as Americans and also as Georgians. On a hot summer day, August 28, 1963, Dr. King delivered his now famous and unforgettable ``I Have A Dream'' speech on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C. His words will always stay with us and help remind our Nation that we must look to our own home and family, friends and community, to see what we can do to make a better world for all. As Dr. King himself said, ``When we let freedom ring, when we let it ring from every village and every hamlet, from every state and every city, we will be able to speed up that day when all of God's children, Black men and White men, Jews and Gentiles, Protestants and Catholics will be able to join hands and sing in the words of that old Negro spiritual, `Free at last, Free at last, Thank God Almighty, We are free at last.' '' 
   Thousands of visitors come to our Nation's capital to see where Martin Luther King delivered the ``I Have A Dream'' speech. Unfortunately, there is not a marker or words to show where he helped change the course of our country's history. To commemorate this historic event and truly honor Dr. King, today I am introducing legislation which directs the Secretary of the Interior to insert a plaque at the exact site of the speech on the steps of the  LINCOLN Memorial. It is my hope that this marker will preserve Dr. King's legacy for generations to come. The Secretary of the Interior may accept contributions to help defray the costs of preparing and inserting the plaque on the steps. This legislation is noncontroversial and is consistent with what has been done previously at the Memorial to commemorate similar events. The bill is a Senate companion to legislation introduced by Representative ANN NORTHUP of Kentucky. I look forward to working with her on securing its enactment.

   Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I am glad the Senator from Rhode Island is here. I did not have a chance to respond to his remarks the other day on the education savings account, and we do have a fairly significant disagreement, beyond the philosophy, over some of the data. I think we are making headway on this. 
   The implication that the education savings account is a vehicle for people who drive around in limousines is inaccurate. The Joint Tax Committee has found the education savings accounts would be used 14 million times over, it would be used by 14 million families, 70 percent of whom have incomes of $75,000 or less. 
   More importantly, though, the point I want to make--and I am not going to dwell on this because I know we have our differences--is that several years ago the President and the Congress passed the higher education savings account. It was for $500. The criteria for the families who could use those accounts are the identical criteria being used for these education savings accounts. There is no difference. 
   I take some issue with the fact we in Congress and the President are applauding this wonderful account we have set up for higher education for $500, and yet on an identical scope of use for this savings account, it somehow gets into class warfare. 
   All that has happened is we have taken a $500 account we all passed and applauded and said it could be expanded to $2,000 or four times. If a family chooses to, they can use it in kindergarten through high school. The odds are the majority of them will use it just as the higher education savings account does, for college. 
   I did want to make that point. It has come up several times. 
   I am the only one who has time, but I yield a few minutes to my colleague from Rhode Island to respond.

   Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I will respond briefly because the clock is running. The demographics in parochial schools and private schools--and we studied this very closely--are within 10 percent, the same as demographics in public schools. Parochial schools, for example, in New York, have identical demographics as the public schools. Sixty percent in parochial schools make $50,000 or less. The idea that people in these parochial or private schools are somehow a class of wealth is, I believe, not correct and cannot be substantiated, No. 1. 
   No. 2, 70 percent of the families who use this education savings account are going to be in public schools; 30 percent in private. The funds the Senator from Rhode Island describes are pretty much evenly divided. I suspect because people in private schools are still paying local property taxes for public schools, they have a higher hurdle, and it does make them save more. This is a debate we can continue at another time. I appreciate the Senator's response. I give him 1 minute.

   Mr. COVERDELL. I will show the Senator the data. We all see private schools that stand out. That is what forms the image. I am saying when you look at all the private schools across the country, you come up with a lot of people who do not have many resources. 
   We will discuss this at a further time. To explain to my good friend from Nevada, I am going to talk for 5 minutes and then yield back our time. It would then be appropriate, in the queue of events, that we move to Senator BOXER. 
   Mr. President, with regard to the Kennedy amendment, which I have here, this amendment was laid down yesterday in the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee. It is the first amendment that was offered in the committee, and it is in the process of being discussed. 
   There are controversies in it. Folks on our side think, once again, it is a story of mandates and regulations and instructions to local schools about how to manage the affairs at the local level. The appropriate place for this amendment to be decided is in the committee of jurisdiction. 
   The other point I want to make, and I have made it repeatedly, is that this is about the fifth or sixth attempt by the other side to come to the Senate floor with what are very laudable ideas, but they are all constructed in a way that is either/or. If we adopt the Kennedy amendment or any one of these other five amendments we have been dealing with for the last several days, the main effect is to cancel the education savings account. 
   If we do that, we are saying to 14 million American families: Sorry, we are not going to let you create an education savings account. These happen to be the parents of 20 million children, which is almost half the school population. No deal; we are not interested in letting your families create education savings accounts that will direct money to your specific needs and, most important of all, they blow away, they open the safe and run off with $12 billion of savings that would occur with these education savings accounts for families to use for educational purposes anywhere from kindergarten through college and beyond college, frankly, if there was a disability incurred. 
   The amendment, while it may be laudable--maybe it will be adopted in committee--the way it is designed is to destroy the opportunity to empower 14 million families and parents who are raising 20 million children and their attempts to save money to help them get that job done. 
   Obviously, we will, once again, when the appropriate time for voting comes, oppose this amendment, not necessarily on its merits--the committee will decide that--but because its main purpose is to destroy the education savings account. 
   Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of our time on the Kennedy amendment. I believe the other side has chosen to go ahead with the Boxer amendment at this time. 
   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set the Kennedy amendment aside, which was envisioned in the unanimous consent request we propounded a few minutes ago.

   Mr. COVERDELL. I will keep my remarks within that same constraint. 
   Let me say that every year since the Republicans gained the majority we have worked to increase the maximum Pell grant. For more than 7 years, the Pell grant maximum fluctuated between $2,300 and $2,400. Last year, the President's budget cut the Pell grant. But we have been dedicated on this side. 
   This is about the seventh time I have lost track of an amendment that has come from the other side. They may have a laudable goal, but the underlying goal is to make moot the central premise of the legislation we are discussing, which is to allow families to set up education savings accounts. 
   If you take the amendment the way it is constructed, it obliterates the possibility to set up these education savings accounts, which means 14 million people will not set up an account who otherwise would. Of the 20 million children in school, almost half the population will not be beneficiaries of the account that otherwise would. But, more importantly, $12 billion that would be accumulated voluntarily in these accounts to help education at every level--kindergarten through college--would go away similar to snuffing out a candle. It makes no sense to do that. 
   The Senator from Wisconsin cited statistics from the Treasury Department that we can't get but the Joint Tax Committee finds incorrect, which is that 70 percent of all benefits from these savings accounts will go to families making $75,000 or less. 
   I will tell you why that is undoubtedly the correct analysis--because the people who would open these savings accounts are identical by criteria to those who can open up the college savings account the President and the Congress passed several years ago. It is identical. The same families who can use those accounts are the ones to whom these accounts would apply. I don't think the President or the Congress passed an education savings account for people driving around in black limousines. It was means tested to help the middle class or less, and the identical means testing applies to this amendment that this amendment would obviate. 
   I yield the floor. I believe the next order of business is Senator FEINSTEIN.

   Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, earlier in the day, the Senator from California sent an amendment to the desk dealing with, I will say in shorthand, guns, but more particularly the shooting that occurred earlier this week in Michigan for which we are all deeply grievous. 
   I have offered a substitute that I think embraces the spirit of the amendment of the Senator from California. Earlier in the day she indicated she might vote for this one as well. I guess we will see. 
   The main differences are three. It is a little broader in scope. It acknowledges the problem of weapons in schools. It deals with drugs and culture, as well. It does not point the finger at the Congress or impugn in any way what the motives are of various people who have strong beliefs with regard to issues relating to guns. 
   It does not set an artificial deadline which is in the amendment that was offered by the Senator from California. The spirit of the amendment is very similar. I think it will receive very broad support. As I said, the amendment does not set an arbitrary date. It does not point the finger at anybody's motives. Also, it is broader. 
   It is an amendment that appreciates what is happening here. It involves many aspects of our lives. Witness the situation in Michigan, where we are now reading about the environment in which this child lived who is alleged to have perpetrated the crime that occurred. As Senator KERRY of Massachusetts said a little earlier, it is kind of hard to believe how that child was living. 
   That is the scope of the Coverdell amendment. 
   Mr. President, if there is any time remaining of my 5 minutes, I yield it back. 
   Mrs. BOXER addressed the Chair.

   Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I believe we are on Bingaman amendment No. 2875. He has already used his minute. Senator KENNEDY did. 
   I reiterate that earlier today, I had a chart showing what the Republican majority has done for Pell grants, and it is straight up. 
   The second thing I want to point out is this is the fifth time the other side of the aisle has tried to make moot the underlying premise of this bill we have been debating now for 2 weeks, the education savings account. It blows away 14 million families, it blows away 20 million children, and it blows away $12 billion that would be volunteered to help education in every quadrant, from kindergarten to college. As with all these other amendments, its objective is to destroy the education savings account for millions of American families. I rise in opposition to the amendment.

   Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, the pending amendment No. 2875 offered by the Senator from New Mexico and, I believe, the Senator from Massachusetts increases mandatory spending by $1.2 billion.

Therefore, I raise a point of order against the amendment pursuant to section 302(f) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974.

   Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I commend the Senator from Michigan for his amendment and his work on the New Millennium Classrooms Act. I joined him several months ago at a press conference where he announced his intentions. I think it is among the  more well-intended, helpful measures to deal with the reform and change we are all seeking in education across America. 
   There is a real need to bring more computers into our classrooms which is, of course, what the amendment is designed to do. 
   Sixty percent of all jobs will require high-tech computer skills. Yet 32 percent of our public schools have only one classroom with access to the Internet. It is almost an incongruity, when you read every day about what is happening on the Internet and where we have gotten in terms of access. It really does point to the digital divide we all speak of these days. 
   The change is occurring so quickly, and the large public educational system is not accustomed to it. In fact, many of us are not accustomed to it. But legislation such as that offered by the Senator from Michigan accelerates the ability of public education to stay up with high tech. 
   The Department of Education recommends that there be at least one computer for every five students. Yet according to the Educational Testing Service, on average, there is only one multimedia computer for every 24 students. 
   Since the passage of the 21st Century Classrooms Act of 1997, there has not been a significant increase in computer donations due to restrictions on the age of the donated equipment and the limitations on donor qualifications. 
   According to the Detwiler Foundation, a California-based nonprofit organization dedicated to providing schools nationwide with quality computers donated by individuals and industry, there are very few Pentium computers donated to schools through their organization. This number has not increased since the passage of the 21st Century Classrooms Act of 1997. Of those computers donated, even fewer qualified for the deduction because of the restrictions. 
   According to the Detwiler Foundation, if even just 10 percent of retired computers each year were donated to schools, we would easily achieve the Department of Education's recommendation of only five students for every one computer. The current deduction is not enough to offset the costs of the donation. 
   Without the addition of the tax credit, the high costs associated with the transport and installation of the computer equipment cancel out the current tax benefit. 
   The new millennium classrooms amendment addresses these restrictions without unduly increasing Federal Government expenditures or creating yet another Federal program or department. It encourages private investment and involvement and keeps control with the teachers, the parents, and the students. At a time when the Government is planning to spend $1.2 billion to wire schools and libraries to the Internet, the demand for this sophisticated equipment and technology will be greater than ever. 
   This amendment increases the age limit for eligible computers from 2 to 3 years; will allow computer manufacturers to donate equipment returned to them through trade-in and leasing programs; allows a 30-percent tax credit for qualified computer donations; allows a 50-percent tax credit for qualified computer donations to schools located within empowerment zones, enterprise communities and Indian reservations; requires that the donated computer must include an operating system. 
   Increasing the amount of the tax credits for donations made to schools in economically distressed areas will increase the availability of computers to the children who need it most. Educational Testing Service statistics show that schools with 81 percent or more economically disadvantaged students have only one multimedia computer for every 32 students, while a school with 20 percent or fewer economically disadvantaged students will have a multimedia computer for every 22 students. Again, the divide is a most dangerous thing for us to contemplate in education in America. 
   Public schools with a high minority enrollment had a smaller percentage of instructional rooms with Internet access than public schools with a low minority enrollment. 
   This bill is not another targeted tax break. Broad-based tax relief and reform efforts should work to lower tax rates across the board while continuing to retain and improve upon the core tax incentives for education, home ownership, and charitable contributions. The new millennium classrooms amendment expands the parameters and, thus, the effectiveness of an already existing education and charity tax incentive, one which will effectively bring top-of-the-line technology into all of our schools. 
   The 21st Century Classrooms Act tax deduction expires this year. It is imperative we act now to ensure that all our children have access to quality computer technology. 
   Again, I commend the Senator from Michigan and his cosponsors. This is, indeed, a most appropriate piece of legislation that will do great good in our education system. 
   I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.

<TEXT>
   Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I want to speak briefly to the Bingaman amendment. 
   First, I associate myself with the remarks of the Senator from Delaware. The Senator talked about the train that could and the train that will, but it will not if we adopt the Bingaman amendment because the Bingaman amendment neuters, makes moot, the education IRA, the education savings account. He takes the funding that is in the bill that is before us and shifts it to the Department of Education. It may be a rational goal or not; that can be debated. The bottom line is that everything Senator ROTH of Delaware has just spoken to would be moot. All the advantages, the accumulation of funds that will allow families to more effectively deal with college costs or educational costs in general will disappear, end, be over, no train. 
   This is about the third attempt from the other side to bring ``an apple pie goal'' and use it as a tactic to defund educational savings accounts. 
   With regard to the Bingaman amendment and its issues of accountability, of course those are rightfully being discussed in the Elementary and Secondary Education Act which is in committee. It is being jump-started in a  very confrontational way in that the very essence of everything we have been talking about for the better part of 2 weeks would be moot if we allowed the funding that allows the creation of family education savings accounts to be shifted over to the Department of Education and all that bureaucratic morass in the name of a good goal. 
   Certainly, accountability is something for which we all strive. I do think we ought to remember that accountability 
   in schools is primarily the responsibility of the State governments. Currently, of all the education funds available in America, some 13 percent are now provided by the Federal Government. 
   What is interesting is about 50 to 60 percent of the administrative overhead and regulations and those things that bog down principals and superintendents and teachers is a Federal mandate. We send off a check for 13 percent, but we demand about a 50-percent overhead on what all those local schools have to do. 
   We will be voting a little bit later on the Robb amendment which, of course, does the same thing. It creates a national school construction program, and if my colleagues read through the amendment, they will see it is going to take a building of lawyers to understand all the requirements and mandates. 
   I wanted to make the point that on the Bingaman amendment and, for that matter, the Robb amendment, both have the effect of defunding and making impossible the creation of the education savings account. 
   I will take a few more minutes to remind everybody that by Government predictions and estimates, the education savings account we are proposing will affect 14 million American families who are educating 20 million children. Because they are setting up this education savings account, they will invest--these are the American families--$12 billion over the next 10 years to be used to help their children for educational purposes. 
   So every time we confront one of these amendments that removes the funding to establish the education savings account, we are not only throwing the idea away, but we are throwing away $12 billion of volunteered money that would come from these 14 million families for their children. It will be one of the largest infusions of resources we have seen in public-private education in many years, and the Federal Government is not having to raise taxes to do it. They are not having to appropriate money to do it. We are simply saying we will allow the interest that will build up in these education savings accounts not to be taxed. 
   Over a 10-year period, it is a reasonably small number of tax revenue that is forfeited, and it makes the American public do massive things. Imagine saving $12 billion for the aid of kids who are trying to get through school and college. 
   I wanted to make it clear that these amendments, under these ``apple pie'' titles have the effect of closing down the idea that we will be opening an education savings account. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.

I further ask unanimous consent that no second-degree amendments be in order to either of the three amendments prior to the votes and the time between now and 2 p.m. be equally divided for debate of all three amendments.

   Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, at the heart of my opposition to the amendment is that it strikes the education savings account, the core of the legislation that came from the Finance Committee. It is a killer amendment. 
   The amendment allocates only 70 cents of every dollar to local school districts. We have been striving to get to 95 cents of every Federal dollar. The amendment not only neuters education savings accounts but it also goes to core issues about how title I funds should be distributed to help local school districts under ESEA. 
   This is an issue being debated at the committee's markup today. Senator JEFFORDS, chairman of the committee, opposes this amendment because he believes it violates the jurisdiction of the committee. 
   I move to table the amendment and I ask for the yeas and nays.

   Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, it is not a precise science we are dealing with here, but it is contemplated that we will move from the Senator's amendment to an amendment by Senator HUTCHISON of Texas, to an amendment by Senator MURRAY of Washington, and perhaps one other which is being discussed from Senator ROTH, which is a managers' amendment. Then all those would be voted on back to back. My guess is, if that is the general plan and it occurs that way--as the Senator knows, 
   these things are sometimes subject to some modification--I think that is a pretty good description of what is likely to happen and that would probably happen around 5:30 or 6 o'clock. It is contemplated the Senator wants a vote on his amendment. It will be in that stacked series of votes.

<TEXT>
   Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, while we are waiting for the Senator from Washington to present her amendment, I thought I would take a couple of minutes to talk about a certain section of this longstanding debate. 
   The day before yesterday, the discussion of the core policy of this piece of legislation was that we would leave and not tax the interest buildup on education savings accounts so that they would compound themselves more quickly as an incentive for people to open the accounts. We are told it will probably result in 14 million people opening an account of this nature, and it will bear the parents of 20 million children, which is a little over a third of the entire population of children attending kindergarten through high school. 
   So the reach of the legislation we are debating and amending is very large. But in the discussion, Senator KERRY of Massachusetts referred to the fact that when you leave, you don't collect a tax. In his mind, that is an expenditure; we didn't appropriate it necessarily, but by not collecting that revenue we, in a sense, are appropriating money. 
   I find that a flawed theory. Under that context, every dime we do not take from a working family or an individual belongs to the Government, and only by the grace of the Government have we allowed it to stay in the family's checking account. 
   I won't say that is a convoluted theory, but it is certainly foreign, I believe, to the genesis of American liberty which envisioned the proceeds of the wages that are earned by families and individuals in our country as belonging to them--the people who earned it. Thomas Jefferson warned us of Government's propensity to take too much from the laborer who produced the wealth or the income. 
   So I thought I would take a minute or two to say that this Senator is among those who believe the wealth, the income, the paycheck belongs to the person who earned it, and Government should only, by the most urgent necessity, tax and remove that resource and thereby lessen the ability of that family or that individual to pursue their dreams and care for their family and its vision. 
   This theory, which essentially is the view that everything that everybody produces belongs to us up here in Washington unless we just happen to gracefully leave it in the family's checking account, is not a healthy idea. And it has come up two or three times in the debate over these education savings accounts.

<DOCNO>106-coverdell-ga-23-20000301</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. COVERDELL. I rise in opposition to the amendment. I wish to make several points. The first point is the Senator from Washington characterizes the education savings account as something that would only benefit a handful of people who are wealthy. I believe that is pretty close to what she said. 
   According to the Joint Tax Committee, 70 percent of those who would utilize the education savings account make $75,000 or less. This is not something for anybody driving around in a black limousine. It is wrong to characterize it otherwise. 
   The second point: the criteria for these educational savings accounts are identical to the President's criteria for the higher education savings account. The same folks who use these savings accounts are the ones who were applauded by that side of the aisle when they created a higher education savings account. There is no difference. Every ``t'' is crossed and every ``i'' is dotted exactly the way it was done on the other side of the aisle. We cannot have it both ways. If they are not rich over here, they are not rich over here. The point is, the vast majority of accounts are utilized by middle-class folks and low-income people. 
   No. 2, this is the fourth attempt from the other side of the aisle to gut the creation of the education savings account. Who do they leave behind? The 14 million American families, 20 million American children who would save on their own $12 billion that would go to help education. By simply cutting out the funds as the amendment of the Senator does, $1.2 billion, she robs the Nation of $12 billion in resources that would come freely from families investing in these accounts utilizing their own money. It is bad economic policy to leave $12 billion sitting on the table. 
   The Senator in her amendment strikes the provision that allows 1 million students in college to receive prepaid tuition in the 43 States that do that, including her State, from their prepaid tuition being taxed when they get it. We are trying to leave the resource there so it can be used for the  college education. The amendment guts it. 
   Last, the proponents of the amendment, as is so often the case, say we will do something for you. But read the language under ``use of the funds.'' They are mandatory uses. It is a long series. If you want to play ball with the Federal Government, you have to hopscotch through every hurdle, every loophole, every this, every that, page after page, reports, qualifications--mandatory. 
   It is reinforcement of the entire concept of oversight by the big principal in Washington. That is not what America wants. It wants its schools governed at home. 
   Time is limited; we have 5 minutes remaining in our time. I see Senator GREGG of New Hampshire, and I yield the remainder of our time to Senator GREGG of New Hampshire.

   Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, today the Senate will immediately resume consideration of the education savings accounts legislation. The pending amendment is the Collins amendment regarding tax deductibility of teacher development supplies. It is expected that the Collins amendment will be laid aside so that other amendments may be offered and debated. Therefore, Senators may anticipate votes throughout today's session of the Senate. As previously mentioned, Senators who have amendments should work with the bill managers on a time to offer those amendments. As a reminder, the Senate will recess from 12:30 to 2:15 p.m. so that the weekly party conferences may meet. 
   I thank my colleagues for their attention.

   Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I see Senator KENNEDY from Massachusetts. I wish to respond for a moment or two to the comments of Senator REID. Then I think in the comity of events it would come to the Senator from Massachusetts. 
   Senator REID's statements dealt with a panoply of issues related to education but not necessarily to the amendment he just submitted for Senator DODD. In a word, the amendment offered by Senator DODD basically removes the education savings accounts provision. It would make that moot. 
   It is premised on the statement we have all heard many times that special education which was passed in the mid-1970s was supposed to have been funded in part by the Federal Government, in part by the State governments, and in part by the local governments. But the Federal Government never fulfilled its promise. 
   Interestingly enough, the Democrats were in the majority until 5 years ago. For the entire time they were there when it became law and was the agreement, they consistently ignored it. 
   Since a Republican majority has come to the Senate, under the leadership of a number of Members on our side--but particularly I will mention today Senator GREGG of New Hampshire--there has been a consistent attempt on our side to fund this special education funding. I will give you an example. 
   In fiscal year 1997, the President--that is their view--requested $2.6 billion for this need that the Senator from Nevada has been describing, but we increased that to $3.1 billion or almost a new $1 billion to put into special education. In the next year, the President offered a budget of $3.2 billion, but we passed, at the prodding of the Senator from New Hampshire, $3.8 billion or $700 million more. 
   In fiscal 1999, the President asked for $3.8 billion, but we answered with $4.3 billion, another half billion dollars for special education. In the fiscal year 2000 budget, the President asked for $4.3 billion, but we made it $4.9 billion. 
   The point is that on our side we have consistently been trying to improve this account for special education. That was ignored for almost 35 years on the other side. 
   I have to be a little suspicious of an amendment that suddenly wraps itself around the interest of special education when they couldn't do it for some 35 years previously. It actually took a new majority to start fulfilling their pledge for special education. 
   As I said, the effect of the amendment would be to make moot the education savings accounts. This issue came up last week in a discussion between myself and Senator WELLSTONE of Minnesota. This $1.2 billion or $1.3 billion that we are talking about being invested in education savings accounts will produce $12 billion in savings and investments in education. It is a classic situation. If we take the $1.3 billion and commit it to that which is recommended by Senator DODD, it will be worth $1.3 billion, and we will forfeit the value of the savings buildup that can go to do all the things about which the Senator from Nevada talked. It allows a family to purchase computers. It allows families to hire tutors. It allows families to aid and abet and assist their children who need or have special  education requirements. The effect of this amendment would be to forfeit and give up the accumulation of $12 billion in new resources and new assets. 
   That seems to me to be pretty shortsighted. Why would we forfeit one of the largest infusions of resources--I might add one of the smartest infusions of resources--coming from the families themselves? We are not having to raise taxes to do it. No State, nor Governor, nor local school district is having to do it. People are doing it on their own. They are producing smart, intelligent dollars because those dollars will be invested precisely on the need of the students. 
   At the appropriate time, of course, I will urge our colleagues on a bipartisan basis to defeat this amendment because the effect of it is designed to make moot the education savings accounts. 
   That is the ultimate goal of this amendment. 
   As I said, when you look at the history of the failure to deal with special education, I think the Senator from New Hampshire referred to this effort as somewhat hollow in that year after year, no attention was paid to the special accounts. Suddenly, we will use it as a weapon against an education savings account, which would choke out, as I said, $12 billion in new resources. I am all for and will support in next year's budget additional funding for IDEA but not at the expense of forfeiting a voluntarily accumulated $12 billion that will come to the aid of public, private, and home schooling education all across the country. 
   I might add, the legislation we are debating deals with school construction. It does it in the appropriate way because it allows the decisionmaking to occur at the local area. The Senator from Nevada goes to great extent to suggest their plans will not interrupt or in any way constrain local school decisions. But the fact of the matter is, in the last 30 years quite the opposite has occurred. Most of our Federal programs have led to enormous constraints and mandates on local school districts. The education savings account goes in a completely different direction. It empowers parents and students and employers. It has no mandates. 
   So I remind everybody the legislation deals with education savings accounts empowering parents to help their children. It empowers employers to have programs of continuing education. It helps students who are in State-prepaid tuition plans so those resources are not lost to the tax collector. It contributes to allowing more flexibility so local school districts can be involved in school construction--this idea coming from Senator GRAHAM of Florida, from the other side of the aisle. 
   With that, I will yield the floor.

   Mr. COVERDELL. I am pleased the Senator asked the question. I do not know where he is getting the data. Let me respond in this way. The means test is identical to the one both the President and the Congress used for the higher education IRA. There is no difference. We all celebrated that IRA account. You can save up to $500 a year for your college education. All this says is it should be larger, $2,000, and it should be available for K-12. But there is no difference in the means testing. 
   The data I have seen over and over suggested over 70 percent of all these savings, or the use of the savings accounts, would go to families earning $75,000 or less. So if there is a pox on this means test, then there is the same one on an account which we have all been applauding for the last 2 or 3 years.

   Mr. COVERDELL. Maybe it is just a disagreement between the two of us about what constitutes wealth. I do not consider 
   families, middle-income, earning $75,000 or less, as wealthy people. Maybe the Senator from Illinois or some other analysis does, but I do not. I think this is the backbone of the country. They are the people who bear the largest burden of the Tax Code. They are having a hard time. Their income tax is at the highest level since World War II. It is so high now that with the disposable income available to them, to do the things we expect them to do about raising their families, they cannot do any more. 
   So we may just have a disagreement over who is considered wealthy.

   Mr. COVERDELL. Yes. So two-thirds plus of this, in my judgment--we can disagree--is going exactly where we want it to go. 
   If I might add one other point, unlike the IRA we have already passed, and unlike any other IRA, this account allows sponsors. We do not know the data on that. It is a benefit to even the lower income. It allows parents, families, unions, benevolent associations, and employers to help open these accounts. From what I have seen of people trying to utilize new tools and resources, it is the struggling families who are most likely to use these accounts.

   Let me say, there is apparently some disagreement about the flow of the funds. Joint Tax states 70 percent of all benefits goes to families of $75,000 or less. Again, I repeat the means test is no different than the one that was established by the President and the Congress on the previous smaller savings accounts that we have implemented and, as I said, applauded. 
   I do appreciate the question from the Senator from Illinois and his interest, which I think is probably shared by all of us one way or the other, in making a very positive education environment for all in the United States. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, while the other side is preparing further remarks about their amendment, I want to make it very clear that the amendment offered by the Senator from Connecticut would, one, make moot the principal core of this legislation, the education savings account. 
   It just wipes it out. No. 2, I wish to make the point that he is making moot an issue that has received extensive bipartisan support in the Senate. 
   The principal coauthor of the education savings accounts is Senator TORRICELLI of New Jersey. When this  was last voted on before the Senate, it received 59, 60 votes--again, a very bipartisan expression in support of the education savings accounts. I want to make it clear that this amendment would have the effect of destroying a core bipartisan component. 
   The second point I wish to make is that the Senator from Connecticut argues the money used to create this educational IRA should be used to enhance the funding of special education. Special education, he rightfully points out, is important and represents an unfunded mandate of some 25 years. 
   I find it interesting that for 25 years the other side of the aisle found it acceptable to ignore the Federal responsibilities for special education, and now with a new majority, we on our side of the aisle have doubled funding for IDEA. We have an attempt to empower parents and local communities to deal with educational requirements for children, and we now find this amendment and the great need on the other side of the aisle to deal with IDEA. There is an incongruity of letting it sit there for so many years without paying attention to it and now all of a sudden it is important.

<TEXT>
   Mr. COVERDELL. I will in a moment. 
   No. 3, let me say to the Senator from Connecticut, first of all, I agree with the attempts to fund special education for all the reasons the Senator enumerates. But I do not find them mutually exclusive. I do not think we have to take this bipartisan education savings account legislation and throw it in the trash heap to do this. 
   We have increased funding over the President's proposals for special education 5 years in a row. I think we will do so again. I think this Congress will respond to the goals the Senator has enumerated and to the letter the Senator has showed us from the Governors who, indeed, think this pledge that was made a long time ago and ignored for an awfully long time should be fulfilled. So we agree on that premise. But I do not think you have to make this moot in order to do it. 
   The last thing I would say--and it is the Senator's amendment, so I want him to be able to conclude his debate--is that we disagree on the nature of the policy. The Senator's side of the aisle, those who do not support it--not those who do--somewhat attempts to minimize the significance of it. 
   I take some issue with that because we are all down here playing the laudatory band for the fact we passed an IRA for higher education that had parameters identical to the means test that applies here, but its value is only one-fourth what the value of this proposal is. I do not think you can make this an insignificant advantage to people on the one hand but say this education savings account was a great accomplishment on the other. 
   Frankly, I think the education savings account that we passed for $500 per year for higher education is a good thing. I supported it. I proposed it. But this is four times the value of that. 
   In conclusion, I think anything that causes American 
   citizens to save is a good thing. That piece gets left out of this debate. We are going to forgive $1.2 or $3 billion over 5 years. Actually, I say to the Senator, for 10 years it is about $2.4 billion. As a result of that, Americans are going to save $12 billion. All of it is going to go to education--half of it to public education and half of it to private education. And 70 percent of the families are going to be in public education; 30 percent of the families are going to be in private education. This is going to do good things. It is going to help families who do have special education problems. I think that is good policy. 
   I think simultaneously we are going to address the goal of the Senator and many of us who share that goal of trying to accelerate funding for IDEA. But as I said, I do not think it has to come at the expense of this idea. Senator WELLSTONE and I got into a debate after the Senator spoke the other day, and I said: There are not many Federal expenditures that provide incentives to people to create large sums of resources that come to education. If you take this $1.2 billion, as you suggest, and move it to IDEA, it is not bad that we have done it for IDEA, but you will leave $12 billion on the table. It just evaporates. I do not think there is any need to do that. 
   I think having those resources in 14 million families, for 20 million children, is of enormous good and will help those families do things that are very meaningful for their children. 
   I have gone through this rather briefly, but it is the essence of my disagreement--not with the idea of funding IDEA or special ed but that you make them mutually exclusive. 
   With that, I yield the floor so the Senator may continue explaining his amendment.

I don't know that this will make a difference in the Senator's vote, but I think it is important that her question be answered. 
   First of all, the means test--and it is means tested as to who can participate in this, and I probably wouldn't have done it that way, but that is the politics of the day--is identical to the college account we have set, which means 70 percent of the benefits flow to people making $75,000 or less. It is the middle income and below who are the primary beneficiaries of the account.

   Mr. COVERDELL. No one can certify that this is going to affect property taxes whatsoever. In fact, the doubling of IDEA, if you can find a jurisdiction that took this and lowered the property tax--I think you should listen--isn't what happened. I don't mean that we ought not to be fulfilling this obligation, but I have seen no example of the property tax being affected one way or the other as we fulfill this obligation. 
   I think what happens is, as we fulfill the Federal obligation, which is rather remarkable--here we are 25 years later and still haven't done it--it theoretically frees up local school districts to do other things that are important in education. I find it interesting. 
   The other point I was going to make to the Senator from California and to the Senator from Connecticut is they essentially inferred--and I can understand why--that the education savings account is different in a sense from the higher education and K through 12 because I think in the debate we have focused on K through 12. But there are extensive families benefitting from that. They ought to have the opportunity--the ``choice''--to use those funds if they so desire. But these accounts are a college account, too. 
   We have taken the President's proposal and the congressional proposal  and made it four times more powerful. It can be used for college. It can be used for the disabled and for dependent students following college. 
   My assumption is--we have to make some estimates--that many of these families will not use this in K through 12. Some will. But a large number of them will use the buildup where essentially it is broadening the scope of what people can do as they try to meet the very costs about which the Senator from California talks.

   Mr. COVERDELL. I would like to respond to the Senator from California by calling into play an individual for whom I know she has enormous respect, and that is the Vice President of the United States. He says:  
   Our current education IRA's simply do not meet the needs of the information age. They are limited to $500 a year.  
   He is right.  
   And it must be used by an age of 30. In a fast moving, fast changing economy, the right skills will often cost more than $500 a year and learning must last a lifetime.  
   Then Vice President GORE goes on to say:  
   Here is my idea. We need to create a new 401(j) account like the 401(k) plans that help you save for retirement. But this account will allow employers and employees to contribute up to $2,500 a year.....  
   So he is $500 over what I am saying.  
   ..... in order to pay for college or job training expenses.

   Mr. COVERDELL. Why should we do that? This is a classic example: Let's tell them what is important to them. You think it is important it only be for college. I think it ought to be up to the family to decide where and when they have a special need. Maybe they have a student who is in junior high school who suffers a very serious injury and they need assistance or they have a child who they discover has dyslexia. You do not deal with dyslexia when you are in college. You deal with it in the younger years. There are many problems associated with that. 
   So let's let them decide. I think the majority of them will utilize these funds at college. But there will be occasions where families have requirements that occur before that. I can think of no reason why we should arbitrarily 
   decide: I am sorry, that is a decision we have made for you.

   Mr. COVERDELL. I am most appreciative of the extended effort on the part of the Senator from New Jersey, who brings a very powerful perspective to this debate. 
   The Senator from Connecticut is correct that we are constantly confronted with choices. I think this is a bad example, though, or choice of that kind of trade. What I mean is, first of all, I believe IDEA will receive added benefits this year. It has received nearly $3 billion in the last 4 years over and above the President's request. So there is a body here that agrees with those Governors and with you that this is a high priority. 
   The problem with the Senator's amendment is when it moves against the savings accounts, it blows away $12 billion. There are choices. You could say, well, we will spend $1.2 billion here instead of $1.2 billion over there. But by the nature of this legislation, this savings account involves 14 million families--20 million of those 55 million you are talking about--3 million or 4 million of them are in private schools, but 11 million of these children are in public schools that will benefit from these accounts. 
   The Senator's amendment takes that resource, which comes forward as a voluntary action on the part of families and communities, churches, synagogues, labor unions, and employers and shuts it down. That is not a good trade. Trading $1.2 billion and losing $12 billion is not a good trade. There may be a place where your choice is appropriate, but I don't believe it is where you blow away all that benefit, which this does. 
   It has been characterized that private schools are the chief beneficiary, and that is not the case. Several on the floor have characterized parochial schools as a ``haven for the wealthy.'' Listen, the children attending parochial schools today are within 10 percent of the same children attending public schools, and they are from families earning $40,000 or $50,000. 
   These are not a bunch of wealthy folks. The demographics in the New York school system are virtually identical between the public system and the parochial system. So it is not like somebody who happens to be in a parochial school and drives up to school in a long, black limousine and a guy in knickers gets out. These are minorities. They are Hispanic. They are African Americans. They are average folks. I don't know why they are there. The public systems ought to be mighty glad it is there because it works both ways. The Senator is right. That system couldn't accept the public system, and it never will. Conversely, close it down and you make new problems for the public system because those people are paying property taxes even though their children are in the parochial system. 
   The point I am trying to make is that the public system will be a major benefactor. It is not a minor player. The choice the Senator is asking us to make is not $1.2 billion here or $1.2 billion there. It is $1.2 billion here or no $12 billion. Of that $12 billion, $6 billion is going to go into public schools over the next 10 years and $6 billion is going to go into private, or home, or whatever. Those are major dollars. 
   When the Senator from California and others talk about the benefit, they don't mention the principal. That is the point. That is how you get up to the $12 billion. The Senator is right. It is not a lot of relief that the Federal Government is giving. What is amazing to me is how little it takes to cause these families to do so much. 
   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator BUNNING be added as a cosponsor to the Collins amendment No. 2854.

   Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I graciously accept it. I will make a motion in 1 minute 40 seconds calling for a point of order against the amendment. The Senator from Connecticut knows that. 
   I guess it is all in the eyes of the beholder. An insignificant number of people will be beneficiaries. That insignificant number is 14 million families and 20 million children, and an individual family can expect only $20 worth of interest-free benefits. 
   But the point is, that, nevertheless, no matter what it is, if it is a quarter, it causes them to save $12 billion, whatever it is. It is $12 billion of new money flowing into both public and private education. That is not insignificant. Everett Dirksen said, ``A billion here and a billion there, and before long it is real money.'' Twelve billion dollars is real money. It would be controlled by America's families to help them with the very special and unique needs that their children have through these education savings accounts. 
   The pending amendment, No. 2857, offered by the Senator from Connecticut, Mr. DODD, increases mandatory spending by $1.2 billion, and, if adopted, would cause the underlying bill to exceed the committee's section 302(a) allocation. Therefore, I raise a point of order against the amendment pursuant to section 302(f) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974.

   Mr. COVERDELL. I thank the Senator from Idaho for his support of the legislation, his remarks, and the generous kindness he has extended to me. 
   Madam President, I think it might be of use to those listening to take just another moment to frame the totality of the legislation, a little bit about who are the sponsors of the legislation, and then to respond to some of the critiques we have heard from the other side of the aisle. I first want to make clear, this is a bipartisan legislative effort. The chief cosponsor of this legislation is Senator TORRICELLI of New Jersey.  
   When this legislation was before the Senate last, it received 59 favorable votes, Republican and Democrat. 
   The first point is this is a bipartisan bill. It has received significant passionate and dedicated support from both sides of the aisle. There is no one who has fought harder for the legislation, as I said, than Senator TORRICELLI from New Jersey. He has been rather courageous about it, candidly. 
   The second point I wish to make is to frame the nature of the overall bill. The component that gets talked about the most is the education savings account, which we know will benefit about half the elementary school population in the United States. Fourteen million families, we estimate, will open an education savings account for their children. They will be the parents of about 20 million kids. That is just under half the entire population going to kindergarten through high school. Over the next 10 years, we are saying to these 14 million families, if you put the money in your savings account, we will not tax the interest buildup. That is not a large sum of money. It is, over 5 years, about $1.3 billion. Over 10 years, it is about $2.4 billion that we would not have taxed out of these savings accounts. We would have left it in the savings accounts. 
   I have said this many times. It is amazing to me how a small incentive makes Americans do big things. By saying to these families we will not tax the interest in your account, we estimate they will save, over 10 years, $12 billion. I asked a Senator the other day in the debate on how many Federal programs can we get a 10-to-1 return? Not many. 
   We are forfeiting $2.5 billion in taxes and, in return, we are getting $12 billion voluntarily put forward to help schools all across the land. That would be one of the largest influxes of new resources behind education in the last 10 or 15 years. We have not had to appropriate anything to do it; no Governor did, no local community did. By simply saying we are not going to tax that interest, people step up to the bar. 
   As has been mentioned in the debate by several Senators, that is a very powerful component of the legislation. But it will also help 1 million employees advance their education because we are allowing the employer a tax incentive, up to $5,200 a year, that can be spent on an employee's continuing education and it would not be taxed. We are helping students who are in prepaid State tuition plans all across the country because we are not going to tax those proceeds. How many? About a million students. A million employees. This is beginning to add up to real numbers in America--14 million families. 
   On school construction, we are using the proposal of Senator GRAHAM of Florida, on the other side of the aisle, to help local communities with the problems of school construction. 
   The Senator who is now acting as our Chair talked about the health care benefits that are in the legislation 
   and the fact we are allowing, through the life of a loan, the deductibility of the interest for hundreds of thousands of students who have large debt when they get out of college. 
   The point I am making is it is a very broad policy, and it is supported strongly by Members of both parties. 
   In the debate last week, several people who have objected to the legislation did so on the grounds that it would allow a family attending a parochial school or a private school or a home school to use the proceeds of their own account to help pay for that. That is extremely puzzling to me. 
   Ninety percent of America's students are in public schools. Only 10 percent or less are in private or parochial schools. The major beneficiary of the savings accounts will be families in public schools. Seventy percent of the people who open these accounts will be helping their children who are in public schools. Thirty percent will be helping their children who are in a private, parochial, or home school. 
   The division of the money being saved is higher for those in a parochial or private school because they know they have an extra burden to bear and they will tend to save a little more. So the distribution of the $12 billion will be about equal--$6 billion to public school students and $6 billion to private and parochial school students. 
   The comment was made on the other side this past week that somehow the parents or families in parochial or private schools are wealthy and they do not deserve any incentive or public attention. Nothing could be further from the truth. 
   There is a study out from New York that the demographics of the student body of a parochial or private school are virtually identical to the demographics of the student body in the public system. In parochial schools, about 60 percent of the families make less than $40,000 a year. In private schools, 60 percent make, according to the Census Bureau, less than $50,000 a year. 
   With regard to private and parochial schools, we have parents who, for whatever reason, have decided they have to make a special effort to deal with the education of their children because, remember, all of these families are paying State taxes and local taxes for their school system. If they have decided to go to another school, they are still paying for the public school system. They have to reach down and pay another bill to get in this other system. 
   They are not wealthy. I think it was offensive to hear these families described as people driving around in a long limousine dropping Johnny off at the school. We will discuss this more during the course of the debate, but the Chair recognizes that when scholarships have been offered in Washington, DC, or in other parts of the country, the principal applicants are African Americans who are struggling to educate their children. These are not rich families. They should not be characterized as such. 
   Senator COLLINS and I had a long discussion--not a debate--about whether this is a voucher or not. As was concluded by the Senator from Maine, it is not a voucher. It will help people who have already made a decision. It will help people in public schools, but statistically insignificant is the number of people who might, because they have a savings account, change schools. I am sure it will happen, but it would be insignificant. And when it does happen, who is to say it should not? 
   In my State, there is a huge debate raging in the general 
   assembly about school accountability. Legislation that is likely to pass, which has been offered by a Democratic Governor, says schools are either making it or not, and if they are not, those children have a right to escape that school. 
   If that becomes a law in my home State, then I want this kind of tool. It is just a tool to help families deal with that situation. The first thing that comes up is, if the school is not preparing our students and it is closed, who deals with the transportation? There will be all kinds of commensurate costs that occur for the students who have to go somewhere else. This kind of tool will help them deal with that. 
   This debate is raging across the country. A little earlier, the Senator from North Dakota was complimentary of the public school system and I believe justifiably so. But the fact of life is, as the Senator from Tennessee alluded to, 40 percent of the students coming out of K-12 all across America cannot effectively read. We do have some problems. 
   This legislation will help a student, whether they are in a public setting or a private setting. Tutors and computers have been mentioned. The poor in our country are shortchanged. The President has alluded to it, and the Vice President alluded to the digital divide, they call it. This helps close the divide because it makes funds available to the family to begin to make high-tech equipment available to their kids, as well as to those in better systems. 
   I close with a reminder that there is a piece of this legislation for which the reach is almost impossible for any of our estimators to figure. This IRA account is different than others because it allows sponsors. In other words, a child can have an account opened for her or him by a grandmother, a sister, a neighbor, an employer, a benevolent association, a labor organization. There is no limit to it when this becomes law--and it will--and people begin to understand: I can help this child over here; I can help the children of my employees; we can help the children of the people who belong to this union or church. 
   I used an example in the last debate a couple of years ago about the loss of  a couple of police officers in Atlanta. I thought at the time--because everybody wants to help--if we had been able to open this account for the children of those officers, when they reached high school or junior high or college, the community easily could have provided a benefit of enormous consequences to the families of the fallen officers. I believe we will see that kind of imagination begin to take root. 
   The value of those contributions are not in any of these numbers. No one knows how many friends and neighbors and organizations and employers will begin to seize on this. I know it will be a lot because this kind of thing is in the American gut. 
   It is a tool that Americans instinctively will use. 
   I was about a third of the way through this debate last time when I remembered my father and I had opened a savings account for my two sets of twin nieces and nephews. At the time we opened it, we did not have two nickels to rub together. But we would put about $25 a month in it. If this had been the law, we would have had two to three times the amount of resources available when those children began to use it for school. As it was, it was not a lot of money. I think it probably got up to $5,000 to $8,000. But you know what. It made a difference. We did not have much money, but we found a way to put a few dollars away. A lot of other Americans will, too. 
   With this legislation, no one gets hurt. Everybody gets helped: Public, private, parochial, home, whatever. No one is being gouged. No one is paying a price at the expense of somebody else. As I mentioned a moment ago, in America it is intuitive in our nature to step forward. 
   The last thing I will say is, the dollars in these savings accounts have a--who knows?--3-to-1 value, 10-to-1 value. I do not know what it is, but these dollars are worth more than public dollars, a lot more, because they are laser-beam managed. 
   First of all, mom and dad are going to get a statement from whichever savings and loan it is to remind them every month how much money is in that account, which will also remind them of their responsibility for educating those children. It is just an automatic reminder. 
   The second thing that makes it so valuable is that no one knows the unique need of the child better than the parent or the sponsor of these accounts. 
   So this money goes right to the target, whether it is a special education need, a medical need, a tutor, a home computer, whatever. Public dollars are hard to direct that way. They build the buildings; they hire the staff; they hire the teachers, and much good is done from it, but it is hard to put them right on the dime. It reminds you of one of these missiles we saw in Kosovo--going right down the chimney. That is exactly where these dollars will go. 
   As has been said, we already have a savings account for higher education. That is good. This makes that account four times larger. In other words, higher education will benefit from this as well because many families will save for K through 12, and then they will not have to use that money. It will be there for college. But as the Chair noted, $75,000 versus $19,000 is a big difference. 
   Because there is so much trouble in K through 12, there are families who will have to use it and need it at an earlier time. If that is the case, they should have the ability to do that. It seems illogical to me to try to push away the options and requirements and needs of families, of children who are in kindergarten through high school. 
   That is where America's problem is right now. We will fix it. I am an optimist about this. I am not a pessimist. We will fix it. But remember, every day we wait on this we leave someone else behind. In my view, in this land of freedom, any child who is denied the fundamental skills of an education means there is one more among us who is not truly free and cannot enjoy the benefits of citizenship in the United 
   States. There is no higher work for us than to keep that from happening every time we can. 
   Madam President, with that, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. COVERDELL. Madam President, for the information of all Senators, tomorrow the Senate will resume consideration of the education savings account legislation. It is expected that a special education amendment may be offered tomorrow morning. Other amendments are expected to be offered and debated during tomorrow's session, with votes occurring throughout the day. Due to the pending agreement, the cloture vote for tomorrow has been vitiated. It is hoped that the education savings account bill can be completed by midweek, and therefore Senators are encouraged to work with the bill managers to offer their amendments in a timely manner.

   Mr. COVERDELL. I thank the Chair. 
   The good Senator from Massachusetts and I find ourselves, once again, in a prolonged discussion about tax policy that affects education. I have several comments to make with regard to that. Before I outline the reach of the legislation, I will respond to several remarks made by the Senator from Massachusetts. 
   First, the Senator from Massachusetts indicated that the President's budget had $4.5 billion in new funding for education and that we are debating something that is worth some $200 million over 5 years. My data does not match his. Actually, in 5 years this legislation would use tax policy to relieve taxpayers, whether they are parents or employers or people who are in a State tuition program. It would be $4.3 billion in the first 5 years and almost $8 billion over 10 years. 
   They really are apples and oranges. What we are debating is the relief of tax policy on top of what will ultimately become an increase in the education budget. In fact, if you are going to do it that way, you have to add these figures to what the President and the Congress ultimately decide is going to be the increase in the education budget, remembering that last year the Congress' increase in education was greater than the President's. 
   It is not accurate to refer to one section of the bill we are debating. You have to refer to the entire section, A. And, B, they are not comparable figures. One is a discussion about how much of an increase you will have in the President's or the congressional budget for education, in addition to  which, this is a proposal to significantly leave tax dollars in the hands of parents, employers, and students to help them pay for education, in addition to whatever the Federal Government is contributing. 
   That is a major disparity in our presentation of the numbers. 
   This is the third time, in essence, we have debated this. We hear this number, that this is only worth $7 to a family. When you leave it there, you distort the picture. Remember, the Senator from Massachusetts complimented the administration and the Congress, and I do as well, for the fact that we have already passed a $500-per-year savings account for higher education. This one section of this bill takes that proposal from $500 per year to $2,000, and it is for higher education or elementary education. 
   My question to the Senator is this: Under that logic, if this proposal is only worth $7 per family, then the President's proposal is only worth about $2.25 because what he and we have done so far is only one-quarter of what we are proposing to do here. If it is insignificant, why are we so tangled about it?

   Mr. COVERDELL. I appreciate that. I think we are getting close to a common line. My point was that the legislation we are debating has a value of $4.3 billion. It is apart from the President's proposed budget or what the Congress is going to do. This is in addition to whatever the Congress and the President decide, A. And, B, I don't think it is plausible to attack a $2,000-a-year savings account because of the $7 figure, with which I take some exception. If you want to use it, that means what we have done is only worth $2.25 under the President's proposal, which is only $500 per year. 
   The Senator from Massachusetts alluded in his remarks to a partisan debate. This is not a partisan debate on the proposal from the Finance Committee. It was passed out with Republican and Democrat Members. The principal cosponsor of the legislation is Senator ROBERT TORRICELLI from New Jersey, 
   the principal cosponsor and a member of the Democratic Party in good standing. In addition, there are some 8 to 10 other Democrats who are on that side of the aisle in the Senate and are very supportive of this legislation. 
   I was pleased by the Senator's remarks when he said the President has become interested in K through 12 because I really believe that is where the crisis in American education is. I am glad we are now talking about the same target. The crisis is not in higher education; it is K through 12. It is, in fact, the 30 and 40 percent of our students who are coming out of high school and are not effective readers and can't write well. 
   The Senator from Massachusetts referred to polling data and listed some seven items that this particular poll enumerated as important. At one point, he said parents are not supportive of this. But in his own poll, the sixth or seventh most important desire on the part of parents was this. 
   Many of the items in the poll that he cites are not in the jurisdiction of the Federal Government. We can debate that, and we have been debating that, for some time. Some of us would find some of those proposals not in our purview; but tax policy is and that was No. 6. 
   I might also add that if you go down the list of items included in the bill that are helping employers deal with continuing education, to which the Senator alluded, this is a very high item in the poll--school construction is a high item in the poll. 
   In other words, the items that are in this proposal react just as the Senator would have them to his poll. So I thought it was important there be some clarification of these points that were alluded to early on. Anybody watching this discussion needs to know that, in fact, this proposal augments the budgetary process. 
   Now, let's talk about the proposal in general. What does it do? I have always been stunned by how little incentive it takes to cause Americans to do huge things. The Senator is correct when he says the savings account is not a particularly large form of tax relief. It is not. It is about $1.2 billion over 5 years. Over 10 years, it is $2.4 billion. 
   What happens is, because we say you can open a savings account and we, the Federal Government, are not going to sock it to you by taxing the interest on the account, we are going to help you make a contribution to the work you do to educate your children--get these numbers--14 million American families will open this kind of account. They are the parents of 20 million children. That is almost half the elementary school population who will become involved in this concept. Their parents, and others, will save $12 billion over the next 10 years. 
   So in addition to all this funding the Senator from Massachusetts is talking about, we are putting into the education arena $12 billion more, and we didn't have to raise taxes one dime to do it, and the State didn't and the local communities didn't. This is voluntary. This is money given to education by loving parents. 
   In my judgment, the $12 billion is worth three to five times the money the Senator from Massachusetts is talking about. Why? Public education money, we all know, is spread across a wide arena. A lot of it never sees a classroom. It doesn't know the name of a single student. It cannot get targeted to particular problems. 
   If we pass this legislation, 14 million families will have an account and once a month some saving institution is going to send a notice to those parents that this is how much money they have in their account for Johnny or Jane. That almost beats the PTA because every month this family is being reminded of this resource it is collecting for its children. 
   Now, I call these smart dollars. Why? Because it is like a laser beam; this money will be invested directly on the child and directly on the most pressing need the child has. You talk about the digital divide--families who have these accounts can close them; they can buy home computers; they can hire a tutor; they can deal with a special ed problem, a health problem, a transportation problem, or whatever it is the child specifically needs. This $12 billion--and I think it would be more--goes right to the target. 
   These IRA accounts are entirely unique in one special way. Anybody can deposit money into the account--the parents, of course, or it could be the grandmother, sister, aunt, or it could be a next-door neighbor or a church; it could be a labor union; it could be a company. No one has even begun to calculate what ideas will emerge to build up these accounts. One can easily see an employer matching his employees and encouraging them to open these kinds of accounts. 
   There is virtually zero downside to the accounts. Every segment of education in America will be a winner--  public education, private education, home schooling, you name it. These accounts will all infuse new resources for which the Federal Government will not have to appropriate a dime to get the job done: Fourteen million families, 20 million children, a resource that is available to them from kindergarten through college, and thereafter if disabled. Public education wins. Private, home schooling, and every form of education wins. To me, it is mind-boggling that anybody would challenge the concept. 
   The bill does more, as I was explaining to the Senator from Massachusetts. In States that have advanced tuition programs available, those proceeds to students will no longer be taxed. I might add that this suggestion came from the Democrat side of the aisle--a good idea. 
   It will help encourage States to have State tuition plans, and it will encourage families to get in them because they don't eat it up in taxes when they use them to go to college. It is estimated that 1 million college students will benefit from that plan. 
   Everybody knows today that education is no longer a box--you finish high school, you finish college, and that is it. In today's rapidly changing world, it is an ongoing process. 
   The legislation--which I think I heard the Senator from Massachusetts say the President agrees with--extends employer tax exemptions when they spend money to train employees on advanced education, and even on undergraduate and graduate education. It is worth $5,200 a year. It is estimated--I think this figure is low--that 1 million American employees will benefit from this legislation. It relieves students of taxes on the interest of their student loans. Through the work of Senator GRAHAM of Florida, it makes it easier for local governments to build new schools. It is a very important part of the legislation. 
   Again, if you take the list of the Senator from Massachusetts of what parents think is important, this legislation refers to almost every one of those arenas, and in the proper Federal way where we manage tax policy. We should make that policy more friendly to people dealing with education. It is not necessarily the Federal Government's role to decide exactly how we are going to build a school in my home State of Georgia. 
   The Senator from Minnesota is waiting. I will finish in a couple of minutes so he may speak. I may speak some more afterwards. 
   I want to relate that since we first debated this proposal and passed it in the Senate with 59 Senate votes--it would probably be higher today--a lot has been happening in America. The debate over the failure of kindergarten through high school is charging through the country. 
   In my State, the Governor is a Democrat. He is fighting for an education revamp right now in the Georgia Legislature. It includes offering tenure. He is proposing for schools proven to certifiably fail that parents have a right to leave those schools. What better tool to help a family deal with that predicament if it comes about--and it will. We will have schools in a State that cannot cut it. And he is not going to force people to go to those kinds of schools. 
   The most unconscionable policy in America is forcing families and children to go to schools that we know are failing. This legislation helps those families deal with that kind of problem, which is why, when you ask parents if they want to do this or not, it gets between 60 and 70 percent approval. They understand that it is an opportunity, a voluntary opportunity--something important in America's government today--to help themselves, to help their families, to help their children. It allows everybody else in the country to help some kid somewhere --one of your employee's children, one of your union member's children, your benevolent association's children, or a police officer who goes down. A community could open this up and have $70,000 sitting there when that kid wants to go to school. Think about it. 
   The Senator wonders why we are debating this. It affects half the population in elementary schools in the United States as it relates to tax policy. That is why. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor. I think under a previous unanimous consent the floor will go to the Senator from Minnesota.

   Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I will only take a minute to respond to the good Senator from New York. 
   The point is, the legislation had come out of the Finance Committee. No one is suggesting this is the only education debate. This bill is ready. This bill has been voted on by the Senate before; 59 Senators have already supported this. This is vetted. 
   Some of the issues the Senator alluded to certainly are not vetted; for example, the Federal Government taking on local teacher salaries. The good Senator from New York knows that will be highly controversial. 
   This is ready. There is not an ulterior motive. The education bill has not come out of the education committee; both Republicans and Democrats are still trying to reach a consensus. I understand the desire to move to other issues, but I do not see that as making this an inappropriate discussion for the Senate. 
   I might add that the neighbor of the Senator, Senator ROBERT TORRICELLI, is the principal cosponsor. 
   I have enjoyed, as well, working with the Senator from New York.

   Mr. COVERDELL. I point out two things. The scope of the families who are eligible for the account is identical to the President's criteria for who is eligible for the account. That is one quarter the size we have already passed. If there is no difference, it is identical to the criteria of the President. 
   Somewhere along the line, we all have to determine what the criteria are, so it is means tested. I frankly have some resistance to that, but we have accepted it. 
   No. 2, the account allows other parties to contribute. The community described by the Senator is in all of our States. Certainly we have a large community such as that in Georgia, but an inner-city church, a labor organization, an employer, other family members, can make these accounts real. 
   And last, from the very communities the Senator is talking about are the loudest voices for Congress to do this.

   Mr. COVERDELL. I am convinced we have a pretty strong disagreement. The Senator has made that point. But being a persistent individual, let's go back to the point the Senator made about the savings account, which is only one part of this bill. Then he alluded to the amount of money that would not be collected. I signaled to him that it is about $1.2 billion over 5 years. The Senator from Minnesota said he thought that could be put to a better use: We collect the money from the people, bring it here, and put it to another use. 
   My question is this: How many Federal dollars can you think of that we leverage to a 10-to-1 value? My point is this: For that amount of uncollected revenue, we cause 14 million families with 20 million kids--it is about half the population in elementary school--on their own, with their own dollars to augment that, and you end up with $12 billion. 
   If we could do that with every dollar we have, we would not be in a debate about any of these things. We could do any and everything. It is very unique in that we get it back over 10 times. 
   I do not think you can call this a voucher. This is not--and I will stop here and let the Senator respond--a voucher. It is simply if a person is in a private school, they can have a savings account. If they are in a public school, they can have a savings account. It is their money; it is not public money, and it is being used by them to decide how they might best help their child. 
   I yield to the Senator from Minnesota.

   Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, as always, I enjoy the opportunity to share thoughts with the good Senator from Minnesota. I understand the dilemma he is in. It seems to happen to all of us all the time. I hope the good Ambassador will understand his responsibilities in this Chamber. 
   Even though the Senator from Minnesota has to leave, I am going to spend a few minutes responding to the remarks of the Senator from Minnesota. I see we have been joined by the Senator from Rhode Island, I assume, to speak on the legislation. 
   I want to go back to the point about not collecting--it is actually about $2.4 billion over 10 years. We say: OK, we are going to leave that in the checking accounts of the families who will open a savings account in support of their children's education, and we will not tax the interest. That is all this proposal does. 
   As I said earlier, it is amazing to me what little incentive it takes to cause Americans to do great big things. When we do that, the parents of 20 million children are going to open up 14 million accounts, and they are going to save $12 billion, and I think it will be much more. 
   So all of us who are interested in education will have had a role in infusing into every form of education--public, private, home; whatever--billions of new dollars that go right to a child's most specific need. Because there is no one who can guide or understand that need more clearly than their parents, these dollars are worth far more than some broad-based public education program. 
   The second point I make with regard to the Senator from Minnesota is that he talks about programs and responsibilities that are clearly not Federal. Education in the United States is governed by, and will continue to be governed by, the States. That is why last year we passed the Education Flexibility Act, which was called for by every Governor--every Republican Governor, every Democrat Governor--to give them more flexibility. They said: Don't tell us in the States what we need to set as our priorities; we will do that. They are not interested in the Senators from Minnesota or Massachusetts or Georgia saying: This is what your priority is. They want to determine that themselves. 
   The Senator from Massachusetts was citing different polling data, but one figure he did not mention that I will be glad to supply him with is: Do you want the Federal Government to manage local schools? The answer is a resounding no. 
   What we are doing is augmenting, empowering parents and their local communities to do the things they perceive are important for their child or their school system. 
   The Senator from Minnesota referred to school construction, but the proposal of the Senator from Florida, Mr. GRAHAM, is in the bill we are discussing, which aids local communities in school construction. 
   Virtually everything I have heard the other side of the aisle talk about, in one way or another, is being assisted by the various components of the bill. We are helping in continuing education. We are helping in school construction. We are helping students have personal computers. We are dealing with the digital divide. We are dealing with special education needs. We are dealing with all of it. 
   As I said, it remains somewhat mind boggling to me to understand why legislation that is so positive for every segment of the population would be opposed, particularly in light of the fact it has already passed the Senate with 59 votes. The Senate has ratified this proposal. The Senate believes in this proposal. It was a bipartisan vote that caused that. 
   I will not keep the Senator from Rhode Island from his remarks. I yield the floor.

   First of all, I say to him, this $7 routine is exceedingly misleading. Two or three of his colleagues have used that. If $7 is all we are talking about, then, A, why get worked up about it? And, B, if $7 per year is the only advantage out of this account, which is four times what the President proposed, then I guess the President's proposal was only worth $2.25.

   Here is my idea: We should create new 401(k) accounts like the 401(k) plans that help you save for retirement, but these accounts will allow employers and employees to contribute up to $2,500 for each working person to pay for college or job training expenses, money that you can save and withdraw tax free. You could use this account for yourself, your spouse, even your child's college tuition.

   Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, let me address that as well because the Senator has made much of this today, as have others. This is, of course, a piece of legislation from the Finance Committee. It has been vetted three times before the Senate. It has been passed by the Senate with 59 votes. It is cosponsored by ROBERT TORRICELLI of New Jersey and about 10 other Democrats. So it is bipartisan with broad support. It in no way suggests that there won't be a full debate occurring on the issue when the reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act comes before us, which will be probably spring because there is not consensus on that committee. I am not on that committee, and I don't know if the Senator is or not. This comes from the Finance Committee and it is one component of what can be done. It is tax policy. It is characterized as if some little piece is going to somehow corrupt or become a hurdle in front of the broader discussion that will come with this other legislation. I find that pretty difficult to comprehend, particularly in light of the fact of previous Senate actions on the legislation. 
   I think it unfair to characterize this as a piece of legislation designed for private schools and that it somehow avoids public schools. That is just not so. The same sources of information the Senator has been quoting would have us understand that the education savings account will primarily benefit public schools but not just public schools. Seventy percent of the families who open these accounts--and I might point this out; the Senator covered it, too. He doesn't consider this the broad base and neither do I. But it does affect 14 million families and 20 million children, which is right at half--5 million less than half--of the entire population--seventy percent of those families' children are in public schools; 30 percent are in private schools. The division of the money is 50/50. 
   In other words, half the money that this generates flows to public schools and half to private or, I assume, home. That is not insignificant. That is about $12 billion that we don't have to appropriate. It is voluntarily brought forward, involving those families with their children and their needs. It is not appropriate to characterize that as a program designed for private schools. Will parents who have children in private schools use it? Yes, they will probably tend to use it more, which is why half the money goes there. I think, though, in 
   terms of causing someone to change schools, there is an implication there will be no place for them to go. It is not meant to make people change.

People do it on their own--not to mention the connection that occurs between the parent and the student.

We have just not collected the tax; there has been no constitutional challenge or discussion about it. That just won't flow. If we have decided to grant accounts that people's own money goes into and have decided we are not going to tax the interest on it, there is no way in the world that anybody would find that that is a subsidy of parochial education.

   Mr. COVERDELL. No, I didn't. I said that 70 percent of the families are in public schools. Then I said the distribution would be 50-50. The reason for that is parents who have children in the private schools are paying higher costs. They are paying, of course, the taxes for the public schools as well, and will probably have an incentive to save more. I think that is probably so. I sort of think that while 70 percent are in public schools, the distribution of 50-50 will probably be the case.

   Mr. COVERDELL. As I do. 
   Mr. President, this debate will continue tomorrow. 
   I want to reiterate that the tax savings account helps 14 million families and 20 million children. It provides for employer incentives to educate their employees. One million employees will benefit. It helps students who are in States with prepaid tuition plans because we do not tax them. That will be 1 million students who will benefit from the savings tuition provision. It adopts the proposal of Senator GRAHAM of Florida and Senator SESSIONS of Alabama on State tuition and on school construction. 
   Go across the face of education insofar as the Finance Committee is concerned. It deals with tax policy. We are not the education committee. We are making the Tax Code friendlier to States, communities, parents, employers, employees, and students to get a better education, 70 percent which will go to families of middle income of $75,000 or less. It is the same means test the President used when he created the HOPE scholarship along with the Congress. The only thing we do is make it four times more powerful than the President's proposal. 
   As I said, I sort of reel from time to time when they try to make it insignificant, but then it becomes a huge debate. They contradict themselves. If this is only worth ``$7 a year'' and is ``insignificant,'' then the President's proposal is only worth $2.25 because it is one-fourth the value of these accounts.

    Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to an American who has given graciously and unselfishly to her country. For over 36 years, Barbara Busch served this nation with great distinction in her many different capacities at the U.S. Peace Corps: from a staff assistant when she first began in 1964, to Executive Officer of the Recruitment and Communications Division, to Chief of Operations of Volunteer Recruitment and Selection, to Acting Director of the Peace Corps. It is truly a story of hard work and dedication. 
   Barbara retired from public service just under one month ago. Mr. President, I wanted to take this opportunity to congratulate her for a remarkable career and wish her well as she moves on to the next stage of her life. She leaves the Peace Corps with a better understanding of its importance and its role in the world than anyone that comes to mind. She will be greatly missed. 
   When I had the privilege to serve as Peace Corps Director, Barbara was working in the Office of Planning, Budget, and Finance. She was a diligent worker, excellent manager, and had a wonderful rapport with Peace Corp volunteers and returned volunteers alike. She was one of the few, courageous supporters of World Wise Schools, an innovative global education program that provides students in the United States with a view of life in countries around the globe. Since its inception in 1989, more than a million students in all 50 states have ``put a face on a place'' through World Wise Schools. 
   Back in 1964, when Barbara began her service, the Peace Corps was operating in 48 countries. Today, after her 36 years, the Peace Corps has 7,000 volunteers in 78 countries around the globe. It is because of dedicated public servants like Barbara that the Peace Corps continues to build on its distinguished record of service and continues to provide unique leadership around the world. There is no doubt that Barbara embodies the very spirit of the Peace Corps: a strong work ethic, generosity of spirit, and a commitment to service--the finest characteristics of the America people. 
   The Peace Corps continues to be the most successful program of its kind precisely because of its commitment to serving others. It is this legacy of service and commitment to others that Barbara leaves behind and for which she will be remembered.

   Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, the Judicial Conference recommends that Congress authorize 24 new bankruptcy judgeship positions in districts where bankruptcy filings and judicial caseloads are particularly burdensome. S. 625 authorizes 18 of these judgeships; these same positions were included in the conference report to the bankruptcy legislation in the 105th Congress. S. 625 does not, however, include six positions that the Judicial Conference submitted to Congress on March 24, 1999. 
   I thank the chairman of the Subcommittee on Administrative Oversight and the Courts for working so closely with me in my efforts to include these judges in the pending legislation. The chairman conducted a joint hearing with the House Judiciary Committee on November 2, 1999 to consider these six additional judgeships and has given them appropriate scrutiny. I have consulted with the Chairman both before and after this hearing regarding these judgeships, and I believe I have his commitment to address these positions when S. 625 is conferenced with the House.

   Mr. COVERDELL. I thank the Chairman for his efforts and assurances. As a fiscal conservative myself, I understand and appreciate his dedication to ensuring that these positions are truly warranted. 
   One of these new judgeships would help address a judicial caseload problem in Georgia. This new position would actually provide relief to two Georgia districts where caseloads far exceed the national average. By authorizing a new judgeship for the Southern District, an existing judgeship that is currently split between the Southern and Middle districts would move full-time to the Middle District.

    Mr. COVERDELL. Madam President, every once in awhile, we are reminded that all the important issues we are working on pale in comparison to the countless acts of charity and compassion that occur all across America on a daily basis. I want to recount for my colleagues one such act, which occurred in my home state of Georgia, appropriately enough, during the holiday season--an act that puts a human face on the compassion that is innate in the American people. 
   A.J. Bentley III, 3 1/2 years old, is a constituent of mine who is dying of brain cancer. While A.J.'s prognosis looks bleak, the disease has not taken away his passion and fascination with tractors, farm and earth moving equipment--the kind which Georgia is blessed to have plenty. Upon learning of A.J.'s terminal illness, our office contacted the good people at Caterpillar to see what they could do to lift the spirits of a dying boy and his family. Caterpillar reacted without hesitation and pulled out all of the stops. First, Caterpillar offered to have A.J. tour their plant in Peoria, Illinois so he could see first hand how all the equipment was built and how it worked. Unfortunately, A.J.'s medical condition prevented him from being able to fly to Illinois. Plan ``B'' was to have A.J. visit the Forest Products Division of Caterpillar in LaGrange, Georgia. On the day his dream would be fulfilled, A.J. was not feeling well and unable to make the 1 hour drive to LaGrange. Undeterred, the people of Caterpillar would not let A.J.'s illness keep them from fulfilling his dream. Because everyone at the LaGrange plant wanted a chance to help, there was a lottery that day in LaGrange. The grand prize was the chance to drive to A.J.'s hometown of Thomaston, Georgia and make his dream come true in person. The lucky few saw first-hand the joy of a young boy, decked out in his Caterpillar hat and playing on his new Caterpillar equipment that he loves so much. As the group was leaving to return to LaGrange, A.J. waved good-bye, then with a burst of energy proclaimed ``this is the best day of my life''. All who helped make this possible, I know, feel their own happiness that words could never adequately express. 
   There are days when all we seem to hear about is how people have become so self-absorbed in their own lives. I offer this example as a case in point of the compassion and good will that exists in LaGrange, in Georgia, and all across this Nation--people who are making a difference on a daily basis--one child, one American at a time. I salute the people of Caterpillar and I am humbled by their act of kindness. I know I speak for all of us when I say, A.J. has touched all of our hearts and he and his family will always be in our thoughts and prayers.

<TEXT>
   Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, today marks a major breakthrough in our War on Drugs. H.R. 1555, the Intelligence Reauthorization bill, contains a provision authored by myself and Senator DIANE FEINSTEIN, which is designed to put drug kingpins out of business. Enactment of our Drug Kingpin legislation represents the most dramatic change in our Nation's drug laws since the drug certification process was established in 1986. 
   The Drug Kingpin legislation, which Senator FEINSTEIN and I introduced earlier this year as a free-standing bill, targets major drug kingpins by blocking their assets in the U.S. and by preventing their access to U.S. markets. Our objective is to use U.S. economic power to undercut the financial base of the cartels and their kingpins, thereby providing a tool that directly targets a major security threat to this country. Simply stated, we are hitting drug traffickers where it hurts them most--in their wallets. 
   This legislation codifies and expands an existing Presidential Executive Order which has had remarkable success in financially isolating and weakening Colombian drug cartels. In 1995, President Clinton signed Executive Order 12978, exercising the International Emergency Economic Powers  Act (IEEPA) against four major drug kingpins affiliated with Colombia's Cali cartel. The Executive Order blocks any financial, commercial and business dealings with any entity associated with the four named drug traffickers, recognizing that drug traffickers who pump cocaine and heroin into our communities pose a threat to our national security. 
   The Coverdell-Feinstein initiative expands the President's Executive Order to include all foreign narcotics traffickers deemed as threats to our national security and enhances congressional oversight of this important and effective program. Here's how it works: As under the President's Executive Order, the Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) would develop a list of Specially Designated Foreign Narcotics Traffickers in consultation with the Department of Justice, the Department of State, and other executive branch agencies. Any foreign entity which appears on the list would be prohibited from conducting any economic activity with the United States. American firms or individuals who violate this prohibition would be subject to significant financial penalties and, potentially, prison terms. 
   Mr. President, this program's track record in Colombia is impressive. The United States targeted over 150 companies and nearly 300 individuals involved in the ownership and management of the Colombian drug cartels' non-narcotics business empire, which included a variety of companies ranging from drugstores to poultry farms. Once labeled as drug-linked businesses, these companies found themselves financially isolated. Banks and legitimate companies chose not to do 
   business with the blacklisted firms, choking off key revenue streams to the cartels. Over 40 drug-funded companies, with estimated combined sales of over $200 million, were liquidated or in the process of liquidation by February 1998. I am submitting for the RECORD a recent Treasury Department Impact Summary on the Colombia program. 
   The best part of this approach to fighting foreign drug kingpins is that it supports the efforts of foreign governments who need our help to take down the cartels. To that end, it is essential that implementation of this program occurs with the cooperation and participation of the host country. Indeed, in the case of Colombia, the participation and high level of cooperation by the Colombian government and the Colombian Banking Association were crucial to the success of the program. It is our hope and intention that as this program is expanded in legislation, a similar framework of cooperation and participation is developed with other countries. 
   One of our principle intentions with this legislation is to avoid the country-to-country confrontation that often occurs and to focus instead on the bad actors who are producing and trafficking the illegal drugs and who are causing so much damage to our nation. At the same time, it is designed to be a supplement, not a replacement for the current drug certification process. 
   The Coverdell-Feinstein provision is not country specific. It is a global initiative which targets foreign drug kingpins and their associates regardless of nationality and location--from Burma to Nigeria to Colombia. 
   Despite the proven track-record of this program, some raised concerns that this legislation would not adequately protect U.S. business interests. I disagree. So do the vast majority in both Houses of Congress, the Department of Treasury that implemented the successful Colombia program and the National Security Council. This legislation has been thoroughly vetted and painstakingly examined by the experts in Congress and in the Executive Branch. Since its unanimous passage in July 1999 as an amendment to the Intelligence Reauthorization bill, important changes were made which perfected and refined this provision that will be soon signed into law. 
   It is important to remember that this bill targets foreign drug traffickers and their front companies, not U.S. entities. This program is implemented so as to minimize the possibility of unfairly tarnishing the reputation of an individual or company. If a U.S. company is knowingly or unknowingly conducting business with drug traffickers or their associates, they are warned by the Treasury Department before any further steps are taken. According to Treasury Department practice, alert letters are sent by Treasury to U.S. entities who are potentially conducting business with a designated foreign narcotics trafficker or their associates. Often, a Treasury Department representative will personally warn the U.S. entity. Actions would only be taken if the U.S. entity continues the business relationship with the narcotics trafficker. 
   The purpose is not to harm unwitting U.S. businesses. Instead, it is to inform U.S. persons of the identities of the prohibited foreign parties. In the case of the Colombia program, U.S. businessmen have termed this program as ``a good preventative measure'' that helps them steer clear of the cartels' front and agents. If a U.S. entity does happen to be adversely affected, it has recourse to administrative remedies through the Treasury Department, and of course has access to U.S. courts--as 
   would any U.S. citizen under the Constitution. I am submitting for the RECORD a copy of several Treasury Department letters on this issue which should put this matter to rest once and for all. In addition, at the suggestion of Senator RICHARD SHELBY and Senator BOB KERREY, the legislation provides for a commission to examine a range of legal issues that could arise through implementation of the program. 
   As for the foreign drug kingpins, this legislation treats them for what they really are: a national security threat. Many of these criminals, who peddle their wares on our streets and in our school yards, are already under indictment in the U.S. These are the thugs responsible for thousands of deaths each year. In several cases tried before U.S. district courts since 1995, U.S. federal judges have found the designation process to be appropriate and applicable to the named foreign entities. 
   The provision unanimously passed the Senate as an amendment to the Intelligence Authorization Bill in July. It then passed the House on November 2 as a free-standing bill by a vote of 385-26. The provision was accepted in the Intelligence Conference on November 5. And then, last week, the House unanimously passed the Intelligence Conference Report, which included this provision. And, today, this provision received final approval in the Senate and will soon be sent to the President for his signature. 
   This provision is time-tested, has had extraordinary success in Colombia, and will continue to be an effective tool when applied on a global basis. This is a tough but fair measure. It punishes some of the worst criminals alive today, and at the same time protects the rights of innocent U.S. citizens. 
   Take legitimate U.S. dollars out of drug dealers' pockets is a vital step in destroying their ability to traffic narcotics across our borders. This is a bold but necessary tool to fight the war on drugs. 
   Finally, Mr. President, I would like to thank the distinguished Senator from California Senator DIANE FEINSTEIN, for her leadership and dedication to this issue. I would also like to recognize Representative PORTER GOSS and Representative BILL MCCOLLUM for their work on behalf of this bill and their tireless efforts in fighting the war on drugs.

   Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I rise to day to draw your attention to an informative and thought-provoking foreign policy lecture that our colleague and good friend, MIKE DEWINE, recently gave in Oxford, Ohio, at his alma mater--Miami University. His address was a part of Miami University's distinguished Hammond Lecture Series, which first began nearly 38 years ago in January 1962. Our esteemed former colleague from Arizona, Barry Goldwater, presented the first lecture in the Series, which, incidently, Senator DEWINE attended during his first visit to the Miami campus. 
   I draw your attention to Senator DEWINE's address because it focuses on a fundamental question that the American people, the President, and we here in Congress must consider. That question is this: ``What role will the United States play in the world, as we enter the 21st Century? In posing this critical question, Senator DEWINE discusses several of the challenges and concerns that our country faces in forming a foreign policy doctrine for the future. I encourage you to take some time to read this reasoned, well-grounded piece, and consider the questions it raises.

    Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I rise today to acknowledge one of Georgia's outstanding citizens. On November 16, 1999, the Senate announced the appointment of Dr. Deborah C. Ball of Columbus, Georgia, to the Parents Advisory Council on Youth Drug Abuse. This group of 16 individuals serve as advisors to the Director of National Drug Control Policy on issues including drug prevention, education and treatment. 
   Not only does Dr. Ball bring to the group her knowledge as a parent of three sons, but also over 27 years experience as an educator and coach. In addition, she is very active in her community through her local church and anti-drug organizations. Dr. Ball has been nominated for, and won, numerous awards for her work as a coach in the sports of basketball, softball, tennis and cheerleading. This year, she has been nominated for the Channel One National Coach of the Year. 
   The youth drug problem in our nation has been an issue of major concern to me for quite some time, and it is my hope that Dr. Ball and the other members of the Parents Advisory Council will bring their insight and innovation to the task of helping to end this epidemic. 
   I was proud to be a supporter of the legislation which established this group, and am pleased that such an eminently qualified Georgian has been selected to serve as a member. Mr. President, I offer my congratulations to Dr. Ball for this honor, and am confident that she will continue in her role of outstanding service and leadership to the youth of Georgia, and our country.

    Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, several weeks ago the Senate wisely rejected the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. Much was written about how the debate evolved here in the Senate. As one closely involved in this historic debate, I submit for the RECORD an excellent article in the November 8 issue of National Review by Richard Lowry. 
   The article follows.  
   Test-Ban Ban  
   ``If we had a hearing and had a vote on the CTBT, we would win overwhelmingly.'' 
   --Sen. Joe Biden, July 29, 1998 
   Jesse Helms mounted his motorized cart and left the Republican cloakroom, just off the Senate floor. Arizona senator Jon Kyl was right behind him. Georgia's Paul Coverdell got word in his office and immediately headed out the door. All were converging on the offices of majority leader Trent Lott late Tuesday afternoon, Oct. 12, as Senate staffers and others buzzed of an imminent deal to avoid a vote on the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. Minority leader Tom Daschle had just offered Lott a treaty-saving agreement. Now the small group of Republicans-after clearing Lott's cramped conference room of all staff, to ensure privacy--would decide whether the Senate would vote down a major international treaty for the first time in 80 years. 
   Their decision would be the culmination of months of work, and it would determine whether the congressional wing of the GOP would win its most significant victory since welfare reform in 1996. They knew they had a strong case on the merits. Defeating the treaty would, among other things, fit into a two-pronged national-security strategy featuring both missile defense and nuclear deterrence; deterrence is impossible without a safe, reliable American arsenal of the sort that the treaty would endanger. Shrewd GOP tactics and a series of Democratic miscalculations had brought the treaty to the brink, and now the senators were back where they had started--around that conference table--pondering whether to push it over the edge. 
   The first meeting in Lott's office had been in late April, when those same four began a quiet, well-organized effort to defeat the treaty. Kyl was the point man. A bright, serious-minded conservative and an authority on arms control, he had hosted meetings of anti-treaty staff as early as February. Soon after, he enlisted the help of Coverdell, always an important behind-the-scenes Senate player. Treaty opponents realized from the beginning that they would be wise to learn from their defeat on the Chemical Weapons Convention two years earlier, when Lott undercut them at the last minute. The first lesson? Get Lott on board early. 
   At the April meeting, Lott indicated his opposition to the treaty but said that no decisions could be made until the group determined how many Republicans were with them. So, in early May, treaty opponents began the first in a series of careful ``whip checks'' of how GOP Senators intended to vote. They gave wide berth to Senators who were likely to support the treaty or might spread word that something was afoot. ``There were 15 to 20 members we didn't even ask,'' says a Senate aide. The first count showed 24 votes against the treaty--10 short of the number needed to stop it--with another 11 ``leaning against.'' 
   Around this time, an internal debate among treaty opponents was close to resolution, at least in the minds of Kyl and Coverdell. The question had been whether it was better to ``go fast''--gather the votes to defeat the treaty, then vote on it right away--or ``go slow,'' in the hope of bottling it up forever. The ``go fast'' advocates figured treaty opponents would only lose strength as the November 2000 elections neared. With the approach of Election Day, Senators would want to avoid any controversial vote, while the White House would benefit from additional time to hammer its opponents. The chemical-weapons fight had demonstrated the awesome communications power of the administration. Why wait for it to shift into gear? 
   In early August, Lott was shown a binder full of clips--op-eds and letters--that supported the treaty, which seemed to indicate that the administration's push for it was underway. For a long time, treaty opponents had feared the administration would use a September conference commemorating the third anniversary of the treaty's signing as a deadline for Senate action. A July 20 letter from all the Senate Democrats--demanding hearings and a vote by October--seemed to confirm this plan. A fall treaty fight would coincide nicely with the period in which Republicans would be scrambling to pass appropriations bills. Democrats would have leverage to threaten to bollix up the spending process--creating the conditions for another ``government shutdown''--unless Republicans released the treaty. 
   Lott settled on a three-part interim strategy: (1) Helms--with 25 years' experience opposing ill-conceived arms-control treaties--would continue to hold up the treaty in his Foreign Relations Committee; (2) meanwhile, influential former national-security officials would continue to be lined up in opposition to it; and (3) Kyl and Coverdell would continue to work the vote count. By the time of a Sept. 14 meeting in Lott's office, Kyl could guarantee 34 votes in opposition--just enough. He could also deliver the energetic help of former secretary of defense (and secretary of energy) James Schlesinger. 
   Before long, the education effort by treaty opponents was in full swing. Kyl's staff prepared briefing books to distribute to other Senate staffers. Two nuclear-weapons experts who had worked in the labs briefed senators both individually and in small groups. And Schlesinger, who had served in both Republican and Democratic administrations, spoke at a luncheon for Republican Senators, then returned for more briefings the following week. ``He was key to us,'' says the Senate aide. The effort began to show in the steadily rising vote count: Sept. 14-34 opposed; Sept. 17-35; Sept. 22-38; Sept. 30--an amazing 42. 
   At the same time, Democrats heedlessly stepped up their agitation for action on the treaty. North Dakota Senator Byron Dorgan  was threatening to tie up Senate business, getting under Lott's skin. ``They were a huge influence on the decision to say, `Okay, let's just hold this vote,' '' says Coverdell about the Democrats. On Sept. 28, Biden showed Helms a resolution that he planned to offer, proposing hearings on the treaty this year and a vote by March 31, 2000. Biden's ploy seemed to indicate that the Democrats now planned to raise the temperature on the treaty in the spring, when it would get enmeshed in the presidential campaign and discomfit George W. Bush. As a result, Lott decided to move. He quietly reassured Biden that his resolution would be unnecessary. 
   On Sept. 30, Lott offered a ``unanimous consent'' agreement--all Senators have to sign on to such an agreement for it to go into effect--to bring up the treaty for an immediate vote. Daschle objected, charging that, among other things, there wasn't enough time for debate. Lott gave the Democrats the additional time they wanted, and on Oct. 1, Daschle lent his support to a new agreement. There would be a vote on the treaty within two weeks. Every Democrat in the Senate had endorsed the timing--and this was a mistake of major proportions. 
   Why did the Democrats do it? In part, they were trapped by their own rhetoric. Gleeful GOP staffers had a sheaf of statements from Democrats demanding a treaty vote this year. How could they back out now? They were also probably unaware of the direness of their situation. ``It was plain arrogance,'' says Kyl. ``They didn't have any idea they wouldn't win.'' Democrats also might have figured that they could, if necessary, cut a last-minute deal with Lott to avert a vote. The final days of the treaty fight featured a panicked Democratic effort to reverse course and do just that, even as the vote count against them continued to mount: Oct. 1-43 against; Oct. 7-45. 
   Lott was still open to avoiding a vote, but only if he could get an ironclad agreement from the Democrats that it would not come up again for the duration of the Clinton administration. It was this possibility--and the wiggle room the administration would surely find in any such deal--that had treaty opponents on edge. ``We were nervous until the vote took place that something was going to sidetrack it,'' says Arkansas Senator Tim Hutchinson. On Oct. 12, Daschle sent Lott a letter proposing to shelve the treaty, barring ``unforeseen changes.'' Lott promised to run it by his members. Hence the call that brought Helms, Kyl, and Coverdell dashing to Lott's office. Daschle's staff was already telling reporters that a deal was at hand, prompting yet another treaty opponent, Oklahoma's Jim Inhofe, to sprint to Lott's office unbidden. 
   Kyl, Helms, and Coverdell huddled with Lott over Daschle's proposal. What did ``unforeseen changes'' mean? Coverdell thought it was a ``glaring escape clause.'' The consensus of the group was that it was unacceptable. ``We couldn't have had a more calm, considerate discussion,'' says Kyl. ``Lott didn't need to be persuaded or harangued in the least.'' There was a brief discussion of going back to the Democrats with a draft of a foolproof deal. But it dawned on everyone that any deal would be impossible. The Democrats weren't serious, and some Republicans were unwilling to go along no matter what. Inhofe, arriving at Lott's office, emphasized just that. The only way out, as one Senate aide puts it, would have been ``an internal Republican bloodbath.'' 
   So, the next day, all systems were go. Lott firmly rejected a last-minute floor attempt by Democratic lion Robert Byrd to place obstacles in the way of a vote. Byrd threw a fit--to no avail. It was too late. Republican Senator John Warner was running around the floor, still gathering signatures on a letter asking that the vote be put off. Again, too late. President Clinton called Lott, asking if there was anything he could do. Replied Lott: Too late. When the floor debate was concluded, 51 Republican Senators voted down the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty in the face of international pressure, the opposition of the White House, and hostile media. 
   Surprising? Well, yes. ``I thought we had 50,'' says Jon Kyl.

   Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation that would address the growing bankruptcy caseload in our federal judiciary. Increased bankruptcy filings are placing a severe strain on our federal courts and on the judges who preside over these cases. The House and Senate bankruptcy reform bills seek to address this issue by authorizing eighteen new bankruptcy judges. While Congress recognizes the need for these judges, it has not yet taken the step it deems necessary to approve another needed group of bankruptcy judges identified by the U.S. Judicial Conference in March of this year. This legislation would authorize these six judgeships and help our federal judiciary address an overburdensome workload. 
   My home state of Georgia is one of the states that the Judicial Conference has indicated needs another bankruptcy judge. The middle and southern districts in Georgia have, respectively, the eighth and ninth highest weighted caseloads in the country. The most recent data from the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts indicates that the weighted bankruptcy filings per authorized judgeships is 1,907 for the middle district and 1,880 for the Southern district. Even with approval of a new judge for the southern district, the three full-time judges in that district would still carry a caseload that exceeds the threshold of 1,500 weighted hours that justifies the creation of another judgeship. 
   The review undertaken by the Judicial Conference of the workload in these Georgia districts also found that caseloads are being managed in a highly efficient manner. The Judicial Conference had no suggestions to assist the court in expending its caseload. A new judgeship is the only solution to this caseload problem. 
   I understand that the Judicial Conference used the same criteria to justify the 6 new judgeships in their March 1999 recommendation that they used to justify the 18 judgeships in the bankruptcy reform bills. Understanding the need for a new bankruptcy judge in my state, I support the Judicial Conference's recommendation,  and other states' efforts to obtain an additional judge. I am pleased that Senator BIDEN, EDWARDS, GRAHAM, CLELAND, SARBANES, MIKULSKI, and MACK, whose states were also included in the March 1999 Judicial Conference recommendation, have joined me on this bill. I believe this legislation will shed important light on caseloads and the need for new judges. The last time Congress approved new bankruptcy judgeships was seven years ago. These judges are needed now and I hope Congress will move forward in approving them.

   Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, we have a national problem that greatly affects Georgia if not addressed. Since 1944, under a federal program administered by the United States Department of Agriculture's Natural Resources Conservation Service, over 10,400 small watershed dams were constructed in 46 states. These dams were planned and designed with a 50 year lifespan. The purpose of this program was to provide flood control, water quality improvement, rural water supply assurance, fish and wildlife habitat protection, recreation, and irrigation. 
   Communities depend upon these watershed projects. However, many of these dams have reached their life expectancy and are badly in need of repair. Currently, the United States Department of Agriculture has neither the authority nor funds for rehabilitation of watershed structures. The legislation I introduce today along with Senator LINCOLN, the Small Watershed Rehabilitation Act of 1999, provides a needed and critical solution to this growing crisis for rural America. 
   The state of Georgia alone has 357 small watershed dams, 69 of which will reach the end of their designed lifespan within the next 10 years. It is my understanding that 121 dams in Georgia need to be modified to meet state dam safety laws and protect residential and commercial development downstream from the dams while 8 dams need repairs and modifications to extend their useful life and help prevent future environmental and economic losses. Since fiscal year 1996, the state of Georgia has appropriated over $4.6 million to bring these structures in compliance with the Georgia Safe Dams Act. However, state and local communities do not have enough financial resources available to rehabilitate these watersheds dams in a timely fashion. 
   The legislation Senator LINCOLN and I are introducing lays out a procedure and a funding mechanism for a rehabilitation process that would ultimately save these dams across the nation, including those located in Georgia. The bill authorizes $60 million a year from 2000 to 2009 and requires the Secretary of Agriculture to establish a system of ranking and approving rehabilitation requests on need and merit. Specifically, the legislation calls for $5 million to be used annually by the Secretary to assess the true needs of the entire program in the first two years of the program's existence. Under this program, 65 percent would be funded by the federal government while the remaining 35 percent would be funded locally. Recent flooding in the southeast from Hurricane Floyd and Irene make enactment of this legislation an even more pressing matter. 
    This bi-partisan legislation has been endorsed by Governor Roy Barnes of Georgia and a wide range of other Georgia state and local officials and national associations. 
   I would like to thank Senator LINCOLN for her leadership, and for working with me on this important legislation. This bill is a Senate companion to legislation introduced by Representative FRANK LUCAS of Oklahoma. We look forward to working with him on securing its enactment. 
   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and letters of support be priinted in the RECORD.

    Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Teacher Liability Protection Act of 1999. This legislation provides limited immunity for teachers, principals and other education professionals who take reasonable measures to maintain order and discipline in America's schools and classrooms in order to create a positive education environment. In other words, it allows teachers to do what is necessary to provide an environment conducive to learning without fear of being sued. This bill allows teachers to control their classrooms. It allows teachers to teach. 
   The ability of teachers and principals to teach, inspire and shape the intellect of our Nation's students is hindered by frivolous lawsuits and litigation. By creating a national standard for protecting teachers and education professionals through limited civil liability immunity, we allow teachers to teach, and we help our children to learn. 
   Mr. President, we must give educators the resources they need to educate our children, and these resources include the legal protection necessary to do their job and maintain a safe classroom. Principals must be able to control the schools, teachers must be able to control classrooms. Unruly and unmanageable children must not be allowed to endanger, intimidate or harm other students. It is our responsibility, as members of the United States Senate, to give teachers the legal protections necessary to provide a safe learning environment for all children in their care. We must give teachers the freedom they need to responsibly handle potentially dangerous situations without the fear of frivolous legal reprisals. 
   Based on the Volunteer Protection Act of 1997, which I introduced and which was signed into law, the Teacher Liability Protection Act would create a national standard to protect every teacher in the country, but would not override any state law that provides greater immunity or liability protection. This bill recognizes the authority of the states on these matters and allows them to opt out of the coverage and provide teachers with a higher or lower level of liability protection if they so choose. 
   This bill also recognizes that millions of parents across the nation depend upon teachers, principals and other school professionals for the educational development of their children. it affirms the fact that most teachers are hard-working professionals who care deeply for our children and go to extraordinary lengths to help them learn. However, this bill does not protect a teacher when he or she engages in wanton and willful misconduct, a criminal act or violations of State and  Federal civil rights laws. It simply protects teachers who undertake reasonable actions to maintain order, discipline and an appropriate learning environment as the public and society expect them to do. 
   I invite my colleagues to support this important and meaningful legislation and to give our Nation's teachers the freedom they need to educate our children.

   Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a resolution commemorating one of the great heroes of American sport. Twenty-five years ago, Henry ``Hank'' Aaron broke one of baseball's most legendary records--the all time home run record set by George Herman ``Babe'' Ruth. In 1974 Hank Aaron hit his 715th career home run and forever etched his name in the annals of baseball history. But we should always remember that this record was only part of the story for an athlete whose impact on the game and society is still felt today. 
   From the time he first arrived in the major leagues with the Milwaukee Braves in 1954, Hank Aaron gained a reputation as one of the most feared hitters in the National League, prompting the rival Brooklyn Dodgers to quickly give him the nickname ``Bad Henry.'' In 1957 he led the Braves to the World Series and earned himself the League's Most Valuable Player Award. 
   Aaron continued his consistently outstanding play through the 1960s and was with the Braves when they moved from Milwaukee to Atlanta in 1966. During these years, Hank Aaron continued to lead the Braves' offense and began amassing an impressive number of home runs. By the early 1970s it was clear that Aaron was on the verge of breaking a record many thought was unreachable--Babe Ruth's record of 714 career home runs. 
   Despite numerous threats to himself and his family from those who did not want to see him break the record, Hank Aaron persevered and made the record his own on the evening of April 8, 1974 at Atlanta Stadium. He went on to finish his career with the Milwaukee Brewers and retired with an amazing total of 755 career home runs, along with a .305 lifetime batting average and 2,297 career runs batted in, also a major league record. He entered baseball's Hall of Fame in 1982, receiving one of the highest vote totals in the history of Hall of Fame balloting. 
   After his playing days were over, Aaron returned to the Braves and became a pivotal part of the team's front office staff as their vice president of player development. He continues to serve the Atlanta community through various charities, including his own Chasing the Dream Foundation, and as corporate vice president of community relations for Turner Broadcasting. 
   Few players have had as large an impact on their sport and the cities where they played. As one of baseball's first African-American stars, Hank Aaron withstood prejudice and bigotry and helped to create the modern integrated game where stars like Ken Griffey, Jr., Ramon Martinez, Brian Jordan and Sammy Sosa flourish. His calm, quiet, methodical style is a lasting example that actions always speak louder than words. The game of baseball and society as a whole owes a debt of gratitude to Henry Aaron, and this resolution will show the Senate's appreciation for the all-time home run king on the anniversary of his greatest achievement on the field.

   Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I compliment the Senator. The debate is now beginning to occur on this very important subject. I associate myself with the remarks of the Senator from Virginia, as he explained to the Senate and to the public the nature of the procedure by which we have arrived at  this event and this process that the leadership of both sides of the aisle, over a 3-day period, concluded, which was agreed to by unanimous consent, would be the process for discussing the treaty. It is very important, in light of certain debates that had more to do with the process than the treaty. That was decided by the leadership. We are now debating the treaty, not the number of hearings, et cetera. 
   In the modern Senate, in my judgment, individual Senators come to decisions on monumental issues, such as this treaty, far more from their personal and internal counsel than they do whether or not there have been a series of hearings. Not very many Senators are able to attend those hearings, but they are gathering the information unto themselves, and they have been weighing the facts about this treaty for a long, long time. That is where the personal decision is likely to be made. I know that is the case in my case. 
   Therefore, I rise in strong opposition to the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. Despite what we are hearing from the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue and the other side of the aisle, ratification of this treaty is dangerous and would jeopardize the national security of the United States. President Clinton, the strongest proponent of this treaty, claims it would ``constrain the development of nuclear weapons, contribute to preventing nuclear proliferation, and enhance the ability of the United States to monitor suspicious nuclear activities in other countries.'' 
   I believe the President and those advocates of that point of view are wrong on every count. The treaty will not prevent countries from obtaining or developing nuclear weapons. Take the 1970 Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, a treaty designed to stop the proliferation of nuclear weapons. Despite its good intentions, which, of course, this treaty also embraces, nuclear proliferation continues today for one simple reason--nations act in accordance with their own national security interests. 
   The 1970 Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty did not prevent countries such as China, Iran, and Pakistan from acquiring or transferring nuclear technology. We cannot be so naive as to believe that such countries will behave differently if we pass this treaty. We must also take into account that our own conventional arms superiority will encourage other nations to cheat on the treaty. 
   My point is this: As the world understands that the United States cannot be challenged in conventional warfare--we are clearly the most powerful Nation in the world on any conventional act of warfare--that means other nations which may be adversaries will be pushed toward the need to have nuclear capacity as a quid pro quo to the United States. Strangely enough, even the administration admits that the treaty does not represent an effective deterrent for nuclear proliferation or modernization. In testimony before the Senate in 1998, the Acting Under Secretary of State for Arms Control and International Security Affairs said he could not identify a single nation that wouldn't seek nuclear weapons, if the treaty were to enter into force. 
   Second, the treaty is not verifiable. Former Director of Central Intelligence, James Woolsey, testified before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee last year that ``a zero yield Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty is extraordinarily difficult to the point of impossibility to verify from afar.'' 
   The distinguished chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee recently brought to this body's attention a Washington Post article which reported that the CIA cannot monitor low-level nuclear tests by Russia. So while our Central Intelligence Agency is telling us it can't verify compliance with the treaty, our administration persists in its misguided efforts to ratify the treaty. In effect, this administration is proposing that the United States adhere scrupulously to such a treaty while other nations will not be verifiably doing so by continuing to develop and acquire nuclear weapons. Ratification, then, means that the rogue and other nations would be gaining militarily over the United States. 
   Third, despite what the administration would have us believe, nuclear testing is essential to maintaining a strong and credible U.S. nuclear arsenal and deterrent. Most experts agree that nuclear tests are necessary to maintain the proper functioning of nuclear weapons and warheads and to modernize the existing stockpile for enhanced safety and effectiveness. 
   I want to digress a moment. If the world ever begins to believe that our arsenal is less than effective, it encourages bad behavior. If we ever come to believe we are not certain about our nuclear arsenal and its capacity, we become destabilized as a nation. 
   Many weapons believed to be reliable and thoroughly tested nevertheless developed problems which were only discovered and could only be fixed through nuclear testing. One-third of all the weapon designs placed in the stockpile since 1958 have required and received postdeployment nuclear tests to resolve problems. In three-quarters of these cases, the problems were only identified and assessed as a result of nuclear testing and could only be fixed by nuclear testing. 
   The proponents of the treaty think we can do this through computer modeling, but most experts will quickly tell us that we don't know whether the computer modeling will work and probably won't know for another 10 years. 
   In short, only by testing will the United States be able to maintain a nuclear stockpile that is able to defend against threats from abroad, rogue nations, to provide a credible deterrent to hostile nations and maintain confidence in the safety and reliability of our nuclear weapons, and to make sure those other nations understand we have a reliable, effective nuclear deterrent. 
   It is important to note that the value of America's nuclear arsenal diminishes dramatically if nations, rogue or otherwise, come to believe our deterrent is not safe and not reliable. The nuclear umbrella extended for decades to cover allies such as Germany and Japan has been an important factor in convincing these technologically proficient nations not to acquire their own weapons, precisely because of the safety and reliability of our weapons. So what kind of decisions do they begin to make if they ever believe they cannot count on the U.S. nuclear deterrent? 
   Mr. President, I want to make a couple of closing comments. 
   The other day, Senator BIDEN of Delaware, in his earlier remarks about the treaty, said something to the effect that this decision would ``hang over the heads'' of each of us who will be called upon to vote. The inference was, well, if those of us who oppose the treaty make an error, that will hang over all of our heads. I point out to the Senator from Delaware that this decision will live with each of us, no matter what decision we make.

   Mr. COVERDELL. He has clarified and made the very point I was going to make--that, clearly, if somehow proliferation accelerated, those who have voted no would have to feel they made an error in judgment. On the other hand, if those who voted for it found themselves in a situation where the U.S. deterrent had diminished, that the new testing procedures were not as effective, and that world rogues had suddenly become very weighty in the world, much would hang over their heads. 
   My closing point is this: Which mistake is worse? In other words, if the mistake is another nation has a weapon that it didn't today, that would not be good. I personally don't think this treaty is going to stop those nations. But, on the other hand, if the conclusion of the error is that we are unable to defend ourselves, first--or secondarily, we have somehow destabilized  our allies and have made the world less safe, which is a worse error? I think of a poster I have seen in the office of Senator GRAMM of Texas. It says: When the day comes, if the lion lies down with the lamb, we better be darn sure we are the lion. 
   The emotion the Senator has expressed today is laudable. It is a weighty decision. I think the Senator gives more to the reports and the process than I would, from my limited experience. He has been here a lot longer. As I said, while he was off the floor, I think personal counsel has a weightier importance on these kinds of issues. In the limited time I have been here, we have been through three of them now in the process. But if I were to have to pick between where we would be on the balance of mistakes, I would pick the safer one, where we have the capacity to defend ourselves.

   Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, the Senator from Delaware knows the respect is mutual. I just point out that people of honor and good faith can come down on very different sides of these questions, as we have seen among experts. 
   Ultimately, each of us will have to personally balance this equation. The political process that has already developed this treaty is the very thing that worries me about the escape clause you talk about. I don't have any confidence in it. I just don't believe, as you do, that this treaty will put any genie in the bottle. I will close with that. I admire the Senator from Delaware for his work. We simply have come to two different conclusions in this matter. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I will just be a moment and yield to the Senator from Michigan so he might call for a voice vote on his amendment. 
   I want to just quote the administration's own drug czar, General McCaffrey. He said:  
   As public servants, citizens, and parents, we owe our children an unambiguous no use message. And if they should become ensnared in drugs, we must offer them a way out, not a means to continue addictive behavior. 
   The problem is not dirty needles, the problem is heroin addiction ..... the focus should be on bringing help to this suffering population--not giving them more effective means to continue their addiction. One doesn't want to facilitate this dreadful scourge on mankind.  
   James Curtis, a professor of psychiatry at Columbia University Medical School and Director of Psychiatry at Harlem Hospital, said:  
   [Needle exchange programs] should be recognized as reckless experimentation on human beings, the unproven hypothesis being that it prevents AIDS. 
   Addicts are actively encouraged to continue to inject themselves with illegal drugs, and are exempted from arrest in areas surrounding the needle exchange program.  
   I can go on and on with expert people involved in the drug war. This is a good amendment. I am pleased that the other side has decided to adopt it. I  compliment the Senator from Michigan for bringing it to the floor. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, the Bingaman amendment will provide $200 million from the funds the committee provided for basic and concentration grants to support State and local accountability efforts to identify school failure and provide progressively more interventions to turn around the performance of the local school. Under the current law, States may now reserve 0.5 percent for such activity. This amendment would set aside $200 million, or 2.5 percent, specifically for State and local accountability efforts. States would not, therefore, be given the choice of whether or not to spend funds for accountability purposes which resemble very much a mandate. This amendment would take education funds away from States to educate low-income students. Most States already have adopted statewide accountability systems that include State assessments to measure whether students are meeting State standards, report cards that summarize performance of individual schools, and rating systems that determine whether a school's performance is adequate. 
   The authorizing committees have not had the opportunity to carefully examine the issue of whether to increase the amount set aside for accountability. Hearings should be held where States can express their views, and this issue should be addressed during the reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act.

   Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, the amendment would take money that currently goes directly to school districts and give it to States for accountability purposes. The authorizing committee, chaired by Senator JEFFORDS of Vermont, wants to have an opportunity to take a careful look at this issue during reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. While the letter from the National Governors' Association states that the association supports the amendment, the fact remains that funds would still be taken from local school districts. While this may be a decision the authorizing committee may ultimately make, it needs to be decided at the authorizing committee level. This is a significant decision, to take money directly from classrooms, and should be carefully reviewed. 
   I yield the remainder of the majority's time, if any remains, and I move to table the Bingaman amendment.

   Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I am going to speak for a moment or two about the pending business, which is the Nickles amendment numbered 1851. It is a sense of the Senate and is quite short and very clear. 
   It is the sense of the Senate that Congress should ensure that fiscal year 2000 appropriations measures do not result in an on-budget deficit, excluding surpluses generated by the Social Security trust fund. 
   Basically, what he is saying is that if for any reason in our budgetary exercise we find ourselves having dipped into the Social Security receipts, go beyond non-Social Security receipts, there would be a sequester for across-the-board cuts to replenish it. 
   The response from the other side is interesting because, of course, the President and the other side have said they don't want to use Social Security receipts and then they say current budgetary activities, depending on whose numbers you read, may have already done so. 
   I point out, it is not over until it is over. There has been no concluding action on our budget decisions. What this sense-of-the-Senate amendment states is ``if,'' depending on how much, it would require across-the-board cuts to protect Social Security--pretty clean and very simple. That is the sense-of-the-Senate resolution from Senator NICKLES of Oklahoma, amendment No. 1851. It is simple. It says when we finish all of our budget activities, finish all the conferences, and have everything concluded, if we have gone beyond other surpluses and dipped into Social Security, they will be replenished by an across-the-board cut. 
   The other side last week was imploring it is already maybe at $19 billion. It depends on whose numbers you look at. That is a 5-percent across-the-board cut. We are not there, is the point. If the budgeteers and appropriators are neglectful and we get into Social Security at that level, it will be appropriate there be a 5-percent across-the-board cut. Everybody has agreed--the President, the leadership on the other side and on our side--we should not use Social Security receipts to deal with this year's budget. 
   I think Senator NICKLES from Oklahoma offers a rational concept for assuring the American people--assuring those individuals who are concerned about Social Security, whether they are using Social Security or about to use Social Security--that this Congress is not going to use those to deal with the current expenditures.

   Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, Senator NICKLES should be here shortly to speak on his own behalf. Basically, he outlined a very simple premise and a very important principle, that we are not going to use Social Security for new spending; we are going to protect Social Security receipts. 
   He has offered a concept by which that would be done. Its impact would depend on the amount to which appropriators and the Congress, through their budgetary practices, had used those receipts. They have two options: They can go back to the conference committee reports and make sure the spending does not get into Social Security, in which case this has no import. But if they do, if it is $5 billion, that will be a 1-percent across-the-board cut; if it is $20 billion, it will be about 5. 
   It is up to the conscience, work, and dedication of our appropriators to resolve. 
   He outlines early in the process a premise which I think is sound: if we get into Social Security, we will recover. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, several comments: First, I commend the Senator from New Jersey for at least a more, in my judgment, candid discussion of this debate than we heard last week because the resolution that he offers says the Congressional Budget Office has projected that Congress is headed toward--headed toward doesn't mean they are there--whereas last week in the debate you would have thought it was a fait accompli. 
   The point is, we don't know if any funds or spending levels would have been at such a level that they would have affected Social Security. No one knows that now. Everybody is trying to avert that. Here comes Senator NICKLES' amendment which says if we don't avert that, it would relate to across-the-board cuts. I think all of us understand that the number, if any of it applies to Social Security, would never be of the magnitude discussed in the amendment by the Senator from New Jersey. 
   The point I wish to make is that it is a nebulous amendment because it says it is headed for--in other words, we don't know. But then they draw the conclusion that it might result in reductions of 10 percent across the board. We heard 1 percent. If it were around $5 billion, it would be 1 percent. If it were $19 billion, it would be probably around 5 percent. To get to 10 percent, we would probably have to be at about $40 billion. 
   The point is, this is a very imprecise amendment about something. It is like an attempt to be a crystal ball. What are the appropriators, what is the Senate, and what is the Congress going to ultimately do with the pressure? 
   The amendment also has a technical flaw because it suggests in the language that it would cut emergency aid to farmers and hurricane victims when across-the-board cuts do not apply to emergency funding--something the authors may want to review. 
   Senator NICKLES said if spending is such that it utilizes some Social Security receipts, they will require an across-the-board cut. I think the American people can understand that. 
   This resolution says we could cut spending, which of course is what Senator NICKLES suggests ought to happen as well; but if that doesn't work, we will just raise taxes. The Senator from New Jersey points out these are taxes that would not affect ordinary families. All taxes affect ordinary families. There is no such thing as a corporate tax. It really doesn't exist. Corporate taxes are expenses to the corporation. The ladder consumers buy, the loaf of bread consumers buy, the gasoline consumers buy, on anything consumers buy, consumers pay all corporate taxes. 
   He talks about the possibility of taxing tobacco companies yet again after the settlement. Who pays any charge to the cost of the tobacco? The people who buy it, the ordinary people who use the product. 
   The major distinction has at least been reduced between the two bills. They both say ``if,'' ``could,'' ``maybe,'' but the principal distinction is that the Senator from Oklahoma says if any of those funds come from Social Security receipts, they have to be replaced by an across-the-board reduction, which is an incentive to reduce spending so that doesn't happen; and the Senator from New Jersey says there is a major incentive to reduce expenditures to keep it from happening, but if it does, we will raise taxes; we will take more out of everybody's pocket. That is the principal distinction. 
   I am pleased the debate has eliminated both suggestions that anyone really understands what that amount, if any, might be. I am pleased the amendment of the Senator from New Jersey acknowledges that. 
   It boils down to two different approaches about what to do if it were to happen. The Senator from Oklahoma says we would have across-the-board spending reduction; the Senator from New Jersey says we would raise taxes. He does admonish it would not be a tax that would affect an ordinary person. I point out that all corporate taxes are paid for by all consumers. 
   I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, amendment No. 1837 increases funding for Reading Excellence by $25 million; it would increase charter school funding by $50 million, and increase Safe and Drug Free Schools by $25 million. The amendment is paid for by an offset of $100 million from the fund for the improvement of education which is currently funded at $139.5 million. I repeat, the amendment increases funding for Reading Excellence by $25 million, increases charter school funding by $50 million, and increases Safe and Drug Free Schools by $25 million. 
   Charter schools are offering some of the most promising educational reform today. Since 1991, 34 States and the District of Columbia have enacted charter school programs. This year, more than 1,700 charter schools will be serving 350,000 of our Nation's students. As most Members know, charter schools are public schools which have been set free from burdensome Federal, State, and local regulations. In place of the intrusive regulations, charter schools are held accountable for academic results by the consumers, parents, and students. 
   In the last 2 years, exciting studies have been released that provide data on the success of charter schools around the country. In May of 1997, the Department of Education released its first formal report on the study of charter schools. The findings include the two most common reasons for starting public charter schools: flexibility from bureaucratic laws and regulations, and the chance to realize an educational vision. 
   About 60 percent of public charter schools are new startups rather than public or private school conversions to charter status. 
   In most States, charter schools have a racial composition similar to statewide averages, or have a higher proportion of minority students. Charter schools enroll roughly the same proportion of low-income students, on average, as other public schools. 
   The Hudson Institute also undertook a study of charter schools entitled ``Charter Schools in Action.'' Their research team traveled to 14 States, visited 60 schools, and surveyed thousands of parents, teachers, and students. 
   Some of the study's key findings: Three-fifths of charter school students report that their charter school teachers are better than their previous school's teachers; over two-thirds of the parents say their charter schools are better than that child's previous school with respect to class size, school size, and individual attention; 90 percent of the teachers are satisfied with their charter school educational philosophy, size, fellow teachers, and students. 
   Among students who said they were failing at their previous school, more than half are now doing excellent or good work. These gains were dramatic for minority and low-income youngsters and were confirmed by their parents. 
   The Hudson Institute study found that charter schools are successfully serving students, parents, and teachers. Currently, there are national and State studies that demonstrate a positive ripple effect. The study on the impact of Michigan charter schools found that charter school competition has put pressure on traditional public schools to become more accountable. A similar study done on Massachusetts charter schools found that district schools have been adopting innovative practices that mirror charter school efforts. A study on Los Angeles charter schools shows that charter schools  have influenced district reform by heightening awareness and initiating dialog. 
   The implication of the success of charter schools is that successful public schools should be consumer oriented, diverse, results oriented, and professional places that also function as mediating institutions in their communities. Charter schools offer greater accountability, broader flexibility for classroom innovation, and ultimately more choice in public education. 
   Many in this Chamber are aware of my strong support of the opportunity for low-income parents to choose the best educational setting for their child, whether public or private. I believe this ability to choose the best educational environment for our children is something all parents should have, not just those parents who can afford the choice. 
   Another provision of this amendment deals with reading excellence. To get an idea of our children's future, one has only to look in the Sunday paper at all the high-tech firms looking for applicants. There is no more clear indicator of where our economy is headed. Without basic skills, many of our children will be shut out of the workforce--left behind. We have a literacy crisis in the Nation. More than 40 million Americans cannot read. Those who cannot learn to read are not only less likely to get a good job but they are also disproportionately represented in the ranks of the unemployed and homeless. Consider that 75 percent of unemployed adults, 33 percent of mothers on welfare, 85 percent of juveniles appearing in court, and 60 percent of prison inmates are illiterate. 
   The Federal Government spends more than $8 billion on programs to promote literacy, with little result. More than 40 
   million Americans cannot read a phone book, a menu, or the directions on a medicine bottle, and only 4 out of 10 third graders can read at grade level or above. That is why last fall we passed an important piece of legislation to address the serious problem of illiteracy in our country. This legislation, the Reading Excellence Act, seeks to turn around our Nation's alarmingly high illiteracy rates by focusing on training teachers to teach reading, increasing parental involvement, and sending more dollars to the classroom. 
   Mr. President, how much time is remaining? 
</TEXT>
</DOC>

<DOC>
<DOCNO>106-coverdell-ga-6-19991006</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. COVERDELL. The legislation provide $210 million for research, teacher training, and individual grants for K-12 reading instruction and requires that funds for teacher training be spent on programs that are demonstrated by scientific research to be effective. It also authorizes grants to parents for tutorial assistance for their children. Most important, Reading Excellence ensures that 95 percent of the funds go to teaching children to read, not to administrative overhead. The Reading Excellence Act provides today's children with the tools they need to be successful in tomorrow's workforce. Helping to ensure every child can read is one of the best bills Congress can pass. 
   We also deal in this amendment with safety in schools. In 1996, students ages 12 through 18 were victims of about 225,000 incidents of nonfatal, serious, violent crimes at school and 671,000 incidents away from school. These numbers indicate that when students were away from school, they were more likely to be victims of nonfatal serious crimes including rape, sexual assault, robbery, and aggravated assault. 
   In 1996, 5 percent of all 12th graders reported they had been injured with a weapon such as a knife, gun, or club during the past 12 months while they were at school; that is, inside or outside the school building or on a school bus; and 12 percent reported they had been injured on purpose without a weapon while at school. 
   So I come back to the basic tenet of this legislation; that is, we are reinforcing, through the amendment, in a significant way, Federal assistance to charter schools, the Reading Excellence Act, and Safe and Drug Free Schools--$50 million more to charter schools, $25 million more to the Reading Excellence Act, and $25 million into Safe and Drug Free Schools. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor and retain the remainder of my time.

   Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, the DeKalb-Peachtree Airport is the second busiest airport in Georgia, and this level of activity makes living and working in this area noisy and dangerous. Businesses cannot expand, and poorer residents cannot afford to move until a government buy-out of these properties is completed. The Federal Aviation Administration, commonly referred to as the FAA, has done studies which show that increased operations at Dekalb-Peachtree Airport are too noisy and unsafe for residents and businesses in the northern vicinity of the airport. While the FAA has provided some relief and been helpful in the purchasing of some homes, there needs to be a speedy conclusion to this buy-out process in order to allow these homes and businesses to move to safer areas and give the airport the room it requires to meet an ever-increasing demand. Additional FAA funding is needed as soon as possible. to complete this task, would the Chairman be willing provide additional federal funding in the FAA reauthorization bill to address this situation?

   Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, as you know I have been a strong critic of the President's recent decision to offer clemency to the 16 members of the Puerto Rican terrorist organization FALN. I have held hearings on this matter and have seen the outrage this action has prompted in many of my constituents and the public at large. I have received numerous communications regarding this situation which criticize the President's decision and question his motives. In particular, I would like to thank Larry Stewart of Lynchburg, Virginia, one of the first to bring this matter to my attention. His interest in this action and its effect on our overall terrorism policy have been appreciated and helpful to me as our work on this issue has progressed.

   Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I rise today to offer a few comments on the occasion of the 75th birthday of our Nation's 39th President and fellow Georgian, James Earl Carter. 
   I have known President Carter and his lovely wife Rosalynn since my days in the Georgia State Senate, and I have always known him to be a very gracious, forthright, and effective public official. Jimmy Carter has dedicated his life to his country--graduate of the United States Naval Academy, member of the Georgia State Senate, Governor of Georgia, and of course, President of the United States. 
   Many former Presidents choose a slower and more relaxed lifestyle once they leave office. But not Jimmy Carter. Since leaving office, he has been a leading advocate for democracy, peace, and human rights throughout the world. The Carter Center, headquartered in Atlanta, is one of the most renowned organizations in the area of promoting health and peace in nations around the globe. 
   Mr. Carter has also been a leader in our country's struggles to end poverty. In 1991 he launched the Atlanta Project, an initiative aimed at attacking social problems associated with poverty. 
   Besides the Atlanta Project, Mr. and Mrs. Carter are regular volunteers for Habitat for Humanity, a charitable organization dedicated to ending homelessness throughout the world. As two of Habitat's most well-known volunteers, each year they lead the Jimmy Carter Work Project, a week-long event that brings together volunteers from around the world for this noble effort. 
   Mr. President, the resolution brought forward by my colleague Mr. CLELAND and myself will express the Senate's best wishes to President Carter on his  75th birthday. I can not think of someone more deserving of this honor. I wish Jimmy and his wife Rosalynn well on this occasion, and encourage my colleagues to do likewise. I thank the Chair.

   Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I rise to speak on behalf of the Gregg of New Hampshire amendment, the second-degree amendment to the amendment of the distinguished Senator from California. 
   To put this in context, in 1975, the Congress embraced a very laudable idea to assure the appropriate education of students who had special education needs. It was recognized at the time that this would be a very costly proposal, so the Federal Government agreed to pay 40 percent of the costs, the States were to pay 40 percent, and local jurisdictions were to pay 20 percent. 
   Guess what. From 1975 to 1999, the Federal Government has essentially reneged on the deal and has forced the local governments to bear the entire costs. Visit any school superintendent, any school board education member, and the first thing they will talk about is the effect of this mandate. It is a handcuff on them in terms of dealing with the multiple requirements of funding education in their local district. They resent, rightfully so, the fact the Federal Government has not fulfilled its promise. 
   Right now the Federal Government provides 11.7 percent of the Nation's special education costs. That is about 29 percent less than the original deal. It amounts to an impact on local schools of about $10 billion a year. 
   The essence of the amendment of the Senator from New Hampshire--and he has said this since he has been in the Senate--is that we have to correct this problem and that the funding should have a priority over virtually all new programs. Until we fulfill this agreement, we should not be imposing new program after new program after new program on local governments. 
   When I visit with my superintendents, they don't ask for new programs. They ask for relief from this huge financial burden that has been impounded upon them by the Federal Government so they can free up resources to do the things they think are important in their school district. They don't call for a new master principal in Washington to tell them what they need to do in their school district. They are saying, do what we promised to do, which will allow them to do the things they need to do. 
   Since President Clinton came to office in 1993, he has never made this special education funding one of his top priorities. Since the Republicans have been in the majority, we have more than doubled the President's request each year to fulfill this promise. In many years he has not requested any increases that would keep the program in line, even with inflation. Most years, the President has asked for no more than a 5-percent increase. This year, in this budget, he asked for less than 1 percent. 
   Meanwhile, from the other side, for laudable reasons, it is: Let's add another program. We will just slip that check over on the side and put it in the desk and come with another program. We will just let the local governments work it out on their own. 
   The real philosophical divide here is that we are saying let's fulfill the Federal promise. It is a huge obligation. If we fulfilled it in its entirety, we would free up $10 billion locally to allow those local school boards and local communities to do the things, as I said a moment ago, they believe are important. 
   Right now, what we have done is reneged on the promise, choked the funds at the local level, and have just come on, year after year, with either another mandate or another idea from Washington about what is best in a local community. So this debate we are having on the amendment of Senator GREGG from New Hampshire, as a second-degree amendment to that of Senator BOXER from California, is a very crucial and symbolic example of the differences we have been debating here all day. 
   Earlier it was the Senator from Washington, Senator MURRAY, who was going to mandate that a certain amount of funds be used to hire x number of teachers, and Senator GORTON from Washington was saying no, the funds should be flexible so the local community could decide what is best. It is the same issue on these amendments. We are voting on exactly the same kind of question here. 
   So I speak loudly as a proponent for Senator GREGG's second-degree amendment, which I expect to prevail. And then I will oppose the forthcoming amendment from Senator BOXER on the grounds we need to free resources at the local level and let local board members decide what is needed in those local districts. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   It is my understanding that the Atlanta Region faces an aging infrastructure and rapid growth and that the City of Atlanta has committed $1 billion in local funds to go directly to the combined sewer system and other watershed restoration initiatives. 
   It is my understanding as well that the House of Representatives has recommended that $1 million be appropriated for this project, and I ask that  the Chairman give every possible consideration to this amount during Conference considerations. Also, I would ask that fair and appropriate consideration be given to an even greater sum.

   Mr. COVERDELL. The Town of Moultrie, Georgia, founded in 1856, has served as an agricultural center for surrounding farms and related industry. Unlike many small towns, Moultrie has managed to avoid population losses, which is mostly attributable to its livable, high quality residential neighborhoods, historical county seat and active community development efforts. It is my understanding that Moultrie is seeking to promote revitalization and economic development that will raise the standard of living of town residents whose per capita income level is only 75% of the country's and 56% of the state's level. 
   In doing so Moultrie faces two key economic development issues. First, is the need to revitalize its downtown to retain retail businesses and attract new retail businesses. Second is the need for attractive industrial and business sites to retain existing, as well as draw new businesses and industry. 
   It is also my understanding that Moultrie's downtown economic development is stymied by an obsolescent industrial and commercial district located between the central historic Courthouse Square and the main entry to the town from Interstate 75. This is a brownfields district typical of smaller, older towns. It contains vacant and under-utilized land and buildings along a railroad, and substandard housing interspersed within a grid of city streets. The most visible problem in the district is the former Swift Plant, once one of the largest pork processing plants in the south. Today its largest building is partially demolished and the site contains documented soil and groundwater contamination. The 250 acre brownfield district in which the Swift Plant is located, has other contaminated properties and yields little tax revenue. No new businesses have located within the district in many years, and many of the existing businesses are considering relocating due to the area's low level of development. 
   It is my understanding that Moultrie has developed an economic redevelopment initiative to revitalize Moultrie's brownfields district and strengthen the city economy, and they have requested federal funding to proceed. Central to this plan is the complete demolition of the Swift Plant. 
   Mr. Chairman, based on what criteria do you consider projects such as this?

   It is my understanding that the requested $5.2 million would go towards the development of a new museum facility in Macon, Georgia to meet the expansion needs and the cultural, educational, social and economic needs of the City of Macon. 
   It is also my understanding that the Tubman Museum may become a Conference issue, and I ask every possible consideration be given to the request.

    Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I rise today to acknowledge one of Geogia's outstanding civil servants. On August 29, 1999, Jack Krakeel, Director of Fayette County's Fire and Emergency Services, was named Fire Chief of the Year by the International Fire Chief's Association. This award is a fitting honor to a man who, through his hard work and leadership, has provided Fayette County with a superior fire and rescue team and has devised innovative methods to deal with emergencies. 
   Under Chief Krakeel's leadership, Fayette County's emergency services have found creative solutions to deal with ever-changing challenges. An important program implemented by the Department requires cross-training of employees. All career members of the Fayette County Department of Fire and Emergency Services are trained as both firefighters and paramedics. This gives the department incredible flexibility when dealing with severe emergency situations. 
   Fayette County, Georgia, is one of the fastest growing counties in the nation. In response to this rapid increase in demand for services, Chief Krakeel has developed plans implemented by the Fayette County Board of Commissioners which will maintain an average emergency response time of five minutes. In a business where the difference between life and death is often measured in seconds, the importance of this initiative cannot be underestimated. 
   Chief Krakeel's department also recognizes the need to inform families, particularly children, on the importance of fire safety. Under Chief Krakeel's leadership, the department was the first in the state to enact a multi-family housing sprinkler ordinance and also created a portable fire safety education home which teaches children how to escape from a fire. 
   Jack Krakeel has also serves in a variety of leadership roles related to emergency services. He is the national Chairman of the National Fire Protection Association's ``Technical Project in Emergency Medical Systems.'' Also, Chief Krakeel is in his third year as a member of the Board of Directors of the International Association of Fire Chiefs. 
   On a more local level, Chief Krakeel is a member of the Georgia's Emergency Medical Services Advisory Council, and is in his twelfth year of service with the organization. Not long ago he helped lead the formation the joint EMS Committee of the Georgia Association of Fire Chiefs and the Georgia Firefighters Association. 
   Other accomplishments during Chief Krakeel's impressive career are too numerous to mention. It is not an exagerration to state that few people have had a greater individual impact on modern emergency service techniques than Chief Jack Krakeel. Mr. President, I offer my congratulations to Chief Krakeel for the honor bestowed upon him, and my hopes that he will continue to provide innovation and leadership for years to come.

   Mr. COVERDELL. As you know, there are several areas in my state of Georgia where the interstate expanded significantly around existing neighborhoods. The Georgia Department of Transportation wanted to put up noise barriers to address this situation. TEA-21 provided $750,000 for Type II noise barriers on I-75 in Clayton County and I-185 in Columbus, Georgia. It also provided $1.5 million for noise barriers along GA-400, and allowed federal highway funds to be used for noise barriers along I-285. Unfortunately, because of an error in drafting the provisions included in TEA-21, the Georgia Department of Transportation is not able to complete these noise barrier projects. I have proposed an amendment which would correct this problem and allow my state to use their apportioned federal highway funds to complete these noise barrier projects. Would you be willing to work with me to address this problem?

    Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I rise today to acknowledge the efforts of thousands of hard-working Americans who are members of the American Payroll Association. As you may know, this week, September 13 through 17, has been designated National Payroll Week, a time to take note of the efforts of our nation's payroll professionals. 
   Payroll taxes are the largest source of revenue for the federal government. While I for one would like to see these rates reduced, we should not let this detract from the hard work which payroll professionals put into their efforts. Payroll work is also a vital component of facilitating child-support payments. It is my understanding that more than 60 percent of all child support collections are derived from payroll deductions for this purpose. 
   While many of us here often make note of Americans working in the factories, in our retail outlets, and on our farms, many times we overlook those who monitor the systems that ensure Americans receive their wages quickly and efficiently. I encourage my colleagues to also acknowledge our nation's payroll professionals during this week.

   Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I want to read the resolution to open this discussion. It is a joint resolution deploring the actions of President Clinton regarding granting clemency to FALN terrorists:  
   Whereas the Armed Forces of National Liberation (the FALN) is a militant terrorist organization that claims responsibility for the bombings of approximately 130 civilian, political, and military sites throughout the United States; 
   Whereas its reign of terror resulted in 6 deaths and the permanent maiming of dozens of others, including law enforcement officials; 
   Whereas 16 members of the FALN were tried for numerous felonies against the United States, including seditious conspiracy; 
   Whereas at their trials, none of the 16 defendants contested any of the evidence presented by the United States; 
   Whereas at their trials none expressed remorse for their actions;  
   I am going to repeat that clause, Mr. President:  
   Whereas at their trials none expressed remorse for their actions;  
   Whereas all were subsequently convicted and sentenced to prison for terms up to 90 years; 
   Whereas not a single act of terrorism has been attributed to the FALN since the imprisonment of the 16 terrorists; 
   Whereas no petitions for clemency were made by these terrorists, but other persons sought such clemency for them; 
   Whereas on August 11, 1999, President William Jefferson Clinton offered conditional clemency to these 16 terrorists, all of whom have served less than 20 years in prison; 
   Whereas the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Federal Bureau of Prisons, and 2 United States Attorneys all reportedly advised the President not to grant leniency to the 16 terrorists; 
   Whereas the State Department in 1998 reiterated two long-standing tenets of counter terrorism policy that the United States will: ``(1) make no concessions to terrorists and strike no deals''; and ``(2) bring terrorists to justice for their crimes''; 
   Whereas the President's offer of clemency to the FALN terrorists violates longstanding tenets of United States counterterrorism policy; and 
   Whereas the release of terrorists is an affront to the rule of law, the victims and their families, and every American who believes that violent acts must be punished to the fullest extent of the law: Now, therefore, be it 
   Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,  That making concessions to terrorists is deplorable and that President Clinton should not have granted clemency to the FALN terrorists.  
   I commend the House of Representatives. It has already passed House Congressional Resolution 180: 311 voting aye, 41 voting no, and, in an unprecedented act, 72 voting ``present.'' 
   I conducted a hearing this morning, the witnesses of which were former New York Detective Senft, former New York Detective Pastorella, the president of the Fraternal Order of Police, Mr. Gallegos, and a son of one of the victims of the New York bombing at a restaurant, Fraunces Tavern, in New York, Mr. Connor. 
   It was a very moving hearing. The two detectives, one of whom, in the bombing in New York by this organization, has lost permanent sight in one eye, some 60 percent of his hearing, and has gone through, I guess, some 16 reconstructive operations. The other detective is permanently blind and has lost the majority of his right hand. They made rather poignant statements. They said that there would be no pardon for what they had suffered; there would be no clemency; that theirs were life sentences. Both nearly lost their lives. One still has metal particles in his stomach and shoulders from the bombing. 
   Mr. Connor, very movingly, talked about the notice that he and his mother received on his 9th birthday that their father, an innocent 33-year-old, who had taken a client to lunch, had died in the bombing. 
   It was sort of interesting; Detective Senft, 2 years ago, began writing the President about this matter, to which there has been no response. Several of the witnesses talked about having written the Attorney General and the White House, with no response. To me, it is hard to imagine that such a letter would come to the White House or to the Attorney General and not be responded to. 
   Lieutenant Senft over 2 years ago wrote and has yet to receive a response. Mr. Connor cited current law which requires that victims are to be notified of the release of prisoners in cases in which they were involved. 
   None--neither of the detectives nor the Connor family--have been notified at all. 
   One of the concerns that came out of the hearing was to embrace these questions so our committee, and the Judiciary Committee, can make appropriate inquiries as to what was done to advise these individuals. In the hearing they pointed out that the clemency advocates have had numerous meetings with the Attorney General's Office and others in the Government, but those who would oppose it have had none, and requests to have these meetings have gone without response. 
   The representative of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, who was to have testified on behalf of the Government to try to explain how this policy would not be incongruous with Federal policy with regard to the handling of terrorists, at 9:30 last night, notified the committee they would not testify, that they had been instructed not to testify by the White House. 
   So the inquiries over the last 2 weeks to give the administration an opportunity to air their view of this circumstance and how it interacted with U.S. policy with regard to terrorism  went unheeded, and neither the State Department nor the Justice Department nor the Federal Bureau of Investigation would even make a witness available on behalf of the committee to air the Government's view with regard to this act on the part of the President. 
   No one is challenging the President's right and power to grant the clemency. To the extent they say, well, it is a constitutional power, et cetera, that is a smokescreen. What we are trying to understand is what its effect is on U.S. policy with regard to terrorism. 
   Interestingly--to comment just a moment or two more on the hearing--I posed the question to the witnesses that the President has endeavored, in his clemency finding, to draw a distinction for these 16 terrorists, indicating they themselves did not actually throw or place the bomb. 
   These were conspirators. These were planners. Senator SESSIONS so eloquently stated the other day that one of the reasons they did not get to do that is they were caught with all these weapons in their van. In other words, if you are an unsuccessful terrorist, you have a higher standing under U.S. law than if you are a successful terrorist. 
   But when the question was posed to the panel, Mr. Gallegos, who is president of the Fraternal Order of Police, said: Wait a minute. What kind of question are we introducing to the adjudication of criminal activity? He said: For example, if you are the get-away driver in a bank robbery--you did not actually rob the bank--under U.S. law you are as guilty and subject to as much of a punishment as the man who walked into the bank. 
   I mentioned the other day on the floor, under this theory of separation of degree, why is Bin Laden a No. 1 fugitive for the United States? He didn't drop the bombs in Kenya and Tanzania. He was a conspirator, as these people were. I asked the question--and I will turn to my colleague--what this did to the morale, and New York Detective Senft said it undermines every active-duty law enforcement officer. He said, as damaged as he is permanently in life, he took solace that the perpetrators who attacked him were in prison. It has been a devastating fact for him to know that clemency can be granted for that kind of activity. All of the law enforcement officials said these decisions were particularly devastating to men and women on America's front line protecting citizens day in and day out from these kinds of hostilities and violence. 
   With that, I yield up to 15 minutes of our time to the Senator from Texas, Mr. GRAMM.

   Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, ever since the introduction of this resolution which basically put the Senate on record, if passed, we were deploring the action of the President commuting the sentences of 16 known terrorists, in this timeframe, the White House so far has refused to allow any of its representatives in the Department of Justice, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, its own White House, or the Bureau of Prisons to testify before any congressional hearing. It was as late as 9:30 p.m. last evening that the testifier from the Federal Bureau of Investigation called our office to decline to testify. In other words, there is a total blackout at the White House. 
   The vote that occurred on the House side had 71 Members of the other side of the aisle voting ``I am here,'' refusing to make a statement. This debate in the Senate will have soon been 2 hours long. So far, on the other side there has been only one sentence discussed about this national issue of the President commuting the sentences and releasing 16 known terrorists. One sentence in the entire debate has come from the other side. Mr. President, 71 of their Members in the House simply voted they were in Washington, and the White House has refused to make any comment and refused to allow any of the administration to testify. 
   Mr. President, this book, ``Patterns of Global Terrorism, 1998,'' is published by the State Department of the United States. It was published in April of this year. On the first page it says:  
   United States policy with regard to terrorism.  
   And the first statement is:  
   Make no concessions to terrorists and strike no deals.  
   These 16 terrorists have been given the concession of being released from prison, and the entire process was one of dealmaking and negotiations among the White House and representatives of the terrorists and the terrorists. 
   The question is the incongruity with the administration as well as our Government's policy with regard to terrorism. 
   The second premise is:  
   Bring terrorists to justice for their crimes.  
   We are in the midst of sending 16 of them from prison out into the population, again with no real assurance--in fact, we have already seen some signs that they would not recant terrorist activities. 
   The President, in a rather tortured effort to explain--that these folks were not the ones who actually dropped the bomb or fired the weapon has already been alluded to by Senator HATCH, chairman of the Judiciary Committee--what they are trying to do is set degrees. Under that theory, bin Laden, responsible for planting the bombs in Kenya and Tanzania, would somehow be in a more favorable position. To put it another way, if you are a successful terrorist, you are going to be in a lot more trouble than an unsuccessful terrorist because you were captured by the FBI before you set off the bomb. 
   In this very booklet published by the administration, it gives a definition of terrorism: ``The term terrorism means premeditated''--we have concluded that--``politically motivated violence''--we have concluded that was the case--``perpetrated against noncombatants''--and I met the son who was 9 years old when his father was killed when he was simply having lunch in New York as a noncombatant--``by subnational groups or clandestine agents usually intended to influence an audience.'' 
   The point I am making is, all 16 whose sentences were commuted fit this definition to a T. They are terrorists. What does not match is the President's violation of the terms of how we deal with such people when it says ``make no concessions'' and he did, it says ``and strike no deals'' and he did. We can only hope and pray that law enforcement officers who were involved with this, families who were involved with this, are not now in harm's way, or the judge who sat in the adjudication of these cases and who was threatened to be assassinated by these people as he conducted the trial of the 16. 
   What a massive incongruity we face. We will shortly vote on this resolution. I very much hope this will be as successful as in the House so that international terrorists, law enforcement officials who put their lives on the line every day, and the victims of these terrorists will understand that the people's branch, the legislative branch of the U.S. Government, thinks these are the rules of the road when you deal with terrorists, that you do not make concessions, that you do not make deals, and that they are apprehended and, if apprehended, they are subsequently harshly dealt with and imprisoned accordingly. 
   The Presiding Officer is signaling me that my time is up.

   Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, at the end of July, beginning of August, the Congress, in an almost unprecedented fashion and with speed, passed a very significant tax relief bill in Washington. It has been the subject of much discussion and debate. 
   We could not find very accurate descriptions of this tax proposal, and so Senators and House Members who believed in tax relief went home, and for the last month they have held 500, 700 town halls. They have been throughout the country describing what the tax proposal actually is. 
   I remember being in a small city in the northern part of my State, Rome, GA, and saying, so far, I had read very little that adequately described what the totality of the tax proposal was. 
   I have just come from a press conference in the Senate gallery with House and Senate Members. I was taken by the fact that of the six or seven Members there, they all spoke of this mischaracterization they were struggling with when they initially got home. It was characterized as a very large tax bill that would disrupt Social Security and Medicare. There was very little understanding of the proposal, which is this: It is proposed that over the next 10 years, there will be some $3 trillion in surpluses. 
   Now, these surpluses are a product of the fact that over the last 4 years, a majority of the U.S. Congress has argued for balanced budgets and for financial constraint. That has produced a very positive economy and, indeed, we are now seeing these numbers that suggest there could be up to $3 trillion in surplus over the next 10 years. Well, what are Washington policymakers going to do about it? 
   At the end of July, the Congress passed this proposal. It said we would take 60 percent of all the surpluses and set it aside for Social Security. It would either be used for Social Security reform or to pay down debt. It assigned 17 percent of all these surpluses to Medicare, education, and domestic priorities to make sure that we keep Medicare sound and whole. It takes 23 percent of the surpluses and returns it to American workers--23 percent. 
   Now, Chairman Greenspan of the Federal Reserve is quoted all the time on this. He said this is what he would do with it. If he had his first choice, he would pay down the debt. Sixty percent of our proposal does that. He said his second choice would be tax relief. Twenty-three percent of our proposal does that. He said the last thing he would do would be to spend it; don't spend it, and even this proposal spends 17 percent of it. 
   So the debate we are having is over whether or not 23 percent of those surpluses should be returned to American workers or left in Washington to be spent. As Americans have understood this proposal, they have begun, in increasing numbers, to support it. A majority of Americans now believe the President should sign the tax relief proposal. I don't know if that will compel him to do so, but America has begun to understand that this is a very balanced, reasoned plan. 
   Why do we think this is so important? American workers today are paying the highest taxes they have paid since World War II. I will repeat that. American workers are paying at the highest tax level they have paid since World War II. About half of their paychecks are consumed by a government at some level--local, State, and Federal. I have said this before. If Thomas Jefferson were here today, he would faint; and when he woke up, he would be very mad that we had ever come to a point that government was taking half of what labor produces. That is what we face today. 
   Economic opportunity is a fundamental component of what makes American liberty work. It is a fact that Americans have had economic independence and they have turned into a people who are so bold, so visionary, so entrepreneurial, and so confident. We are a very confident people. It goes all the way back to the Revolution. American workers at that time were already the highest paid workers in the world. Since that time, we have seen what happens to a people who have their own independence. We must never take that away from the American psyche and culture. If we do, we will threaten the way American liberty has worked. 
   Therefore, this tax relief proposal is not some disjointed political venture. This tax relief proposal is instrumental in the nurturing of one of the fundamental principles of American liberty, i.e., economic independence. There is not a day in this town--and I have been here a little over 6 years, about the same time as the Presiding Officer--that somebody hasn't bemoaned the fact that there was something American families needed or ought to do that they can't: They don't have enough insurance, or some of them 
   don't have any; they don't have enough housing; they don't have enough to pursue the educational purposes they seek. 
   If the government is taking half of the resources away from them, are we surprised and shocked that these families don't have enough to accomplish the fundamental goals they seek, that they can't pay the insurance premiums? If the government would leave the money with the persons who earned it, they could solve those problems. 
   There is not a wizard, wonk, or bureaucrat in this city who can more appropriately determine what a family  needs to keep itself whole and healthy than the family itself. Therefore, there is no public policy that is more important than nurturing the economic liberty and keeping the checking accounts of American workers healthy so they can do what they have done for the last two-plus centuries. 
   Economic liberty is a fundamental component of American culture. That is what this tax relief proposal is about. It is about making sure more of those resources stay in those checking accounts. 
   When you take too much out of those checking accounts--which we have been historically doing now for about three decades-plus--you change the way Americans function. We are not who we are because of our genes. We are who we are because we have been free. When you reduce the resources American families have, you start seeing things you don't like to see. 
   Let me give you a couple of examples. This year, for the first time since the Great Depression, workers in the United States--our workers--will have a negative savings rate. What is left to save after the Government marches through the checking account? 
   If an average family in America is making $50,000 or $55,000 a year, and you take half of it away, is there enough left to get the job done? The answer is no. So there is nothing to save. So when there is a crisis, there is no ability to respond to it or to prepare adequately for retirement. If you leave the resources in those checking accounts, you will see the savings go up. They will have the resources to do the kinds of things they are supposed to do, including saving for problems or retirement. 
   Here is another one. Bankruptcies are at an all-time high. Credit card debt is at an all-time high. There are not enough resources in the checking accounts and so the behavior of these families begins to move in directions that are not as appropriate. That is going to continue as long as we continue to press and constrain and take too much out of the check of an American worker, an American family, and an American business. 
   I see that the distinguished Senator from Idaho has arrived. I don't want to infringe upon his time. I will yield the floor. Under the previous order, each of us has up to 15 minutes.

   Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I rise today in opposition to the amendment offered by the Senator from Virginia, Mr. ROBB, that will move to strike a section of the Interior appropriations bill that is not only important to the future of the management of our national forests, but critical to the taxpayers of this country. 
   Section 329 of the fiscal year 2000 Interior appropriations bill is a necessary clarification to the National Forest Management Act provision that requires the Forest Service to include wildlife diversity in its management of the national forests. A recent decision by the 11th Circuit Court determined that the Forest Service must conduct comprehensive wildlife population surveys in every area of each national forest that would be disturbed by a timber sale or any other management activity in order to authorize that activity. 
   This may seem like a simple requirement. However, in order to understand this amendment, you need to understand what types of surveys are currently being done and how expensive it would be to comply with the new recent decision. It is also important to know that this decision overturns 17 years of agency practice and is contrary to decisions in 3 other courts of appeal. 
   From 1982 until 1999, the Forest Service has consistently interpreted its rules implementing the wildlife diversity by inventorying habitat and analyzing existing population data when determining the effect of planning decisions on wildlife populations. During this same 17 year period, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth, Eighth, and Ninth Circuits have upheld the Forest Service's interpretation of its own rule, not to mention several lower courts. 
   Then this year the Eleventh Circuit overruled a lower court decision concerning one national forest in Georgia and found that the Forest Service, despite two decades of agency interpretation and performance and judicial opinions, must count every member of every species on the ground. This decision sets a standard never seen before in the management of our national forests. The cost estimate to carry out such a laborious task could be as high as $9 billion. That is almost three times the entire National Forest Service budget. This inventory standard is unachievable and sets a paralysis on the management of our national forests. 
   In my home State of Georgia, this decision threatens small saw mills that purchase their lumber from public lands as well as fisheries and wildlife projects, recreation, land exchanges and new facility construction such as trails and campgrounds. Section 329 will reapply the standard that the Forest Service has been using for the past 17 years, and allow for a balance between protection of wildlife and protection of public lands. 
   I strongly urge my colleagues to look beyond the rhetoric on this amendment and see that section 329 does not interfere with the judicial process, nor does it reverse current policy of the Forest Service or the Bureau of Land Management. It simply allows agencies to use the best information that is available to them to protect our national forests. I urge you to support sensible management and vote ``no'' on the amendment to strike the language of section 329.

   Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I commend both the Senator from Alabama and the Senator from Texas who preceded him on their remarks regarding this subject. 
   I am particularly taken with the personal experience the Senator from Alabama brings to this as a former prosecutor. He raises a point in conjunction with the exchange that occurred between the majority and minority leader about the timeliness of this. The minority leader suggested we can't really affect the President's decision--that is correct--and therefore we are under no mandate to speak hurriedly--wrong. 
   The Senator from Alabama talked about the duty and the honor of the law enforcement officials who put their lives on the line to stop this terrorist activity. He alluded to victims, two sons who lost their father in the tavern in New York. 
   The Senator from Alabama is making the case that there must be a voice in our Government that says to these people and the world that this divergence from policy about how the United States handles terrorism is not universally accepted here. In fact, there is massive objection. It is setting the record straight. Because of the speed with which the President has proceeded with this, a speed must occur that responds to it. There is no terrorist in the world, no law enforcement official, no living victim who does not understand what U.S. policy is with regard to terrorism, even if there is confusion in the White House.

   Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation that guarantees the future of a great historic treasure in my state. For nearly 200 years, the lighthouse at St. Simons Island, Georgia, stood as a sentinel at the head of St. Simons Sound and guided ships safely through dangerous waters and into the port of nearby Brunswick. Although it is no longer used for this purpose, the lighthouse remains an integral part of the St. Simons Island community and is part of the rich heritage of this region. Unfortunately, events could soon take place which could do irrevocable harm to this site. 
   In 1961, the United States Postal Service (USPS) leased part of the lighthouse property and built a small post office for the community, which is no longer used by the USPS. The lease was signed between the USPS and a private citizen, who owned the property at the time. This agreement, which expires in 2011, gives the USPS seven options to purchase the land outright at a significant discount, with the next purchase option being in 2001. 
   Since the lease was signed, many things have changed. In 1984, the title to the lighthouse property was transferred to the Coastal Georgia Historical Society, an organization dedicated  to preserving the lighthouse and Georgia's coastal heritage. While the CGHS holds the title, the lease with the USPS remains in effect. 
   It is very easy to see why many in the St. Simons community have grave concerns about the USPS exercising its right-to-buy option. The USPS has expressed its intent to exercise this option and immediately sell the land to a commercial developer for a huge profit. Many area residents do not appreciate the idea of placing a highrise hotel or a fast food restaurant next to the historic symbol of their community. 
   The bill I am introducing today seeks to rectify this situation by preserving the St. Simons Lighthouse without interfering with the profit maximization requirements placed on the USPS. The St. Simons Lighthouse Preservation Act states that the General Services Administration will locate a sufficient federal property of equal value to the leased property at St. Simons and deed it to the USPS. In exchange, the USPS will terminate its lease. 
   Passage of the St. Simons Lighthouse Preservation Act will ensure that future generations will be able to enjoy the Lighthouse and its environs. I encourage my colleagues to work with me to ensure quick passage of this important legislation.

   Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I rise to request that the Chairman of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee help me to clarify the intent of the Savannah Harbor Expansion Project that appears in Section 102 of the 1999 Water Resources Development Act. It is my understanding that this legislation authorizes a project to deepen the Savannah River channel to a depth of up to 48 feet subject to a favorable report by the Chief of Engineers and a favorable recommendation of the Secretary by December 31, 1998.

   Mr. COVERDELL. It is my understanding as well, that both the Chief of Engineer's Tier I Environmental Impact Statement and Feasibility Report provide for the establishment of a stakeholders' evaluation group which will have early and consistent involvement in the project, and as part of the process, the EIS requires the development of a mitigation plan to fully and adequately address predicted and potential adverse impacts on, among other things, the Savannah National Wildlife Refuge; striped bass population; short-nose sturgeon; salt water and fresh water wetlands; chloride levels; dissolved oxygen levels; erosion; and historical resources. Is that correct?

   Seventy-five percent of stockholders today have household incomes less than $75,000. The Coverdell-Torricelli amendment targets middle-class investors by exempting their first $1,000 capital gains from taxation, beginning in fiscal year 2006. This is a bipartisan amendment, which is also cosponsored by, as I said, Senators TORRICELLI, DOMENICI, BAYH, and ABRAHAM. It will wipe out the gains tax for millions of middle-class taxpayers and promote tax simplification. 
   I yield the remainder of my minute to the Senator from New Jersey.

   Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I would like to discuss an amendment that Senators TORRICELLI, MCCAIN, CRAIG, and I would like to offer--expansion of education savings accounts. Under our provision, parents, relatives, friends--anyone--would be allowed to contribute up to $2,000 per year, after tax, into an account where the proceeds could be withdrawn tax-free to pay for a child's K-12 education expenses. 
   Right now, the law allows parents to contribute up to $500 per year for a child's college education. We increase that amount to $2,000 per year and allow for tax-free withdrawals for K-12 educational expenses, as well. 
   Last Congress, this legislation passed the Senate with bipartisan majorities on two separate occasions. The bill passed with a vote of 56 to 43; while the conference report passed with a vote of 59 to 36. 
   On each occasion, the chairman of the Finance Committee supported the measure, and was in large part responsible for its successful passage. 
   Unfortunately, despite the bipartisan support for the bill, the opponents of this legislation ultimately prevailed and it was vetoed by President Clinton. 
   Because the House-passed tax-relief measure contains this provision, I would like to withdraw our amendment and ask the chairman of the Finance Committee, Senator ROTH, to support  the House position on this issue during the upcoming House-Senate conference negotiations.

   Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I think it might be useful for anybody listening to the debate to put this in some sequence. When the Nation discovered there would be projected surpluses of amounts that had not been anticipated, they changed all the dynamics of our discussions about budgets and Social Security. When the President gave us his budget, he spent about 40 percent of the Social Security receipts. 
   If there is one complaint you hear as you travel across the country, it is that people are unhappy when the Congress dips into the Social Security taxes that have been sent, purportedly, to prepare for the retirement of all those who participate. So when this Congress began, we got a budget from the President that spent 40 percent of those Social Security receipts. 
   Our side of the aisle said no. We are going to take the President at his admonishment over the years. We are not going to spend any of the Social Security receipts, and we are not going to use it for tax relief. It is going to be set aside and protected. Over the next 10 years, that is almost $2 trillion. 
   I might add, that does not solve all the issues that deal with Social Security. But it makes a pretty good downpayment on the problem. Everybody in America agrees that ought to be done. 
   After this debate was floated around the town for a while, I think the President realized it was not going to fly to propose to spend the Social Security receipts. So he said on June 28. That is just several weeks ago after being pummeled for 5 weeks that he should not be spending those receipts. He said, ``Social Security taxes should be saved for Social Security, period.'' He didn't say, ``and something else,'' or, ``Maybe we ought to talk about Medicare.'' We will talk about that in a minute. He said, ``Social Security taxes should be saved for Social Security, period.'' That was a big change. 
   We had our side of the aisle saying no Social Security receipts for anything but Social Security, and we had the President. 
   They brought it up in the House of Representatives. It was virtually unanimous with 415 votes. We are going to protect all the Social Security receipts. All that has to happen is for that to clear the Senate, and we say to America: We have made a monumental breakthrough. 
   What happened when it got to the Senate? Filibuster. 
   We have endeavored to go to the measure to debate it and to amend it five different times. I might add it would be subject to amendments to improve it and to have the ideas heard from the other side of the aisle. 
   But what was the response? Don't let the Senate get to the bill. Block it. 
   The latest ruse, which is this amendment, is to cloud it because they do not want to be responsible for blocking a sound measure to protect Social Security. They don't want to be responsible for that. They do not want headlines such as the New York Times that says ``Republicans Seize the Banner on Social Security.'' This has been their purview for years. Suddenly, they are in the position of having to cloud the issue because they do not want to be seen as being responsible for leaving all of those receipts out there that could be spent or used for some other issue. 
   We are prepared to pass a lockbox for Social Security--that none of those receipts would be spent on anything but Social Security, or the pay-down, and that they would not be used for tax relief. It would be a monumental breakthrough. 
   You can only conclude that, A, they don't want a lockbox because they want those funds to be available; and, B, that the reason they are coming forth with blocking going to the bill or an amendment--that gets into another subject--is to cloud the issue, which is they are blocking the ability of the Senate to concur with the President of the United States and the House of Representatives and give America a  lockbox that protects Social Security. It is not very complicated. 
   I will say one last thing. When you go to a town hall meeting and you talk to the American people, they do not want these two subjects mixed. They don't want them jumbled up. They want Social Security protected, and then they will consider what we are talking about on Medicare. They do not want the Government in their medicine cabinet. They don't want these two issues mudded. 
   Mr. President, I yield in accordance with the unanimous consent.

   Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, the F-22 has become a matter of great interest and controversy over the last several days because the House Appropriations Defense Subcommittee voted to bring a pause to the program; it took $1.8 billion out of it and redistributed it to other priorities. The problem is, if I might just take a moment to characterize it, nobody had any knowledge of the potential of this act--not the Defense Department, not the Air Force, not the contractors, not any parties who have been involved in development of the aircraft. 
   To step back for a moment, the decision as to this highly advanced weapons system and the decision to commit the Nation to its development is well over a decade old. The actual development of the aircraft began in 1991. We have now as a nation invested $20 billion in the development of this system; two of these unbelievable instruments of warfare are being tested in the air, and there is movement now to production of the first fighters. 
   My point is that after responsible commitments are made through three administrations and we have invested everything in its preparation and now  we are ready to harvest that decision, the only words that come to mind are, it is bizarre that out of the blue, with no hearings, no reflection, this decision just drops like a lead brick into the middle of all these circumstances. 
   I am going to read the letter written by Secretary Cohen on July 15 to Congressman BILL YOUNG, chairman of the Appropriations Committee. I think it begins to encapsulate the shock of what has happened. He says:  
   I was dismayed to learn about House Appropriations Defense Subcommittee's mark last Monday that cut $1.8 billion in procurement funding for the F-22 aircraft. The Department of Defense cannot accept this decision. This decision, if enacted, would for all practical purposes kill the F-22 program, the cornerstone of our nation's global air power in the 21st century. 
   For fifty years, every American soldier has gone to war confident that the United States had air superiority. Canceling the F-22 means we cannot guarantee air superiority in future conflicts. It would also have a significant impact on the viability of the Joint Strike Fighter Program. The F-22 will enable the Joint Strike Fighter to carry out its primary strike mission. The Joint Strike Fighter was not designed for the air superiority mission, and redesigning it to do so will dramatically increase the cost. An upgraded F-15 will not provide this dominance and will cost essentially the same as the F-22 program.  
   It goes on to say:  
   I know the difficult budget environment the Congress has to deal with these days. I support your efforts to give our nation the best possible defense at an affordable cost. However, I believe the nation's defense requires the F-22. The proposed cut jeopardizes our future warfighting capability and will place our forces at higher risk.

   Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, an article appeared on July 21 in the Marietta Daily Journal which further illuminates the nature of the Secretary's letter. It says:  
   Defense Secretary William Cohen criticized a House panel Tuesday--  
   This is the point I want to make--  
   for not consulting with the Pentagon before voting to suspend development of the Air Force's F-22 stealth fighter jet. 
   ``Neither I nor anyone in this building--or anyone in the Air Force--was aware of the effort underway on the part of the committee,'' Cohen told reporters during a photo-taking session [at the Department of Defense].  
   This underscores the point I was making that something of this magnitude, something of the sophistication of this system, something that we have invested $20 billion in, something that we have spent almost two decades getting ready to launch, is not managed in this manner. It is bizarre that you would find yourself at this point, and suddenly a subcommittee decides to overturn almost two decades of thought and preparation and planning. 
   As I said a moment ago, we have invested about $20 billion in this system up to this point. If you were to carry out and carry through to the end what the subcommittee has done--and it reappropriated $1.8 billion--we would lose another $6.5 billion. This House Appropriations Committee action would deteriorate and jeopardize the program and violate current contractual agreements between the Air Force and the contractor. 
   One Pentagon source told Defense Daily yesterday:  
   The $1.8 billion cut would result in $6.5 billion in total growth, $5.3 billion in production costs and $1.2 billion in engineering and manufacturing development costs.  
   In other words, you would not be saving $1.8 billion; you would have to bleed out another $6.5 billion. So by this time we would have $26, $27 billion in this weapons system--almost two decades--but no fighters. 
   Anytime you develop a system of that magnitude, there have been issues that surround it. But they have all been managed. Extensive congressional oversight has been very significant over the development of the aircraft. Its problems have been dealt with and managed. As I said, we are at the point of actually inheriting this unique fighter. 
   There was an article in the Washington Post this morning by Richard Hallion. I will read a couple paragraphs.  
   There was some irony in the House Appropriations Committee's canceling production funding last week for the Air Force's next generation fighter--the Lockheed-Martin F-22 Raptor. The action came only weeks after America's military forces proved--for the third time since 1990--that exploiting dominant aerospace power is the irreplaceable keystone of our post-Cold War strategy for successful quick-response crisis intervention.  
   I believe everybody at this point, after the Persian Gulf, after Iraq and Kosovo, is looking anew at traditional war strategy. Who would have ever thought you could have flown the thousands of sorties that were involved in Kosovo with no combat casualties?  
   No issue has been more misunderstood than the F-22. The plane links radar-evading stealth with the ability to cruise at supersonic speeds and to exploit and display data from various sources to better inform the pilot about threats and opportunities.

   Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, my amendment ensures the Small Business Administration's Drug-Free Workplace demonstration moves forward. I want to thank Senators KYL, SESSIONS, ABRAHAM, DEWINE and SNOWE for joining me in this effort. I also want to express my sincere appreciation to Senators BOND, GREGG, and HOLLINGS, as well as their staffs for their cooperation. 
   Last year, the Drug Free Workplace Act received broad bipartisan support when it was enacted. The House passed it 402-9, and the Senate Committee on Small Business endorsed it without opposition. We see this program as a critical opportunity to assist small businesses who are grappling with the hardships of drug abuse in the workplace. 
   The funding included in the FY2000 Commerce, Justice, State Appropriations bill, will enable these demonstrations to go forward. The Small Business Administration's initial grant applications indicate there is tremendous need for drug-free workplace programs. It has been reported that no less than 146 qualified grant applications were submitted to SBA for FY1999 funding, but no more than 30 will be funded. At least 116 of these qualified potential drug-free workplace demonstration programs will go unfunded leaving $12 million in unmet need. 
   Again, I look forward to working with my colleagues to ensure the Drug-Free Workplace demonstration continues to receive the support of Congress.

   Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, as Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee on Western Hemisphere, I have spent years addressing the drug problem that confronts our nation. I personally have visited drug source and transit countries throughout the region with the objective of searching for ways to resolve and overcome this escalating problem. As a result of many hearings and meetings on this important matter, last year Senator DEWINE and I introduced the Western Hemisphere Drug Elimination Act, a $2.7 billion--3 year authorization for enhanced drug eradication and interdiction efforts. We were successful in getting this legislation passed into law and providing a $800 million down payment for this bill. We must continue to fund this important law. 
   Recognizing that US government resources are limited, it is important to fund agencies that can get a huge return on a small investment. the Drug Enforcement Administration indeed is an agency that demonstrates this objective on a daily basis. With limited funding, the DEA is a vital source not only for our law enforcement activities, but for other nations as well. Relying primarily on manpower, the DEA has demonstrated how effective an agency with limited funding can produce significant results. Last year, the DEA seized more drugs and arrested more traffickers than ever before. They play an integral part in training foreign law enforcement officials overseas to help them help us keep drugs out of our country. they do a great service to our nation. 
   This past March, Senators DEWINE and I sent a letter to the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Commerce, State, Justice Subcommittee, calling for building on this year's investment in the DEA and requesting additional funding for 300 new DEA agent, analysts and support personnel, and for other DEA initiatives. This request is consistent with DEA initiatives outlined in the Western Hemisphere Drug Elimination Act. Specifically, 16 senators--both Republicans and Democrats--co-signed the letter to the Chairman and Ranking Member. 
   I thank the Subcommittee for addressing our needs in our request. The Subcommittee earmarked $17.5 million for new hires for DEA agents, analysts, and support staff. I recognize this was a difficult task given the tight budget caps confronting this Subcommittee and the other Appropriations subcommittees. While I appreciate the tremendous efforts made by the Subcommittee and their staff to earmark money for new DEA hires within their account, I am concerned that there isn't any additional funding for the DEA. The DEA will have to sacrifice other important and necessary programs for these new hires. 
   I realize that the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Commerce, Justice, State Subcommittee are trying to complete the bill this evening. I had intended to offer an amendment to request $24 million in additional DEA funding for new agents, analysts and support staff hires. After talking to the Subcommittee leadership, however, I have instead agreed not to offer my amendment and would commit to working with the Commerce, Justice, State Subcommittee to help find a way to provide additional funding to the DEA during conference of this bill. 
   Mr. President, I see Senator DEWINE on the floor and understand that he too would like to say a few words on this matter. I yield the floor to my distinguished colleague from Ohio.

<TEXT>
   Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, the amendment just sent to the desk, it is my understanding, has now been agreed to by both sides, which Senator FEINSTEIN and I are most happy about. 
   This piece of legislation evolved earlier in the year. Senator FEINSTEIN will speak for herself, but she and I have been engaged in the issue of narcotics trafficking in our hemisphere and in the world and have become deeply worried about its effect on the United States and have envisioned this as a new tool for our Government. 
   To give you a bit of a background, the International Emergency Economic Powers Act is a follow on to the former Trading With The Enemy Act. Its purpose is to stop all economic activity, commerce, trade, and finance with rogue nations, such as Libya and North Korea, that are national security threats to the United States. 
   In 1995, President Clinton expanded this act through an executive order to include specially designated narcotics traffickers. As issued, the President's executive order applies to four drug traffickers affiliated with the Colombian Cali cartel. The goal was and remains to completely isolate the targeted drug traffickers. The executive order that the President issued in 1995 blocks any financial, commercial and/or business dealings with any entity associated with the four named drug traffickers, to include criminal associates, associated family members, related businesses and financial accounts. 
   What would this amendment accomplish? It takes the President's 1995 Executive order and codifies it in the law and expands it to include other foreign narcotic traffickers deemed as a threat to our national security. 
   It freezes the assets of drug traffickers under U.S. jurisdiction and cuts off their ability to do business in the United States. 
   There is the arrow pointed at the problem. It begins to isolate these nefarious forces and their effect on the United States. 
   As under the President's Executive order, the Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control would develop a list of specially designated narcotics traffickers in consultation with the Department of Justice and the Department of State. Anyone who appears on the list is prohibited from conducting any economic activity with the United States. 
   American firms or individuals who violate this prohibition will be subject to significant financial penalty and potential prison terms. The Treasury Office of Foreign Assets would enforce the sanctions, which carry criminal penalties of up to $500,000 per violation for corporations, and $250,000 for individuals, as well as up to 10 years in prison. 
   The goal is to provide another weapon in the war on drugs by completely isolating targeted drug traffickers. 
   Taking legitimate U.S. dollars out of drug dealers' pockets is a vital step in destroying their ability to traffic narcotics across our borders. This is a bold but necessary tool to fight the war on drugs. 
   Let me say before I turn to the distinguished Senator from California, as early as 1 hour ago I was in communication with 
   representatives of the Treasury Department and the administration of a willingness to continue as this legislation works its way through the Congress to work with them to perfect the legislation. It is an important new tool. It is premised on an action this President has already emboldened and taken and simply expands it. 
   We must confront the growing strength of impunity of drug cartels. Several months ago former DEA Administrator, Tom Constantine, testified about Mexican drug cartels. He said:  
   Organized crime groups from Mexico continue to pose a grave threat to the citizens of the United States. In my lifetime, I have never witnessed any group of criminals who have had such a terrible impact on so many individuals and communities in our Nation.  
   Of course, this is not Mexico-specific. This is a broad tool to deal with narcotics and their activities anywhere in the world. With drugs continuing to pour across our border, there is no other way to think about drug trafficking than as a fundamental threat to our national security. 
   Several years ago, in a meeting with the President of Mexico, President Zedillo, he said--and he has said such publicly since--that there is no threat as dangerous to the security of the Republic of Mexico as the narcotics traffickers. 
   We must use every weapon in our arsenal to strike at the heart of this scourge--those who traffic these drugs. By expanding the use of the President's international emergency economic powers to target drug kingpins and their empires, we can work year-round to help drive these traffickers out of business--no matter where they exist. 
   I thank my colleague, the Senator from California, not only for her work in perfecting this amendment but for her ongoing work and concern about the effects of narcotics on the stability of the democracies in this hemisphere, and, of course, its effect--its dramatic effect--on the citizens of the United States. 
   I am reminded--as we talked during several debates about things that are so critically important to us--and we might be reminded that 14,000 people a year die of the narcotic impact, not to mention 100,000 crack babies. The list goes on and on. 
   There is no segment of public policy that is any more important. There are some that are as important but none any more important with regard to the safety of the people of the United States--and, for that matter, this hemisphere--than our work on narcotics and the peripheral issues that deal with it. 
   I yield the remainder of my time to the Senator from California.

   Mr. COVERDELL. Do I have 14 minutes remaining? Thank you. 
   Mr. President, let me, first of all, thank all of these speakers. In their own way, each pointed out the effect of a circumstance in which working American families are paying the highest taxes they have ever paid. These numbers begin to back into each other, but if you get down to the bottom line, what we are talking about is that American workers today are keeping just over half their paycheck--about 52 cents. If they kept two-thirds of their paycheck, which I think everybody in the country would agree at a minimum would be appropriate, they would have about $7,000 a year in their checking accounts. 
   We have just spent a fierce week of debate arguing about how people deal with prescription drugs and the Patients' Bill of Rights and the needs of American families. The problem is, we have taken so much out of those folks' checking accounts they do have to start looking to some other place to take care of these problems. Obviously, if every working family had $7,000 more in their checking accounts, the problem of a $2,000 drug bill or an additional educational requirement could be facilitated. 
   We have created, by these enormous tax levels, massive pressure on American working families. I will give you two immediate manifestations of what this does, and there are many. 
   One of them is that American families this year, for the first time, have a negative savings rate. 
   In other words, they are in the red in terms of the amount of money they are saving each year. The reason is, if somebody--the Government--goes into their checking account and takes over half what they make, there is not enough left to save. In fact, there is not enough disposable income left to do what that family is supposed to do. Education, housing, transportation, and health needs are all impaired because we have taken those resources and moved them away. 
   There are people in this city who believe they can make better decisions about where that money ought to go. If you are interested in tax relief, economic relief, leaving those funds in those families' checking accounts, you are a person who believes they make a better decision about what they need, they make a more efficient decision, they make a more intelligent decision about what the requirements are in that family than some bureaucrat buried in the basement of one of these buildings in Washington, DC. 
   They know whether they have a special education problem. They know whether they can afford and need more health insurance or not. They know whether or not they have a housing requirement or transportation requirement. 
   There is absolutely no way this city, despite all the intellect, can figure out what are the specific needs of an individual family. The best thing we can do for middle America, the best policy we can enact, is to get more resources into their checking accounts. They worked for it; they earned it. 
   If Thomas Jefferson were here today, he would faint that we had come to the point where nearly half the resources of working families are sent off to the Government. If he woke up, he would be furious that this condition had ever been imposed. So 
   American families are not saving. 
   Also, we have the highest bankruptcy rates in contemporary history. Why is that? Once again, it is a reaction to all the pressures we put on working families across the country. We are taking too much of their paychecks and moving those resources away from them to Washington for others to decide what to do with it, leaving those families without the resources necessary to do what they have always done for America. 
   Mr. President, I am going to conclude. I know there are several other Senators who have remarks to make on other subjects. 
   In my judgment, there is no single policy more deserving of our attention than that of focusing on how to lower the highest tax levels in American history, how to return resources to the  checking accounts of our average American families so they are empowered to do the things they need to do to make America great. 
   There are three pillars of American freedom. One is economic opportunity, the second is safety of persons and property, and the third is an educated mind. We have ratcheted down economic opportunity to a point where it is changing the behavior and the way Americans function and act. It is robbing them of the dreams and the visions that have been such a special part of America. 
   This is the time, the perfect time, for us to be conscious of this, to leave those resources in those checking accounts and empower those families to build not only their family, their community, but their Nation, the United States of America. 
   I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, today I rise to offer a joint resolution to grant congressional consent to an Interstate Compact between my state of Georgia and the state of South Carolina which resolves a border dispute whose origin dates back to the Articles of Confederation between the two states. On June 25, 1990, the Supreme Court in Georgia vs. South Carolina (No. 74, Original) ruled that Georgia lost sovereignty over the Barnwell Islands in the Savannah River to South Carolina. These islands had shifted due to erosion and accretion since the time of the first scientifically accurate survey of the area in 1855. The Supreme Court further ordered the two states to determine a new boundary and submit it to the Court for final approval. 
   During the summer of 1993, the two states with the assistance of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) reached an agreement on a common boundary. Subsequently, the agreement was adopted by the Georgia General Assembly on April 5, 1994, and by the South Carolina General Assembly on May 29, 1996. 
   On May 26, 1999, the agreed boundary was forwarded to Congress for its approval in accordance with the U.S. Constitution Article IV, Section 10. This Compact once adopted will amend the Beaufort Convention of 1787. 
   With passage of this resolution, granting Congress' consent to the Georgia-South Carolina Interstate Compact, Congress will have fulfilled its obligation, and the agreed upon boundary will be presented to the Supreme Court for its final approval and application. I am pleased to have my colleagues from South Carolina, Senators THURMOND and HOLLINGS, and my colleague from Georgia, Senator CLELAND, join me in sponsoring this historic piece of legislation. In this day, where members from both sides of the aisle are speaking of the need for more bipartisanship, I would like to commend these two great states for coming together and reaching an agreement on such a contentious issue and ask for the full Senate's support for this important and necessary legislation.

   Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I would like to engage the esteemed chairman on a matter important to out Nation's Federal law enforcement training and the Glynco, GA site at which this training is conducted. As the chairman knows, the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center was developed to consolidate federal law enforcement training. This was done to ensure efficiency, prevent redundancy, and save taxpayer dollars. The Chairman is also aware that FLETC has a five year plan for its sites in Artesia, NM and Glynco, GA to modernize the facilities and address a training overflow issue. I understand that the Chairman's bill preserves FLETC's intent and keeps the five-year plan moving  into the next fiscal year. Understanding the Chairman's work continues FLETC's viability, will he be willing to communicate to the Treasury Department not only his commitment to this program but his desire to see that Treasury take steps towards funding design money for two dormitories at Glynco during this fiscal year?

   Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I would like to bring to the attention of the chairman the tremendous need for the speedy assignment of additional Customs Inspectors for Hartsfield Atlanta International Airport. 
   There has been a 100% increase in the number of international gates at Hartsfield from 1994 to 1999 and yet only a 14% increase in Customs Inspectors during the same period. In addition, there has been a 102% increase in metric tons of cargo and no increase in inspectors to handle that growth. 
   Hartsfield airport officials and the business community believe this lack of Customs Inspectors to handle the rapid growth in both passengers and cargo will soon place the airport at a serious competitive disadvantage. It is my understanding that millions of dollars a year will be lost by business travelers and industries in the Atlanta region due to inefficient movement of passengers and goods if this problem is not addressed soon.

   Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I am going to read several of the statements made by Mr. Curtis in the op-ed. He says:  
   For the past 10 years, as a black psychiatrist specializing in addiction, I have warned about the dangers of needle-exchange policies, which hurt not only individual addicts but also poor and minority communities. 
   There is no evidence that such programs work....... 
   Studies in Montreal and Vancouver ..... found that those addicts who took part in such exchanges were two to three times more likely to become infected with HIV than those who did not participate. They also found that almost half the addicts frequently shared needles with others anyway....... 
   Needle-exchange programs are reckless experiments....... 
   Needle exchanges also affect poor communities adversely. For instance, the Lower East Side Harm Reduction Center is one of New York City's largest needle-exchange programs. According to tenant groups I talked to, the center, since it began in 1992, has become a magnet not only for addicts but for dealers as well....... 
   The indisputable fact is that needle exchanges merely help addicts continue to use drugs.......  
   Mr. President, I point out the last time that an amendment like this appeared before the Senate, it was adopted 96-4. 
   General McCaffrey, the Nation's drug czar, says:  
   As public servants, citizens and parents, we owe our children an unambiguous no use message. And if they should become ensnared in drugs, we must offer them a way out, not a means to continue addictive behavior.  
   He goes on to say:  
   The problem is not dirty needles, the problem is heroin addiction ..... the focus should be on bringing help to the suffering population--not giving them more effective means to continue their addiction. One doesn't want to facilitate this dreadful scourge on mankind.  
   A spokesman for the Office of Drug Control Policy also said that ``addicts who took part in needle-exchange programs in Vancouver and Montreal had higher HIV infection rates than addicts who did not participate.'' 
   Just a word or two about the Vancouver experiment. In the case of Vancouver's needle exchange program, one of the biggest in the world, studies show that intravenous drug use increased by 20 percent and deaths from overdose have increased five-fold since 1988 when the program started. Some needle exchange programs actually encourage cocaine and crack injection providing so-called safe crack kits with instructions on how to inject crack intravenously. 
   I have one of the kit's brochures. It is the one issued by the Bridgeport Needle Exchange Program in Bridgeport, CT. It makes an interesting menu. It starts off:  
   Get your stuff ready. 
   Have a cooker, water, syringe, citric or ascorbic acid, cotton and alcohol wipes ready. 
   Put crack and citric or ascorbic acid (about a pinch to a slab), in a cooker. Add plenty of water (about) 30 to 40 I.U. of water. Smash and mix well. 
   Add cotton and draw up into the syringe. 
   Get your vein ready. 
   Tie off, find a good vein and clean with a alcoholic wipe. 
   Inject, make sure you are in a vein, register, look for blood back flow in syringe. 
   Slowly push plunger in for injection. This helps to avoid vein trauma and collapse. 
   Withdraw needle. Apply pressure for about a minute. Use clean gauze tissue.......  
   Well, anyway, it goes on to say: Take care of yourself. Use vitamin C, eat a good diet, and things will be just fine. 
   I agree with General McCaffrey. I especially agree that in the Nation's Capital we do not want to send the messages of a needle exchange program. 
   I ask unanimous consent that Senator ASHCROFT of Missouri be added as a cosponsor to my amendment.

   Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleagues, Senator BURNS and Senator DEWINE, to offer an amendment to the Foreign Operations Appropriations bill. This amendment would provide $10 million to the State Department Bureau of International Law Enforcement Affairs  for mycoherbicide research and development to be used for narcotic crop eradication. The appropriations bill, as it currently stands, provides no funding for this important tool in our war against illegal drugs. 
   Many of my colleagues and I view this mycoherbicide technology as a promising new tool that will reduce the cultivation and supply of narcotic crops, and thereby increasing our capacity to combat illegal drugs. I have been briefed on the mycoherbicide technology and understand that it is a naturally occurring plant pathogen that can be introduced into an area to control a target plant species. The program is also environmentally friendly--it posses no threat to humans or animals, other crops, or water supply and replaces the use of harmful chemicals. In addition, the program is a cost effective tool in our war on drugs. The mycoherbicides will remain in the soil for an extended period of time, for up to 40 years, and costs a fraction of the $2.65 billion we spend on other supply reduction methods. 
   I remind my colleagues that Congress has recognized the importance of this technology and its ability to eradicate deadly crops when it endorsed the program last year in the Western Hemisphere Drug Elimination Act. The program was funded in the amount of $23 million for fiscal year 1999. I strongly urge my colleagues to continue their support for this program by passing this amendment and supporting the continued development of the mycoherbicide program. 
   Mr. President, as illegal drugs continue to cross our borders and threaten the welfare of American citizens, this program is a top priority that can significantly reduce the production of narcotics crops. We know that elimination of illicit crops is the best way of preventing deadly drugs from reaching our streets and destroying untold lives and communities. I urge my colleagues to join with Senator BURNS, Senator DEWINE and me in support of this amendment and in support of this important program.

   Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I rise today to express my concern about the proposed reduction of funding for the Peace Corps in this foreign operations appropriations bill--a reduction that is contrary to the will of Congress as expressed by the overwhelming, bipartisan support for the Peace Corps Reauthorization Act, which passed unanimously this session in both Houses of Congress. 
   I am mindful of the constraints imposed by the lower allocations to the appropriators. But Congress has spoken affirmatively on the issue of increased funding for the Peace Corps. The authorizing committee and, then, this body, supported the bill by unanimous consent. A few months earlier, the House passed the measure by a vote of 326-90. President Clinton immediately signed the bill in May. 
   Mr. President, as chairman of the authorizing committee for the Peace Corps, I worked with the committees' ranking Member and former Peace Corps Volunteer, Senator DODD, to sponsor the Peace Corps Act. The Act authorizes a 12 percent increase for Fiscal Year 2000 and is part of a multiyear plan to enable the Peace Corps to reach its goal of 10,000 Volunteers by 2003. Reaching this mark has been a long-standing goal of Congress--a goal set into law in 1985. 
   Despite the consistent endorsement of the growth plan, the Appropriations Committee has recommended a $50 million reduction in funding from the authorized amount (and $20 million less than the Peace Corps current budget of $240 million). This appropriation is ill-advised. If enacted, it would deny the Peace Corps the opportunity to reach its goal of 10,000 Volunteers serving abroad. And, even worse, it would force the Agency to cut the current level of Volunteers by over 1,000 (That is, from 6,700 to 5,700) Volunteers). 
   I recognize the constraints under which the Peace Corps and all federal programs must operate. For that reason, I have been a close observer of the Peace Corps activities, as has Senator DODD, in exercising our oversight responsibilities. I remain confident that the Peace Corps remains the best foreign assistance program of its kind, and that it has systems in place to continue fielding Volunteers responsibly and efficiently. Part of the genius of the Peace Corps is its ability to use a relatively small amount of money to do big things. Even if the Peace Corps received full funding at $270 million, the amount would be about 1 percent of our foreign aid budget. 
   Mr. President, I believe that the Peace Corps is well prepared to begin implementation of the multi-year plan. I urge the appropriators to join the Members of Congress from both sides of the aisle and in both Houses who have overwhelmingly endorsed this worthy goal.

   Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, first, I compliment the Senator from Minnesota for organizing and bringing this meeting together on the question of tax relief and for the powerful statement he just made in support of giving relief to American workers so they can keep more of what they earn in their checking accounts rather than sending it off to bureaucrats--locally, in the State, and federally. 
   In the last few days, President Clinton has joined in calling for a strong lockbox to protect Social Security. I am pleased to see this. For the last month, we have been fighting a filibuster from the other side of the aisle on this concept of setting a procedure in place that would make sure Social Security receipts have a new protection device. Hopefully, because the President has now said he supports it, the other side of the aisle will drop their filibuster and we can get on with our proposal to be more protective of Social Security receipts. 
   Second, the President has said he will now support tax relief. That is important. But tax relief can have a lot of definitions. 
   Our view of tax relief is that it should be across the board, that everybody should participate, and that the savings which families keep in their checking accounts be used for the decisions those families want to make: Do they need more health insurance? Do they need to pay school tuition? Do they have a leak in the roof? Do they need a new car? 
   The President's definition of tax relief is that you get it if you do something he wants, for instances if you put a solar panel on your roof or if you buy an electric car, if you can find one. That is behavioral relief. In other words, if you begin to live your life the way we in Washington think you should live it, you will get a break, but we are not going to let you decide what you ought to do. 
   I would suggest that the tax relief proposal, which is growing in size, ought to be looked at very seriously. I will come to that in just a minute. But let's just talk for a second or two about why tax relief is so important to American families. 
   First, as was said by the Senator from Minnesota, they are paying the highest taxes they have paid since World War II, which, given the extended periods of general peace, is unconscionable. 
   This year, American families will have a negative savings rate. That has not happened since the Depression. If you read what several pundits in the country have written, they say it is because American families are greedy. Hogwash. What it is, the Government has been taking more and more of what they earn, and the disposable income, the income they have left to use, is barely enough. In fact, in many cases it is not enough to manage their families so there is nothing left to save, and they are not saving. 
   That means those families cannot face off an emergency. If somebody loses a job or there is some loss of income, the rent cannot get paid. If there is an unexpected illness, an unexpected educational cost, an emergency, there are no savings in America to deal with that. So you put a whole arena of anxiety across the breadth of the land. 
   I am not going to overdetail this because of the time we have, but I, Senator TORRICELLI--it is bipartisan, bipartisan in the House, Republican and Democrat with leadership--Senator LOTT, 
   Senator GRAMM of Texas, the chairman of the Banking Committee, are all coauthors of a concept that takes the first tax bracket, which is 15  percent, and increases dramatically the number of people who are in that minimum tax bracket. 
   So everybody would share equally. But the effect is that about 7 million people would be pushed down into that lowest tax bracket. Then the first $500 of interest that family earns from the savings account would not be taxed. That means about $100 billion over the next 10 years would be saved by those families, and 30 million of those families would have no tax on their savings accounts. 
   So what we have is a plan that benefits 110 million taxpayers, 30 million of which would be saving tax free, 10 million of which would no longer pay capital gains tax, and 7 million middle-income taxpayers would be returned to the lowest tax bracket. 
   But we do not tell them what to do with their savings; they can figure that out. It isn't designed to cause them to live in a loft or to use a solar panel or a windmill. It is designed to let them keep more of their income so they can more effectively manage their families and their lives. 
   Incidentally, this is the only tax plan that has been endorsed by the New York Stock Exchange. It is right on target, because pushing people into the lowest tax bracket is helping them save, and it is simplifying the Tax Code. 
   I hope that every succeeding year we can take another million-plus taxpayers and push them down into this 15-percent tax bracket. One day we might even get to the point that almost all Americans are there. 
   So this is a time for tax relief. Americans are paying the highest taxes they have paid since World War II. They have no savings, and therefore they do not run their families as effectively as they could. We all know the results of that. So this is broad public policy that needs the attention of the President and the Congress. It is the right thing to do, and this is the right time to do it. 
   I yield back to the floor manager. 
   Mr. GRAMS addressed the Chair.

   Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, there is no community in America that is suffering more difficulty today than rural America in agribusiness. My State is a very large agriculture-based State, and ever since I have been in the Senate, we have been struggling with drought, flood, low commodity prices--you name it. It has been very unsettling to families that have been in agribusiness for over a hundred years, that are facing very difficult personal decisions about their ability to stay in business. 
   Now, to be candid, by now we should have passed S. 1233, a $60.7 billion budget authority for agriculture, rural development, and nutrition programs. The bill contains provisions for food stamps, child nutrition, payments to the Federal Crop Insurance Program, Commodity Credit Corporation, and discretionary spending for agricultural purposes. It is the people's business because agriculture is the cornerstone of our national security, our quality of life, and our economy. In our State, agriculture is one-third of the economy, and across the Nation it approaches 30 percent. 
   We are stalled for political purposes. We ought to be doing the Nation's business. We ought to be proceeding with this agriculture bill. This is not the time to have a debate between two very different views about how to deal with the Patients' Bill of Rights. I am stunned that those on the other side of the aisle would choose agriculture--which, as I said, is so terribly stressed--and use that as a vehicle to try to create a political debate in the Senate. I have letters from our school of agriculture, I have documentation of the massive losses that have occurred in agriculture in our State, and we look to this legislation to be a part of the relief, a part of stabilizing agriculture in our State. 
   Last year alone, we lost $700 million in agriculture interests in the State of Georgia. I will tell you what this reminds me of. It is an uncaring kind of way of dealing with this legislation. It reminds me of the way the administration handled disaster relief. In the omnibus bill of 1998, we gave the Department of Agriculture $3 billion for disaster payments, and October went by, and November went by, December, January, February, March, April, May, and June; and finally, 9 months later, we got disaster payments into the hands of people who have long since passed financing requirements and planning decisions and the like. And here we are once again trying to deal with this critical bill, and we have basically a political filibuster underway that can do nothing but add to more anxiety and worry in this very important economic sector of our country dealing with thousands upon thousands of families every day. 
   We ought to be on with the business of getting this agricultural appropriations bill handled. We will find the right time to handle these other issues. But right now, it is time for the people's business, and it happens to be a group of people who are in deep trouble in America. 
   I yield the floor. 
   Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I bring to the attention of the chairman, other members of the Appropriations Committee, and the Senate--the International Radioecology Laboratory, commonly referred to as IRL, in Slavutych, Ukraine--which was dedicated last month by the U.S. Department of Energy. The IRL was established in July, 1998 by an agreement between the governments of the United States and the Ukraine to facilitate the critical research being conducted near the Chernobyl nuclear site on the long-term health and environmental effects of the world's worst nuclear accident. Construction of the IRL will be completed by fall, 1999. The IRL is managed by the Savannah River Ecology Laboratory, also known as SREL, of the University of Georgia and funded through cooperative agreements by the Department of Energy. 
   Led by Dr. Ron Chesser of SREL, highly integrated research scientists from the University of Georgia, Texas Tech, Texas A & M, the Illinois State Museum, Purdue University, Colorado State University, Ukraine and Russia have been involved in cooperative research in the Chernobyl region since 1992. These efforts have significant importance regarding the long-term risks in the Chernobyl area itself, but also for predicting the environmental consequences of future radioactive releases. 
   The new IRL will serve as the primary facility from which radioecology research activities are directed and will be the central point for collaboration among scientists worldwide concerned with the effects of environmental radiation. 
   The Savannah River Ecology Laboratory has proposed a new 5-year research initiative at the IRL to be administered through the Office of International Nuclear Safety Cooperation Program at the Department of Energy. This ambitious research project would carry out the goals of the United States-Ukraine 1998 agreement to: (1) understand the effects of the pollution from the Chernobyl disaster on forms of life; (2) provide data needed to make wise decisions concerning environmental and human health risks and the effectiveness of clean-up activities; and (3) develop strategic plans for the potential of future radiation releases. I am disappointed that this new initiative was not specifically funded in the FY 2000 Energy and Water Appropriations bill approved by the Committee and I would urge the Chairman to do all he can to find the necessary funds for this important project when the FY 2000 Energy and Water Appropriations bill goes to conference.

   Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, as the chairman knows, several projects from the great state of Georgia found funding in the Committee's appropriations report now before us. I applaud the attention and support provided by the Subcommittee to fund these important activities. In particular, I speak of the funding for Brunswick and Savannah Harbor maintenance and the Army Corps of Engineers' investigations of Brunswick Harbor and the Savannah Harbor Expansion. The Brunswick and Savannah Harbor expansion projects found earlier authorization in the Water Resources Development Act of 1999 (WRDA) which recently passed the Senate.

   Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, today I introduce the National Forensic Science Improvement Act, a bill designed to address the growing backlog in our nation's crime labs. Across the country, state and local crime labs, Medical Examiners' and Coroners' offices face alarming shortages in forensic science resources. While other areas of our criminal justice system such as the courts and prison systems have benefitted from federal assistance, the highly technical and expensive forensic sciences have received little attention. Mr. President, my bill will help correct this problem. 
   There are 600 qualified state and local crime laboratories in the United States which deliver 90% of the total forensic science services in this country. In a 1996 national survey of 299 crime labs it was found that 8 out of 10 labs have experienced a growth in the caseload which exceeds the growth in budget and/or staff. Mr. President, I need go no further to demonstrate that this is a national problem. Without the swift processing of evidence our criminal justice system cannot operate as it is intended. I believe it is time to take a step to address specifically the problems our crime labs face. 
   The National Forensic Science Improvement Act has been endorsed by organizations such as the National Governors Association, the National Association of Attorneys General, the Association of State Criminal Investigative Agencies and the International Association of Chiefs of Police who see it as a flexible approach to a problem that indeed has far-ranging consequences. Mr. President, it is my belief that Congress must work to ensure justice in this country is neither delayed nor denied. Right now across the country backlogs in crime labs are denying the swift administration of justice and with this bill we have a ready solution. 
   In crafting this bill I have worked closely with the Georgia Bureau of Investigation which is suffering heavily under a growing caseload. At its headquarters in Decatur, GA the GBI has a number of cataloging systems that are not yet computerized. Further, they lack the funding to create computer networks that would connect not only their forensic equipment with internal computers, but would also allow them to share information with crime labs across the country. While the Governor has taken steps to provide the GBI with more funding for forensic sciences, it remains clear that federal assistance is needed. 
   Last year the Senate passed the Crime Identification Technology Act. This important measure, which I supported, was a good step towards improving the technology employed by law enforcement across the country. I believe my bill is the next logical step in this body's effort to improve the manner in which justice is administered in this country.

   Mr. COVERDELL. As the committee noted in its report on S. 1122, the Marine Corps' Chemical Biological Incident Response Force, also known as CBIRF, has an important responsibility in responding to chemical/biological threats and that their activities should be fully integrated with the Department's chemical-biological defense program. It is my understanding that the Marine Corps is prepared to conduct a coordinated civilian and military chemical incident demonstration that would integrate sophisticated sensor technology like that interferometric sensors I just mentioned, into a detection network. My area of the country would make an ideal place for such a demonstration because of the presence of chemical agents and demilitarization facilities in the region and because the region has been the target of terrorist activities in the past. Does the committee agree that such a joint civilian and military exercise is an appropriate part of developing chemical and biological detection technologies and can be funded out of the additional funds made available by the committee under Marine Corps Program Wide Support?

    Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague from California, Senator FEINSTEIN, in introducing legislation that will intensify our fight against the terrible scourge of drugs. A version of this bill was originally introduced on March 2. Since then, we have conferred with various agencies, including the Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control, the Department of Justice, and the Office of National Drug Control Policy. All are supportive of this concept. The current bill includes some of their comments and suggestions. 
   Simply put, Mr. President, this legislation decertifies the drug kingpins by preventing them, and any of their associates or associated campanies, from conducting business with the United States. The bill codifies and expands a 1995 Executive Order created under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), which targeted Colombia drug traffickers. The bill expands the existing Executive Order to include other foreign drug traffickers considered a threat to our national security. The bill freezes the assets of the identified drug traffickers and their associates and prohibits these individuals and organizations from conducting any financial or commercial dealings with the United States. 
   In the case of the Cali cartel in Colombia, this tool was remarkably effective in weakening the drug kingpins. The United States targeted over 150 companies and nearly 300 individuals involved in the ownership and management of the Colombian drug cartels' non-narcotics business empire, everything from drugstores to poultry farms. Once labeled as drug-linked businesses, these companies found themselves financially isolated. Banks and legitimate companies chose not to do business with the blacklisted firms, cutting off key revenue flows to the cartels. 
   The goal is to isolate the leaders of the drug cartels and prevent them from doing business with the United States. Taking legitimate U.S. dollars out of drug dealers' pockets is a vital step in destroying their ability to traffick narcotics across our borders. This is a bold but necessary new tool to wage war against illegal drugs and to curb the increasing power of the drug cartels.

    Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I rise today to commend Mr. Oscar Poole, affectionately known as ``Colonel'' in the north Georgia town of Ellijay, who on June 4th will be celebrating his tenth year of business as one of our great state's foremost authorities on barbecue. Throughout his ten years of service in this little town resting in the scenic foothills of the Appalachian Mountains, Colonel Poole has served customers both far and wide, from nearly every state in the Union, and more than several countries. 
   The grassy embankment behind this now landmark establishment, pays tribute to the many thousands of customers that have passed through the town of Ellijay to eat the Colonel's barbecue. The embankment, referred to as the ``Pig Hill of Fame,'' is covered by nearly 4,000 personalized, painted, and pig shaped signs. Individuals, families, tour groups, friends, Sunday school classes, and celebrities have each had pigs erected to memorialize their visit to one of the South's greatest places for barbecue. In fact, I am fortunate enough to have a sign in my name on this famed hill. As many in the South know, politics and barbecue go hand in hand. Therefore, it comes as no surprise to learn that governors, congressmen, Senators, statesmen, and even Presidential candidates have made the voyage to Colonel Poole's. 
   Colonel Poole's reputation supersedes our state's boundaries. On three separate occasions he was the highlight of Capitol Hill. On his first trip to Washington, the Colonel arrived at the steps of the Capitol in his large yellow PigMobile and in his colorful and patriotic suit to deliver his hickory smoked pork to the entire Georgia delegation and their staffs. Much to the dismay of some in the delegation, word about real Georgia barbecue got around Washington so fast that the Colonel's rations, enough for 450 people, quickly ran out. On another occasion, I had the opportunity to serve what may be one of Georgia's finest kept secrets to several of my friends and colleagues here in the Senate who meet for a weekly lunch. 
   While most know the Colonel as a barbecue maestro, he is a wearer of many hats. His customers know he is also a pianist. Others know of him as a preacher. This man with a big heart is all of these things and more. 
   Inside his tin covered, pine wood restaurant the Colonel plays classical music, show tunes, and almost every customer request. Having learned to play the piano at an early age, Mr. Poole has long since appreciated his gift as a musician. His ability to play was good enough to put himself through the Methodist seminary where he was ordained a minister. 
   His work in the Church, as a preacher and a missionary, took him to many rural communities here in the South and to developing countries like Brazil. It was this sort of compassion that enabled a north Georgia gentleman named Wendell Cross to approach the Colonel for instruction on how to read. Mr. Cross, a sixty year old man, had spent his entire life not knowing how to read. That was until Mr. Poole took him under his wing and worked with him on a daily basis for nearly twelve months. Eventually Mr. Cross learned to read. The story of compassion and friendship received nationwide media coverage and was shown on the popular ``Today Show.'' 
   More importantly, two days before the tenth anniversary of his business, Colonel Poole will be celebrating his 49th, I repeat, 49th year of marriage to his lovely wife, Edna Poole. This is a milestone that anyone would be extremely proud, and I am happy to report that the Poole's will have four sons--Michael, Greg, Keith, and Darvin--to help them celebrate this milestone. 
   Once again, Mr. President, I would like to commend Colonel Oscar Poole on his tenth year of business and his 49th year of marriage. During this time when there are discussions of the direction of today's culture, Colonel Poole is an example of how leading one's life by a core set of good, American values--faith, family, and country--will result in a life of many successes.

   Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I rise today to honor a great man and a great American who passed away last week. I had the privilege of working with and knowing Admiral James `Bud' Nance. His passing was a great loss for me personally, for the Senate, and most importantly, for our country. 
   In both his long and distinguished naval career and his work directing the activities of the Foreign Relations Committee, Bud set the highest standard in his selfless commitment to country and his loyalty to friends. His commanding presence, his decorum in all that he did, and his model of sacrifice and service is an inspiration for all who knew him. 
   While we are saddened by his passing, we rejoice in his memory and in the legacy of loyalty and service he left behind. Chairman HELMS, my sympathy and condolences to you in the loss of this great friend. Our prayers and thoughts are also with the Admiral's wife and children. 
   Mr. President, I would like to conclude these brief remarks with a poem by Ralph Waldo Emerson, titled ``Great Men.'' It captures, far better than I could in my own words, Bud's commitment and service to this country. 
 Not gold, but only man can make  A people great and strong; Men who, for truth and honor's sake  Stand fast and suffer long. 
 Brave men who work while others sleep,  Who dare while others fly-- They build a nation's pillars deep  And lift them to the sky.  
   Bud Nance was once of these great men who helped build our nation's pillars deep and lift them to the sky.

   Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I thank all my colleagues honoring National Teacher Day and Teacher Appreciation Week. I appreciate very much the work Senator FRIST has done on behalf of reform in education. 
   Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleagues today to recognize May 2-8, 1999, as the 14th Annual Teacher Appreciation Week, and to commend thousands of dedicated teachers across the nation for their determined efforts to shape the intellect of our children. 
   The foundation of American freedom and democracy is a strong, effective system of education where every child has the opportunity to learn in a safe and nurturing environment. 
   America's first rate education system depends on a partnership between parents, principals, teachers and children. The success of our nation for much of the 20th century--is the result of the hard work and dedication of teachers across the land. 
   While many people spend their lives building careers, teachers spend their careers building lives. Our nation's teachers serve our children beyond the call of duty as coaches, mentors, and advisors without regard to fame or fortune. Across the land nearly 3 million men and women experience the joys of teaching young minds the virtues of reading, writing and arithmetic. 
   As part of the 14th Annual Teacher Appreciation Week, I'd like to pay special tribute to Andrew Baumgartner of Augusta, Georgia--who was recently named the 1999 National Teacher of the Year. 
   Mr. Baumgartner, who teaches kindergarten at A. Brian Merry Elementary School in Augusta, has been a teacher for 23 years. His motivation and source of inspiration comes in part from the belief that it was his duty to give something back to society, and he has done so through his teaching. 
   To achieve his goal of getting kids to learn, Mr. Baumgartner creates a sense of adventure in his classroom. He has used his creativity and imagination to bring the magic of reading and learning to the minds of his kids. 
   The award, sponsored by the Council of Chief State School Officers and Scholastic, Inc., will send Mr. Baumgartner on a promotional tour as 1999 National Teacher of the Year, where he will share his innovative ideas with other teachers around the nation. I wish Mr. Baumgartner the best of luck during this tour and am confident that he will inspire other teachers with his creativity and willingness to do whatever it takes to get kids to learn. 
   In closing Mr. President, I call on all my colleagues--on both sides of the aisle--to take a moment this week to give a special thanks to the nearly 3 million important American men and women--like Andy--who have contributed to the emotional and intellectual development of children across the land.

   Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, today I am proud to join my esteemed colleagues in introducing a bill that will expand and make permanent the Medicare Subvention demonstration program passed as part of the 1997 Balanced Budget Agreement. I worked with Senator GRAMM to pass that measure then and I am pleased to join him again today to move this program to its next level. 
   Military retirees have had an increasingly difficult time obtaining the lifetime health care they were promised in return for 20 years of service to their country. The problem, largely, has been access. The number of military hospitals has decreased dramatically since the end of the cold war and TRICARE/CHAMPUS, the health care plan created to assist military retirees, not only is not available to a military retiree who is Medicare eligible, but also when it is available its reimbursement rates are so low many private practitioners will not accept it, forcing military retirees back into military hospitals on a ``space available'' basis. Mr. President, you can see the vicious cycle this creates. Simply, put, military retirees are being shut out of the military health care system. 
   Congress, in turn, has been looking for solutions to this lack of access. Last year I cosponsored a commonsense measure with Senator THURMOND. Our simple proposal would have given military retirees the option to enroll in the Federal Employees Health Benefits Plan, the same plan in which you and I and our staffs are enrolled, Mr. President. Congress acted on this idea by creating an FEHBP demonstration program. While not a total solution, the program has moved us in the right direction. 
   Another commonsense measure, Mr. President, is Medicare Subvention. Currently, Medicare does not reimburse the Defense Department for health care services. This makes little sense considering that Medicare would reimburse any other private physician or medical care provider. If a Medicare-eligible military retiree lives near a military hospital he cannot use his Medicare and he cannot use TRICARE. He must find another insurance provider to help pay for his medical care. This is why, Mr. President, we passed a test of the Medicare Subvention in the 105th Congress. 
   Now we hope to move this concept forward. It is my understanding that while the program is working, the connotation of the word ``test'' is deterring military retirees who might otherwise enroll in a program they know to be permanent. This bill would solve that problem. Our bill also provides a fee-for-service Medicare option at certain Military Treatment Facilities if this would be a more cost effective approach for those facilities. 
   Mr. President, this bill enjoys widespread support. The Military Coalition strongly favors an expansion of the Medicare subvention test. My colleague from Texas, Senator GRAMM introduced for the RECORD a letter from the Coalition supporting this bill. Further, Congressman HEFLEY's bill in the House has already garnered 69 cosponsors. I believe this is a proposal Congress should move forward. 
   Congress must continue to increase access to health care for our nation's military retirees. Medicare subvention is a commonsense approach to achieving this end. Thus far, based on the demonstration program, the parties involved feel that Medicare Subvention has been a success. Now we must let our military retirees know that when they enter this program the Government will not leave them in the lurch. This bill will do exactly that.

   Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I rise today to report on the implementation of the Taxpayer Browsing Protection Act of 1997. Two years ago, the Congress passed and the President signed into law, legislation I proposed with Senator John Glenn that sought to end the egregious protection of unauthorized inspections of taxpayer files. Something I prefer to call ``file snooping.'' 
   I am pleased to report that, according to a GAO report my office is releasing today, it appears that the Taxpayer Browsing Protection Act is working. But, we still have work to do. The report demonstrates that file snooping still occurs, but the incidents have become fewer. I believe this is good news for taxpayers. 
   At the same time, as I stated previously, our work is not done. The GAO found that sixteen confirmed cases of file snooping occurred since the enactment of the Taxpayer Browsing Protection Act, each of which had been appropriately referred for prosecution. Unfortunately, 15 cases were declined for prosecution meaning there was only one case in which taxpayers were notified that their privacy had been violated. In those 15 cases, the affected taxpayers were not assured the opportunity to seek the civil recourse available under the law. 
   I believe we have a duty to correct this loophole. Taxpayers not only have a right to know their privacy, entrusted by them to the Federal Government, has been violated, that we let them down, but that the opportunity to seek the relief provided under the law is ensured. 
   Legislation I introduce today, the Taxpayer Privacy Protection Improvement Act of 1999, will ensure taxpayers' right to know. In short, it triggers the notification of taxpayers that their files have been snooped to the point where a case is referred for prosecution following the conclusion of a thorough internal investigation. 
   This proposal builds on our previous progress, and I encourage my colleagues to join me in this effort.

   Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation--the Federal Facilities Community Right-To-Know Act of 1999--which provides that the federal government is held to the same reporting requirements under the Emergency Planning and Community Right-To-Know Act (EPCRA) of 1986 as private entities. In 1986, Congress directed the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to establish a national inventory to inform the public about chemicals used and released in their communities. Since enactment of the Emergency Planning and Community Right-To-Know Act, manufactures have been required to keep extensive records on how they use and store hazardous chemicals and report releases of  hundreds of hazardous chemicals annually. EPA compiles the reported information into the Toxic Release Inventory (TRI). 
   The Toxic Release Inventory is a publicly available data base containing specific chemical release and transfer information from manufacturing facilities throughout the United States. The TRI is intended to promote planning for chemical emergencies and to provide information to the public regarding the presence and release of toxic and hazardous chemicals in their communities. 
   In August 1993, President Clinton signed Executive Order 12856, which required Federal facilities to begin submitting TRI reports beginning in calendar year 1994 activities. I commend President Clinton for taking this action. However, this executive order does not have the force of law and could be changed by a future Administration. The National Governors Association's policy on federal facilities states that ``Congress should ensure that federal and state `right to know' requirements apply to federal facilities.'' My legislation simply amends the Emergency Planning and Community Right-To-Know Act to cover federal facilities. It is important for the Federal government to protect the environment and its citizens from hazardous substances. People living near federal facilities have the right to know what hazardous substances are being released into the environment by these facilities so they can better protect themselves and their children from these potential threats. It is my strong belief that federal facilities should be treated the same as private entities. My legislation attempts to move us closer towards that goal.

   Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I rise today to ask my colleagues to support legislation that will help our men and women serving in Operation Allied Force. 
   I might point out that part of the reason we are accepting this House version, due to this skirmish on the Senate floor yesterday afternoon, is because we only have some 12 hours left. This is April 15. These families needed to get this message, frankly, yesterday. But today I am confident that this relief, this comfort, that we are offering to the men and women who are on the front line today in Kosovo will be of enormous comfort and assistance to their spouses and to their families. 
   In short, the legislation does three things. 
   I might point out that the Senate substitute was identical in language to the House version that will be coming here later this afternoon on which we will vote. 
   The legislation does three things. 
   First, it exempts all U.S. troops serving in the Yugoslav theater of operations from being taxed on their hazardous duty pay. That is the additional pay they receive over their regular pay for being a hazardous operation. That will not be taxed when this passes. The danger pay that you receive on the periphery of the combat theater will not be taxed. 
   Second, it grants our troops a 180-day filing extension for their 1999 income tax return. The 180 days begins when they return from duty in the combat zone. 
   Third, it exempts our troops from the 3 percent excise tax levied on long-distance telephone calls to reduce somewhat the burden of a long-distance call home whenever they have a chance to do that. 
   Several days ago, the President signed an Executive order 
   declaring Yugoslavia and certain areas surrounding it a combat zone. This declaration in turn provides troops serving in the zone with certain tax breaks which this legislation will codify and expand. It will expand it, for example, to troops like those in Georgia who are fulfilling the refueling missions in the combat zone. The bill takes the President's order a step further by providing these same level of tax breaks and filing extensions to those personnel who have been relocated to the combat zone area and are receiving imminent danger pay. 
   Mr. President, I believe this is an important additional provision that the President by law cannot extend through an Executive order. At a time when our men and women are putting their lives on the line in the name of freedom, we should do what we can to relieve some of the worries associated with income tax burdens and filings associated with the timing of the conflict occurring within 2 weeks of income tax day, April 15. 
   Mr. President, we have several other Senators who are here to speak on the measure. Before they get here, let me briefly say that we are deeply appreciative for the enormous bipartisan support--and I named the coauthors on both sides of the aisle--to get this done. My one regret is that we have been delayed a day by ``internal process.'' That is the most polite way to describe it. But we are going to get this done. 
   I hope anybody who is watching or listening to this who is related in any way to the families and spouses of those troops for whom we think of every minute of every day will tell them that their significant income tax relief burden is being lifted so that they ought not have to stand in that long car line sometime tonight trying to get this in. They have been granted an extension, and a significant one. Depending on the pay grades of those involved, there is rather substantial tax relief, because, as I said a moment ago, with the passage of this act, those additional pays that are received by these troops for hazardous duty or imminent danger will not have an income tax applied against them. So it should be very meaningful. 
   Let me quickly say that this is no windfall. If anybody listening to me has ever been around a serviceperson  who was called away for combat, just stop and think about it. All kinds of new costs come into play. You have a breadwinner that is somewhere else. You are trying to communicate. You have many associated costs. 
   So what we are doing here is not a windfall. It is a move to help those families deal with the inordinate kinds of problems that are associated with taking care of the family when only half the parents are still there. In all practicality, this probably doesn't do enough. But I hope that for anybody listening this will be a reminder that the Congress is trying to do everything it can to be of assistance to those troops. 
   I see I have been joined by my distinguished colleague from Maine. I yield up to 10 minutes to the Senator from Maine on this measure.

   Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I thank my good friend and colleague from Maine for her statement and all of her energy, which I appreciate and enjoy so much, on so many subjects. I thank her very much for speaking on the importance of this measure. 
   We deal with so many varied issues that sometimes a very simple, clean-cut act like this gets overlooked in the thrashing about that goes on in Washington. 
   I am pleased that the Congress has been able to do this, and do this expeditiously. I just asked my young assistant to make sure that the minute this passes, probably between 4 o'clock and 4:30, the Pentagon makes sure all of our troops get this message quickly. They need to help us make sure the comfort represented by this legislation is understood as quickly as possible.

   Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Kansas for his support and for his observations of his visit with the troops about to depart. That is always an emotional time. 
   I think it is worthy to note that of every discussion--and there has been considerable debate about this operation--one thing for which there is no debate is the loyalty, the dedication, and the precision with which these troops have exercised what their Government told them to do. That loyalty and that desire to do it, do it well, and do it right, cannot go unnoticed by anybody who is in their presence. I am glad the Senator referred to that particular incident. 
   How much time remains on our side?

   Mr. COVERDELL. I will not need the 12 1/2 minutes. I do want to reiterate that this legislation does three very specific things to bring comfort to our troops in the combat zone. It exempts all U.S. troops serving in the Yugoslavian theater of operations from being taxed on their hazardous duty pay. They will not be taxed on that. Hopefully, that will help them deal with the extra costs related to performing this duty. 
   No. 2, it will grant a 180-day filing extension for their 1998 income tax return, and the 180 days begins on the day they leave the combat zone. 
   Third, it exempts our troops from the 3 percent excise tax levied on long-distance telephone calls. 
   We will notify the Pentagon, as I said, later this afternoon, and hope they will assist us in making sure the troops in the operation theaters are aware of this so it can help bring some comfort. I know all of us in America understand the confusion that surrounds tax day. I have been on the phone about five times. So, I hope mitigating that pressure will be of help and make it a little easier for them as they perform the missions they have been assigned by the United States of America. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. COVERDELL. First, before the Senator from Pennsylvania gets away, I wish I had been able to hear all of his remarks. But it will be in the RECORD. It was very intriguing. I could not agree more with any concept that envisions simplicity, equity. I think a lot of taxpayers today think somebody else is getting a better deal, and there is a lot of cynicism as a result. 
   But with a proposal such as you are talking about, everybody knows what the rules of the road are. I think in addition to the many accomplishments that you are suggesting your proposal would achieve would be a confidence among the American people and a reduction in cynicism about somebody getting a benefit that somebody else does not, and that sort of thing. So I commend the Senator for his work.

I doubt that there is hardly an American alive who did not watch that stunning and chilling event when these three men exemplified all the virtues of American heroism. It is a stark reminder of what Americans, who work for our fire departments, our rescue units, our law enforcement agencies all across the country, are capable of doing, and their total dedication where they will often set all their own personal safety aside in the name of helping another citizen. 
   It was all embodied in this enormous event that occurred in Atlanta, GA several days ago. It was an incredible sight and witness of American heroism. I am particularly pleased to be able to join with my colleague, Senator CLELAND, in the authorship of that resolution which has just been approved.

   The reason is not to facilitate my own amendments. It is to facilitate the issue for which, as he has acknowledged, there is broad agreement. I think that the thinking here was that this very simple proposal which would help our fighting men and women, for which there is broad agreement, could be handled and moved forward. It is very clear that a Member on your side of the aisle, who is purporting to want to amend it, is talking about something that would be very controversial and would entangle the simple proposal that could be an immediate gesture to our fighting men and women, to which the whole Congress has agreed. The  House passed it unanimously yesterday. I just reiterate that this is a needless delay on something that is designed for our fighting men and women, no matter how you look at it.

   is broad agreement on this. Anything that would improve it would have been accepted. You are talking about another debate completely out of context with the benefits proposed in here.

   Mr. COVERDELL. First, I associate myself with the remarks of the leader and the Senator from Connecticut on Macedonia, Albania, Bulgaria, and Romania. We have only begun to assess the impact. You can see on television what is happening in Macedonia and Albania. But you can't see it in Romania and Bulgaria. It is very important, and we are attentive and appreciative to these second-tier states that are affected by these actions. 
   The point I want to make, Mr. Leader, on this issue that you just addressed, is that the clock runs out. There is no other issue we are talking about, including the one we all share on Macedonia, that has a time clock over its head. 
   If this could be done tonight, tomorrow is the 15th, we send immediate comfort to these thousands of families scrambling, as all of America is, by tomorrow. We ought not to leave another night lingering of question and unknown measures for all these families. It ought to be settled tonight. 
   There is not another issue I have heard talked about here that has that kind of deadline on it and a discomfort ramification. This is comfort for the families that we all think of every minute of every day now, and it really ought to be apart from some of these other things. 
   I appreciate the Senator from Connecticut recognizing that, and I wanted to say so.

The Senator from California understands the complexities of this institution as well as anybody. It is being run through the committee of jurisdiction. I don't know what their response will be. I want to make a point there is a clock ticking. Nothing else we are talking about has a finite conclusion, which was why I wanted to do what we could do to get this done, so that the comfort--I think yours relates to comfort, too--can be settled for all the families because they are busily trying to comply with this tonight. I think this sends a message to all of those troops, their spouses, and their Nation that this is, indeed, going to happen.

    Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize three Georgians who went above and beyond the call of duty in a daring rescue mission yesterday. We watched with awe as Robert Clines, Larry Rogers and Matt Mosely successfully rescued Ivers Sims, a construction worker who found himself suspended some 180-feet in the air trapped by a raging fire. 
   Roger Clines, a Georgia Department of Natural Resources pilot, and his navigator Larry Rogers negotiated their helicopter through treacherous wind, smoke and fire, as Atlanta firefighter Matt Mosely dangled on a rope to rescue Mr. Sims--a dramatic and heroic scene. 
   I want to take a moment to recognize and honor the teamwork, dedication and bravery that resulted in this successful rescue mission. These three men, in the true spirit of heroism, risked their lives for the sake of a fellow human being. 
   Addtiionally, I would like to take this opportunity to honor and pay tribute to all of Atlanta's firefighters, the Atlanta police officers, Sheriff's deputies, and the Cabbagetown residents themselves, who worked together to fight the massive fire that engulfed the historic cotton mill. Our firefighters, facing shortages of equipment and personnel, heroically fought and contained a fire that could have destroyed an historic neighborhood currently being revitalized. Residents at home during the fire helped by rescuing neighbors' pets, and used garden hoses to extinguished burning debris. 
   As devastating as it was for residents of Atlanta's Cabbagetown to watch this historic landmark burn, the heroism of the day--like Atlanta's symbol the Phoenix--rose from the ashes. Although we mourn the loss of this historic landmark, it is good to know that we will remember this day not for the tragedy that could have been, but for the heroism that was.

   Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, today I am proud to join my esteemed colleague from Georgia, Senator CLELAND, to introduce once again a very important piece of legislation authorizing a new National Cemetery in the Atlanta, Georgia, metropolitan area. For many years Georgia has had a pressing need for a new national cemetery for veterans. With the leadership of my friend from Georgia who, I might add, has been working to make this a reality for about twenty years, we hope to pass this bill this year for our nation's veterans. 
   Mr. President, Georgia has one of the fastest growing veterans populations in the country. Currently, about 700,000 veterans call Georgia home with well over half, about 440,000, living in the Metro-Atlanta region; the area where this new cemetery would be built. However, the only national cemetery in the area has been full since 1970. Furthermore, the only other veterans cemetery in the state is operated by the National Parks Service, not the Department of Veterans' Affairs, and is in Andersonville, a town in southwest Georgia far from the concentration of Georgia veterans. 
   Mr. President, I believe we clearly demonstrate the need for a new national cemetery in Georgia. VA studies have concurred the need for this cemetery and, in fact, Atlanta was chosen as a site for a new cemetery in 1983. It is now time to build this needed tribute. 
   Burial in a national cemetery is a deserving honor for our nation's veterans, but it is becoming increasingly difficult to bestow upon them, especially in Georgia. This bipartisan legislation seeks to remedy this situation. Mr. President, by focusing on areas across the country with pressing needs for more burial slots, Congress can increase access to the honor of burial in a national cemetery. Georgia is such an area. By passing this measure, Congress would help veterans, and their families, find a burial place befitting their patriotic service to this great land.

   Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, as my good colleague from Virginia, I appreciate the conscientious nature of every vote that will be cast tonight. I was among those who visited with the President this morning and have struggled with this. I have concluded that I cannot vote for this resolution. It is a declaration of war. There are going to be casualties. This resolution will not bring about the adjusted behavior of Mr. Milosevic that is sought. 
   The lingering question throughout the day and throughout all the deliberations is: What is next? That question has not been answered and it will surely come upon us as a result of this vote tonight. This is a very grave decision we are making for which the prospects of a solution, as proposed in this resolution, are nil.

   Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I commend my colleague from Alaska for his leadership on this very important supplemental appropriations bill. It goes without saying that these funds are much needed both in our country and in the countries of Central America and the Caribbean affected by Hurricane Mitch. The funds will go to some of the neediest people in this hemisphere and will address immediate and long-term needs. I have traveled the region personally in the wake of this disaster, and I know that these resources  are imperative to its economic viability and recent strong advances in freedom and democracy. 
   In considering this large assistance measure, however; we should recognize that there are problems in some of the recipient countries. In particular, we have heard of many difficulties with American companies trying to do business in the region. Currently, there are a group of Senators, led by the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, who are concerned about an airport project in Honduras and the government's apparent refusal to pay the American company performing the work. In the Dominican Republic, I have consistently been informed of problems the American energy sector is having in trying to do business in that country. While U.S. State Department personnel have been responsive and have tried to be helpful in providing consular assistance, a group of American energy companies still are having problems getting paid on time--or at all--under the terms of their established contracts. This is worrisome. It obviously hurts domestic confidence in investing in this region--or in these countries particularly. 
   I would appreciate it if the chairman would review the material I will provide him on these situations and consider developing report language to accompany this legislation which would address this recurring problem. In the language, I would like to encourage these countries to honor their contracts to the best of their abilities and to abide by the rule of law. If we are going to provide this infusion of resources, we need to assure that our companies operating in the region are treated fairly. It is certainly best for both us and the countries in which we invest. I thank the chairman for his leadership on this measure.

   Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation with the senior Senator from Louisiana, the senior Senator from Ohio, and the junior Senator from Minnesota. This legislation--the Federal Facilities Clean Water Compliance Act of 1999--will guarantee that the federal government is held to the same full range of enforcement mechanisms available under the Clean Water Act as private entities, states, and localities. Each federal department, agency, and instrumentality will be subject to and comply with all Federal, State, and local requirements with respect to the control and abatement of water pollution and management in the same manner and extent as any person is subject to such requirements, including the payment of reasonable service charges. 
   It has been over twenty-six years since the enactment of the Clean Water Act. This Act has been an effective tool in improving the quality of our nation's rivers, lakes, and streams. Over that period of time, however, states have not had the ability to impose certain fines and penalties against federal agencies for violations of the Clean Water Act. This is a double standard that should not be continued. 
   In 1972, Congress included provisions on federal facility compliance with our nation's water pollution laws in section 313 of the Clean Water Act. Section 313 called for federal facilities to comply with all federal, state, and local water pollution requirements. However, in 1992, the United States Supreme Court ruled in U.S. Dept. of Energy v. Ohio, that States could not impose certain fines and penalties against federal agencies for violations of the Clean Water Act and the Resource Conservation Recovry Act (RCRA). Because of this decision, the Federal Facilities Compliance Act (H.R. 2194) was enacted to clarify that Congress intended to waive sovereign immunity for agencies in violation of RCRA. Federal agencies in violation of the RCRA are now subject to State levied fines and penalties. However, this legislation did not address the Supreme Court's decision with regard to the Clean Water Act. The Federal Facilities Clean Water Compliance Act of 1999 makes it unequivocally clear that the federal government waives its claim to sovereign immunity in the Clean Water Act. 
   The federal government owns hundreds of thousands of buildings, located on millions of acres of land, none of which have to abide by the same standards as a private entity does under the Clean Water Act. This legislation simply ensures that the federal government lives by the same rules it imposes on everyone else. 
   I would like to thank Senator BREAUX, Senator DEWINE, and Senator GRAMS for cosponsoring this important legislation, and look forward to working with them and my other colleagues in the United States Senate on its speedy consideration.

   Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, today I rise to offer a tax reform package to provide greater tax fairness and to protect citizens from retroactive taxation. This package includes three initiatives: a constitutional amendment called the retroactive tax ban amendment, a bill to establish a new budget point of order against retroactive taxation, and a proposed Senate Rule change. 
   The first, the retroactive tax ban amendment, is a constitutional amendment to prevent the Federal Government from imposing any tax increase retroactively. The amendment states simply ``No Federal tax shall be imposed for the period before the date of enactment.'' We have heard directly from the taxpayers, and looking backward for extra taxes is unacceptable. It is not a fair way to deal with taxpayers. 
   In addition, I am introducing a bill that would create a point of order under the Budget Act against retroactive tax rate increases. Because amending the Constitution can be a very long prospect--just look at the decades-long effort on behalf of a balanced budget amendment--I believe this legislation is necessary to provide needed protection for American families from the destabilizing effects of retroactive taxation. 
   Finally, I am proposing a Senate Rule change making it out of order for the Senate to consider retroactive tax rate increases. 
   Both proposals, the point of order under the Budget Act and the Senate Rule change, are modeled after the existing House Rules preventing that body from considering retroactive taxation. In other words, by virtue of the fact that the House cannot consider legislation so too has the Senate been de facto unable to consider retroactive tax rate increases. Now is the time for the Senate to come forward and incorporate this fact in its proceedings. 
   It was clear to Thomas Jefferson that the only way to preserve freedom was to protect its citizens from oppressive taxation. Even the Russian Constitution does not allow you to tax retroactively. Retroactive taxation is wrong, and it is morally incorrect. 
   Families and businesses and communities must know what the rules of the road are and that those rules will not change. They have to be able to plan their lives, plan their families, and  plan their tax burdens in advance. They cannot come to the end of a year and have a Congress of the United States and a President come forward and say, ``All your planning was for naught, and we don't care.'' 
   I encourage my Colleagues to join me in protecting taxpayers from retroactive tax rate increases.

   Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I rise today, joined by my good friends Senator TORRICELLI and Senator ABRAHAM, to introduce legislation whose time I believe has clearly come. We are faced with a real crisis. That crisis is the state of personal savings, savings by families that let them prepare for the bumps in the road. 
   Families are not saving, and I believe it is not happening because our government takes too much from them. A recent report by the Congressional Budget Office showed that taxes on the American public are at their highest level since World War II. Too many middle-class families have been squeezed to the point where they live paycheck to paycheck without the option of saving for the future. 
   Today, the Nation's economy remains the envy of the world. The United States has the first federal budget surplus in thirty years, unemployment is down and the stock market is up, but there are troubling signs on the horizon. Manufacturing activity slowed in December for the seventh straight month, dropping to its lowest level in almost eight years as global economic problems continued to hinder exports. At the same time, personal savings are at Depression-era lows. 
   In 1982, families saved nine percent of their personal income. In 1992, it was between five and six percent. Last year, it was one-half of one percent and headed into the red. Personal savings is so important because it helps prepare families for any crisis that could occur, such as a health emergency or job loss. 
   Having said that, I believe we would all do well to remember the lessons from the biblical parable of Joseph. Recall that Joseph warned Pharaoh his kingdom would experience seven years of plenty followed by seven years of famine. His message to Pharaoh was to build reserves during the years of plenty in preparation for the years of famine, so that his people would not suffer. To ensure the longevity of our recent economic gains, it is important to remember the lessons of Joseph and heed the words of President Kennedy who, in his second State of the Union address said: ``Pleasant as it is to bask in the warmth of recovery ..... the time to repair the roof is when the sun is shining.'' 
   One-third of Americans have no savings at all, and the next third have less than $3,000 in savings. Although the baby-boom generation has contributed to the explosion of people investing in the equities, only two in five baby boomers will have enough savings to maintain their current standard of living when they begin to retire in 2011. 
   The Small Savers Act would help to reverse these troubling trends. First, our proposal returns middle class taxpayers to the lowest Federal income tax bracket. Under our legislation, 7 million taxpayers would no longer find themselves taxed at 28%. Instead, they would be taxed at the 15% bracket. 
   Second, it would encourage modest savings and investment. We propose to enable savers to earn $500, or $250 for singles, in interest and dividends without paying a tax. According to the Joint Economic Committee, 30 million low and middle income taxpayers would be able to save tax free. Our proposal also would wipe out capital gains taxes for 10 million low and middle income investors by exempting the first $5,000 of long-term capital gains. For those committed to ending the taxation of capital gains, this would be an opportunity to take that first step while encouraging lower and middle class workers to invest for their future.  
   Finally, we provide for a modest $1,000 increase in the contribution limit for deductible IRA contributions, from $2,000 to $3,000, and index for inflation after 2009. These contribution limits have not been raised since 1981. 
   The Nation faces many challenges in the years ahead. None is more important than sustaining economic growth and ensuring our retirement security. The Small Savers Act is a modest and progressive step to begin shoring up personal savings and to keep the Nation on the path to long-term economic health.

   Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I want to associate myself with the remarks of the Senator from Arkansas. His eloquent statement delineates what is at stake here. I will expand upon it just briefly. As Senator JEFFORDS said, I will limit this to 5 minutes. 
   I would like to make three points with regard to what we will begin voting on tomorrow. 
   First, I want to make it very clear that from my perspective the amendment suggests that we should have a Federal program that envisions 100,000 Federal teachers, which is a bad idea. It is just not a good idea. 
   Mr. President, it envisions, or it suggests, that some Washington wizard wonk has some better idea about what ought to happen in Arkansas, Georgia and your State of Michigan. I just have to suggest that most of those wonks have never been to any of these locations. They have no idea--none--as to what that school board requires or needs. Some will require teachers. Some will require transportation. Some require construction. Some require a playground. And every American in the country knows that the needs of all of these school districts all across the Nation are all different. The Senator from Massachusetts would have us believe there is only one requirement, that only Washington knows what it is, and you are going to do it our way, the old Frank Sinatra song. 
   You are going to fill out this zillion-page application, and you are going to do it our way. 
   I suggest that if most Americans had a chance to evaluate whether the wonk from Washington should do it or the local school board should do it, they are going to go with the local school board. 
   That takes me to my second point. This idea that Washington is going to do it after you fill out the 15-20 page application is going to lead to systems that have not met their responsibilities being weighted to the advantage of this program. It will tend to reward those who have not yet done the job they were supposed to do. If you talk to the Governors of the States, many, including mine, have already expanded their numbers of teachers to reduce class size--all across the country, Texas, California, to Georgia. So a system that has one solution is only going to be weighted to those school districts that didn't do anything about it. True, maybe they need some assistance because they had a harder time meeting that standard, but mark my word, you will tend to reward systems that have not stepped up to the bar with this kind of program. 
   My third point. The fact that Washington bureaucrats, guided by the administration, are going to decide who is a winner and who is a loser suggests that it is going to be politically correct, that political correctness will suddenly weigh in on this. If you look at the record of decisionmaking about who the winners and losers are during the course of these last 6 years, it will substantiate the assertion I make. In department after department, agency after agency, the town is aswirl with politics getting in the way of policy. A program that picks winners and losers in Washington is already susceptible to it but particularly so now. 
   So the point that the Senator from Arkansas made that we should fully fund our previous commitments, which will have the effect of freeing up funds in local school districts all across the country to make their own decisions about what their priorities are, is a better idea; it is a better idea than having a bureaucrat who has never been on the scene, could not name one school superintendent, one school board member, or even the name of the communities to be affected, deciding what the priorities are all across the country. It makes no sense. It is a bad idea. It should be defeated so that we can proceed with this legislation that has been endorsed by 50 Governors. And I might point out those 50 Governors have not endorsed the amendment of the Senator from Massachusetts. 
   Mr. President, I thank the manager for granting me this time, and I yield back whatever of the 5 minutes might remain.

   Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, first I acknowledge the Senator from Tennessee, the Senator from Vermont, the Senator from Oregon, Senators FRIST, JEFFORDS and WYDEN, for the extensive work they have been about trying to address this enormous issue in America. The data that we are receiving is striking to me, particularly in grades kindergarten through high school, about failed reading skills, last in math, last in science among the industrialized nations. America knows this. You can ask any community what is the No. 1 issue in the country today, and they will tell you we have trouble in our school systems. We are not effectively equipping all of our citizens with the ability to participate in this society. If that is allowed to continue, it will have the effect of crippling the United States in the new century. 
   I have often said, to the extent that any citizen is denied fundamental educational skills, we have abrogated their ability to be full citizens and to enjoy the benefits of American citizenship. An uneducated people will not be a free people. By allowing so many of our students to come through the system and to have missed the mark, we are in danger of creating for the first time in America a cast system. This never existed in America. 
   There is vast mobility in our population--people coming up the economic  ladder; people coming down. It is not static. We will change that, if we turn our heads away from allowing hundreds of thousands of our citizens to come through the educational system without being equipped to be a full participating citizen. That is why I was proud to be a cosponsor of this piece of legislation, the Education Flexibility Act, which has already proven itself in 12 States. This legislation expands what is working. We need those things that are working out there. 
   I do not believe I have ever in my career in the U.S. Senate seen a piece of legislation that has the approval of every Governor in the United States. I do not believe I have ever seen that happen before. Every Democrat Governor has signed a letter of endorsement for this piece of legislation; every Republican Governor has signed. How many times? It has never happened. 
   In the face of that, we are on day 7, holding reform legislation that has been proven to work, supported by every Governor, we are holding it hostage. We are holding all those students who can benefit from this hostage. They are last on the list. We have to serve some other agenda, some bureaucracy, some status quo. They come first. Just let those students sit out there with those miserable scores. Go ahead and let 30 and 40 percent of our students come to college unable to effectively read; go ahead and let the States spend millions upon millions of dollars to retrain them to see if they cannot somehow salvage a college education and career. So what? Just put the old fist down, dig your heels in and leave everything the way it is. 
   This reminds me of the struggle for welfare reform. You didn't have to be a rocket scientist to understand that program was in deep trouble. It was costing America trillions of dollars, and it was producing dependent, not independent, citizens. It was stunting the future of millions of Americans. Yet, it took a massive struggle, year after year, same crowd, I might point out. Just leave things the way they are; go ahead and let those folks lose their opportunity and their lives. Do not give them a chance to be full participatory citizens. 
   It finally got done, and millions of Americans have learned the American way. They have jobs. They are getting off welfare rolls by the thousands in every State. 
   So here we have another picture. We have an education system that is producing very troubling results. The Senator who is now presiding and his colleague come forward with a very clean, simple idea to try to help the States, which manage education, set better priorities, make the money be more effective, get in there and try to turn this around. What does turning around mean? It means you are saving the future for some child. You are giving them their chance. This kind of resistance is saying, OK go ahead and let them be strangled and choked down. That is OK. How can anybody in this Capital City accept the status quo? It is beyond me. 
   As you have said over and over, Mr. President, this bill, simple, clean, is about removing handcuffs and shackles and letting Governors and State legislatures and school boards get in there and get those resources to what the priorities are--in other words, reducing the overhead. You have said many times, and I agree completely, the Federal Government makes about 6 to 7 percent of the funding available for elementary education, but 50 percent of the overhead and administrative regulations are directly tied to that. Twenty-five thousand employees across America are required to administer that slim piece of the puzzle. Your bill gets at that, begins reducing that overhead and that waste, and diverting the attention of those teachers away from the kids to some regulatory system. 
   The amendments being talked about, bandied around town, miss the whole point. This is about reducing the overhead and putting more of the resources in the classroom. 
   Let me read from the genesis of one of these amendments desired to change your bill. It is called ``Applications.'' It is a section about how to apply under one of these amendments.  
   Applications Required: If any State chooses not to participate in the program under this Act, or fails to submit an approvable application...... 
   Applications Required: The State educational agency of each State desiring to receive an allotment under this Act shall submit an application to the Secretary at such time, in such form, and containing such information as the Secretary may require.  
   That is the Secretary in Washington, not in Wyoming, not in Georgia, not in Tennessee. It is the person in Washington.  
   Contents: Each application shall include (1) the State's goals for using funds under this Act to reduce average class sizes in regular classrooms in grades 1 through 3, including--(A) a description of current class sizes in regular classrooms in the local educational agencies of the State; (B) a description of the State's plan for using funds under this Act to reduce the average class size in regular classrooms in those grades; and (C) the class-size goals in regular classrooms the State intends to reach and a justification of the goals; (2) a description of the State's educational agency's plan for allocating program funds within the State, including--(A) an estimate of the impact of these allocations on class sizes in the individual local. .....  
   You get the point, Mr. President. This is going in the opposite direction. This misses the point. This is saying that the 50-percent burden, the 25,000 employees we have out there to try to regulate the color of the classroom, how tall it will be and the size of a chair, they want to do more of that. They want more administrative burdens. They want more strings. 
   This is a classic division. This is a group of people who are conducting an obstructionist filibuster to block what every Governor and a vast majority of the American people have concluded is needed: That there is too much regulatory burden; it locks down the system and does not allow the system to set proper priorities. And it infers, Mr. President, that that Governor, those legislators, that community, aren't smart enough to figure out what they need to do and it requires a Washington wizard wonk in the bowels of one of these buildings over here to tell them what they need to do. That is what this division is all about. 
   This legislation envisions that these local communities, the Governors of our States, have a sense of the problems there and they need to be given the room to go about solving them. We have done this on a pilot basis in 12 States, and it is working. It is working. This legislation opens it up so that all the States --and you come back to the point, it is absolutely unprecedented, Mr. President, that every Governor, of both parties, would document and send to the Congress a letter that says: ``Do this. We all agree.'' 
   In the face of that bipartisan support, and in the face of that magnificent requirement and urgency, what are we facing here in the U.S. Senate on something that is totally agreed to? A filibuster, of all things. A filibuster. And you can only conclude--as we fought our way through welfare reform and as we fought our way through education reform last year, the commitment to the status quo, the inconceivable ability to turn away from the absolutely proven facts about what is happening in kindergarten through high school, with all that data--the fact that those kids are not getting the mark does not matter, it is just too bad, tough luck, because we are going to defend the establishment, the bureaucracy, the status quo. They are first; the kids are last. 
   Those Governors did not sign this letter at some willy-nilly picnic. They are on the ground, and they know what is happening. It is a frightening thing because if we leave this unchecked, we are going to have a very, very large population that cannot work in our system. And that is going to create havoc for our country, not to mention their condition or what you have done to that person. You have left them without the tools to take care of themselves and their new families and their communities. Mr. President, that is unconscionable policy, to turn and walk away from that. It is hard for me to believe. 
   So I have to say, I have not been here all that long, but I have to tell you that this particular filibuster is onerous because of who the beneficiaries are of your work. They are children, they are American children. They need help, and they need it now. And this is not the way they should be treated. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor. 
   Mr. ENZI addressed the Chair.

   Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I am honored to rise this morning to pay tribute to a distinguished American and a great Georgia visionary. 50 years ago, Benjamin H. Hardy, Jr., was one of the primary architects of a new foreign policy initiative that became known as President Truman's ``Point Four,'' a program of technical assistance to help the people of developing nations. This bold and revolutionary program became an important tenant of American foreign policy, helping people around the world improve their lives. 
   Mr. Hardy was a distinguished student at the University of Georgia, graduating with a BA in journalism in 1928. After graduation, he worked as a journalist and later as a public affairs officer for the Departments of Defense and State. His service at the Department of State required him to draft the foreign policy portion of President Truman's 1949 inaugural address. The address cited four basic points of American foreign policy: (1) Support for the United Nations; (2) continuation of the Marshall Plan; (3) military cooperation with Western allies; and (4) a ``bold new program'' of technical assistance to people in developing nations. This last point was based on what Mr. Hardy had seen of the economic needs in South America during World War II. According to some accounts, he included it in the draft of President Truman's speech at considerable risk to his own career.  
   But it was the last concept, point four, which received widespread acclaim and that, in time, became a major component of American foreign policy. In 1950, this ``Point Four'' policy was approved by Congress in the form of a mandate to create the Technical Cooperation Administration (TCA) within the State Department. It was this ``bold new program'' drafted by Mr. Hardy that later developed into the Agency for International Development and which, perhaps, was the seed for the establishment of the Peace Corps. These were truly forward-looking concepts. 
   During this period, Mr. Hardy served as the chief of public affairs for the TCA and the chairman of its policy planning council. Tragically, on December 23, 1951, Mr. Hardy, along with the Director of the TCA, was killed in a plane crash on a flight from Cairo to Teheran. It is a shame that Benjamin Hardy did not have the opportunity to see his concept take root and grow as he would have had it. 
   Fifty years after Mr. Hardy drafted the Point Four speech, it is fitting that we in Congress pay tribute to the vision and courage of this man, his contribution to American foreign policy, and his commitment to improving the lives of people around the world. Ideas like Benjamin Hardy's have helped demonstrate the generosity of the American people around the world. And it is such ideas that have helped America remain engaged as the world's leader, helping to build a better future for all people. Mr. President, it is my honor to recognize this distinguished American from Georgia and to inform my colleagues of his proud heritage. Thank you.

   Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague from California, Senator FEINSTEIN, in introducing a bill that targets one of America's most dangerous and real national security threats--the international drug cartels. I am also pleased that Senator DEWINE, Senator LOTT, and Senator TORRICELLI have agreed to cosponsor this important legislation. These drug cartels, through their involvement in illegal drug trafficking, money laundering, arms trafficking and the violence related to these activities, pose a threat to the political and economic stability of countries in this hemisphere. More importantly they threaten the citizens of this country by preying on our children.  
   That is why it is so important that we introduce this bill today--to combat the drug cartels and move one step forward in the war on drugs. This bill codifies and expand a 1995 Executive Order created under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), which targeted Colombia drug traffickers. The bill will expand the existing Executive Order to include other foreign drug traffickers considered a threat to our national security. The bill freezes the assets of identified drug traffickers, their associates, and their related businesses. It also prohibits these individuals and organizations from conducting any financial or commercial dealings with the United States. 
   Our goal is to isolate the leaders of the drug cartels and prevent them from doing business with the United States. By stopping the drug kingpins's ability to benefit from the U.S. market and from practices that enable them to sell drugs to our nation's children, we are taking an important step to eliminate the scourge of illegal drugs.

   Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague from Connecticut, Senator DODD, and my colleagues in the House, in introducing a reauthorization of the Peace Corps Act. This legislation authorizes a 12 percent increase for the fiscal year Peace Corps budget and is part of a multi-year plan to enable the Peace Corps to reach its goal of 10,000 volunteers. Reaching this level has been a long standing goal--set into law in 1985--and I am pleased that this legislation would accomplish this as the Peace Corps readies to enter the 21st century. 
   As former Director of the Peace Corps, I have learned first-hand of the tremendous impact that the relatively small amount we spend on the Peace Corps has throughout the world. Not only does the Peace Corps continue to be a cost effective tool for providing assistance and developing stronger ties with the international community, it has also trained over 150,000 Americans in the cultures and languages of countries around the world. Returned volunteers often use these skills and experiences to contribute to myriad sectors of our society--government, business, education, health, and social services, just to name a few. What a rich resource the Peace Corps is for the United States as the world grows closer.  
   Peace Corps volunteers continue to provide unique leadership around the world by representing the finest characteristics of the American people: a strong work ethic, generosity of spirit, and a commitment to service. The interpersonal nature of the Peace Corps has allowed volunteers to establish a collective record of public service that is well respected and recognized in all corners of the world. 
   Several Members of Congress, including Senator DODD, have contributed to this legacy of service and volunteerism. I believe they have experienced the value of the Peace Corps and its commitment to serving others, and I am certain that my colleague from Connecticut would consider this Peace Corps experience invaluable to his work today. As I have said before and I think it deserves repeating, virtually every ambassador and official representative I have met from countries with volunteers is an enthusiastic supporter of the Peace Corps. They all have viewed the Peace Corps as the most successful program of its kind. 
   Mr. President, I believe that the time is right to expand the number of Peace Corps volunteers. As the needs of people in developing countries continue to grow, so too does the number of enthusiastic Americans desiring to serve. Over the last 4 years, the number of Americans requesting information about joining the Peace Corps increased by almost 40 percent. Yet, during the same period, the Peace Corps has only been able to support a 2 percent-increase in volunteers. 
   In addition, the Peace Corps has taken steps to streamline agency operations to channel more resources in support of additional volunteers. Headquarter staffing has been reduced 13 percent since 1993. Five of 16 domestic recruiting offices and 13 country programs have been closed since fiscal year 1996. Financial savings in basic business operations have been achieved by realigning the headquarters organization and improving overseas financial operations. The sum of all the financial savings have contributed to a 14 percent-reduction in the average cost per volunteer (in constant dollars) since 1993. 
   Today, nearly 6,700 volunteers serve in 80 countries around the world, working with local communities to build a better future. This increase in Volunteers will help the Peace Corps expand in areas such as the Caucasus, Central Asia, and Africa as well as in Jordan, China, Bangladesh, and Mozambique. Increased funding will also help expand the work of the ``Crisis Corps,'' a group of experienced Peace Corps volunteers who have the necessary background to make valuable contributions in emergency situations. Crisis Corp volunteers, by the way, are serving today in Central America, assisting the region in its recovery from the terrible devastation of Hurricane Mitch. 
   Finally, this proposed authorization will serve to strengthen the Peace Corps as it prepares to enter the 21st century, putting it on the firm footing it needs and deserves. I firmly believe that a rejuvenated Peace Corps will help ensure that America continues to be an engaged world leader, and that we continue to share with other countries our own legacy of freedom, independence, and prosperity. This is an investment in our country and our world that we need to make.

   Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, American soldiers in the modern military operate under a great deal of strain. Forced to work harder with fewer resources, our men and women in uniform bear a heavy burden defending our nation. This is especially true for those deployed overseas. Not only must these troops defend American interests, but they also live under constant threat of attack and must spend months away from their homes and their families. 
   In addition to their duty to protect our nation's security, American servicemen and women still must fulfill obligations back home, such as paying their taxes. However, in an incredible cart-before-the-horse scheme that could only be found in our nation's tax code, the federal government extends for our troops abroad the deadline for filing income tax forms by two months, but requires that servicemen and women still pay interest and penalties during the extension period. In other words, they must pay their tax bill before they are required to file their tax bill. Mr. President, this is unconscionable. 
   This sense of the Senate on uniformed services filing fairness, which I propose today with Senator MCCAIN, is simple. It puts the Senate on record calling for the codification of the current two-month extension period available to our uniformed personnel and for the elimination of the interest and penalties that would otherwise be charged. The Joint Committee on Taxation estimates the cost of this common-sense correction at just $4 million over ten years. Mr. President, how can we not afford to move forward on this matter? 
   We must show our nation's soldiers that we support them through concrete action. The amendment I introduce puts the Senate on the path toward making the lives of soldiers stationed overseas a little easier. I hope my colleagues will join me in this simple, inexpensive correction of an unfair tax law.

   Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. Chief Justice and fellow colleagues, in the Capitol's Mansfield Room where our Conference has met over the last few weeks, there is a picture of our first president--George Washington--who celebrates a birthday this Monday. I was reminded that, from childhood through adulthood, George Washington carried around with him a copy of the Rules of Civility. The rules could be seen as a roadmap of how one should conduct himself or herself appropriately in society. As the Senate began its course through uncharted waters, civility has been our goal, if not our duty. We have done our best to work together, to be respectful of each other's views and to do justice according to the Constitution. Had we not started with this goal in mind, I fear the debate would have quickly descended into rancor doing a disservice to our Nation. 
   In the next few minutes, I want to explain how this trial unfolded for me, as well as the rationale behind some of the votes I've cast, including on the Articles of Impeachment. 
   When the historians write their accounts of the impeachment trial of William Jefferson Clinton, I trust that, regardless of where one comes down on the facts of the case, they will agree that the Senate did it right. We conducted a trial that was fair to all sides, correct according to the Constitution and expeditious in accordance with the wishes of the American people. We also did our best to conduct our deliberations on a bipartisan basis. 
   We began this process by taking a second and most solemn oath of office: to do impartial justice. For me, as a Senator, I can think of no more somber and important a constitutional duty than the one that was given us. Our first task was to draft a blueprint of how we would proceed in the trial. We met in closed session in the Old Senate Chamber where the discussions were civil, respectful and frank on both sides. In the end, it was Senator GRAMM of Texas, joined by Senator KENNEDY of Massachusetts, two opposite sides of the political spectrum, that led us to a unanimous bipartisan agreement on how to proceed. The support of all 100 Senators was important because it opened the door to a trial that was conducted in a professional and judicious manner and without the discord that so many of the Washington wisemen had predicted. 
   After hearing the opening arguments made by both sides, Senator ROBERT BYRD offered a motion to dismiss the case against the President. If successful, this would have been the first dismissal of an impeachment trial in our Nation's history. 
   My vote against this dismissal motion was premised on my sworn Constitutional obligation to hear the facts and evidence, and consider the law before I rendered a decision on whether the Articles warranted the President's conviction and removal from office. Indeed, this was part of the oath we took--to do impartial justice. The Senate would not have been able to render a fair and correct judgment on the Articles without receiving and objectively assessing the wealth of evidence presented by the House of Representatives and the White House. In short, dismissal was premature and inappropriate. 
   Consistent with our duty to consider all the evidence fully, I supported an effort to allow both the House Managers and the White House the opportunity to depose a limited number of key witnesses to resolve inconsistencies in testimony. After reviewing the depositions, I 
   supported a bipartisan motion to make all of this information--both the videotapes and written transcripts--part of the permanent record so that each and every American could examine the evidence and draw their own conclusions. I also voted to allow both the House Managers and the White House to use the videotaped deposition testimony on the floor of the Senate. 
   Although I did support deposing a limited number of witnesses, I did not support an attempt to allow Ms. Lewinsky to testify as a live witness on the floor of the Senate. In my judgment, we provided the House Managers a more than adequate opportunity to present their case: allowing for witnesses to be deposed, for House Managers to ask any questions necessary to resolve inconsistencies in testimony and to allow any portion of these tapes to be used on the floor to argue the case against the President. Consequently, I thought it inappropriate  and unnecessary for Ms. Lewinsky to testify on the Senate floor. Seventy Senators felt similarly on this issue. 
   The presentation with videotaped excerpts, rather than live witnesses, allowed both sides to make their arguments cogently. In my opinion, witnesses questioned on the floor, under a time agreement, would have made for a more fragmented process--objections by counsel would have disrupted the flow of presentations considerably. I believe that our decision to exclude live witness testimony was appropriate, fair and improved the nature of closing arguments. 
   It is the same sense of obligation and a desire to maintain decorum that guided me in my vote to uphold the Senate's time-tested tradition of deliberating impeachment trials in private. Opening the doors of the Senate during these final deliberations would have been a tragic mistake that would ignore years of precedent on this issue. For 2,600 years, since the ancient Athenian lawgiver Solon, trials have been open and jury deliberations have been private. Throughout our own history in every courthouse in America, we have open trials, we have public evidence, we have public witnesses, but when the jury deliberates, it meets in private. Jury deliberations are held in private for the protection of all parties, and to ensure for a frank and open discussion of the evidence. 
   Private jury deliberations have also been part of the Senate rules for 130 years. Some argue that these rules are outdated and need to be revised. However, in 1974 and 1986, when the Senate had an opportunity to vote on changes to these rules, it chose to leave intact the precedent that the deliberations should remain closed. 
   Our private deliberations have promoted civil discussion on this grave matter of impeachment. Some of the most profound and thoughtful statements I've heard have come during these private meetings--where the absence of cameras has had the effect of turning politicians into statesmen. These private deliberations set a tone of civility and allowed the healing process to begin. 
   After hearing all evidence and deliberations, at the end, I voted for both impeachment articles. Setting all the legal contortions aside, as vote against the Articles, or to acquit, would be to ratify that there are two sets of law in our country--one set for our citizens, and another for the President of the United States. This is a conclusion I could not reach or support. Therefore, my vote on both Articles says in the simplest terms that no American is above the law and there must be one law that applies to us all. 
   Today's outcome should be a surprise to no one. From the beginning, our two parties approached this issue in fundamentally different ways. While Democrats and Republicans agree that President Clinton committed very serious offenses, the disagreement is over whether or not these issues rise to the level that he should be removed from office. To some extent, the die had been cast when the Democrat Party decided to rally around the President. Like President Nixon's fate was sealed when his party fell against him, President Clinton's presidency was secured by his party's allegiance. 
   My hope is that no future Senate will ever be required to consider Articles of Impeachment against the President of the United States. But, if they do, I have every confidence that we have left behind an appropriate roadmap for them to fulfill their constitutional responsibilities. I am proud of the Senate and its Members. The Senate should be proud of the way it has conducted itself: we have done our jobs right by being fair to all parties, correct according to the Constitution and expeditious in accordance with the wishes of the American people. 
   In conclusion, I would like to thank the leaders on both sides. In particular, I would like to single out Senator LOTT for his leadership--this has clearly been one of his finest hours as our Majority Leader. 
   I yield the floor.

    Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce along with my distinguished colleagues Senators THURMOND, SMITH of New Hampshire, GRASSLEY, and HELMS the National Right to Work Act of 1999. 
   This bill does not add a single word to Federal law. Rather, it repeals those sections of the National Labor Relations Act and Railway Labor Act that authorize the imposition of forced-dues contracts on working Americans. I believe that every worker must have the right to join or support a labor union. This bill protects that right. But no worker should ever be forced to join a union. 
   I am happy to say that my own state of Georgia is among the 21 states that is a ``Right to Work'' state and has been since 1947. According to U.S. News and World Report, 7 of the strongest 10 state economies in the nation have Right-to-Work laws. Workers who have the freedom to choose whether or not to join a union have a higher standard of living than their counterparts in non Right-to-Work states. According to Dr. James Bennet, a prominent economist at George Mason University's highly respected economic program, urban families in Right-to-Work states have approximately $2,852 more annual purchasing power than urban families in non-Right to Work states; particularly when the lower taxes, housing and food costs are taken into consideration. 
   According to a poll by the respected Marketing Research Institute, 77 percent of Americans support Right to Work, and over 50 percent of union households believe that workers should have the right to choose whether or not to join or pay dues to a labor union. That should be no surprise. This is about freedom. The Right to Work expands every working American's personal freedom. 
   Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation. It expands the freedom of hard working Americans and ensures them the choice of whether to accept or reject union representation and union dues without coercion, violence or work-place harassment.

    Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I rise today to commend the goals of the proposed IMANI Art Museum in Americus, Georgia. I would also like to note the work of Dr. Ron Maxwell for working to make the museum a reality. 
   The IMANI Art Museum will be dedicated to encouraging diversity and educating the community about contemporary forms of African art and African American art. Such a museum will help preserve the culture and history of African Americans so that future generations may fully appreciate their accomplishments. 
   Furthering the museum's goals of education, the museum will feature a Children's Center, W.J. Robinson Center for Art Teaching and Learning, and a research library. The Children's Center will strive to increase youth self esteem and self respect through the recognition and acquisition of art skills and historical knowledge. The W.J. Robinson Center will serve as a valuable resource and training tool for the community's teachers in all aspects of diversity issues and educational curriculum. The research library will serve as a valuable resource to students and the community with regards to the African American history and culture. 
   Once again, Mr. President, I commend the goals of the proposed IMANI Art Museum and the diligent work of Dr. Ron Maxwell. The museum will provide history and cultural richness for the citizens of Southwest Georgia as well as prove to be important to the economic development and tourism industry which is sorely needed in this region. As we continue to look for ways at bringing people together, let us look to intentions of the proposed IMANI Art Museum as a leader in this effort.

    Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Captain Robbie Bishop of the Villa Rica Police Department in Villa Rica, Georgia, who was tragically slain in the line of duty on Wednesday, January 20, 1999, bringing his service which spanned a decade to the people of Georgia to an end. In addition, I would like to honor Captain Bishop's family for the sacrifice that they have made in the name of Freedom. He was a husband and father of two. 
   Captain Bishop, I understand, was known to have an extraordinary ability to detect drugs during the most routine traffic stops and was considered by some to be the best in the Southeast at highway drug interdiction. He was known to have seized thousands of pounds of illegal drugs and millions of dollars in cash. Police departments around the country solicited Captain Bishop's help to train their officers. In fact, it is believed that it was a routine traffic stop where he had, once again, detected illegal drugs that resulted in the sudden end to his remarkable career. 
   Once again, Mr. President, the work of law enforcement is an elegant and lofty endeavor but one that is fraught with terrible dangers. Captain Bishop knew of these threats, but still chose to serve on the front line, protecting Georgia citizens. As we discuss ways to continue our fight with the war on drugs, let us remember the lives of those like Captain Robbie Bishop who have fallen fighting this war.

   Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, the President has now given us his budget--quite a remarkable document. 
   I remember when the President came to speak to the joint session and said, ``The era of big government is over.'' There was broad applause--not only in the Chamber but around the country. Now we are confronted--it is not nearly as spot oriented or media driven--but it is sort of the statement: ``The era of big government is over'' is over. He has taken that pronouncement and absolutely quashed it in this new budget--driven it in the ground never to be seen again. It was a 77-minute speech,  and it outlined 77 new Government spending proposals that amounted to approximately $5 billion in new Government spending per minute. I am glad the speech wasn't longer. 
   In the President's budget, according to the New York Times, he proposed 81 separate tax increases totaling $82 billion over the next 5 years. The effect of that would be to nearly nullify the limited tax reduction that the last Congress finally fashioned with this administration for which there was an enormous celebration on the White House lawn. This would virtually eliminate it. 
   The administration will describe these as ``user fees.'' That is not new. Both parties have used that. But when you look down at what that means, it is quite interesting, Mr. President: 
   $1.1 billion in airline fees. That means all traveling America is going to get a tax increase, if you ever get on an airplane. 
   Or $504 million in food inspection fees. Who is going to pay that? Anybody who goes into the grocery store and buys a quarter-pound of ground beef, processed chicken, or milk; in other words, everybody. 
   Then we have $200 million in new health care fees on providers and plans and doctors--no, not on providers, health plans, and doctors. That goes to patients. Patients will pay that. 
   So if you are buying food in the grocery store, if you are part of traveling America, if you have to go see your doctor, to a hospital, you are going to be the recipient of this $1.1 billion in new taxes. 
   Now, he said there is tax relief in his budget. Well, the only way an American taxpayer would see one cent of President Clinton's so-called tax relief is if they agree to buy a solar panel or buy an electric car or engage in some other sanctioned Government behavior--this in the face of $800 billion of non-Social Security surpluses that have been generated by our economy. The direct beneficiary of balanced budgets and financial discipline and disciplined spending has produced a vigorous economy which has produced massive surpluses for the first time in modern history, but this administration could not resist spend, spend, spend and could not find it in any frame to suggest, well, maybe some of this should be returned to the working people of America. 
   Mr. President, I see that we have been joined by Senator GRAMS of Minnesota to speak on the subject, and I am going to yield up to 10 minutes to Senator GRAMS of Minnesota to continue our presentation on this budget.

It codifies the current two-month extension period available to our troops and eliminates the interest and penalties that would otherwise be charged. The Joint Committee on Taxation has estimated the cost of this commonsense correction at just $4 million over 10 years. Mr. President, how can we not afford to pass this bill? 
   We must show our nation's soldiers that we support them through concrete action. The bill I introduce today will help make the lives of soldiers deployed overseas a little easier. I hope my colleagues will join me in this simple, inexpensive correction of an unfair tax law.

    Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation--the Dekalb-Peachtree Airport Buyout Completion Act--which accelerates the long-awaited buy-out of homes and businesses around Georgia's second busiest airport. Specifically, this legislation grants a priority airport designation for the Dekalb-Peachtree Airport and authorizes the FAA to make available $35 million for the buyout initiative. 
   This is a very import project to the citizens of Dekalb County, Georgia. In the 1990s, the Federal Aviation Administration proposed to buy the businesses and residential properties located in the Dekalb-Peachtree Airport's Runway Protection Zone. This was the result of FAA studies that found increased operations at the airport too noisy and too unsafe for residents and businesses in the northern vicinity. While the citizens of Georgia and myself are grateful that the FAA has assisted in purchasing some of the properties, this financial assistance has been extremely slow. The FAA's failure to provide the remaining federal financial assistance in a timely manner has caused local residents and businesses to remain in limbo and very upset. Businesses cannot expand and poorer residents cannot afford to move out until the buyout is complete. Those residents who have moved out are leasing their homes to lower-income individuals and families. These circumstances have also caused the crime rate in the area to substantially go up. 
   My proposed legislation would help alleviate this problem by authorizing the federal funds necessary to complete the buyout of the remaining residential and business properties. I look forward to working with my colleagues in the Senate on this important proposal and urge its speedy consideration.

    Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, yesterday, I introduced the Educational Opportunities and Excellence Act of 1999. This legislation represents the Republican vision how we can improve educational opportunities for every American child. 
   Last year, Congressional Republicans passed an educational agenda to provide every child in America with first-class learning opportunities in safe, secure schools, to give parents new choices and more decision-making power over their children's education, and to bring common-sense reforms to a myriad of redundant and antiquated federal education programs. Unfortunately, the special interests in Washington were resistant to change and fought desperately against our reform efforts. This is what happened:

    Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I rise today, along with Senators MCCAIN and TORRICELLI, to introduce the Middle Class Tax Relief Act of 1999. The Senate's agenda on tax relief is premised on the realization that political leaders need to create policies that unleash the creativity, innovation and expertise of the American people. We should reject Washington-based solutions and instead, seek to move power, money and decision-making back to the people of this nation. 
   Now is the time for us to consider sweeping middle class tax relief. This tax relief proposal accomplishes several goals. First, it directs the vast majority of the relief to those who feel the tax squeeze the most: middle-income taxpayers. 
   Second, because it is across-the-board relief, every middle class taxpayer wins. Every American earning $25,000 in taxable income or more would see relief. Estimates by the Joint Committee on Taxation show that approximately 29 million taxpayers would see tax relief this year. 
   Third, it provides modest marriage penalty relief without adding complexity to the tax code. 
   Fourth, it is a realistic proposal that is also entirely consistent with the long-term goal of achieving a flatter, simpler tax code. 
   My proposal, the Middle Class Tax Relief Act, achieves these goals by raising the roof on the 15% individual income tax bracket. In other words, it returns middle class taxpayers to the lowest individual income bracket. It would increase the income threshold between the 15% and the 28% income tax rate brackets by $10,000 for married couples--$5,000 for singles--over a five year period. 
   If the Middle Class Tax Relief Act were fully in place today, it would mean that a family of four who earned $71,250 or less would be taxed at the 15% rate. It would mean such families could expect up to $1,300 in tax relief annually. That amounts to increasing their take-home pay by more than $100 a month and that is real relief. 
   In the coming weeks, a great deal of discussion will focus on providing the American people with the tax relief they need and deserve, and how that is to be accomplished. There are a number of proposals providing tax relief, some of which I support. However, I believe the Middle Class Tax Relief Act will be successful ultimately because we can actually achieve it during this Congress. I ask my colleagues to join me in this effort.

   Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, day before yesterday, our conference introduced our agenda for the 106th Congress. We all know that the Senate is in a very stressful period. But we have said time and time again that the people's business is going to continue. 
   If anything, the presence of all Members of the Senate has accelerated our attention--the Presiding Officer and I talked about that earlier today--accelerated the work of the people's business. But the outlining of this agenda is extremely important and says volumes about our view of what is good  for America and what this Congress, the 106th, will be highly focused upon. 
   There are five core areas that were defined by Majority Leader LOTT, other members of leadership, and our conference: 
   No. 1: Saving and strengthening of Social Security to create a more secure retirement system for all generations--not just some. 
   No. 2: Improving education opportunities for every American child, regardless of circumstances. We all know--and last night the President acknowledged--that we have an enormous problem in kindergarten through high school. In the last Congress, the 105th, our conference put education No. 1. I predicted then that we were going to stay with it. And we are. Nothing could be more important. 
   No. 3: Providing tax relief and economic opportunity for working families. 
   When I first came to Washington not all too long ago, a working family in Georgia was only keeping 45 cents on the dollar after taxes--State, local, and Federal--and their cost of regulation. In this Congress, our majority has gotten it to where they now keep 52 cents on the dollar. We are up 7 cents. But until we get two-thirds of their paychecks staying in their checking account--not coming up here--our work isn't anywhere near finished. 
   Many in our leadership have already outlined dramatic proposals to reduce all taxes anywhere from 4 to 10 percent and 15 percent over 10 years. I might add that if we can achieve that, we will indeed be restoring to American families the right to keep two-thirds of their paycheck. What a wonderful celebration we ought to have when that is achieved. 
   No. 4: Increasing personal and community security by fighting drugs and crime. 
   Drugs are the axle of crime in America today, Mr. President. In any prison in America, 80 percent of the prisoners in it--a jail, a Federal prison--are there for direct or indirect drug-related problems. To break the back of crime in America, you have to break the back of the narcotic Mafia. 
   No. 5: Strengthen our national security. 
   We just heard from Senator WARNER, the world is a very, very dangerous place. We have undermined our military. We have not given them sufficient resources, and therefore they cannot be as trained and ready as they need to be--No. 1. No. 2, the President alluded to last night--we are behind the curve in understanding that terrorism is a component of strategic warfare today. No. 3: As the Rumsfeld Commission has acknowledged, we cannot defend ourselves against ballistic missiles in the hands of rogues. 
   Saving Social Security, improving education, tax relief, personal security at home and in school and in the workplace, and strengthening our ability to defend ourselves from world rogues--Mr. President, these are not episodic issues that somebody dragged out of a hole; these issues are an acknowledgment that America is great because her people have been free, and an understanding that the core principles of 
   American freedom are economic opportunity, the right to work and save and pursue your dreams. That is what has made Americans so independent and bold--and an understanding that a free society cannot function if its citizens are not safe, either from a world rogue or a narcotic dealer, or that their property is not secure. To the extent a citizen of America is not fully educated, they cannot enjoy the full benefits of American citizenship, and indeed no uneducated people will remain free. 
   This agenda is designed to strengthen the components that have kept America great: Our freedom--keep Americans free economically, let them keep their paycheck, keep them secure and safe in their workplace and home and school, and that their property is protected, and keep them educated. Mr. President, they will take it from there no matter who the policymakers are; the American citizens will build that new American century that the President alluded to last night. 
   Mr. President, I now yield up to 5 minutes to my distinguished colleague, Senator ABRAHAM from Michigan, who will continue addressing the key components of this agenda for freedom.

   Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Michigan. I don't think you can say enough about the fact that the new target of the drug cartels, the drug infrastructure, which is in many ways better than a lot of the soft drink distributors', is focused on children 8 to 14--8 to 14. And the consequences of attacking that vulnerable segment of our society live with us an extended period of time.

   Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Education Savings Account Act of 1999. 
   Under this bill, parents will have more control over their children's education through IRA-style savings accounts that allow parents to save money tax-free for elementary and secondary education expenses. This legislation allows parents, grandparents, or scholarship sponsors to contribute up to $2,000 (post-tax dollars) a year per child for educational expenses while at public, private, religious or home schools--from kindergarten through high school. The accumulated interest in the savings accounts is tax-free if used for the child's education. 
   Just consider the benefits of these innovative education savings accounts: if a parent placed $2,000 each year in an education savings account beginning in the year of a child's birth, then assuming a 7.5% interest rate, $14,488 would be available by the first grade, $36,847 by the time the child starts junior high school, and $46,732 when the child starts high school. 
   For a child attending public school, this money could be used for after-school tutoring, car pooling or other transportation costs, school uniforms, or for a home computer. The Joint Committee on Taxation estimates that 75% of all families using these accounts--10.8 million families--will use them to support children in public schools. 
   These savings accounts give parents the power to obtain the necessary tools to overcome current obstacles to obtaining a quality education for their children. 
   This legislation is modeled on the Education Savings Accounts that were established for college as part of the bipartisan Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997. Last year, a similar version of this bill passed both the House and the Senate but was vetoed by President Clinton. 
   I am confident that because this is an idea that benefits millions of working American families, President Clinton will put aside his differences and join us in our effort this Congress. 
   By Mr. DODD (for himself, Mr. DASCHLE, Mr. KENNEDY, Mr. HARKIN, Mr. AKAKA, Mrs. MURRAY, Mr. KOHL, Mr. KERRY, Mr. KERREY, Mr. BINGAMAN, Mr. BRYAN, Mr. SARBANES, Mr. BIDEN, Mrs. BOXER, Mr. BREAUX, Mr. DURBIN, Mr. JOHNSON, Ms. LANDRIEU, Ms. MIKULSKI, Mr. ROCKEFELLER, Mr. REED, Mr. SCHUMER, Mr. TORRICELLI, Mr. WELLSTONE, Mr. LAUTENBERG, and Mrs. FEINSTEIN).

   Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, today I introduce legislation which would modify the boundaries of the Chattahoochee River National Recreation Area to protect and preserve the endangered Chattahoochee River and provide additional recreation opportunities for the citizens of Georgia and our nation. This legislation authorizes the creation of a greenway buffer between the river and private development to prevent further pollution, provide flood and erosion control, and maintain water quality for safe drinking water and for the fish and wildlife dependent on the river system. In addition, this legislation promotes private-public partnerships by authorizing $25 million in federal funds for land acquisition for the recreation area. The $25 million will be matched by private funds. The State of Georgia, private foundations, corporate entities, private individuals, and others have already given or pledged tens of millions of dollars to protect and preserve the Chattahoochee River for future generations of Georgians to enjoy. 
   I would like to thank Senator CLELAND for co-sponsoring this important legislation and supporting my efforts to protect one of Georgia's most vital natural resources. I believe it is crucial for Congress to act quickly on this legislation in order to protect the Chattahoochee River from any further development and environmental damage. I look forward to working with Senator CLELAND and my other colleagues in the Senate on this important proposal and urge its speedy consideration.
