   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today I wish to pay tribute to my colleague from Virginia, Senator CHUCK ROBB, who will leave the Senate in January after 12 years of exemplary service to his state as a member of this body. 
   As others have noted, CHUCK ROBB has had a long and distinguished career in public service. He served his country for 34 years in the Marine Corps and reserves, and he is a highly decorated combat veteran. He was a widely popular governor of Virginia, who increased the state's education budget by $1 billion, and appointed many women and minorities to top government jobs. And he has now served two terms as a United States Senator, where he has been praised for his leadership on national security, education, and the budget. 
   But I would like to note several aspects of CHUCK ROBB's Senate tenure that may not be quite as familiar, but for which I will always remember him and be grateful to him. The fact is that he was a hero on many issues: civil rights, human rights, and a woman's right to choose. 
   Time and time and time again, even in the most difficult and politically charged debates, Senator ROBB was steadfast in his support for the precious right of women to control their own bodies without interference from government. 
   He led the fight in the Senate to bring justice to African-American farmers throughout the nation who had been discriminated against by the Department of Agriculture. His legislation helped lead to the largest civil rights settlement in our history. 
   And then, in February 1993, he delivered a powerful and moving speech on the floor of the Senate, the message of which was that all of God's children, regardless of sexual orientation, should be treated equally in the military. 
   I will always remember Senator ROBB's eloquent words:  
   The issue should be not what kind of person you are but what kind of soldier, sailor, airman, or marine you are. ..... I would suggest to you, Mr. President, morale is in the heart of each service person. The threat to morale comes not from the orientation of a few but from the closed minds of many.  
   I was deeply touched by these words of tolerance and understanding, particularly because they came from one who had served so gallantly in the Marine Corps. 
   So I salute you and I thank you, CHUCK, and send you my very best wishes as you move on to new challenges.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, it has been more than a year since the Columbine tragedy, but still this Republican Congress refuses to act on sensible gun legislation. 
   Since Columbine, thousands of Americans have been killed by gunfire. Until we act, Democrats in the Senate will read the names of some of those who have lost their lives to gun violence in the past year, and we will continue to do so every day that the Senate is in session. 
   In the name of those who died, we will continue this fight. Following are the names of some of the people who were killed by gunfire one year ago today. 
   December 15, 1999: 
   Jerome Anderson, 26, Washington, DC; Danta Dandridge, 17, Washington, DC; Diane Gibbs, 39, Atlanta, GA; Jimmy Gibbs, 21, Atlanta, GA; Kasmas Hall, 18, Miami-Dade County, FL; Byron Johnson, 21, Pittsburgh, PA; Antoine Omar, 19, Boston, MA; Glenn Roundtree, 29, Chicago, IL; Oscar Segura Nieto-Lopez, 32, St. Paul, MN; Ricky Truss, 27, Detroit, MI; William Wilder, 39, New Orleans, LA; Venis Woods, 29, Philadelphia, PA; and Unidentified Male, 24, Newark, NJ. 
   We cannot sit back and allow such senseless gun violence to continue. The deaths of these people are a reminder to all of us that we need to enact sensible gun legislation now.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am heartbroken that the Supreme Court has issued an opinion that, to me, undermines a core democratic principle--that every vote counts and every vote must be counted. 
   I am also perplexed that the Court sent the case back to the Florida Supreme Court for further proceedings on the recount, since it did so while also suggesting that time had run out for the recount. That suggestion is disingenuous, considering that the U.S. Supreme Court itself helped cause the clock to run out when it voted 5-4 to stop the recount last Saturday by issuing a stay. 
   I want to compliment the four justices who voted against the stay order--Justices Stevens, Souter, Breyer and Ginsberg--two appointed by Republican Presidents and two by a Democrat. While several of them recognized constitutional problems in the way the recount was being carried out, they clearly understood the overriding importance of counting every legal vote. 
   In his dissenting opinion, Justice John Paul Stevens pointed out that the Florida Supreme Court, in ordering the recount, merely ``..... did what courts do--it decided the case before it in light of the legislature's intent to leave no legally cast vote uncounted.'' 
   He stated that in its action ``the majority effectively orders the disenfranchisement of an unknown number of voters whose ballots reveal their intent--and are therefore legal votes under state law--but were for some reason rejected by ballot-counting machines.'' 
   The closing words of Justice Stevens, I believe, will go down in history as the thoughts of a great Supreme Court justice:  
   Although we may never know with complete certainty the identity of the winner of this presidential election, the identity of the loser is perfectly clear. It is the Nation's confidence in the judge as an impartial guardian of the rule of law.  
   When the next President is sworn into office in January, I pledge to do all that I can to help the country put this extraordinary and unsettling election behind us. I will do my best in the United States Senate to advance the interests of the people of California, who have so many needs and rights that remain to be addressed. 
   There are many lessons to be learned from these events. We need to change our election procedures to make them uniformly as reliable and accurate as possible, so that we will never again be in this situation. And more Americans must now realize that their participation in the political process is vitally important. I will work on these challenges in the coming months, for the sake of Californians and for all Americans.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I thank the Chairman of the Indian Affairs Committee, Senator CAMPBELL, and the distinguished ranking Democrat, Senator INOUYE, for moving this important bill to the Senate floor. This bill will restore Federal recognition and associated rights, privileges, and eligibility for Federal services and benefits to the Federated Indians of the Graton Rancheria of California, formerly known as the Coastal Miwok tribe. 
   This bill provides much needed recognition for the tribe. The Graton Rancheria have been waiting decades for the Government to undo a past wrong. In 1958, the Federal Government stripped the Graton Rancheria of Federal recognition. Recently, it was found that the tribe holds a small parcel of land in Graton, CA that had been set aside as reservation for them in the 1920s. 
   As passed in the House of Representatives, this bill included language that waived the tribe's gaming rights. I supported that language, as did the Graton Rancheria and the local community. However, it was clear that the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs and the Bureau of Indian Affairs would not support the language. The chairman and ranking member of the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs have offered an amendment that removes the no-gaming clause. In his statement accompanying the amendment, Senator INOUYE asserts that the no-gaming clause is unnecessary because the Graton Rancheria have no intention of conducting gaming. 
   I hope with the Senate passage of this bill that the House, the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs, and the administration can work to resolve the differences over the no-gaming clause and come to an agreement on either bill or report language.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I appreciate the work of my colleague from Ohio, Mr. DEWINE on S. 1495, the ICCVAM Authorization Act of 2000, and was pleased to cosponsor that legislation. The measure will help ensure that we improve the review of chemical test methods employed by federal agencies with the ultimate goal of reducing the unnecessary use of animals in testing. 
   The bill we consider here today is the House-passed version, H.R. 4281, which is somewhat different than S. 1495. Would the Senator from Ohio be willing to clarify a few important points about this legislation for our colleagues?

   Mrs. BOXER. I have one additional question for my colleague from Ohio. The legislation also creates a Scientific Advisory Committee, SAC, to advise ICCVAM, and provides that the SAC should be comprised of at least one representative from industry and one representative of a national animal protection organization. 
   My understanding of this provision is that it is not exclusive, and that the SAC will also include at least one representative from the environmental community and one member from the public health community as equal voting members. I along with my colleague from Montana view this issue of equal representation as essential to this legislation. 
   Can we have the commitment of the Senator from Ohio that at least one voting member of the SAC will be from the environmental or public health community?

    Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today, I note with sadness the passing of David Brower, a great conservationist who died last month at his home in Berkeley, California. David Brower worked for more than half a century to preserve and protect the American landscape he loved so well. He served our nation in war and peacetime as a soldier, writer, and activist, and enriched the lives of many Americans. 
   Born in Berkeley in 1912, young David Brower learned to appreciate nature by guiding his blind mother on walks through the Berkeley hills. In the 1930s, he worked at Yosemite National Park and became a skilled mountaineer. During World War II he trained troops in climbing techniques, wrote the Army's alpine manual, and fought in northern Italy. 
   After the war he returned to California and volunteered at the Sierra Club, which was then a hiking organization with little involvement in public policy. After writing the first Sierra Club Manual, he became the club's first executive director in 1952. Under his leadership, the club's membership grew from 7,000 to 70,000 as it became the nation's leading environmental organization. After leading the Sierra Club for 17 years, Mr. Brower went on to found the Friends of the Earth and the Earth Island Institute, and he helped to establish the League of Conservation Voters.  
   During the 1950s and 1960s, Mr. Brower led the Sierra Club's successful efforts to block the construction of dams in Grand Canyon National Park and Dinosaur National Monument. He often said, half jokingly, that ``All I have been able to do in my career is to slow the rate at which things get worse.'' 
   But in fact he made things better. David Brower was instrumental in the creation of Redwoods National Park, North Cascades National Park, and Cape Cod National Seashore as well as the passage of the Wilderness Act and establishment of the National Wilderness Preservation System. 
   Our Nation has lost a giant, but we must try to walk in his footsteps. David Brower's life and legacy will live as long as we continue to preserve, protect, and enjoy America's natural treasures.

    Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate yesterday passed legislation to name the new federal courthouse in Riverside, California the George E. Brown, Jr. United States Courthouse. 
   It is altogether fitting that the federal courthouse in Riverside be named for the late Representative Brown. It was through his work for the people of the 42nd district of California that the courthouse was built. I only wish that he had lived to see its grand opening next year. 
   George was a champion of justice. Before he could vote, he helped to integrate university student housing. He fought against the internment of Japanese-Americans in World War II and stood on the side of workers in labor battles. George always asked us to use all of our assembled knowledge to improve the lives of our fellow humans and our world. In my long association with George Brown, I always knew on which side he would stand: on the side of justice. 
   Since his death, we have seen many tributes to the late George Brown. The USDA Salinity Laboratory at the University of California bears his name. The giant Sequoias that George loved now are protected with monument status, and he was remembered at the dedication ceremony. More tributes are planned. However, I am particularly pleased that the federal court building in Riverside will be known as the George E. Brown, Jr. United States Courthouse.

   Mrs. BOXER. I thank my friend from Massachusetts for coming down here and putting into words what so many of us are feeling--just this sense of unfairness, not only about the process, which he described so well, taking what is supposed to be a Small Business bill, hollowing it out and stuffing it full of other issues, leaving out the people who are supposed to be involved, but also the substance of what is actually in this bill. 
   I want to probe him on one question. Is the Senator aware that tens of billions of dollars in this bill are going to the HMOs, and there is not one string attached that the HMOs have to serve the senior citizens who they kicked out of Medicare? 
   We are giving bags of money to one of the most unpopular businesses in America today because they do not treat people fairly, without one requirement that they take these seniors home again and give them health care again. 
   I say to the Senator, you have seen it in your State and I have seen it in my State, where seniors were told: Join this HMO through Medicare. You won't have any copayments. You will be fine, only to wake up in the morning and be kicked out. 
   Could my colleague talk about the fairness or unfairness of that?

   Mrs. BOXER. I am sitting here listening carefully to the Senator from Massachusetts, to my Democratic leader, and others. I realize why the Senator started out with the word ``fairness'' and why this bill is so unfair. I wish to just ask one question. I wonder if my friend has seen the Washington Post analysis of this particular tax bill entitled ``Businesses Poised To Benefit From Bills.'' 
   I wanted to point out an irony and see if my friend doesn't agree, the irony of calling this a small business bill; in other words, they have hollowed out the small business bill. But let's look at what they have done. And I will be very brief, but I think it is important. It says, ``From the National Association of Broadcasters and defense contractors to the racetrack industry, to tobacco companies, business interests are poised to reap large benefits from the small print of Republican-backed bills that were moving through Congress yesterday.'' 
   Looking at several of the bills, it goes on to say--and again I will be brief--``But those benefits pale''--those benefits pale--``in comparison with the ones lavished on medical care providers,'' the HMOs. Those pale. So they gave to the tobacco industry; they gave to the defense contractors; they gave to the broadcasters. We know how they are all suffering. And those benefits pale in comparison with what they gave to the HMOs. So when the Vice President is out there talking about fairness and talking about fighting for people, this proves his point. When Democrats are locked out of the room--and we know they were--who walks away with the sacks of money but the HMOs that have been hurting our people. 
   So I think my friend has really laid out the case. And by the way, the Post points out there are many other special interests hanging around these corridors. They are unhappy they were left out of the mix, and they are listed here--the lobbyists in their pinstripe suits standing around here waiting to get in, waiting to get some of the benefits. 
   So I just wonder at the irony of the situation. I notice my friend is not wearing a pinstripe suit himself today. But the bottom line here is giveaways to those who have, asking nothing in return, giveaways to those who are hurting the senior citizens, kicking them out of the HMOs because they say Medicare doesn't pay enough. They get billions of dollars back. Nothing is really asked of them to walk away with those sacks of money. And all they are doing with the so-called small business bill is giving breaks to big business. I say to my friend, he is right to be upset on this point.

   Mrs. BOXER. Senator LANDRIEU and Senator CRAIG have worked so closely together. I am not an expert on that. I just saw Senator LANDRIEU deeply disturbed and upset in her view that rather than helping the people who adopt the most difficult situations, in other words, children who are disabled, children in foster care, we are going in the other direction. 
   I only want to say, in good will, that it looks as if the President will veto this bill for the many reasons we talked about. I am not going to, believe me, go into that. But when he does that, maybe we can go back and fix this problem so we can really celebrate passage. 
   I am only reflecting Senator LANDRIEU's distress that she feels that the toughest cases here are not being helped. That is all I wanted to say.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I thank my friend for bringing these issues to the floor of the Senate. I think this issue of pain abatement is a key issue. 
   I go even further than that in this debate because the issue of physician-assisted suicide, which I do not support, is really not what I am afraid of in Senator NICKLES' approach. But I just want to say to my friend, thank you for bringing this issue forward. 
   I watched a loved one, who was as close to me as anyone could be, cry out in pain hour after hour, saying: I don't want to live. 
   I wanted this person to live more than I can say. But I went to that physician of this loving relative and I said: Please, please, do everything in your power to anesthetize this pain, to sop this pain. This physician looked at me and he said: I will do everything that I can. 
   I am so fearful that someone else, if this bill becomes law, will look at me and say: BARBARA, I know how much you love this individual, but I can't do more than I am doing because I'm afraid I'm going to be hauled off to prison. 
   I don't want any family looking in the eyes of a physician, begging to put a loved one out of this type of misery and pain, being told that their hands are tied; they would love to help and they can't. 
   That is why what the Senator from Oregon is doing is so important and why I am so saddened that this bill, in the dead of night, that could lead to people writhing in pain, not being able to get the help they need, was done in such a fashion where we really can't even give it the attention it deserves. 
   As my final point, would my friend tell me again, for the record, so that everyone watching this debate can know, which organizations are opposing this Nickles provision for the reason that the Senator has stated--that it will lead to people suffering needlessly, and doctors being afraid to help them because they will be hauled off to jail.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, the Senate will soon bid a fond farewell to one of its most distinguished members, the senior Senator from New York. I rise today to bid him adieu. 
   As we all know, Daniel Patrick Moynihan is the Senate's Renaissance Man, a man of dazzling intelligence and accomplishments in many arenas of public life. A scholar, an author, a teacher, a statesman, a Senator: he is--to paraphrase President Kennedy's comment on Thomas Jefferson--perhaps the most extraordinary collection of talent, of human knowledge, that has ever graced the United States Senate. This body and every one of its members have been touched by his grace, and we shall all be ever the richer for the days he spent with us. 
   I have enjoyed the additional pleasure of serving with Senator MOYNIHAN on the Environment and Public Works Committee. In past years, as Chairman of the Committee, he raised public awareness on the issue of acid rain. In doing so, he broadened our horizons by greatly expanding our understanding of the far-reaching effects that human actions can have on the environment and the effects that environmental degradation can have on human beings. 
   Mr. President, I know that Senator MOYNIHAN has much more to offer his country, and I hope that he will long continue to give the Senate the benefit of his peerless intellect, insight, and experience.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to my good friend, California's good neighbor, and our distinguished colleague, Senator RICHARD H. BRYAN of Nevada. 
   With his impending retirement from the Senate, Senator BRYAN will culminate 36 years of public service at the local, state, and national levels. He has served the people of Nevada as a district attorney, public defender, state legislator, state attorney general, governor, and United States Senator. Throughout his career, he has been known for his intelligence, integrity, and good sense. 
   During his two terms in the Senate, DICK BRYAN has addressed a variety of national issues without forgetting the people of his state. He has been a leading champion of American consumers, fashioning laws to require air bags in automobiles, protect Internet privacy, reduce telemarketing fraud, and reduce errors in personal credit reports. He has fought for American taxpayers by working to reduce wasteful spending, eliminate special-interest subsidies, and balance the Federal budget. 
   Senator BRYAN has been a vigilant and tireless protector of Nevada's environment, working to save Lake Tahoe and prevent the construction of a nuclear waste storage facility at the Nevada Test Site. Earlier this month, he won another victory for his home State's environment with the passage of the Black Rock Desert--High Rock Canyon Emigrant Trails National Conservation Area Act, which will provide added protection to nearly 800,000 acres of federal land in northwestern Nevada. 
   Senator BRYAN is a gentleman, a man known for his ability to work with people of all parties and persuasions. In bidding him farewell, I hope that the Senate will carry on his spirit of comity, courtesy, and bipartisanship.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise today to bid farewell to the senior Senator from New Jersey: my dear friend and distinguished colleague, Senator Frank LAUTENBERG. 
   This is a bittersweet occasion for me--sad because Frank will be leaving us soon, but sweet because he leaves us with so many fond memories and such a great example of what it means to serve the American people through this great institution. 
   Frank Lautenberg has been one of my closest friends in the Senate. He has also been my colleague, confidante, mentor, and role model. Intensely patriotic and ethical, he takes his role as legislator very seriously without taking himself too seriously. A man of deep and wide-ranging intellect, he is quick to grasp the essentials of any issue before the Senate yet slow to criticize others, even those with whom he disagrees. A tolerant and benevolent man, he is ever ready to compromise in the name of harmony yet firm in his core beliefs and steadfast in acting on them. 
   Frank Lautenberg is a living embodiment of the American Dream. The son of poor immigrants, he served in World War II, graduated from Columbia University on the G.I. Bill, went into business with friends and developed one of the world's leading computer services companies. He chose public service not as a career move but as a way of giving something back to the people of his state and nation. 
   During his three terms in the Senate, Frank Lautenberg has worked to defend and improve the health, safety, and security of every American family. He wrote the laws to raise the national drinking age, ban smoking on airplanes, toughen the standards on drunk driving, and prevent anyone convicted of domestic violence from owning a gun. He helped write the Superfund, Clean Air, and Safe Drinking Water Acts. And he co-authored the Balanced Budget Agreement of 1997, which put America on the path to sustaining Social Security and Medicare. 
   Frank Lautenberg served the public good before he came to the Senate, and he will do so long after he leaves us. He founded the Lautenberg Center for General and Tumor Immunology three decades ago, and he continues to support its work as one of the world's leading cancer research institutions. A noted philanthropist, he continues to support charitable work in education, the environment, the arts, and the Jewish community. 
   Mr. President, Frank Lautenberg is someone I could point out to my grandson and say, ``There is a man.'' He is a great human being, a great American, and a great Senator. His departure will be a great loss to the Senate, but his presence has been a great gift to us all. I thank him for all that he has done for me, for this body, and for the people of the United States.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise today to bid farewell to Senator Robert Kerrey, a distinguished friend and colleague who will be leaving the Senate at the close of this Congress. 
   Bob Kerrey is a true American hero, a man of great physical and political courage. We all know about his heroism on the battlefield, though he rarely mentions it and does nothing to solicit the admiration showered upon him. A man of peace and goodwill, he speaks with unparalleled authority on the need to maintain a strong national defense while working for reconciliation with America's former adversaries. 
   Bob Kerrey's political courage is evidenced by his independence, candor, and willingness to tackle the toughest issues. He took on entitlement reform when few others dared look it in the face. He took the first brave steps toward a bipartisan reform of Medicare in order to guarantee the program's long-term stability. And he has continued to press for universal health care coverage for all Americans. 
   In an era when even the finest legislators hesitate to speak before consulting the polls, Bob Kerrey says what he means and means what he says. He never hesitates to follow his personal moral compass, even when this means working with the other political party or criticizing his own. 
   Mr. President, as Senator KERREY leaves the halls of Congress for the groves of academe, I know that he will bring the same courage and rigor to his new career that he has displayed here in the Senate. I join my colleagues from both sides of the aisle in sending him off with our best wishes and profound gratitude.

   Mrs. BOXER. I thank the assistant leader for the time. 
   I was very interested in hearing the Senator from Utah talk both about the economy and about education. I may never have been in quite that high an income bracket as he was, but I think I have a view that I learned growing up as a child of an immigrant family on my mother's side, a first-generation American who had to go to public schools. 
   I know the assistant leader has a major story to tell. I think it is very important that we consider that when we are on the floor. We ought to be fighting for the people who really need to make sure they have the economic opportunity; and everything that we do, we should keep those working families in mind because I think that the people at the top 1 percent are OK. In fact, many of them live in my State and they are telling me: Senator, we don't want a great big, irresponsible tax cut. We are doing great. We want to make sure, in fact, that the rest of America can come along. I thank them for that progressive position. 
   I think this Presidential race presents the starkest choice when it comes to our economy, and the good news is we have history to prove who succeeded on this economy and who has failed miserably.

   Mrs. BOXER. I think one of the biggest differences in the Presidential race, which is mirrored on the floor of the Senate as we debate tax legislation, is the fact that in Vice President Gore's plan it is the middle class who will get the breaks; in Governor Bush's plan, it is the very top 1 percent. 
   I want to be specific because I think people are tired of hearing that, and they don't really know exactly what we are talking about. Under Governor Bush's plan, if you earn over $350,000 a year, you get back $50,000 a year. You get back $50,000 a year. That is more than three full-time minimum wage jobs, I say to my friend. If under Governor Bush's plan you earn $30,000 a year, you get back about $200 a year. So I think my friend is right to point out that the kind of tax cuts Vice President Gore has in his plan, the kind of tax cuts that we stand here and fight for, would be for those in the middle class who really need to have the help. 
   I think that tax deduction for tuition is very important because the cost of college is going up enormously.

   Mrs. BOXER. I am aware of those reports, and I am aware of yet another report that came out in the last few days as well. Another independent, nonpartisan report says Texas is 48th in ranking as far as a good place to raise a child. Only two States were worse than Texas in terms of raising a child. 
   I say to my friend that I don't really know why we are in session now. We should have finished our work a long time ago. As long as we are in session, I intend, on behalf of the people I represent, to come down to this floor and make sure the folks in the country understand the choices they are facing, both in the Presidential election and in the congressional elections. 
   When our friend from Utah comes and talks about the economy and says, amazingly, the reason we are doing well in this economy is because of what happened 20 years ago, I have to scratch my head and say this is back to the future, folks, back to the future. He is citing things that happened 20 years ago. 
   I want to cite what happened when then-President Bush in the 1980s went to Japan. He was there to beg for guidance on what to do about our economy, which was failing. People had no hope. They were afraid. The recession was taking hold. Things could not have been worse. Deficits were as far as the eye could see. He went to Japan and said: Please, sir, tell me what you are doing. 
   Well, the answer was right here in America: faith in the entrepreneurship of our people, faith in our children, investing in their education, and the guts to cut this deficit, to make the hard choices that President Clinton and Vice President GORE made. We were proud to stand with them and we saw AL GORE cast the tie-breaking vote. So our friends on the other side of the aisle are going to go back 20 years. That is similar to saying if you had a disease 20 years ago and you took something for it and it didn't work, but something else in the nineties worked, you are giving credit to that medicine.

   Mrs. BOXER. Yes. The economy in California was just on its knees; it was so bad when Bill Clinton and AL GORE took over. I remember being on an airplane talking to Leon Panetta, the then-budget adviser to President Clinton. And we were looking at every avenue to bring hope to the people. One of the things they did was invest in defense technology. We had the Technology Reinvestment Act. We did so many things to bring this country back. That is why I wonder why the Bush camp isn't ahead in California because they have spent $1 million practically every week--if not more--bashing AL GORE. People remember, I say  to my friend. We were in a horrible situation. 
   I was an economics major in college, which doesn't qualify me for that so much. But I do know something about Economics 101. It is pretty simple. You don't give a big massive tax cut in a time when the economy is running strong. 
   We have been joined by our friend from New Jersey who ran an extraordinarily successful business and came here. We are going to miss him so much. He knows because it is so clear that you don't give the stimulus with tax cuts to wealthiest people in the middle of a prosperous time. You don't do that. You will only then add to inflation, which will lead to higher interest rates, which will then turn around and make it more expensive for people to buy a home, to send their kids to college, or to buy cars. As sure as you can bet on it, people will start retrenching, and it will lead to a recessionary atmosphere. 
   We know the George W. Bush plan is wrong--not because we are talking about it from an academic point of view but the fact is we lived through the trickle-down economics. We lived through that decade. Oh, you could go back and find some quotes from those trickle-down big tax cuts to the wealthy. What were the wealthy going to do? They were going to invest in the businesses here and create jobs. Let me tell you that didn't happen. A lot of that money went offshore. The bottom line is we got into big trouble. While our Republican friends were talking about a constitutional amendment to balance the budget, guess what we did. We balanced the budget without one of their votes.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, Senator LAUTENBERG has been my real chairman of the Budget Committee. Senator DOMENICI is the official chairman. But I always call Senator LAUTENBERG my chairman because he speaks for me. He has incredible experience on growing a business that turns into a mega business with his compassion and his caring about his employees and people who work for a living. My friend helped on the issue of Social Security. We tried to protect Social Security and set aside that surplus in a lockbox, and we finally made it happen. 
   I want to say again, if we had followed Governor Bush on Social Security, he promised a trillion dollars to the seniors, and he promised the same trillion dollars to the young people, telling them they could have their private stock market accounts. 
   The other thing I didn't mention today is I used to be a stockbroker after I graduated from college with my degree in economics. It was a long time ago. But I have seen the market go up, and I have seen the smiles on the faces of the people who entrusted me with their investments. I have seen the market go down. 
   I think what we need to keep in mind as we talk about privatization of Social Security is this: If you happen to retire on a day when your stock market funds are turned into an annuity and prices are high, you are doing great. But with a volatile stock market that can go down 400 points in one day, and that happens to be your day, or within the days of the month that you are going to turn that stock market fund into an annuity, you are going to find yourself in deep trouble. 
   That is another reason why Al Gore makes so much sense because he is saying save Social Security; keep it the foundation of the house. And if you want to do a voluntary stock market investment on top of your Social Security foundation, that is fine. 
   My friends, that makes sense. It is conservative. It isn't a river boat gamble. It is another great issue at stake. Great issues are at stake in this election. It is an exciting election. It is not an election between two people who agree on everything. They do not agree. We have a Republican candidate who wants to go back to the 1980s with trickle-down economics of the past, with small investments in education. 
   I will end my remarks with education because the Senator from Utah said there is a big difference between Republicans and Democrats. He said Democrats want the Federal Government to tell the local school districts what to do. That is incorrect. Every single program that we support dealing with school construction, dealing with smaller class sizes, dealing with after school, dealing with high tech in the schools--those are all options the school districts can take advantage of if they so choose. There is no program on this side of the aisle, or any in Al Gore's portfolio, that says that any local school district has to take these funds. I think that is key. 
   It goes back to Dwight David Eisenhower, whom I always quote, because he said you can't really be a strong country and you can't be secure unless you have an educated workforce. This was a Republican President. I liked Ike. My family liked Ike. One of the reasons they liked Ike was because he said that educating our children was a national priority and the Federal Government shouldn't just say: Here, States; take a whole lot of money and do what you want. He started the National Defense Education Act. That wasn't a blank check to the States. It was clearly for a purpose, and the purpose was to make sure that our teachers knew math and knew science and could teach math and science. 
   We know if you follow the Dwight Eisenhower kind of system that we need to look at our school districts and say: What do you need help with? Can we help you? We have the resources thanks to the great stewardship of the Clinton/Gore team. We have the great stewardship of the economy. We can invest some money. 
   Do you know what they told us? We need to help with the hiring of teachers. We need school construction. We need afterschool funds so our kids can learn after school. And the Democrats responded. 
   The big fight at the end of this year is over a lot of those issues. We stand with the children; we stand with the families; and we stand with the seniors against the HMOs. That will be a big issue in the last few days. Are we just going to do giveaways to the HMOs and keep letting them drop the seniors out of Medicare? We on this side of the aisle and Vice President Gore are ready to stand up to the HMOs. We are ready to stand up to the tobacco companies. We are ready to stand up for our children. In the waning days, I think these issues will play themselves out.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, it has been more than a year since the Columbine tragedy, but still this Republican Congress refuses to act on sensible gun legislation. 
   Since Columbine, thousands of Americans have been killed by gunfire. Until we act, Democrats in the Senate will read the names of some of those who have lost their lives to gun violence in the past year, and we will continue to do so every day that the Senate is in session. 
   In the name of those who died, we will continue this fight. Following are the names of some of the people who were killed by gunfire one year ago today. 
   October 26, 1999: 
   Manuel Guilarte, 78, Miami-Dade County, FL; 
   Damien McFarland, 25, Gary, IN; 
   Willie B. Nelson, 47, Atlanta, GA; 
   Sarah Petty, 49, Atlanta, GA; 
   Brett Pleasants, 39, Denver, CO; 
   Brenda Ray, 31, Atlanta, GA; 
   Tony B. Richards, 32, Memphis, TN; 
   Fernando Rodriquez, 25, Detroit, MI; 
   Comer Sistrunk, Jr., 61, Cincinnati, OH; 
   Ronald Turchi, 61, Philadelphia, PA; 
   Tony Unk, Houston, TX; 
   Michael Washington, 16, Baltimore, MD; and 
   Deric West, 18, Oakland, CA. 
   One of the victims of gun violence I mentioned, 31-year-old Brenda Ray of Atlanta, was shot and killed one year ago today while walking home from her sister's house with her two children. A stranger approached Brenda, robbed her, then shot her in the chest while her six-year-old son and five-year-old daughter stood by watching. 
   We cannot sit back and allow such senseless gun violence to continue. The deaths of these people are a reminder to all of us that we need to enact sensible gun legislation now.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, there is so much happening in the world of politics and elections, it is almost hard to know what topic to talk about. Education is certainly No. 1 on the agenda of the American people, and we are now in the final stages, I hope, of agreeing--I am hopeful--on an education bill for our country. We have made some good progress. I am very glad; it appears President Clinton's budget priority for afterschool programs is winning out. I am hoping that is the case. 
   Many of us have worked long and hard to make the point that afterschool care is crucial, that it is the best antidote to high crime, juvenile crime that occurs in the afternoons after school. It is a no-brainer. We know if kids are kept occupied after school, it keeps them out of trouble. We have seen these programs work. We have seen that juvenile crime occurs between 3 and 6 p.m. If children are engaged in stimulating activity after school, it helps. 
   President Clinton and the Democrats have been trying to ensure that the 1 million children who are waiting for afterschool programs, in fact, get afterschool programs. After reading press reports, I am glad to report to my colleagues that this looks as if it is on the way. However, we still have a major disagreement on school construction. I have seen some of our schools that are falling apart. Again, I hope we can reach agreement on this crucial issue. 
   The two candidates for President have been arguing over education. The good news is that education is the topic of the day. It is important, when we realize we have to import people to come into this country to take the high-tech jobs, and what a 
   tragedy it is that our young people are not trained. So education is key. 
   Of course, there is an argument between the two candidates on whether or not education should be a national priority, which is Vice President GORE's view, or Governor Bush's view that really the National Government should not get very involved. This is a key distinction. 
   I side with Dwight Eisenhower, a Republican President, who said it is crucial to our national defense to have education as a top priority and to make sure that our young people are educated in math, science, and reading, everything they have to know--even in those days before high tech. I think Vice President GORE is correct. 
   There is also a flap over some claims that the Texas students were doing really well. It turns out that the independent Rand report issued just yesterday says, in fact, those Texas students were not tested with national tests. If one looks at the national tests, they are just not making it. Clearly, this education issue is going to go on. 
   I come here as a member of the Foreign Relations Committee to talk about another issue, a very important issue, and that is an issue that is being debated in the Foreign Relations Committee right now. I am not on the particular subcommittees that are holding this hearing, but it seems to me the hearing going on about U.S.-Russia policy in 1995 are really aimed at trying to take a hit at Vice President GORE. 
   It is interesting that Republican officials who are speaking up 2 weeks before the election never even talked about the agreement that came out of those meetings in 1995. They did not talk about them for 5 years, but 2 weeks before an election they are out there trying to hurt the Vice President. This is politics at its very worst. 
   Frankly, what we ought to be talking about is foreign policy in the years 2000 and 2001 in this century because some of the comments made by Governor Bush and his advisers are raising all kinds of alarms throughout the world. It is important that they be put on the table. These remarks have to do with the U.S. policy in the Balkans. Advisers to Governor Bush have followed up on his statements he made in the last debate that if he was elected President, he would negotiate for the removal of all U.S. peacekeeping troops from the Balkans. As one can imagine, this announcement has set off alarms in capitals of our European allies who rightly believe that such a policy would weaken and divide NATO. 
   One of the things that alarmed me about Governor Bush's comments was he said our military is really there to fight wars and win wars, not to keep the peace; that is our role. That puts our people in a very difficult position because if, in fact, we have a situation where suddenly our military is no longer involved in peacekeeping but only in fighting, then I think our NATO allies will say: OK, you do the fighting, we will do the peacekeeping. And it means that our troops will be in harm's way and our pilots will be in harm's way. 
   This is a great concern to me. 
   According to today's New York Times, Lord Robertson, the NATO Secretary General, has regularly told visiting American Congressmen that the Bush proposal could undermine the whole idea of risk sharing, which is precisely the glue that holds our alliance together. 
   The Washington Post quotes one European Ambassador saying:  
   If the U.S. says it will not perform certain tasks, then the basic consensus of ``all for one and one for all'' begins to unravel....... The integrated military command could fall apart and so would [our] alliance.

   Mrs. BOXER. Let me take us back from before the unanimous consent request was made and kind of summarize where I was going. 
   We had a statement by Governor Bush. The statement was that he wanted to see all of those peacekeeping troops come home from the Balkans. He said we should not be involved in peacekeeping, only in fighting. As a member of the Foreign Relations Committee, I am concerned and clearly our NATO allies are concerned. Lord Robertson, the NATO Secretary General, again, has said this could undermine our relationship with our NATO alliance. 
   The Washington Post says one European Ambassador was quoted as saying: If the U.S. says it will not perform certain tasks, then the basic consensus of NATO begins to unravel. 
   Now, I remember being very surprised, because I was at the second debate, when Governor Bush made the point that we were carrying the load in the Balkans in terms of the peacekeeping troops. I knew that was incorrect. The fact is, American troops are no more than 20 percent of the total. American aid represents no more than 20 percent of what is being provided to Bosnia and Kosovo. 
   I would hate to see us walk away from peacekeeping and tell everyone we are the fighters; and then have our allies say: OK, you do the fighting; we do the peacekeeping. It is of great concern to me.

   Mrs. BOXER. I am going to read a little bit from those editorials when I can find my glasses, which is an important thing. Here they are. When I started out in politics, I did not need these reading glasses. So that shows you how long I have been around. 
   This is from the Washington Post:  
   The Balkans are at peace; democracy is sprouting almost everywhere; even the apparently invulnerable Slobodan Milosevic has been knocked from his perch. Of course, many problems remain, the gains are fragile and, yes, U.S. troops will be needed for some time. But surely helping democracy take root throughout Europe is worth the modest price of that modest deployment [of peacekeeping troops].  
   The New York Times says that George Bush's adviser's proposal is misguided. That is the proposal to say that we will no longer participate in peacekeeping.  
   The job of securing peace in Bosnia and Kosovo is far from complete. The American share of the peacekeeping has already been substantially reduced. Finally, the NATO alliance has been built on a concept of shared risk that is inconsistent with a total withdrawal of American ground forces from Balkan peacekeeping.  
   Now, we know that America's share, they say, of peacekeeping responsibilities is steadily reducing.  
   There are now only 11,400 American troops in the Balkans, about one-fifth of the NATO total. When NATO first went into Bosnia, about a third of its 60,000 troops were Americans. Balkan peacekeeping costs [are only] 1 percent of the Pentagon's ..... budget....... 
   Asking Europe to accept a total withdrawal of American ground forces from the Balkans needlessly challenges some of the basic assumptions of [our] western military alliance.  
   Our Western military alliance has served us well. Why would we now--when we see the tinderbox over in the Middle East--come up with a plan that would shake up our allies, that would worry our friends? This is the time not to make those kinds of proposals. And those proposals themselves are dangerous for the world. 
   I will also quote from USA Today. So you are seeing a whole number of newspapers coming out against this Bush plan. 
   They say:  
   The deeper risk extends beyond the Balkans to the overall U.S. role in NATO. Since NATO's formation in the wake of World War II, it has served to quiet the continent's longstanding rivalries. Weakening U.S. leadership would set off a counterproductive race to fill the gap, with unfavorable consequences for U.S. interests.  
   I have to believe this kind of a policy--either it was not thought out or it is a radical departure from what has worked for us not only through the cold war but after the cold war. Governor Bush says we can't do all this alone. And I agree with him; we can't do all this alone. But the bizarre thing is, he is pulling us out of a situation--or would want to, if he were President--where we are only about 20 percent of the force. This is an example of the way we ought to integrate all of the responsibilities of the various allies. I find it amazing that this policy would come up at this time when we have the world in such a precarious position as we look at what is happening in the Middle East. 
   So in any event, in closing, I will make these points in 
   two areas: education and foreign policy. 
   I think there are some interesting new developments the American people ought to look at. One, we have a candidate for President, who is the Governor of Texas, who is using Texas as the model. We just learned that Texas is almost dead last as a place people would want to raise their children. That is an unbiased report that came out. We have a Rand study, which is a study that Bush himself has cited, which says these kids in Texas are simply not making it. 
   We now have this foreign policy fiasco. While the Republicans want to look at what went on in 1995 between Russia and America, we now realize that what we ought to be looking at is this latest proposal by Governor Bush, and to try to debunk it, that would say we ought to pull our peacekeeping troops out, that America should not even have a role in peacekeeping. It is rattling our NATO allies. 
   Again, NATO has served us well. Why? Because we all cooperate and we work together and we come up with plans together. And to have this, if you will, ``Molotov cocktail'' from George Bush just thrown out--unprovoked--to shake up our NATO allies, and say, ``We are not going to do peacekeeping; we are going to do fighting,'' I say to this Senate that I do not like that division of responsibilities, where America does all the fighting and our NATO allies do the peacekeeping. 
   I do not like shaking up our allies at this time. I think it shows a certain recklessness, a certain lack of experience, a certain misunderstanding of history of what it has been like for us to build these alliances. As a member of the Foreign Relations Committee, I am very concerned by this proposal. 
   I believe it will have a very negative impact. 
   I am someone who has fought long and hard for burdensharing. I have offered a number of amendments in the House and the Senate asserting that it is important our allies carry their fair share. I will go on record as saying 80 percent of the troops in the Balkans is a fair share; 80 percent of our commitment in the Balkans is being paid by the Europeans, 20 percent by the Americans. That is good. That is a fair share. That is working. 
   To throw this kind of a proposal out there at this time when the Middle East is in crisis, when we need our allies at the table, when we need good relationships with our friends, shows a certain irresponsibility and riskiness upon which the American people are not going to look very kindly. And certainly, while the Foreign Relations Committee is beating up on the Vice President 2 weeks before an election about Russia-United States relations; our problem today isn't Russia-United States relations; our problem today is trying to do the best we can with our allies in the world to end some of these tragedies going on in the Middle East, to work for a new Yugoslavia that is democratic, to make sure we build on Madeleine Albright's seeming success in North Korea where, by the way, we have 37,000 troops. Maybe my friend from Illinois knows this. I did not hear any comments about pulling out troops from the Koreas, but maybe that is his next proposal, where we have kept the peace and stability.

   Mrs. BOXER. We have taken longer deciding who is going to talk than we have on what we really want to say. I will sum up my points today. 
   I think two issues are coming to the floor in this election. Education is one of them. We have the Governor of Texas saying his kids in Texas are doing great. We learned today that was based on a State test, not a national test. So that is something we have to look at. We have a new study showing that Texas is one of the worst places to raise a child. That is from another objective, nonpartisan study. 
   Now we have a hearing going on in Foreign Relations beating up on Vice President Gore for something that happened in 1995, when not one Republican ever complained about it until 2 weeks before the election, when Governor Bush has now made a proposal that in essence threw a bomb into NATO--figuratively, not literally--and our NATO allies are worried and concerned that suddenly we have on the table a proposal--not very well thought out, in my view--that would drastically change NATO and would say, in essence, that the United States will be the fighters, someone else will be the peacekeepers. 
   I think it is more dangerous for our people to take that on alone. It is a big worry I have. It shows in this sensitive time why we need proven, effective, experienced leadership in the White House. We don't want to have someone coming in and throwing this kind of proposal into NATO. We need our NATO allies now more than ever. We have great opportunities for peace in the world. We are not going to make them come true if we dissect NATO and destroy it.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today I am proud to introduce the California Reclaimed Water Act for the 21st century. As California takes its first steps into the 21st century, it is undeniable that the quality of water, the quantity of water, and the availability of water are among the most formidable challenges to our 34 million citizens and the many diverse regions of our fast growing state. Our farmers, urban dwellers, sport and commercial fishing interests, tribes, mountain communities and environmentalists all seek a more reliable and a more certain water future. Recycled water plays an important part in meeting California's water needs today and will play an even more important role in the next several decades. 
   California is making significant progress in its effort to put its water house in order. Between March and June of this year, two major water policy initiatives occurred in California. On March 7, 2000, California voters overwhelmingly approved a $2 billion water bond. Further, on August 28, 2000, Governor Gray Davis and Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt signed the landmark CALFED water agreement which broadly sets a course for California's water future. Water recycling and reuse is a major element of both these new actions and policies. 
   The existing federal program to support water recycling is found in title XVI, Public Law 102-575 and was enacted in 1992. The law authorized recycling projects and studies throughout California, including in Los Angeles, San Diego, San Jose, and San Francisco. The law also authorized projects in Colorado and Arizona. The 1992 law also called for a special Southern California Comprehensive Water Reclamation and Reuse study to investigate  how the use of recycled water could relieve water supply pressure in California. That study is being prepared by the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, State of California's Department of Water Resources, Metropolitan Water District of Southern California, Central Basin and West Basin Municipal Water Districts, City of Los Angeles, City of San Diego, San Diego Water Authority, Santa Ana Watershed Project Authority and the South Orange County Reclamation Authority. It should soon be completed. 
   Expressing continued support for the title XVI program, in 1996 Congress authorized a second group of water recycling projects in California, from Watsonville to Ventura County, and from Pasadena to Orange County, plus individual projects in Utah, New Mexico, Texas and Nevada. The legislation I introduce today builds upon these congressional efforts, voter ballot initiatives and agency studies. The bill authorizes a series of title XVI water recycling projects and directs the Secretary of the Interior to work with various water districts throughout the State including: Castaic Lake Water Agency Reclaimed Water Project Lake County, Clear Lake Basin Water Reuse Project East Bay Municipal Utility District and the San Ramon Serves District Recycled Water Project Inland Empire Utilities Agency, Inland Empire Regional Water 
   Recycling Project in San Bernardino County San Pablo Baylands Water Reuse Project in Sonoma, Napa, Marin and Solano Counties State of California Water Recycling Program Regional Brine Lines (salt removal) in Southern California, the San Francisco Bay and the Santa Clara Valley areas Chino Basin Watermaster, Inland Empire Utilities Agency, Western Municipal Water District and the Santa Ana Watershed Project Authority for the Lower Chino Dairy Area Desalination Demonstration and Reclamation Project. 
   Additional research, in cooperation with the WateReuse Foundation, is mandated and two previously authorized projects, one in Los Angeles and the other in the San Gabriel Basin, are modified. Finally, my bill mandates that the proposed projects be coordinated with the CALFED Program. Taken together, these projects will have the capacity to produce hundreds of thousands of acre feet of water. The Inland Empire Regional Water Recycling Project, for example, is designed to yield up to 66,000 acre feet of recycled water annually. Each acre foot of recycled water reduces the demand for imported water from the Bay-Delta and the Colorado River. Inland proposed to ``drought proof'' its region with these and related investments. 
   Beneficiaries of these projects and these investments include the immediate service areas, downstream neighbors, and towns and communities throughout California. Water recycling projects in California also reduce the demand for imported water, be it from the San Francisco Bay-Delta or the Colorado River. Recycling and reuse investments in Southern California have the effect of helping the Bay-Delta by reducing demand for additional imported Bay-Delta water. These same investments benefit California's neighboring states up and down the Colorado River. As more water is developed locally, pressure is reduced for imports. 
   Presently, negotiations are underway between California and the other six states of the Colorado River Basin. California is being asked to reduce the amount of water it takes from the Colorado River. In fact, as a result of these talks, California faces a reduction of some 800,000 acre feet. The water recycling projects proposed in this legislation can help California meet this challenge. As a result, Utah, Colorado, Nevada and Arizona also benefit from these programs. Unlike traditional Bureau of Reclamation water projects, these water recycling projects require a majority of funds to be locally provided. Consistent with title XVI limitations on recycling projects as authorized in 1992 and 1996, the projects proposed in my bill require 75 percent local funding. Federal cost sharing is limited to 25 percent. Moreover, this bill specifies that none of the funds can be used for annual operation and maintenance costs. Those annual expenses are the responsibility of the local water districts or management agency.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, the Senate considered the VA-HUD conference report a week ago today. During consideration of the bill, the Senate extensively debated report language included in the conference report that dealt with the cleanup of river and ocean sediment contaminated with DDT, PCBs, metals and other toxic chemicals. 
   Upon passing the conference report today, it is critically important to reiterate that it was understood by the managers of the bill in the House and the Senate that our resolution of the contaminated sediments issue in the VA-HUD conference report on October 12, 2000 was final, and that modifications to the report language or bill language relating to this issue would not be permitted this legislative session on any legislative vehicle. 
   It is also important to reiterate and to underscore the clarifications the Senate made to that report language. 
   One of the most important clarifications was a statement of the managers that the report language would not apply presently or prospectively to any site in California. 
   Another important clarification included a colloquy between Senators BOND, MIKULSKI and LEVIN stating that EPA had full discretion to define the operative terms of the report language. 
   Yet another critical clarification was a colloquy between Senators BOND, MIKULSKI and LAUTENBERG that stated that the National Academy of Sciences study referred to in the report language was not to be afforded any type of extraordinary or special standing in the Environmental Protection Agency's established process for selecting remedies under Superfund. 
   Finally, a colloquy between Senators BOND and L. CHAFEE clarified that report language would not affect the cleanup of the Centredale Manor Restoration Project in Rhode Island. 
   Make no mistake about it, Mr. President, I would have preferred that the proponents of this report language not be given even one bite at the apple in an appropriations bill on the important issue of cleaning up heavily contaminated river and ocean waters. I was concerned that the report language they advanced would slow cleanups in California and around the nation. 
   I am satisfied that our debate on the report language will ensure that it does not have that effect. 
   Under no circumstances, however, should the proponents of this report language be permitted a second bite at the apple to undo the work of this chamber and the commitments of the House and Senate managers not to revisit the issue of contaminated sediments--in bill or report language--in this legislative session on any legislative vehicle.

    Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the record and accomplishments of one of my constituents who has devoted his career to serving working men and women in California. On the occasion of his retirement from the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, I salute Joe Dean Bobo for his tireless efforts over the last three decades, and applaud his lifetime of accomplishments. 
   Joe Bobo was born in rural Arkansas to a family of fifteen. He moved to Oakland, California as a teenager, and served three years in the United States Army before beginning work in his family's scrap metal business. Joe's involvement with the IAMAW began in 1969, when he began work as an apprentice mechanic. He quickly advanced to become a shop steward, and was appointed a full-time union official with the IAMAW Northern California District Lodge 190 in 1979. 
   Since that time, Joe has worked tirelessly in advocating for fair wages and benefits on behalf of the men and women he represents. He has gained the respect of both labor union members and employers through his dedicated service. 
   In addition to his full-time position with the IAMAW, Joe's experience and passion for labor issues have resulted in him being called on to participate in a variety of leadership positions. He is currently the Secretary/Treasurer of the Automotive Machinists Coordinating Committee of Northern California and a Trustee of the Automotive Industries Health, Welfare and Pension Fund. Joe's labor leadership has also included a term as President of the California Conference of Machinists, representing 150,000 members employed in the aerospace, airlines, automotive, electronics and manufacturing industries. 
   His community service is also commendable, including service as an advisory member of the Transition Committee for Waste Management and on the New Oakland Committee. Joe is an exceptional person who has earned the gratitude and respect of the scores of people who have worked with him and come to know him. 
   I am pleased to join Joe's friends, family and colleagues in recognizing his outstanding service to his fellow workers and to the community and wish him well as he moves on to new challenges in his retirement.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I would like to congratulate Kim Dae-jung, the President of South Korea, on receiving the Nobel Peace Prize for 2000. This award is well-earned for a great leader whom many call the ``Nelson Mandela of Asia.'' President Kim's life-long dedication to peace and reconciliation is evident in the fact that he had been nominated for this award on 14 different occasions. Last Friday's announcement made President Kim his nation's first Nobel laureate, a source of great pride for the people of South Korea. 
   Kim Dae-jung has led an extraordinary life, highlighted by an unwavering commitment to democracy. In fact, throughout his career, President Kim has been willing to risk his own life in standing up for the principles that allow South Korea to be the great nation it is today. 
   President Kim has indeed paid a heavy price for speaking out against totalitarian rule. Shortly after his first run for President in 1971, Kim was nearly killed in a car accident that many believed to be an assassination attempt. Two years later, he was kidnapped by South Korean agents, ostensibly because he was perceived as a threat to the status quo. He would have been killed, had the United States not intervened. In the years that followed, President Kim survived jailings, house arrest, exile and numerous beatings. 
   Three years ago, President Kim campaigned on an innovative, open approach to reconciliation with North Korea, which he called the ``sunshine policy.'' This policy of building ties with the North is on a scale that has not been seen in the history of postwar Korea. After winning the election, President Kim, a forgiving and religious man above all, pardoned the former military rulers who tried to kill him as his first act in office. He has also been a positive force for South Korea's economy which was at a low point when President Kim was elected. The South Korean economy grew by 10.2 percent in 1999 and is projected to grow by 6 percent in 2000. 
   President Kim's ``sunshine policy'' culminated in a June summit between the leaders of North Korea and South Korea. The summit was a success, and set a tremendous precedent for the relationship between the two countries. Speaking of the meeting, President Kim said, ``the Korean people are one; we have a common fate. There is nothing we cannot do if we make steady efforts with good faith and patience.'' The possibility for continued conversation between North and South gives me great hope that the two sides have taken the first steps to a true and lasting peace. 
   The rebuilding process between the Koreas has been enhanced by several small but meaningful achievements. North Korea and South Korea have pledged to work on rebuilding roads and rail lines between the two countries. Earlier this summer, a brief reunion occurred of families separated by the Korean war 50 years ago. Just last month, the entire world was moved when the North Korean and South Korean teams marched together in the opening ceremonies of the Sydney Olympics. 
   I had the opportunity to meet President Kim in 1986 when he was under house arrest. I was very moved by his courage and faith and thought that he would some day lead his beloved nation. It is with great happiness that I take this opportunity to congratulate Kim Dae-jung and the people of South Korea on this historic occasion.

   Mrs. BOXER. Certainly. I say to my friend that it is a very simple amendment. It strikes two riders. We will send it over to the Senator at this time. It doesn't have any language. It simply strikes two of the riders. 
   Mr. President, will you please tell me when I have 5 minutes remaining of my time?

   Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Chair. 
   Mr. President, my amendment strikes two egregious anti-environment riders that have been attached to this appropriations bill. These riders are opposed by 21 environmental groups. 
   There is a letter on everyone's desk from the League of Conservation Voters. They consider this to be extremely important. 
   We also have another letter that came in this morning signed by the most respected environmental groups in the country supporting both of my amendments. 
   We will try to put these on the desks. I will go through the groups in a moment. 
   Twenty-one environmental groups oppose these riders. They say they believe these riders would ``jeopardize public health or the environment.'' 
   The first rider deals with arsenic in drinking water. Let me take a moment to explain why I think this rider should be stricken. In the Safe Drinking Water Act Amendment of 1996, which the Senate approved unanimously, we told the EPA to update its drinking water standard for arsenic by January 1, 2001. We included this provision in the law because we learned from public health experts that the current standard for arsenic is severely dangerous and outdated. The standard was set in 1975, but it was based on public health data from 1942. 
   What do scientists and health experts say about the dangers of arsenic? According to a National Academy of Sciences report, arsenic in water is known to cause cancer of the lungs, skin, and bladder. The National Academy of Sciences study and other studies also found that arsenic in drinking water may cause kidney and liver cancer. Arsenic is also known to cause other severe problems, including toxicity to the central and peripheral nervous system, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, skin lesions, and could cause birth defects and reproductive problems. 
   Here is the national shocker. The National Academy of Sciences estimates that 1 in every 100 people who drink water containing arsenic at the current standard may well develop cancer caused by arsenic. This is a cancer risk that is 10,000 times higher than the cancer risk EPA allows in food. 
   The National Resources Defense Council analyzed EPA's base data, and they looked at 25 States serving approximately 100 million Americans. They found that approximately half of those Americans are drinking water with arsenic levels that could cause 1 in 100 of them to develop cancer. 
   The arsenic levels in those systems meet the EPA's outdated 50 parts per billion standard. As the NAS has said, the outdated standard ``does not achieve EPA's goal for public health protection and requires revision as promptly as possible.'' 
   Let me repeat that. This is science. They base these rules on science. The  sciences say set the standard at a lower level as soon as possible. 
   In this rider we push the date back. It is a delay. I think it is a dangerous delay. 
   The EPA has been working on this new standard for a long time. They have held numerous public hearings. Actually, they have been working on updating the standard since the early 1980s. 
   It is time to do this. The EPA was told by Congress to move forward by January 1, and now this rider was slipped into this bill. 
   I know my friends believed at the time that these riders were not that much of a problem. Whoever told them that--and I was not in the room--I believe was wrong. They are proven wrong by science. They have been proven wrong. 
   Call me old fashioned, but I think when you play around with the arsenic levels in drinking water, it deserves to have the light of day. It should not be attached to some rider. I am the ranking member on the subcommittee on the Environment. My chairman of the full committee is here, Senator BAUCUS. We are working hard to make sure that drinking water is safe. Yet we push back the date. That is not the right thing to do. 
   I appreciate my friends giving me 15 minutes of time, and I am going to give Senator BAUCUS about 5 minutes of that time when he is ready. I have saved 5 minutes. 
   This is no way to legislate on an issue such as arsenic. 
   In closing, before I yield my time to my friend, I want to talk about the other part of this amendment which deals with another egregious rider that has to do with clean air. The clean air rider is very important. It essentially would prohibit EPA from designating new regions of the country as being in violation of smog standards. In other words, it is a gag order on EPA, telling them they cannot, in fact, tell communities their air is dirty. This is a fact. 
   I do not understand, again, why we would be doing this. There is a court case pending on the power of the EPA. It specifically says in that court case that EPA has the right to designate these areas and to tell people in these areas they are not meeting the smog standard. Administrator Browner made a very strong comment about this rider in the past. 
   I ask how much time I have remaining.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I want to respond to my colleagues directly on a number of points that they made. These two riders should be deleted. It is bad process. I think that has been spoken to a number of times. And it is really bad policy. I think that has been spoken to as well. 
   I say to my dearest friend, Senator MIKULSKI, who has worked so hard on this bill--and it means everything to her--how much I support her bill but for these riders. I want to tell her how I feel. 
   I do not think that all wisdom resides in Washington. I think I am quoting the Republican candidate for President. I do think these 21 groups are phenomenal. I do trust them. The National Resources Defense Council, the Sierra Club--maybe they do not always agree with every one of us, but they spend their lives on these issues. I do respect them. And I do think that they can. I am really glad it looks as if they are going to count these votes as an important vote on their scorecard. 
   But I do want to say if CEQ were in the room and some others from the administration--I know it to be fact, and it is true --I just do not happen to agree with them. I will tell you who was not in the room, who was not even given the courtesy of a phone call, Senator Max BAUCUS, who is the ranking member on Environment and Public Works. I will tell you who else was not in the room, Senator MOYNIHAN, who supports my dredging amendment. I think a phone call from the administration, if you will, to those folks would have been in order to find out how we feel about these anti-environmented riders. So we are very disappointed. 
   I say to my friend, Senator CRAIG, who has left the floor, he calls it ``silly science'' to talk about a lower standard for arsenic. Here is the silly science. I have to tell you, taxpayers pay the National Academy of Sciences to produce this study on arsenic in drinking water. This isn't silly science. This is what they said:  
   This outdated standard does not achieve EPA's goal for public health protection and, therefore, requires revision as promptly as possible.  
   So what did we do? We did the opposite. We delayed the date. 
   The Senator mentioned a water district in California. That is why we have a waiver in the Safe Drinking Water Act, for those small communities, a waiver so they will not have hardship. That is why we have a State revolving fund which, by the way, is funded in this bill. It needs more attention. It needs more help. 
   But I have to say, again--and call me as old-fashioned as you want; maybe it is because when I was a kid I saw ``Arsenic and Old Lace''--but I can tell you right now, the science is clear. It is not silly; it is not foolish. This is very dangerous. We have to do something about it. 
   To say this is a rush to judgment when we have been having hearings on the standard since the 1980s, we all know what it is about. It is about a delay. It is the hope that the new administration may not be as tough.

   Mrs. BOXER. So I would sum up this way. We have a gag order in front of us in the rider that deals with EPA not being allowed to tell people they live in a dirty air district. It is for people to know that exposure to smog decreases lung function. It hurts our children with asthma, and it leads to emergency room visits. The courts have said clearly--and I have a direct quotation from the court--the court said: EPA has the right to tell people the truth about the quality of their air. This rider overturns that court decision. 
   I hope we will have strong support for this amendment. 
   I thank my friends.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I strongly oppose report language included in this conference agreement that will delay the cleanup of waters contaminated with toxic pollutants such as DDT and PCBs. We tried to work with my colleagues to change this language. We were unable to be successful. 
   The language will remain in because you can't strike report language, but we have a sense of the Senate that is very clear. Basically the operative language, which was just read by the clerk, is:  
   It is the sense of the Congress that the Environmental Protection Agency should move swiftly to clean up river and ocean sites around the nation that have been contaminated with PCBs, DDT, dioxins, metals and other toxic chemicals in order to protect public health, safety and the environment.  
   The report language included in this bill--remember, this is an appropriations bill--prohibits the EPA from cleaning up river and ocean sites that are contaminated with these horrible pollutants until the National Academy of Sciences completes a study or until June of 2000, whichever comes first. That isn't the worst of it. The worst of it is, we believe this language opens up a whole new loophole, which is really going to mean we are going to have many more court suits. I will get to that in a minute. 
   We think this language could delay the cleanup of at least six Superfund sites nationwide. One of them happens to be in California. The report language that is extremely troubling, which we were unable to remove, requires EPA to ``properly consider the results of the NAS study'' before moving forward on the cleanup of these sites. Anyone who knows anything about litigation knows a lawyer will have a field day with the phrase 
   ``properly considered.'' 
   What does that mean? You must properly consider before you move ahead with a cleanup? You could have a whole year discussing what that means, and that is exactly what the polluters are going to do. They are going to haul this Government into court just to try to get out of their responsibility. It will give polluters a hook to get into court and to litigate. 
   I want to talk about a site off the Santa Monica Bay, the Montrose site. 
   Mr. President, will the Chair inform me when I have 5 minutes remaining of my time?

<DOC>
<DOCNO>106-boxer-ca-7-20001012</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Chair. 
   The Montrose Chemical Corporation holds the distinction of being the largest producer of DDT in the world. That is not a great distinction since we know what a poison DDT is. 
   It discharges tons of DDT through storm sewers into the ocean off the Palos Verdes peninsula, and 100 tons of it sits on the ocean floor there. 
   DDT is classified as a probable human carcinogen. It is thought to have severe liver and neurological impacts, and it has also recently been identified as a chemical which may promote breast cancer. 
   We know DDT is causing harm to the ocean, i.e. Santa Monica Bay, because the DDT goes up through the food chain where it reaches the bald eagles. Of course, we know those bald eagles were brought to the brink of extinction by DDT, and we know it causes the eagle eggs to thin and to fail to successfully hatch. EPA estimates it will cost $150 million to restore the ocean where that dump is. 
   The report language, in our strong opinion, with legal authorities across this country, tells us that it would prohibit the EPA from cleaning up this site until the NAS report comes out. And then even after that, Montrose will go back into court. Mind you, they have already spent $50 million fighting the cleanup. Their position is: Let the DDT just sit there. Don't cap it off. Don't do anything. In the meantime, it is poisoning the environment there. 
   I don't understand why we do these things. When I talk to my constituents, their eyes roll. Arsenic, DDT, PCBs, these are not good things. If we could agree on one thing around here, it would be to get rid of them. We do  everything we can to help people who are good actors to clean up their act, if they made a mistake. We have a State revolving fund. 
   It stuns me that in this century we are still arguing over cleaning up arsenic out of the water, cleaning up DDT that is harming wildlife. 
   As to this argument by Montrose that they should do nothing, imagine how strongly they feel. They have spent $50 million in order to do nothing. Why didn't they spend the $50 million cleaning up the site, and we would be rid of the DDT; we wouldn't have this poison moving up the food chain. 
   What we hope to achieve--and we hope the managers will support this--is a very simple sense-of-the-Congress amendment. It is so clear. What we say is: Look, we can't get your language out of the report. We understand you don't want to make changes because you don't want to go back to conference. All we are saying is, let's stand firm together. Let us pass the sense of the Congress. I will reiterate it, and then I will save my 5 minutes. I am hopeful others will come to the floor.  
   It is the sense of the Congress that the Environmental Protection Agency should move swiftly to clean up river and ocean sites around the nation that have been contaminated with PCBs, DDT, dioxins, metals and other toxic chemicals in order to protect health, safety and the environment. 
   Now, my colleagues say nothing in this bill would harm that. I hope, therefore, they will support this amendment. I think it is very important. 
   Mr. President, I will take an additional 30 seconds to say Senator LEVIN wants to be added as a cosponsor. Senator BAUCUS was not personally consulted by anyone on this matter. That is clearing up the record, straight from Senator BAUCUS.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Massachusetts for his eloquent remarks. He is a leader on environmental issues in the Senate. It makes me feel really good that he came over. 
   I want to again try to set the record straight. Senator BOND said a letter is on its way from the EPA saying the California site is not in fact affected by the language in the bill regarding dredging. We have called them again. We called the general counsel last night. I told my friend from Missouri. They tell us that no such letter is coming. 
   Be that as it may, whether the letter comes or it doesn't come, the fact is if it does not affect California--and I hope he is right--I say to my friend, if he gets that letter, I will be very grateful. It is a bad situation because the language, in fact, we believe will really slow down the cleanup of Superfund sites. That is why you have Senators MOYNIHAN and SCHUMER concerned about the Hudson River. That cleanup will be stalled. 
   As my friend, Senator MIKULSKI, said--she calls me the gentlelady from California. She is the gentlelady from Maryland. That goes back to our House days. Senator MIKULSKI pointed out that she said these riders are less draconian. I believe that. They are less draconian. They are still bad, and 
   they don't belong on their otherwise terrific bill. They do harm. 
   My friend points out that it is very clear the language said this will wreck the public health--no delay. It doesn't say ``affect'' the public health or the environment. When you have an effect on the environment by the fish eating DDT, you do not have to be a rocket scientist; if the fish eat DDT, it it is bad for humans. When do you prove that? It may not come down the line much longer. 
   I know my friend worked very hard on this. She had people in the room whom she trusted. But, again, I don't believe the administration sought out these riders. My friend is right; it was the House Members who did. They simply don't belong here. It would be very simple for us to agree to this sense of the Senate. I think it would be helpful because my friends say they don't want to delay these cleanups. 
   I want to make one point about science. Listen very carefully when people stand up here and say it is silly science and we must act on science. The EPA and the National Academy of Sciences acted on science with their new rule on the arsenic standard. Guess what. They are calling this silly science. This is the National Academy of Sciences. They say arsenic is very dangerous. 
   The bottom line is you can't seem to win around here. You get a report done by the National Academy of Sciences, and they say you have silly science; forget about it; throw it away. When you don't have the report, they say you can't act. As my friend pointed out, there have been many studies done by the National Academy of Sciences on port dredging as a way to get rid of these contaminants. We didn't know  they were life threatening and dangerous. We know that now. 
   I hope we will have a good solid vote on these amendments. 
   I thank my colleagues. I retain 30 seconds.

   Mrs. BOXER. I thank my friends for the opportunity for the brief debate. I say to my friends, these are not harmless riders. You can say they will ``defang'' and that is in the eye of the defanger. 
   The bottom line is these are not harmless riders. It is not harmless to tell the EPA they are gagged from telling the people in my State and every other State that they live in a dirty air situation. That is what this rider does. 
   It is not harmless to tell the EPA they cannot set a new standard for arsenic, a standard that essentially was set with data collected in 1942. I will not tell anyone if I was born then or not. That is an old standard, folks. We know it is 
   much more dangerous. 
   Finally, it is not harmless to delay the cleanup of PCBs and DDT and all the other hazardous toxins that sometimes get into the bay and the ocean floor and harm the wildlife and work up the chain. 
   Please support the Boxer amendments.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, my amendment strikes two riders which are harmful and unfair to the American people. That is why 21 environmental groups support the amendment. And the League of Conservation Voters has indicated they are going to score this on their environmental scorecard. 
   The first rider delays the setting of a new standard for arsenic in drinking water. The National Academy of Sciences tells us we must act on a new standard for arsenic in water because arsenic is now a known carcinogen. They urge swift action because they tell us that the old standard was based on 1942 data. Arsenic causes cancer. That is science. We should not delay. 
   The second rider gags the EPA from informing communities that their air quality is harmful to their health. That is, to me, in a democracy, an amazing thing that we would stand here and allow this to happen, where the EPA would be denied the free speech to go into communities and say: You have to watch out for your health. 
   Gag rules on clean air and delays on arsenic standards are bad riders. I hope we will strike them.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, this is a simple amendment. It is a sense of the Congress and says the following: 
   It is the sense of the Congress that the Environmental Protection Agency should move swiftly to clean up river and ocean sites around the Nation that have been contaminated with PCBs, DDT, dioxins, metal, and other toxic chemicals in order to protect the public health, safety, and the environment. 
   I think this is very straightforward. I think we should all join hands and support the amendment. Why do I think we need it? There is report language in this bill that we believe delays the cleanup of these sites. The managers say, no, they don't think it will result in delay. If that is the case, then why can't we all join hands and support this sense of the Congress? 
   My goodness; we ought to protect our environment in this way. It seems to me if we have PCBs, if we have DDT with an ocean environment, a bay environment, or river environment, it is going to harm and it is harming the wildlife. That gets passed on to humans as the fish consume the DDT. 
   I urge a ``yes'' vote. 
   I ask for the yeas and nays on this amendment.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I have strong reservations about the fiscal year 2001 Defense Authorization Conference Report that is before the Senate today. The concerns I have are the same that led me to vote against the Defense Authorization bill when it was before the Senate earlier this year. 
   This conference report would increase Defense spending by more than $20 billion over last year's authorized level. It is $4.6 billion over the President's request. I am particularly troubled that most of this $4.6 billion increase is for weapons systems that were not requested by the Department of Defense. 
   While I support many provisions of this bill, including a 3.7 percent pay raise for military personnel and additional pay for troops on food stamps, I strongly believe that military spending is increasing at a rate beyond what is necessary to meet our security needs. 
   Today, however, our military has been attacked--presumably by those who believe that acts of terrorism might somehow deter the United States from defending our interests of promoting peace and security throughout the world. 
   At this time, it is important to vote for this bill to send a signal to the rest of the world that America stands united in the face of such threats and supports the men and women who so bravely serve this Nation.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, my heart is so heavy this morning as we learn of the increasing tensions in the Middle East. 
   I join my friend from Arizona, Senator KYL, in expressing our condolences to those American families who are grieving at the loss of their children by an unprovoked attack on one of our ships off the coast of Yemen. We are not exactly sure who did this. We suspect that it was terrorism. 
   But, as Senator MCCAIN said on one of the shows this morning as I listened to him, we will find out, and we will respond. The world should make no mistake about that. 
   This morning I also want to call on Yasser Arafat to take control of the situation in the Middle East. There has been an incident where four Israeli soldiers were in Ramallah--the Israelis say that they had taken a wrong turn. They certainly weren't provoking anything. They were captured, and taken to the Palestinian authorities and to a detention center. Then a mob overtook the center and killed at least two of them. The reports vary. One report I heard said there was a lynching. I don't know that is accurate, but one report said that. You have now no rule of law. It is very difficult to negotiate a peace agreement when there is no rule of law on one side of the equation. 
   I had been closely following this. I was very hopeful yesterday. Things looked as if they were going in a better direction. The word was that Yasser Arafat was, in fact, calming his people down. But it is time for him to do this now publicly. It is one thing to quietly work behind the scenes; it is another thing to come out publicly and say enough of mob rule. 
   As I say, I come here with a very heavy heart, but always hopeful that the goodness in people will overcome everything else. 
   My heart is with the American families who will be grieving. My heart is with all the families in the Middle East who are suffering so much. 
   I believe Dwight Eisenhower once said--I may stand corrected--that people want peace so much that one of these days governments had better get out of the way and let them have it. I think people want peace. The vast majority of people want peace. How tragic it is that we can't seem to grasp that. 
   I praise President Clinton and Vice President GORE for doing everything they can. I give them my best. I offer myself as someone who will do what I can. I am on the Foreign Relations Committee. This is an area that we know is always a tinderbox. Yet we have faith that the peace process can get back on track.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, thank you very much. I thank my friend from Vermont for all his hard work. I thank my friend, Senator WELLSTONE. I thank Senator BROWNBACK. I thank Senator BIDEN and Senator HATCH. 
   We have a very important bill before us. I think the Trafficking Victims Protection Act sort of stands on its own. I would love to have seen that come on its own because it is a landmark piece of legislation. I felt the same way about the Violence Against Women Act. 
   That is a landmark piece of legislation. Unfortunately, I think we have issues and pieces of legislation that shouldn't be in here. But that is the way it goes. How you would ever get to the point where you would put an issue that deals with sales of wine on the Internet is beyond me. I don't think people really get what we do here when we take these issues and blend them together. But let's call it the way it is. 
   The Trafficking Victims Protection Act and the Violence Against Women Act are so important that Members are willing to say, even if they didn't agree with all the appendages, they are willing to go along with them. I am going to make some comments about each piece that is in this legislation. 
   The Violence Against Women Act is very near and dear to my heart because in 1990 I was over in the House, where I served very proudly for about 10 years, and Senator BIDEN came to me and said: Would you be willing to offer the Violence Against Women Act in the House? He had authored it in the Senate. I was extremely pleased to agree. 
   The whole issue of domestic violence in our country up until that time was never discussed. It was swept under the rug. Even though we knew it was brutalizing women and children, we didn't have the courage to act. In those early years, it was very hard to get attention paid to violence against women. 
   I was able in the House to get through just a couple of pieces of that legislation. But it wasn't until I came to the Senate with Senator BIDEN that we really orchestrated tremendous support for the bill. In 1994, we got it through as part of the Crime Act. It has proven itself. 
   In this particular reauthorization, we will provide $3.3 billion in funding over the next 5 years to protect victims of domestic abuse and violence. We have made tremendous progress. We have seen a reduction of about 21 percent in domestic violence. But still to this day, we have a national crisis that shatters the lives of millions of women across the country and tears at the very fabric of our society. 
   Reauthorizing these programs sends a much needed message to those who even think about lifting a hand to a spouse or think about lifting a hand to an innocent child that we will not stand silently by and that we in fact will protect those victims of domestic violence. 
   We know that nationwide nearly one in every three adult women experiences at least one physical assault by an intimate partner. We know for a fact that domestic violence is the leading cause  of injury to women age 15 to 44, with nearly one-third of women who are murdered being murdered by a husband or a boyfriend. 
   Although domestic violence affects both men and women, the overwhelming majority of domestic violence victims happen to be women. That is why a majority of the services authorized under the Violence Against Women Act focus on the unique circumstances of women in abusive relationships. 
   Again, we have made progress. Since 1994, when the bill passed and President Clinton signed it into law, there has been a 21-percent decrease in intimate partner violence and we have increased battered women's shelters by 60 percent. 
   I remember in those years when we were battling for this bill, we originally pointed out that there were more shelters for animals than there were for battered women. I am proud to say today we have seen an increase in the number of shelters so we can in fact address the critical needs of victimized women and their children, many of whom have absolutely no place to go and therefore sometimes they are forced to stay in these abusive relationships. Where are they going to go? They will go out on the street if they don't have a loving family to go home to. It is a tragic situation indeed. 
   The bill ensures that we will be funding a continued increase in these shelters. But we also want to stop the violence before it gets to that. We have STOP grants that provide moneys for rape prevention, and education grants, and a 24-hour national domestic violence hotline which is so important. Women in these circumstances need to have a reassuring voice. They believe sometimes that no one cares about them; they are all alone. If they can dial that hotline and get professional help, it makes all the difference in the world. 
   This bill will strengthen law enforcement efforts to reduce domestic violence by requiring the enforcement of other States' protection orders as a condition of funding for some of the grants. In other words, if you have a batterer who tries to escape prosecution by going across State lines, we address this issue. 
   This is very important. I want to talk about the children. We talk about battered women, but we know--this is an incredible fact as we look at the causes of violence in society, and we are right to look everywhere in the society--we need to understand if a young boy sees his father beat his mother, that child is twice as likely to abuse his own wife than the son of a nonviolent parent. If a child, particularly a young boy, sees a father beat a mother, he is twice as likely to abuse his own spouse. 
   We know 10 million children every year are exposed to domestic violence. More alarming even than that is the fact that 50 percent to 70 percent of those men who abuse their female partners also abuse their children. It becomes a way of life and a way of communicating for which we should have zero tolerance. 
   These abused children are at high risk for violent, delinquent behavior. The National Institute for Justice reports that being abused as a child increases a child's likelihood of arrest as a juvenile by 53 percent. We know even when they are young they are more apt to be arrested and get in trouble. We know when they are adult and they marry they are more likely to abuse a spouse. 
   When we talk about the Violence Against Women Act, we are not talking only about women. We are also talking about the children. If there is anything we can do in this hallowed hall of the Senate, it is to protect children. We have the Safe Havens for Children Pilot Program; we have victims of child abuse programs funded; we have rural domestic violence and child abuse enforcement grants. This package also includes training for judges and court personnel. We also, for the first time, look at battered immigrants, which is a very important issue, because we sometimes have people coming here who don't understand their rights. They need to understand their rights, that their bodies don't belong to anyone else, and they have a right to cry out if they are abused. 
   There are many other programs reauthorized by the Violence Against Women Act, such as those to combat sexual assault and rape, transitional housing, and civil, legal assistance. Again, a lot of these folks don't understand their legal rights. We provide grants to counsel them. We include protection for older and disabled women. 
   It is hard to even imagine an older woman in our society or a disabled person being victimized. Is there no rule that would say to every human being that there has to be respect? Unfortunately, in some cases, these rules don't penetrate. So we have to get tough and make sure that we prevent this. However, if it happens, we will crack down. 
   Again, I thank Senator JOE BIDEN for his work. It is very important. 
   Also, a judgeship that is being held up is the nomination of Bonnie Campbell to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. One might ask what it has to do with the Violence Against Women Act. The fact is, Bonnie Campbell has been the first and only Director of the Violence Against Women Office in the Department of Justice, and her nomination is being held up because of partisan politics in the Senate. Here is a woman who paved the way for the Violence Against Women Act, ensuring it was successful, and she is a perfect person to be a judge. She was the attorney general in Iowa for many years. Her achievements and qualifications are obvious. If we really care about the Violence Against Women Act, and I believe we do, then I believe we will have an overwhelming vote, hopefully a unanimous vote. Then we ought to look at one of the people who has made this act such a success. What a wonderful tribute it would be to the women of America to make Bonnie Campbell a judge. 
   I join with Senator HARKIN on this because I know he has been quite distressed that such an excellent nominee has had a hearing, but her nomination has not come out of committee. We know of no one who is opposed to Bonnie Campbell. I think it would be a fitting tribute to the women of America to bring her nomination quickly to the floor. 
   I appreciate the work of Senator WELLSTONE and Senator BROWNBACK on the Trafficking Victims Protection Act. We know that some of these victims have been subjected to the most horrific lives, including rape, sexual abuse, torture, starvation, and imprisonment. The selling of naive and desperate women into sexual bondage has become one of the fastest growing criminal enterprises in the global economy. It is hard to understand how this could happen. But when people are in a strange land and are frightened, they look to others to protect them when they really want to hurt and harm them. This legislation authorizes $94 million over 2 years to stop this abhorrent practice. 
   At the beginning of my remarks, I talked about sometimes attaching bills to other bills that make no sense. I am sad to say this has the alcoholic beverage sales attached to it. I am very sorry for the small wineries in my State. I tried to protect them. I will have some kind of a colloquy with Senator HATCH on this. Half of our 900 wineries in California are run by families. They don't have big, elaborate distributors; they don't have a big distribution. Because of this they will need to sell their product on the Internet. I have nothing against the way wine is distributed, but the new technologies will make it possible for our many wine sellers to sell directly to consumers without the need to go through a middleman or middle person. I think it is sad that we have attached this because these very small family-owned wineries may well suffer. 
   I am going to be working with my colleagues. I know Senator LEAHY is quite sympathetic to this. We want to make sure there are no negative impacts from this legislation. We think there will be. But we are going to follow this very closely. 
   The excuse given is, we will stop kids from buying on the Internet. That is a legitimate point. But we recommended a solution dealing directly with preventing underage drinking, and it was not accepted. In my heart of hearts, I believe this is a special interest piece of legislation to protect the distributors. It doesn't do anything to protect young people from buying liquor. I think it is a sad day for our small wineries that are trying hard to survive in California.  
   In conclusion, I again thank Senator LEAHY for this time. It is a wonderful day. We finally got this Violence Against Women Act reauthorized. We are going to put an end, hopefully, to the sex trafficking. It is a good day for the Senate. 
   I only hope we will heed the words of Senator KENNEDY now and get on with education, get on with prescription drugs, and get on with the real Patients' Bill of Rights. Let's do our work. We can do our work. The American people want us to do it. The way the procedure is going now, we have no chance to offer amendments on education or health care. It is a shame. 
   I yield my time.

   Mrs. BOXER. I thank my friend for his comments on all fronts. Regarding his last comment, he is so right. When I first learned there was a move to attach this bill to the Violence Against Women Act, I was absolutely stunned. People have to watch what we do here. They understand, unfortunately, that the special interests still have a lot of influence. This is one case where they had too much influence. As my friend knows, we tried to work this so we could address the issue of juveniles buying liquor from the Internet, which everyone agrees is a terrible thing. 
   This hurts our small wineries--let's call it the way it is--in favor of the big distributors. 
   But on the Bonnie Campbell point, I particularly want to say to my friend how much I have appreciated his leadership on these judicial nominations. I say today we would not have had even the meager number that we have had without his leadership and his pointing out, over and over again, that women and minorities are getting second-class treatment here. 
   I ask my friend if he would recount, briefly, the study he had quoted many times, showing that women and minorities take about 3 months longer, on average, to get through; just his comments on how it always seems we are here fighting for women or a minority. It does not seem as if we have to fight that hard for the white male.

   Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I have strong misgivings about one part of the conference report we are about to consider. The provisions relating to interstate sales of alcoholic beverages, known as the 21st Amendment Enforcement Act, would dramatically reduce the ability of small wineries in my state to market their products across the country. 
   These wineries are small, independent, often family-owned, operations. They are the ``little guys'' in the winemaking industry. They need to sell their products directly to consumers around the country, and the Internet, especially, holds great promise for their future economic success. 
   Already, some of them have been hurt by state laws banning interstate sales of wine. The Matanzas Greek Winery in Sonoma County estimates that it is turning away around $8,000 a month in direct sales from consumers who had visited the winery and hoped to place orders from their homes in other states. 
   I am very concerned that the 21st Amendment Enforcement Act will make it even more difficult for these ``little guys'' to compete in the wine business. 
   I would like to ask the distinguished chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Senator HATCH, whether he would consider the impact of this legislation on my small wineries. Would the senator be willing, after the legislation has been on the books for a year or so, the review its impact on small wineries and to work with me to make such amendments as are necessary to take care of them?

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, on Friday the Senate passed H.R. 2389, the ``Secure Rural Schools and Community Self-Determination Act of 1999.'' I have paid close attention to the bill because it has significant implications for the State of California. H.R. 2389 is important to my State because it provides substantial and desperately-needed revenue to rural counties to be used for schools, roads, and other beneficial purposes. The bill also, however, creates unprecedented opportunities for  local stakeholders to play a role in decision-making on Federal lands. It is this latter feature of the bill that has the potential to have a negative impact on the health of our forests. 
   I am deeply disappointed at the version of the bill that was just passed. For months I worked closely with my Senate colleagues to negotiate a compromise proposal that included safeguards to help ensure that the bill would not lead to increased exploitation of our federal timber resources. This earlier version of the bill (S. 1608), which passed the Senate by unanimous consent, benefitted greatly from changes that clarified the appropriate role of local communities in Federal land management decisions and directed local projects funded under this bill towards environmentally beneficial activities rather than commodity production. Unfortunately, many improvements that I fought for in the Senate-passed bill have either been discarded or weakened in H.R. 2389. 
   I pledge to monitor closely implementation of this Act to see if it results in local projects that involve unsustainable logging, salvage, and other types of environmentally damaging activities. I hope this does not materialize, but if it does, I will seek to make improvements to the Act.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I thank my friend for setting the record straight and for doing such a good job because we do have to remember where we were when the Clinton-Gore administration took office. 
   In my State, there was suffering; there was no hope; people's dreams were set aside; the economy was in the tank; and there was double-digit unemployment. Today we are in the midst of the greatest economic recovery ever. It dates back to the vote AL GORE cast because he was the deciding vote on that budget. The Republicans predicted gloom and doom, deficits and debt, unemployment and the rest. Let's face it; they were wrong. We do not want to go back to those days of high deficits.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I appreciate the assistant Democratic leader yielding me time because I want to talk briefly about the Violence Against Women Act, and then I am going to make a unanimous consent request, of which I believe the other side has been made aware. 
   The Violence Against Women Act, a landmark law that was passed in 1994, has now expired. We have to reauthorize it. It is crucial. It has expired. 
   Is this an important and worthy act? Yes, it is. Both sides of the aisle agree. We have seen a 21-percent reduction in violence against women. We have seen shelters for battered women and their families built. They have gone up from 1,200 to about 2,000. We see doctors trained to recognize domestic abuse and police men and women trained to recognize domestic abuse. 
   So we are seeing, in the figures, a decrease in the violence. 
   But we cannot allow this law to die. The point is, it passed the House overwhelmingly. It is a clean bill. But there are political games going on over here. People want to attach all kinds of different things to the Violence Against Women Act. It can stand alone on its own two feet. Senator BIDEN wrote that act a long time ago. When I was in the House, he asked me to carry it. He has been joined by Senator HATCH. They have worked together now on this new reauthorization. 
   The last point I want to make before making my unanimous consent request is this: It may be called the Violence Against Women Act, but this act directly attacks the problem of children in these homes. We have to realize that children under the age of 12 live in approximately 4 out of 10 homes that experience domestic violence. 
   We look at Hollywood--and we are critical of what they are doing in terms of the R-rated films shown to kids--but the fact is, there is only one reliable predictor of future violence. If a male child sees one parent beat another parent, he is twice as likely to abuse his own wife as the son of nonviolent parents.

   Mrs. BOXER. We have a situation where we know if a child sees violence in the home, that child is very likely to repeat that violence. We have to protect these children by stopping the violence.

   Mrs. BOXER. I thank Senator REID, once more, for yielding me some time. 
   I understand the Republican side of the aisle wants to attach different pieces of legislation to the Violence Against Women Act, and that is what is slowing it down. I know they want to see this act go forward. But I have to say to them, there is an easy way to do it. 
   I am very disappointed we had this objection this morning. We had a beautiful prayer--a beautiful prayer--given by Senator LEAHY's brother-in-law. If you heard what he said, he prayed that we in the Senate could work to do good works--to do good works. I know that is what we all strive to do every single day we get up in the morning. But it seems to me that good work such as the Violence Against Women Act is easy to do. We do not have to use it as a train to which we attach different pieces of legislation. 
   I see Senator WELLSTONE on the floor. He has worked so hard in the area of the trafficking of women worldwide. Yes, we have no objection if we marry these two, if you will, pieces of legislation together because they make sense. One is talking about violence at home; one is talking about taking girls and putting them into sex trafficking. And it is a sin upon the world that this happens. We agreed to do this. It could have been done in a minute. We do not need to come on the floor and have a long period of time to discuss this. I am sure the Senator would agree; we could have a few comments.

   Mrs. BOXER. Yes. I would call on the Governor to intercede with our friends on the other side. He was asked about the Violence Against Women Act on the campaign trail. He was unaware of it. He said he had not heard of it, although Texas has received about $75 million, and they have built battered women shelters. Then when he studied it, he said he supported it, for which I am very grateful. But this is a golden moment for him. 
   Since we have passed the bill, I want to say to my friend 
   from Nevada, intimate-partner violence has decreased by 21 percent. Again, we have seen the number of battered women shelters increase by 60 percent. Before there were more animal shelters than there were for women and children. So we should act. I hope my friends will reconsider.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I have been a long time supporter of CARA--the Conservation and Reinvestment Act. The concept behind CARA was a visionary one--to take revenues generated from the extraction of offshore oil and gas resources and reinvest them permanently and automatically in our nation's invaluable wildlife, coastal, and public land resources. 
   The CARA proposal that was developed in a cooperative, bipartisan way by the Senate Energy Committee offered an opportunity for this Congress to make an historic contribution to conservation and to truly leave behind a legacy that we could be proud of and from which our children would benefit. 
   Instead, we are faced with a situation in which this overwhelmingly popular bill will never be considered on the Senate floor. 
   The House passed its version of CARA back in May by an overwhelming vote of 315 to 102; it was a vote that brought in supporters from across the political spectrum and around the country. More recently, a letter signed by 63 Senators was sent to the Senate leadership requesting that CARA be brought to the floor. 
   Yet the Republican leadership has refused to let this bill move forward. 
   I ask my colleagues, what does it take to get a vote around here? How can we say that we are doing the people's business, if a bill that is as broadly supported as CARA cannot even be voted upon? 
   We have now been presented with a package in the Interior appropriations bill that purports to fulfill the goals of CARA. I am tremendously disappointed to say that this package does very little to accomplish the goals of CARA. 
   CARA would have provided nearly $45 billion to important conservation programs over the next 15 years. The Interior proposal provides roughly $6 billion and only makes those funds available for the next 6 years. 
   But far more disappointing than the discrepancy in funding levels is the fact that the Interior proposal does little to guarantee that these funds will actually be made available each year for specific conservation purposes. 
   Instead, the Interior proposal will force important and beneficial programs like Urban Parks and Recreation to battle against other important programs like the Historic Preservation program for funding each year. 
   What made CARA remarkable was the fact that it would have provided the Urban Parks program, or state fish and wildlife agencies, or endangered species recovery efforts, with a predictable and reliable amount of funding. 
   This feature would have ensured that important conservation efforts would NOT be subject to the uncertainties of the annual appropriations cycle, but instead could be certain that funding would be available over the long term. And as a result, these conservation programs could have finally planned and implemented ambitious, long-term conservation efforts. The Interior appropriations proposal fails to provide this sort of certainty. 
   I will vote for the Interior appropriations bill. The bill funds many important programs that I care about and in making a nod to CARA it will provide some increased funding for things like the state's portion of the Land and Water Conservation Fund. 
   I am also pleased that the most egregious anti-environmental riders that appeared in earlier versions of this bill have been removed. 
   However, I hope nobody will interpret my vote for this bill as a sign of support for what I view as a hijacking of CARA. I remain deeply disturbed that a bill that had the potential to do as much good as CARA will never see the light of day.

    Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, firefighters from across the Nation who died in the line of duty will be remembered during the National Fallen Firefighters Memorial Weekend on October 7th and 8th at the National Fire Academy in Emmitsburg, Maryland. As in years past, the National Fallen Firefighters Foundation and the Federal Emergency Management Agency will sponsor the nation's tribute to these valiant public servants. 
   The 106 firefighters to be honored this year include seven Californians. On behalf of the people of my state, I want to remember each of them in turn: 
   Matthew Eric Black, 20, a volunteer with the Lakeport Fire Protection District, died on June 23, 1999 when he accidentally came in contact with a downed power line during operations at a grass fire. His older brother is also a firefighter. 
   Stephen Joseph Masto, 28, a career firefighter with the Santa Barbara Fire Department, died on August 28, 1999 of heatstroke while working as an EMT at a wildland fire. He received the Outstanding Cadet Award at Rio Hondo Fire Academy and received a service award as a volunteer at Upland Fire Department. 
   Tom Moore, 38, a career firefighter with the Manteca Fire Department, died on June 16, 1999 after suffering severe trauma in a training tower fall. He had served with the department for over 14 years and was a well-known fire service instructor specializing in heavy/confined space rescue and hazardous materials. 
   Karen J. Savage, 44, a volunteer firefighter/EMT with Hawkins Bar Volunteer Fire Department in Burnt Ranch, died on October 16, 1999 from injuries sustained in a vehicle accident at the scene of a wildland fire. 
   Martin Michael Stiles, 40, a California Department of Corrections inmate assigned to the Los Angeles County Fire Department Strike Team, died on July 18, 1999 of injuries from a fall while working at a wildland fire in Ventura County, California. A San Diego native, he was dedicated to wildland firefighting and loved the outdoors. 
   Tracy Dolan Toomey, 52, a 27-year veteran firefighter with the Oakland Fire Department, died on January 10, 1999 in the collapse of a burning building. A Vietnam veteran, he was an avid welder and a member of the California Artistic Blacksmith's Association. 
   Edward E. Luttig, 54, a member of the Sacramento Fire Department, died on September 10, 1990 from injuries sustained 23 years earlier while searching for survivors in an apartment fire. Sacramento firefighters donated their time and money to support Mr. Luttig and his family during those 23 years. His name is being added to the Memorial at the request of his friends and former colleagues. 
   These fallen heroes paid the ultimate price for their devotion to public service and safety. They are an inspiration to us all, as are the men and women who continue to protect Americans from fire and other emergencies.

   Mrs. BOXER. I am pleased to come to the floor today to try to shed a little light, if not a little heat, on an issue that was raised by the Senator from Alaska, Mr. MURKOWSKI, when he asked unanimous consent that we take up H.R. 2884, but substitute his amendment to that bill, and pass it. The unanimous consent request was made by the majority leader on behalf of Senator MURKOWSKI. He came to the floor with a very eloquent discussion of why he believed it was important. 
   I am one of the Senators--there is more than one--who objects to this bill. I think it is very important to state clearly on the record why. First, H.R. 2884 as it came over from the House does exactly the right thing. It reauthorizes the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, and it sets up a home heating oil reserve. That is very important for the people of this country, particularly the people in the Northeast. We could pass that in 1 minute flat by unanimous consent request. No one has any problem. 
   What is the problem, my friends? Senator MURKOWSKI has essentially added to that bill a whole new body of law concerning royalty payments by the oil companies, which they owe the taxpayers of the United States of America. It deals with the ability of the oil companies to pay, not in cash--which is essentially the way they pay now--but in kind. It would encourage, by many of the provisions in it, the payment of these royalty payments in kind. In other words, Uncle Sam would become the proud owner of natural gas, Uncle Sam would become the proud owner of oil. And, by the way, Uncle Sam would then have to in some cases market that product. 
   I don't think we are good at becoming a new Price Club. I really don't. My friend from Alaska says: But the Government wants to do it, they want to do it. They came to us; they asked us; they want to do it. Show me one bureaucrat in Government who doesn't want more power, more authority, more jobs, and I will show you a rare bureaucrat. 
   The royalty payments that come into this Federal Government go to the Land and Water Conservation Fund. Let me be clear what a royalty payment is. When you find oil on Federal  land offshore and onshore, you must pay a percentage of that to the taxpayers. It is like rent. You are using the taxpayers' land, the offshore areas, and you have to pay a certain amount of rent based on the value of the oil or gas you recover. 
   This is an area that has been fraught with complication and difficulty. I frankly have found myself on the side of the consumers who have said they have been shortchanged by the oil companies. 
   I believe that those of us who fought for 3 long years for a fair royalty payment did the right thing. Why do I say that? Because under the old system there have been lawsuits and almost in every case--I do not even know of any case where we did not prevail on behalf of the taxpayers. 
   I hear today that the Federal Government has collected, because there have been some recent settlements, almost a half a billion dollars of payment from the oil companies. Do you know why? Because they have been cheating the taxpayers out of the royalty payments that they were supposed to make based on the fair market value. One of the ways they have cheated the taxpayers is to undervalue the oil. If you are in beginners math, you know a percentage of a smaller number will yield yet a smaller number. So they did not do the proper math. They didn't show what the oil was worth. They undervalued the oil and then they took a percentage of the undervalued oil and gave it to the taxpayers and we were shorted a half billion dollars--maybe more. That is just the recent settlement. 
   So after 3 years of fighting--and, believe me, I had to stand on my feet and fight long and hard, and so did a lot of my colleagues, and I thank them--we were able to make sure that a fair way of determining the fair market value of that oil was put in place. 
   In the middle of all this comes the payment-in-kind program. In other words, instead of paying cash, we say to the oil and gas companies we are going to try an experiment. We are going to try a pilot program. We are going to allow you to pay your royalties in kind. That is like if you owed the Government your income taxes and said: Uncle Sam, I'm short. Will you take the payment in, say, my mother's antique chest? That's worth about $1,000 and that's what I owe. 
   By the way, we do this with no other commodity. We have checked the records. We say to them something we say to no one else who owes the Federal Government: You can pay your dues, your royalty payments, in kind. 
   I have a lot of problems with that. A lot of my colleagues think it is just great. But, again, it is my experience that we do not do too well in the business world in government. We are better off doing our work here, getting that straight. Now we are going to expand. It is going to be Uncle Sam's Oil Company; Uncle Sam's Gas Company: Drive in and fill her up. 
   Of course I am exaggerating; it will not be exactly that. What we will do is market the product and sell it and probably pay the oil companies to do all that marketing for us so they will get back plenty of money. We will wind up paying them to market their product. This is a very confusing matter. 
   So what happens? Without one hearing in the Energy Committee, we have before us a substitute bill that I have objected to and others have objected to that would essentially say, regardless of all the work, Senator BOXER, that you and many of your colleagues went through to get a fair royalty payment, we are going to come around in the backdoor when nobody is looking and we are going to put in a new way to figure out how to pay royalties. We are going to expand this payment-in-kind program even before we have held one hearing on whether it even works. The pilot programs are going to be completed very soon, in about 3 or 4 months, at least one of them. Another one will be done next year. What is the rush to pass a 5-year authorization on royalty payments in kind? What 
   is the rush? Is that the way to govern? Is that the way to legislate? 
   No other industry in America gets this chance. I say, if you read the substitute offered by my good friend, Senator MURKOWSKI, you are going to find a few things in there that are going to raise your eyebrows. 
   In the very first draft, they set up another definition of ``fair market value.'' I protested. They dropped it. Now it just says the royalty in kind has to be paid in a fair market value, but it doesn't define it. It doesn't do what the rule does for the in-cash payments. So now you have two conflicting ways, one way that is clearly defined if you pay in cash and one way that is open to interpretation, fair market value--whatever that means--for the payment in kind. 
   Do you know what I see? Again, you don't have to be an expert in economics. I was an economics major, but that was so many years ago I don't pretend to be an expert. But if I say to you, ``fair market value,'' you are going to say, ``I think that is a willing buyer and a willing seller.'' 
   If I ask Sarah here, who has worked so hard on this, she is going to say: I think that is a little risky because the seller might be a subsidiary of the buyer. That is not arm's length. It has to be an arm's length agreement. 
   Somebody else might say: Forget that. Let's just go to the published newspaper in terms of what the oil is selling for on that date. 
   Frankly, that is the one I like. That is the one we use in the definition when you pay royalty in cash. 
   The first problem is you are setting up a whole conflict here. I will tell you, those guys with those sharp pencils who are in the oil company, they are going to go for payment in kind because there is not any real definition. They are going to give us less oil and less value than we would get. 
   So then you say to my friend, Senator MURKOWSKI, let's at least put in this legislation a statement that says: Under no circumstances should we get less than we would get if it was payment in cash because, again, this money goes to the Land and Water Conservation Fund, which is our conservation fund. We buy lands with it. We fix up parks with it. And the State share--because States get a share of the royalty payment--that goes to the California classrooms. 
   Are they going to send oil to the California classrooms? Are they going to send natural gas? 
   So we said: Look, we have to work out these problems with the States. In any case, we can't have less of a payment than we would have if you paid in cash. So we said: Will you put that in the language? ``Under no case will we get less than we would get if we got payment in cash.'' 
   Oh, no, they use the word ``benefits,'' not revenues. The benefits have to be equal or greater. 
   I said: Wait a minute. What does that mean? 
   Well, the Secretary will decide if there is a benefit. 
   Let me tell you I have seen Secretaries of the Interior come and go. I saw one who said: Don't worry about the ozone layer leaving us. Don't worry about a hole in the ozone layer; just wear a hat and put on sunscreen. Don't worry about cancer. That was one Secretary of the Interior. 
   So in this 5-year authorization that never had a hearing, before the pilot programs are through, we are leaving all this up to the Secretary of the Interior, whoever he or she may be. 
   We have seen Secretaries of the Interior who fought on behalf of the environment. We have seen Secretaries of the Interior who fought on behalf of big oil. I am not here to give authority to the Secretary of the Interior to decide when it is in the benefit of the United States to take less than what you would get if you received a payment in cash. 
   I understand from Senator MURKOWSKI's staff that he feels strongly about this and he is not going to back off. He is going to file a cloture motion and all the rest of it. That is fine. We will stay here past the election because I am going to stand on my feet because I don't think the taxpayers ought to be ripped off again. They have been ripped off for years. We finally resolved the situation, and we are now back to square one. 
   Again, I reiterate, the underlying bill that came over from the House is a beautiful bill. 
   It deals with two things which we need to do: We need to fill up the Strategic Petroleum Reserve and reauthorize it, and we need a home heating oil reserve. I will say we are told by the administration that they actually can act on this without this legislation, but it certainly would be better to have it.  
   I say to my friend, Senator MURKOWSKI--and I will not do it now in deference to the fact he is not here--I would like to move the underlying H.R. 2884 as it came over here and pass it 5 minutes a side. We can do it if we did not add all this royalty in-kind section to it. 
   The last point I wish to make on this subject is, in the Interior bill that is now before the Senate, we have already taken care of this problem. The Minerals Management Service came to us and said: We need a little help with the pilot program because we really want to make sure we are giving payment in kind every chance. The Minerals Management Service wants to go into the oil business. That is great. They want to be the Price Club of the United States of America. So they want help. OK. 
   We took care of them in this Interior bill. We gave them what they wanted. We allowed them to calculate this royalty in a way that they can subtract the cost of transportation, even subtract the cost of marketing oil. The oil companies get a good deal. Senator MURKOWSKI wants a 5-year authorization without one hearing. He wanted to pass it by unanimous consent, no amendments, nothing. 
   I may sound upset, and it is true, I am upset because I think the consumers get a raw deal. Every time we have a little problem with an energy supply, what do we hear around this place? Drill in ANWR; let the oil companies pay lower royalties, and meanwhile the oil companies are earning the biggest profits they have ever earned, causing Senator PAT LEAHY of Vermont to come down here and propose a windfall profits tax on the oil companies. But it is not good enough for them to earn $1 billion and $2 billion in a quarter--in a quarter--to have 100-percent profits and 200-percent profits and 300-percent profits. They have to pay us less in royalties. If you knew what this amount was--it is so minuscule compared to their profits--it would shock you. 
   It is not minuscule to the child who sits in a California classroom. It is not minuscule to the Land and Water Conservation Fund or the Historic Preservation Fund, but yet here we are when we should be doing energy conservation, when we should be having a long-term energy plan, the first thing we do, because the Senator from Alaska attaches it to an important bill, is give a break to the oil companies again with these royalties in kind. 
   Boy, I tell you. Maybe the Senator from Florida will be interested to know this. There is not any other business in America that pays in kind. It would be interesting if you had to pay your IRS bill and you said: I have a few extra things around the house I am going to send in. 
   It is hard to believe we would have an authorization to really expand the payment-in-kind program without one hearing. I am stunned. It is taken care of in the Interior bill. We gave them a narrow bill. We did not mess with the definition of how you are supposed to pay, what you are supposed to pay. We did what the Interior Department wanted. 
   If this is going to a cloture vote, I tell my friends, so be it. I have other friends on this side of the aisle who agree 
   very strongly, and we are going to stand on our feet and it is not going to be pleasant, it is not going to be happy, but we are going to have to do it, and let us shine the light of truth on the whole oil royalty question. 
   They are going to get up and say: Oh, it's the mom and pop little guys. Fine, let's do this for the mom and pop little guys. I will talk to you about that. But do not give the biggest companies--these are multinational corporations making excess profits--another break, and suddenly Uncle Sam goes into the oil business and the gas business. 
   This whole issue of an energy policy is important. It came up in the debates, and what we heard from the two candidates was very different. George W. Bush had one energy policy and one energy policy alone, and that is more development at home. By the way, we have had a lot more oil development here--and I am going to put that information in the RECORD--since Clinton-Gore came in. But they want to go to a wildlife refuge and drill in a wildlife refuge. 
   The No. 1 goal of environmentalists in this country is to protect that wildlife refuge. They want to drill in it, and you say: Senator BOXER, how much oil is in there? The estimate is about 6 months of oil. Period. End of quote. Forever. Some say if you got every drop out of it, it could go for 2 years, but that is the outside; most people think it is 6 months. 
   To me that is a contradiction in terms. We have to figure out a better way. I will give you a better way. We can save a million barrels of oil a day--a million barrels of oil a day--if we just say the SUVs should get the same mileage as a car. A million barrels of oil a day, and yet when that comes up, people duck for cover around here. 
   How have the President and the Vice President tried to have an energy policy? First of all, since they came in, oil and gas production on onshore Federal lands has increased 60 percent, and offshore oil production is up 65 percent since they came in, while they are protecting the most vulnerable offshore tracts, off California, off Florida, and other pristine places. We have seen a huge increase there. 
   They worked to bring an additional 3.5 million more barrels per day into the world oil market. They have taken measures to swap 30 million barrels of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, and this will help the Northeast not have a repeat of last year's home heating oil shortage. We know it was Vice President GORE who pushed for this, frankly, along with a couple of Republicans and Democrats in the Congress, and it seems to be working. We hope it will. 
   They supported alternatives to oil and gas, such as ethanol, a renewable resource made from feedstock such as corn, and increasing ethanol use would help reduce dependence on foreign oil. It would help our farmers by boosting corn prices, and since ethanol can be made from waste, such as rice straw, waste straw, trimmings and trash, the greater use of ethanol can turn an environmental problem into an environmental benefit. In other words, it would take trash and turn it into energy. That is a plus. 
   The other half of the administration's energy policy is to improve energy efficiency. I think it is very important to look at the record here. Having told you that if we go to the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, we will only get 6-month's worth of oil, what is the answer? Let's see what the facts show. 
   The administration supported a tax credit to promote alternative sources of energy--solar, biomass, wind, and other sources. The Republican Congress said no. 
   The administration recommended tax credits for electric fuel cell and qualified hybrid vehicles. It was a 5-year package of tax credits. The Republican Congress said no. 
   The administration advocated a tax credit for efficient homes and buildings. The Republican Congress said no. 
   The administration recommended tax incentives for domestic oil and gas industries. The Republican Congress said no. 
   The administration requested $1.7 billion for Federal research and development efforts to promote energy efficiency in buildings, industry, and transportation, and expanded use of renewable energy and distributed power generation systems. And the Republican Congress partially funded that program. 
   The administration requested $1.5 billion for investments in energy R&D for oil, gas, coal, efficiency, renewables, and nuclear energy. What was the answer of the Republican Congress? No. And they introduced legislation to abolish the Department of Energy. That is a great answer. 
   George Bush is saying we have no energy policy, and most of his party said: Do away with the Department of Energy. That was at a time when oil prices were low. They said: We don't need it. That is some policy. 
   It goes on. 
   The administration requested $851 million for energy conservation for the Department of Energy. The request was cut by $35 million. 
   They requested money to continue the Partnership for a New Generation of Vehicles. That was cut in half by the Republican Congress. 
   They requested $225 million for building technology assistance funding. That was cut. 
   They asked for $85 million to create a new Clean Air Partnership Fund to  help States and localities reduce pollution and become more energy efficient. The Republican Congress said no. 
   It goes on. 
   The administration recommended studying increases in the fuel economy of automobiles. We know that 50 percent of the cause of our energy dependence is automobiles. What did this Republican Congress do? It prohibited the administration from even studying the increases in fuel economy standards in a rider to the appropriations bill. 
   So now we have the Republican standard bearer standing up in a debate saying: Where is your energy policy? There were 20 initiatives. I have only mentioned part of those. And they said no to the vast majority of them, and they said, OK, we will give you a little bit for a few. 
   It seems, to me, disingenuous--and that is the nicest way I can say it--to be critical of Vice President GORE, saying he has no energy policy, when every single proposal, except maybe a couple, was turned down with a vengeance. 
   Then, when we have a problem, our friends on the other side come down and say: You see the other side, they care about the environment too much. They will not drill in a wildlife refuge. 
   I say, thank you for mentioning that because if there is anything I want to accomplish here in the short time that any of us has in the scheme of things, it is to protect this magnificent area. 
   I wish we could join hands across party lines on energy. I say to the Presiding Officer, we have worked together in the Committee on Public Works. We have worked, for example, on ways to replace MTBE in a good way. We have worked on ways to make sure that we do not rob the States of their transit funds. I think we can do this. I do not think it is fair, however, for the candidate of the Republican Party to accuse the Vice President, who has proposed numerous ways, both on the production side and on the demand side, to resolve the problem, and say, there is no energy policy, when time after time after 
   time it has been thwarted in this very body and in the House. 
   I remember when I first went into politics--a very long time ago--we had an energy crisis. At that time, we realized our automobiles were simply gas guzzlers. I remember. They used to get 10 miles to the gallon, 12 miles to the gallon. I am definitely showing my age when I admit that. I remember that. And now we are doing better, but we can do better still. 
   I say to you that rather than go into a pristine and beautiful wildlife refuge--which we really owe to our children and our grandchildren and their kids; we owe them the preservation of that area--rather than do that, we could take a few steps here that can really make us so much more energy efficient, that we will be proud to say to our children and our grandchildren that we took a few steps. We did not inconvenience anybody. 
   Our refrigerators do a little bit better on energy use, our dishwashers, and our cars. I say to my own kids, who are at that age when they love those cars--I have a prejudice against those big SUVs because it is hard for me to climb into them. The bottom line is, they are very nice, but we can do better for our Nation and not be dependent on OPEC. 
   Fifty percent of our problem has to do with transportation. So we do not have to say: Oh, my gosh, we have a problem. Drill in a wildlife preserve. Oh, my gosh, we have a problem. Destroy the coast of California; ruin the tourism industry; ruin the fishing industry; risk oil spills. We do not have to go there. 
   We were sent here to find better ways of solving problems. Having an energy policy is important, but it takes two to tango. The Congress cannot do without the President, and the President cannot do without the Congress. The President proposes and Congress disposes. Unfortunately, they disposed of almost every single idea this administration had. We are suffering the consequences. So the issue is brought up at a Presidential debate, when people are pointing at each other, and we right here had a chance to do much better.

    Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I come before you today to pay tribute to a staunch patient advocate whose dedication and commitment to biomedical research has changed the lives of all around her. 
   Ellen Glesby Cohen was the President and Founder of the Lymphoma Research Foundation of America (LRFA). Ellen founded this organization almost ten years ago after she was diagnosed with a slow growing form of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). 
   Ellen, being the courageous person she was, decided to turn her experience into something positive by establishing the Lymphoma Research Foundation that is the nation's first and foremost organization dedicated to promoting and funding lymphoma-specific research. 
   Ms. Cohen's efforts on behalf of lymphoma-specific research has led to the Lymphoma Research Foundation awarding close to $3 million to support 92 lymphoma research projects at top universities and cancer centers throughout the nation. 
   The foundation Ms. Cohen founded has been active not only in funding research, but has helped educate the public about the high incidence rates of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma by spearheading such initiatives as the National Lymphoma Awareness Week during the second seek of October and an annual Lymphoma Advocacy Day on Capitol Hill. 
   I have been particularly impressed by Ms. Cohen's passion on behalf of lymphoma patients and, consequently, have supported increasing the funding for lymphoma research at the National Institutes of Health and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 
   Ellen is survived by her husband Dr. Mitchell Cohen and her two children Hailey and Josh. While the last decade of Ellen Cohen's life was dedicated to lymphoma research, Ellen's accomplishments as a mother and a wife will forever be remembered even after the day comes that non-Hodgkin's lymphoma has been eliminated. 
   Although Ellen's work has already benefitted thousands across the country diagnosed with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and other cancers, I know that she would like us all to continue her fight against this devastating disease by supporting such worthy organizations like the Lymphoma Research Foundation of America. 
   Despite the fact that Ellen is not here physically, her spirit will continue to live on through her family and friends. Thank you Ellen for what you gave to persons everywhere. You will truly be missed.

   Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, along with many of my colleagues, I voted in support of an amendment to the energy and water appropriations bill when it moved through the Senate to strike an anti-environment rider from that bill. Unfortunately, that amendment failed and the rider remains in the conference report we consider today. 
   For that reason, I must vote against this legislation. I understand that the President has indicated that he will veto this legislation because of this antienvironment provision. 
   The antienvironment rider included in this bill stops changes in the management of the Missouri River called for by existing law. Those changes would ensure that the river is managed not only for navigation, but also for  the benefit of the fish and wildlife that depend on the river for survival. 
   It is critical that those changes go into effect promptly because without them several endangered species may become extinct. 
   The Missouri River management changes that this antienvironment rider blocks are called for by a 600-page Fish and Wildlife Service study. The study is itself based upon hundreds of published peer-reviewed studies, and would modify the 40-year-old Corps of Engineers policy of managing the flows of the Missouri River primarily to benefit a $7 million downstream barge industry. 
   That old Corps policy is largely responsible for the endangerment of three species--the piping plover, the least interior tern, and the pallid sturgeon--that depend upon the river for survival. Two other fish species are also headed toward extinction. 
   It is very unfortunate that this provision was included in a bill that otherwise has much to commend it. 
   I appreciate the conferees' hard work in crafting a bill that funds several important California priorities. The Hamilton Wetlands Project funded in this bill would restore approximately 1,000 acres to wetlands and wildlife habitat at Hamilton Army Airfield. The American River Common Elements funded in this bill would result in 24 miles of levee improvements along the American River and 12 miles of improvements along the Sacramento River levees, flood gauges upstream of Folsom Dam, and improvements to the flood warning system along the lower American River. Finally, the Solana Beach-Encinitas Shoreline Feasibility Study funded in this bill would assist both cities in their efforts to battle beach erosion, and would provide needed data for the restoration of these beaches. Projects such as these are extremely important to California. 
   Because of these and the other benefits of this bill for California, I find it unfortunate that I must vote against this legislation. I do so, however, because a vote for this bill is a vote to support an antienvironment rider that may well lead to the irreversible damage of causing the extinction of several endangered species. 
   I expect that this legislation will be taken up by the Senate without this rider in the next few weeks, and that we will move forward with important energy and water projects without doing irreversible damage to our environment.

   Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Senator from West Virginia, who is, I have to say, the most respected Senator in this Chamber. When he speaks, I do think that both sides listen. I believe that his remarks today are not partisan at all. I think that he has been critical of both sides and he has been critical of the administration. 
   I want to pick up on some of Senator BYRD's remarks. I had the honor of serving on the Appropriations Committee for a period of time. Senator FEINSTEIN now holds that seat, and who knows, maybe some day I will be able to reclaim it. California is such a large State that I think there is a real understanding on my side of the aisle that one of us should be sitting on that committee. 
   In that situation you have a much greater chance to speak for your State, and to talk about the priorities of your State. 
   Right now my dear friend, Senator FEINSTEIN, is recuperating from a terrible fall and a terrible injury to her leg. I want to say to Senator FEINSTEIN--if you are watching, because I know you are in the hospital--we are thinking of you and we wish you well. I will do everything I can to speak for both of us when it comes to the issues that face our State. 
   But, in particular because of her injury, I think at the moment I am on that list. The Senator could add us on that list of the 23 ``have nots,'' although we are praying that Senator FEINSTEIN will be back next week in time to be there. But even if she is back, the fact is, when that private session is called to look at this big omnibus bill--the Senator from West Virginia has described it--very few will be in that room. I compliment the administration for insisting that the Democratic leadership be in that room. 
   I had the honor to serve in the House for 10 years of my life. It was a great experience for me. I know many others, including the Senator from West Virginia, had that privilege. But I ran for the Senate in a very risky political move--no one thought I would ever make it here--because I wanted the chance to do more. I wanted the chance to operate under the Senate rules and to offer any amendments that I wanted to at any time. 
   Now I find with this particular leadership that I am precluded from doing that. I am precluded from fighting for my State. When I hear that bills were going straight to the conference and bypassing the Senate and the ability of the Senator from Iowa to offer an amendment--even though he serves on that committee, there is still time even when you are on the committee. You wait until you get to the floor to offer the amendment. We all know that is the way it goes because sometimes you can't win in the committee but you have a chance to make your case on the floor with unlimited debate and an opportunity to show your charts and make your point. 
   I find myself here in a circumstance where I, in behalf of the people of California, basically have no say on these bills. 
   As Senator BYRD rightly points out, I think anyone in this Senate Chamber who says they know what is in a huge omnibus package with 3,000 pages, not to mention report language and colloquy, is simply dreaming because we know there is just so much we are capable of. When you do one appropriations bill at a time, you can concentrate on that and read that bill. You can be briefed on that bill. If you want to offer an amendment, you can do so. You can make your case for your State. 
   There is one issue on which the Senator from West Virginia and I do not agree. I respect his view so much. But I come on a different side. I think it is so important that we should be allowed to raise other important issues that we believe this Senate ought to vote on, even if it voted on it before. I say to my friend that some of these issues are so important. Now that we are in the middle of a Presidential election, they are being raised by both Governor Bush and Vice President GORE, and we ought to have another chance to vote on them.

   Mrs. BOXER. I agree with my friend. I sit on some authorizing committees, such as the Environment and Public Works Committee. There are so many good bills that we could bring forward, but the leadership does not want to do that. Frankly, I think it is because they would rather not run this place like the Senate. They want to run it like the House with strict controls where the Rules Committee decides what can happen. 
   Frankly, I have to think that there are some amendments on which they don't want to vote. I think we are then forced in the circumstance that my friend from West Virginia--my hero, if I might say, in this Senate--believes is inappropriate. But we are in a circumstance where we are committed, for example, to vote on a prescription drug benefit for Medicare. We are so committed to making sure that class sizes could be reduced by putting 100,000 new teachers in, and we don't get the education authorizing bill. We only get the appropriations bill. 
   It forces us--I agree with my friend--to be in the situation that is not good for the Senate. As my friend said, it is the ``Dark Ages of the Senate.'' Those are powerful words. This is a man who thinks about that. When he says we are in the ``Dark Ages,'' I think we have to listen. We are in the Dark Ages because we don't want to debate authorizing bills. We are forced to try to offer amendments on appropriations bills, which delays the situation, which  makes leadership say they are not going to bring the bill forward, and which makes them send them straight to conference to avoid the chance for amendments. The vicious circle continues. 
   I think I am not being a Senator. We never know how long we are going to be in this Chamber. In many ways, it is up to our electorate. In many ways, it is up to God to give us good health to be here and do this. It is up to our families to see how long they can take it. So we want to have a chance to legislate.

The frustration level of Senators, as my friend Senator HARKIN pointed out in his very to-the-point-question, is that we have no other option but to turn to these priorities that our people are asking Members to take care of, and try to offer these amendments. Then we have a majority that doesn't want them. 
   I yield to my friend.

   Mrs. BOXER. I ask my friend to stay on his feet because I want to continue this discussion. 
   When I was a child, I learned how a bill becomes a law. We always had that book in school, how a bill becomes a law. A bill starts out; someone authors it on one side, the Senate; someone authors it in the House. If it is a money bill, it has to go through the House first. And then each House, the House and the Senate, will act on the bill. If there are differences, it will go to conference. Those differences are worked out. If they are worked out--either body will vote on them--it goes to the President; he says yea or nay. If he issues a veto, two-thirds to override; if he signs it, it is a law. We learned this. 
   I say to my friend, it almost seems to me that what is happening is unconstitutional. I do not have a law degree. But we don't see these bills coming through the Senate for Senators to comment on. Sometimes we get a bill through here and it is not controversial. We will agree to a 2-, 3-, 5-minute time agreement. But at least we have a chance to look at it. That is our job. If  we don't look at it and it does some harm to our people, that is our fault. 
   But if bills never come here and if they are sent directly into a conference committee and bypass the Senate, this says something is very wrong, that we are not doing what we are supposed to do according to the Constitution. I honestly wonder whether there couldn't be some kind of lawsuit by some citizen out there who looks at this and says: The way the Senate is operating, I have no voice in this because my Senator is bypassed. As Senator BYRD shows in his chart, 23 States are not on appropriations. They don't even have a chance to utter a word in the committee. 
   I was wondering, not being a lawyer, as the Senator is a lawyer, whether there isn't some kind of lawsuit waiting to happen. This isn't the way a bill is to become a law. 
   I think this could be considered taxation without representation. For some of these cases, some colleagues could say to their people: I didn't know; I didn't have a chance; I could only vote no or aye at the end; I voted aye because there were so many good things in the omnibus bill; but there were 23 bad things, but I had to keep the Government going. 
   I think we are treading on some dangerous ground. 
   I am happy to yield if my friend has a comment.

   Mrs. BOXER. Yes. When I go home to meet my constituency, they, as taxpayers, will say to me: Senator, what did you think about page 1030 in that omnibus bill? Did you actually get a chance to vote on it? I will say: In the big sense, I guess you could say I had to vote. It was all in one package. But I had no choice. I wanted to keep the Government going. 
   When I raised that issue, it was not for the technical response, but I am just suggesting to my friend that it is in many ways taxation without representation. In any event, if it does not rise to that level, it is close to that level. 
   I wonder if my friend from Iowa has a comment, or my friend from West Virginia.

   Mrs. BOXER. I agree with my friend. It is pretty distressing to see this happen to the Senate. 
   Senator BYRD said the other day that many of us in this Chamber don't know how the Senate is supposed to work because when we got here, those bricks had started to be pulled out of that foundation. I long for the days when I can tell my grandchildren or great grandchildren that I had a chance to serve in the greatest deliberative body of the land, and that even on a matter that perhaps only one or two Senators cared about, we had the unfettered right to express ourselves on behalf of the people we represent. 
   As I stand here, I represent, with Senator FEINSTEIN, almost 34 million people. Imagine that, 34 million people. They have so many concerns, whether it is the cost of prescription drugs, that I know my friend from Iowa just made a brilliant speech on yesterday--and I hope he will continue that today--whether it is just the normal appropriations process under which they are able to meet their needs, the highways, the public buildings, all the things they need to keep going; making sure we have the water and the power to keep this incredible State going. We would be the eighth largest nation in the world. We count on the Senate to be able to address our needs. 
   I am so grateful to the Senator from West Virginia for making this point because I think the people need to pay attention. As my friend from Iowa has said, it may sound as if it is about rules and things that do not impact them. But it impacts them mightily because when I am muzzled by virtue of the fact we don't get a chance to offer amendments--not that my voice is going to always carry the day, but at least their voice will be heard.

   Mrs. BOXER. In this remaining 5 minutes, I wanted to ask my friend from Iowa if he will stay on the floor because Senator KENNEDY, who is our leader on education issues, as we know, in terms of his position on ESEA, said it looks as though if we don't reauthorize the Elementary and Secondary Education Act when the funding expires, which is this year--which is this year--it will be the first time since the 1960s, since 1965, that this bill will not have been reauthorized. 
   What I want to ask my friend--I know he is going to take his time to talk about prescription drugs, and I am going to stay here for that. It seems to me, with both Presidential candidates out there talking about education, and with huge differences in the two positions; where you have George Bush supporting a voucher system to pull money out of the public schools into the private schools, and you have AL GORE saying he wants to do twice as much for education; in terms of budget authority, where you have Vice President GORE supporting putting 100,000 new teachers in the classroom and George Bush opposing it; 
   where you have our Vice President supporting school construction, and these are all initiatives that emanated from this side of the aisle with opposition on the other side. A fair debate. Whether or not we want to continue in the tradition of President Eisenhower, a Republican President who said, yes, the Federal Government should step in when there is a void, and that is why he signed the National Defense Education Act saying way back in the fifties--the happy days when I was growing up--that if you do not have an educated workforce, you can have the most powerful military in the world and it will not matter. AL GORE wants to follow in that tradition, but we have the opposition saying the Federal Government should not have anything to do with it, block grant it, and who knows what will happen. 
   Does my friend agree with me--I know he agrees with me; I would like him to talk about this--why is it so crucial we bring this education bill to the floor--and do it soon--and we allow this Senate to work its will on the issues that all of America cares about, whatever side one is on. Does he not agree this is a stunning departure from tradition and history since 1965? We sit here and there is nobody on the other side. We have the time to talk when we could be acting on the ESEA.

   Mrs. BOXER. I will be brief. My friend makes such an important point. In this fast moving, global economy we are in, everyone admits education is the key. If all we can do is fund old programs--by the way, they are good; we are not going to walk away from them--but if we cannot address the new challenges--and my friend mentions specifically the digital divide. Senator MIKULSKI and I have been working on a very good bill. We let thousands and thousands of foreign workers in here when we still have a 4-percent unemployment rate--by the way, the best in generations, but we do have people who need jobs--we do not have 
   a shortage of workers, as Senator MIKULSKI says, we have a shortage of skills. 
   My friend is so right to point out that when we do not authorize bills and we cannot look at the new solutions and the new challenges, we might as well be living in the last century. 
   I thank my friend for yielding me additional time. I look forward to his presentation on Medicare. I will sit here and listen to his wisdom on that and maybe he can answer a question or two as he goes about his presentation. I thank my friend.

Out of the 34 million senior citizens in this country who are covered under Medicare--not to mention the 5 million disabled; let's throw that out for a moment because they would qualify for the Gore plan; let's just focus on the 34 million--how many seniors are you saying, if everything went right in their States and they were able to get the enabling legislation--they went to the welfare office, they got the stamp of approval--if it all went right, how many seniors are you estimating would be covered under the Bush plan?

   Mrs. BOXER. Under the first 4 years of the Bush plan, out of the 34 million seniors, this new benefit would go to less than 700,000 people. And those people have to go through the welfare offices.

<DOCNO>106-boxer-ca-27-20000928</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. BOXER. I thank my friends, and I thank the Senator from Louisiana for her patience. This is an important point that she made to me yesterday and to a number of my colleagues. 
   I think the chart that is behind the Senator from Iowa tells a story all America has to see. This tax cut is so enormous, with such enormous tax breaks for those at the top--for example, those over $350,000 will get back $50,000 a year compared to those at $30,000 who will get back a few hundred dollars--that it is impossible for Governor Bush to do anything real for the American people that the American people want. 
   I asked myself, why would it be that his prescription drug policy would only cover 5 percent of the seniors who need it. The easy answer: Even if he wanted to do more--and let's say he does; I will give him that break--he can't do more, because when you look at what he wants to do for the military and what he says he wants to do for education, and it goes on, it does not add up. So what happens to Governor Bush is that he has to take tiny little baby steps for things he thinks are important because he doesn't have the resources because he is committed to this enormous tax break, instead of doing what AL GORE has done, which is to say: Yes, we will give tax breaks, but we will give them to the middle class. We will do it for people who need to send their kids to college by helping them with their tuition. We will do it for people who need health care by making that deductible. We will do it for the people who are working hard every day, struggling and fighting to make ends meet. 
   The last point I will make to my friend is a comment by the president of the Health Insurance Association of America, who said:  
   Private drug-insurance policies are doomed from the start.  
   That is the Bush plan.  
   The idea sounds good but it cannot succeed in the real world. I don't know of an insurance company that would offer a drug-only policy like that or even consider it.  
   This isn't TOM HARKIN talking or HARRY REID talking or MARY LANDRIEU or BARBARA BOXER or ZELL MILLER. This is the head of the Insurance Association of America. 
   I say to my friend, in closing the extra time he has, the chart behind him tells the story, and this quote tells the story. It is truly, unfortunately, a sham prescription drug plan.

   Mrs. BOXER. It is just a very brief question. I thank my friend. I think that is the clearest explanation I have ever heard of the Bush plan. It is very clear. 
   Something that I read yesterday reminded me of the days when Newt Gingrich was in control, and as the Senator well remembers, in 1995 it led to a Government shutdown. They wanted to cut $207 billion out of Medicare over 10 years. And we said that is the end of Medicare. It turns out that Governor Bush in those years said that Gingrich and the Republicans were courageous to do this, and he lauded it. I think if you take that statement and mesh it with what the Senator from Iowa just taught us about his plan, it all adds up now. It is the end of Medicare.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, yesterday, the Senator from Alaska, Senator MURKOWSKI, made a reference to me which I would like to respond to and set the RECORD straight. 
   The Senator from Alaska said that H.R. 2884, which would reauthorize the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, is being held up by a senator from the Democratic side of the aisle who is objecting to the reauthorization of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act. 
   I support H.R. 2884, but I oppose Senator MURKOWSKI's substitute amendment that undermines the new oil valuation rule for royalty payments on oil produced on Federal lands. This rule took over three years to finally implement. Senator MURKOWSKI's amendment would do great damage to the rule, which just took effect a few months ago and taxpayers would be hurt. 
   In conclusion, I support the House bill, which sets up a heating oil reserve for the northeastern states and reauthorizes the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, but I object to the royalty provision in the substitute amendment. 
   I call on the Senator from Alaska to let H.R. 2884 move forward as it was passed by the other body--without the royalty language.

   Mrs. BOXER. I thank my friend. I thank him and Senator DASCHLE, our leadership team here, for what you are doing. The Senator from Utah asked, I thought, a very reasonable question when he said: What is this going to cost? 
   I say to my friend, on the issue of cost--and I think this is important--what happens to a family when the worker in that family is told to leave? Because if we do not pass this law--which is what our friends want; they do not want us to pass this law--that worker goes back to the country of origin and has to wait 10 years there, leaving behind--let us say it is a man in this case--a wife and children, children who are citizens of this country. 
   My friend from Utah says: Illegal. 
   Those are American children. If we do not act, their dad is going to be deported. For 10 years they will have to wait. What happens to the cost when a wage earner has to leave this country, perhaps for up to 10 years, leaving the children behind? The Senator pointed out the business community is without workers, so they are going to have to pay more to get fewer workers. That is a cost. But what is the cost if these people have to go on welfare, I say to my friend, because the breadwinner is summarily removed from this country because we have failed to act on this immigration fairness act?

   Mrs. BOXER. When I am completed I am sure there will be 
   time for others, but I do not want to lose my train of thought. 
   What my friend has said is when someone asks what is the cost of this immigration fairness act amendment, we are saying it is more costly not to act because of the impact on the business community and their ability to get help is huge. The impact on the family, when the breadwinner has to leave behind American citizen children and perhaps the mom has to go on welfare, is very high, not to mention the cost of splitting up families. My friend has been a leader on this, as has my friend from Utah as well. We know what happens when parents split up. We know the costs to society. We know what happens to the kids. We know what happens to people using alcohol to dull the pain and all those things, when a family is summarily split apart. 
   I do not hear my friends on the other side saying, ``change the law for Nicaraguans or Cubans.'' Good for them, we should allow those people to stay. What about the Salvadorans?

   Mrs. BOXER. The last question I have is this: Our colleagues are up in arms about allowing us to have a vote on this, but they are bringing out amendments without even asking the authors if they want them attached to this particular bill. It amazes me. 
   I guess the final question I have for my assistant leader is this: If our friends on the other side do not like this bill, why do they not just vote against it? We are not asking to pass this without a vote. Are we not asking for the ability to put this on the Senate floor, debate it very briefly--or as long as they want? You yourself said, I think, you would take 10 minutes of debate and whatever the other side wants. Is it not their right to vote against this fairness legislation if they so desire?

   Mrs. BOXER. Will my friend yield for just a couple of quick questions, and then I will allow him to, of course, finish his statement. 
   First, I really came over to the floor when I saw the Senator took time to speak on the floor about the Violence Against Women Act. It was my great honor when I was in the House that he asked me to carry that bill those many years ago. I remember what a struggle it was. We couldn't get that House at that time to recognize this problem. 
   I have heard my friend say many times, even the words ``domestic violence'' indicate something that is different about this particular kind of violence; there is something that is domesticated about it. It is violence; it is anger; it is rape; it is hard to even describe what women, particularly women--although it does happen to men--go through. 
   So I took to the floor just to ask a couple of questions. In light of the House passage with the kind of vote you rarely see over there--my goodness, we hardly ever see a vote like that--and the fact it was freestanding, wasn't attached to any other bill, doesn't my friend believe we should bring this up--I agree with him--with a short time agreement, 2 minutes a side? It doesn't matter to me. We have talked enough about this over the years. 
   Doesn't my friend agree it would be much better to just bring it up freestanding instead of attaching it to another bill that some people may have problems with? Why would we want to take this idea, this incredibly important idea that the Senator pushed through this Congress, and attach it to another bill that may be controversial?

   Mrs. BOXER. We might want to see if we could get some signatures on a letter asking him to bring it up freestanding 
   because it seems to me to be the best thing to do. 
   Almost everything else we do, as my friend has pointed out, is controversial. But when you have a bill that has worked to increase the funding for shelters and train judges and doctors and the rest, and as a result we have seen a 21-percent decline in this kind of violence, it ought to breeze through here. 
   But I really came to the floor to thank my friend for his leadership here and his continued focus on this issue. A lot of us, as we get older, start thinking: What have I done that I am really proud of? I know my friend can truly say--and I can say it because I was fortunate he involved me in this early on--this is one of the good things, one of the great things. 
   I thank my friend and hope we can prevail on the majority leader to bring this up freestanding. I thank my colleague for yielding.

   Mrs. BOXER. They fear for their kids. With all of the attention we have paid to the entertainment industry--and the Chair has taken a lead on this--to call to everyone's attention the excess of violence and the marketing of too many R-rated films to kids, we know for sure, I say to Senator BIDEN, there is only one proven predictor that violence will be passed on to the next generation, and that is when the child sees a parent beat the other parent. We know that 60 percent or more of those kids are going to grow up in the same fashion. 
   I was going to leave now, but every time the Senator starts to bring up another point, it is so interesting, I am kind of spellbound. But the bottom line is, with this bill we are helping women and 
   children and families. We are standing for the values that I thought we all mean when we say ``family values.'' Again, my thanks.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, it has been more than a year since the Columbine tragedy, but still this Republican Congress refuses to act on sensible gun legislation. 
   Since Columbine, thousands of Americans have been killed by gunfire. Until we act, Democrats in the Senate will read the names of some of those who have lost their lives to gun violence in the past year, and we will continue to do so every day that the Senate is in session. 
   In the name of those who died, we will continue this fight. Following are the names of some of the people who were killed by gunfire one year ago today. 
   September 26, 1999: Robert Coney, 64, Miami, FL; Derrick Edwards, 22, Washington, DC; Philip Harris, 27, Detroit, MI; Samala McGee, 24, New Orleans, LA; Michael D. Miles, 48, Hollywood, FL; David Sexton, 43, Baltimore, MD; and Unidentified Female, 47, Nashville, TN. 
   We cannot sit back and allow such senseless gun violence to continue. The deaths of these people are a reminder to all of us that we need to enact sensible gun legislation now.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today I am introducing a very important bill, the Halt Electricity Price-gouging in San Diego Act. This bill, a companion to the bill introduced in the House on September 7, 2000 by Congressman FILNER, sends a loud and clear signal to electric companies in California that the federal government will not tolerate price gouging of our people. 
   California is currently experiencing an energy crisis, particularly in San Diego. Energy supplies are barely adequate on any given day to meet demand. Wholesale electricity prices have soared, causing San Diego Gas and Electric to pass along increased costs to consumers and resulting in bills that have increased as much as 300 percent in the San Diego area. 
   Small business owners and people on small or fixed incomes, especially the elderly, are particularly suffering. Other utilities in the state have similar supply and cost problems, causing losses in the hundreds of millions of dollars. 
   This bill would direct the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to impose price caps on wholesale electricity prices. The bill would also require power suppliers to refund fees charged above the FERC-imposed price cap since June 1, 2000. The precise total of refunds due would be determined by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. 
   I urge FERC to act swiftly and bring relief to those who have been hit by this terrible situation. 
   The fight for fair utility rates is going to be difficult and may require a number of other solutions. I will continue to work with Congressman FILNER and others to ensure that we end the crisis and prevent similar incidents in California and elsewhere in the United States.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I thank my colleague for giving me these 5  minutes. I listened to Senator GRAMM's attack on the Clinton-Gore prescription drug plan, the Democratic plan. I will tell you, it was very interesting because I just read an article in one of the newspapers. I think it was in The Hill. It is an article by Representative SHERROD BROWN. Representative BROWN points to a confidential document--I will quote him--prepared for House Republicans. It found its way into the public realm. It wasn't news at the time, he says, but when you read it, it suggests that the Republicans go after the Democratic plan by calling it a one-size-fits-all plan, ``a big government plan, especially a one-size-fits-all big government plan.'' 
   As I listened to Senator GRAMM, he uses those terms over and over again. Now it sort of makes sense as to why they have put out this strategy on how to attack this plan. I had to smile when I was listening to Senator GRAMM because I thought, Is he attacking the Medicare program? The Medicare program is a program that covers 99 percent of our seniors. I suppose he thinks that the one-size-fits-all big government plan--and I assume he feels that way because Governor Bush, in 4 years, wants to do away with the Medicare plan. So this is what is happening here. 
   I want to share a couple of charts that show the differences between the two plans. This is amazing. Also, they say it is a forced plan when it is voluntary. Vice President GORE has been very clear that the plan is a voluntary plan. Seniors can take it if they want. So here you have the Democratic plan, which is affordable for all seniors. It is part of Medicare and it is voluntary. It has a defined benefit, and it gives bargaining power to seniors so that the cost of the drugs would go down. 
   The House Republican bill has no assistance to seniors with incomes over $12,500. So that leaves out most seniors. It is private insurance, not Medicare. Insurers say they won't offer it. We have proof of that and we have quotes. An insurer can modify or drop benefits year to year. Seniors may lose access to local pharmacies or drugs. There is no guarantee of better prices. Let's see the comments about the Bush-Republican plan--the GOP prescription drug plan by health insurers.  
   We continue to believe the concept of the so-called drug-only private insurance simply would not work in practice.  
   That is Charles Kahn, President of the Health Insurance Association of America. 
   Let's look at other comments of health insurers on the GOP plan endorsed by Senator GRAMM and Governor Bush.  
   Private drug insurance policies are doomed from the start. The idea sounds good, but it cannot succeed in the real world. I don't know of an insurance company that would offer a drug-only policy like that or even consider it.  
   Charles Kahn, President of the Health Insurance Association of America. 
   Health insurers tell us that the Bush Republican plan is doomed because no insurance companies are going to do it. 
   Here is Cecil Bykerk, Executive Vice President of the Mutual of Omaha companies, who says:  
   I am convinced that stand-alone drug policies won't work.  
   You have a real plan by AL GORE for voluntary benefits under Medicare--a program that is revered by seniors. The fact is that the Republican plan, by the very companies that are making life miserable for seniors--HMOs, insurance companies, and pharmaceutical companies--is a complete sham. 
   Things are getting hot around here. It is ``happy season.'' It is political season. I think we have to get back to reality. 
   Let's realize that the words used by my friend, Senator GRAMM from Texas, come straight out of the Republican campaign strategy book--call it big government, call it one size fits all; if you don't like the Medicare program, then you ought to support Governor Bush's plan because in 4 years he does away with Medicare. 
   Let's take a look at this one more time. 
   The Senate Democratic bill, which is essentially the Gore plan, is affordable for all seniors. It is voluntary. It will work. 
   The House Republican plan and the one that is discussed by PHIL GRAMM is a sham. The insurance companies say they can't do it. 
   Thank you very much. I thank my colleague from Florida for allowing me to go ahead.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I will vote against the combined legislative branch and Treasury-Postal Service appropriations bills. 
   While the administration has identified a couple of funding shortfalls in the bill, that is not my primary concern here, and it is not the reason I am opposing this legislation. 
   I am voting against the bill because the Senate has never considered the Treasury-Postal appropriations bill. Let me repeat that: the Senate is being asked to vote on a conference report on a bill that never passed the Senate. 
   This is a complete distortion of the legislative process. We are not potted plants. The people of the state of California elected me to represent them. That means debating bills, offering amendments that are important to the people of my state, and casting votes. It does not mean giving a rubber stamp to whatever conference report comes before us when we have not even debated the bill in the first place. 
   I was considering offering an amendment to this bill prohibiting the sale of firearms to individuals who are drunk. Believe it or not, it is not against the law to sell a gun to someone who is intoxicated. I was considering offering an amendment regarding the carrying of concealed weapons in places of worship. And I was considering offering an amendment praising Smith and Wesson for entering into an agreement with the administration to change the way it manufactures and distributes firearms. 
   But I was prevented--every Senator was prevented--from offering any amendments because the Treasury-Postal Service bill was never brought up. Normally a bill that does not come before the Senate cannot become law. 
   But the majority wanted to avoid debating and voting on these amendments, and so they found a way to  make an end-run around the rules of the Senate and to run roughshod over the rights of 100 Senators. 
   I will not be a party to this process, so I will vote against the bill.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, we have a very important issue facing us in California. In fact, we have two very important issues facing us in California that are intertwined into this particular discussion on immigration policy. One of them deals with the real shortage of high-tech labor that we face in California and elsewhere in the country, where we are finding that the high-tech industry cannot find enough good, qualified people with the proper skills, experience, and training to fill the high-tech jobs that are really fueling our economic recovery and our economic prosperity, not only in California but in many other States. 
   This is a real problem. At first, when I heard about it, I thought, could this  be true? Could it be true that we do not have these workers? Since I have asked that question, and a number of others did also, there have been some studies showing that it is the case; that we do have a shortage of these workers. If we don't make accommodations for people to come into this country who have these skills, we will simply not be able to function as an economy. 
   The second problem we face in California--and perhaps in other States, I am sure--is the question of fairness in our immigration law. Fairness really needs to be a hallmark of what we do when it comes to immigration. We should not treat people from one country who face real problems differently from people from another country who face similar problems. Yet we have that with respect to our Latin American policy. So we really need to have a situation where we have a Latino fairness act, while we are, in fact, taking care of the labor shortages for our business friends. These things are interrelated in many ways. I hope we will be able to take them up together and pass them together; or if we can't do it that way, I hope that we have an agreement between both sides of the aisle, and with the President, that we will make sure both of these problems are addressed and are addressed in a good and careful way. 
   Let me talk about the Latino fairness question. Basically, what we are asking for is parity for all Americans so immigrants from El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Haiti have the same chance and go through the same process for permanent status or asylum as those from Nicaragua and Cuba. It is very simple. Why should we say to immigrants from one Latin American country that they would have a different standard when, in fact, there has been great suffering in all of these countries? 
   It may take place in different ways, but the bottom line is that there are many people from these countries who had to leave these countries because of fear of harm to themselves, their families; and those people were in these countries I mentioned. 
   We have heard about death squads. We have heard about horrible things happening to people and people disappearing in the middle of the night. In fact, the families in Guatemala 
   have been shattered by this kind of thing, and a group of mothers got together and brought this issue to the world's attention. So there has been suffering. We remember the suffering from El Salvador with the right-wing death squads operating there, and we know the horror stories from Haiti and the other countries that are clamoring for some kind of fairness. 
   So if you lived in Nicaragua and you were hurt there by the Communist regime, or if you lived in Cuba and you were hurt there by the Communist regime, we want to open our arms to you. Why wouldn't we want to open our arms to you if you were hurt by a right-wing regime? We should not be playing politics at all. We should say that people who are persecuted by government--whether the bullet came from the right, left, or the middle, it doesn't matter; it is still a bullet. We should be fair to all of those people. 
   We want to update the registry so that undocumented aliens in the U.S. before 1986 can get a chance to remain permanently. The current cutoff date is 1972. Historically, we have gone back and changed those dates. It is time to do that. 
   We want to restore section 245(i), which allows those eligible for permanent resident status, who are in the U.S. already, to remain here while the process is being completed. 
   I want to tell you a real story about why this is so important. Jaime came to the U.S. from Mexico, and is now married to Michelle, a U.S. citizen. The couple has two daughters, both U.S. citizens. As a citizen, Michelle petitioned for an immigrant visa for her husband. When it came time to complete the visa application process, Jaime and his wife went to the consular offices in Cuidad Juarez, Mexico, for the interview. He was unaware that if he left the United States he would be barred from entering for 10 years. Michelle returned but has since lost her job and is struggling financially to support her children. Jaime is making very little money in Mexico--not enough to support his family in the U.S. Michelle finds every day a struggle to survive without her husband. The separation has caused great emotional anguish, as well as economic hardship. 
   I think all of us on both sides of the aisle care about families and care about family unification. We know how important it is that children have a mother and a dad at home, if it is possible. So here we have a policy where this gentleman who came here a long time ago, was working and supporting his family, made a mistake and left the country; now he finds out he can't come back for 10 years. We need to fix this problem. 
   So while we are helping our friends in the high-tech industry get workers and allow those workers to come into this country, to immigrate into this country, it seems to me that we ought to address this Latino fairness act. 
   As I said before, I was a little dubious when I heard of these shortages in the high-tech companies I represent. So I was very pleased when there was a study because the study showed that in fact they were telling us the absolute truth; they are short a lot of people. 
   In January 2000, unemployment hit its lowest level in 30 years. What a great economic story we have to tell. It is important to all of our sectors that are desperate for properly qualified employees. 
   We thought we would never see this day, even as recently as 1992, which seems like yesterday. That is when I won election to the Senate. The people in my State were suffering double-digit unemployment. We are very happy to stand here today and say that because of the Clinton-Gore policy that made it through, we have seen the greatest economic recovery in history, with the biggest surplus we have seen, having created 22 million new jobs. 
   So we have a problem, and our problem is an enviable one to the entire world. We really need to have more help in our high-tech industry. 
   That is why this bill that is pending before us is so important. That is why I support it so strongly. 
   We see that an independent study group found a shortage of 400,000 programmers, systems analysts, and computer scientists. 
   We know we have a real problem. We also know we are not doing enough in this country to educate our kids. 
   That is why I am so excited at the idea of a huge commitment to education, the kind Vice President GORE talked about--he said the biggest since the GI bill. That is what we need so we don't have to import these workers. 
   The number of bachelor's degrees awarded in computer science has declined 43 percent between 1986 and 1996. The number of bachelor's degrees awarded in engineering declined 19 percent between 1986 and 1996. 
   We are not turning out the graduates for the computer science and engineering skills that we need. 
   We need to really move on this matter; it breaks my heart to say these high-paying jobs are not going to American workers. 
   Some of the good things in this H-1B visa bill deal with retraining. A lot of the funds will come from the fees the companies will pay. They have to pay a fee when they bring a worker in to do important things--workforce training; math and science engineering; technology; postsecondary scholarships for low-income and disadvantaged students; to the National Science Foundation for matching or direct grants to support private company partnerships; to assist schools in initiating, improving, or expanding math and science; and information technology curricula through a variety of methods. We have some funds to help our Department of Labor enforce and process these workers, and for the Immigration and Naturalization Service. 
   I compliment the committee for its work. I particularly thank Senator KENNEDY who did a very good job of working with the high-tech community. They are very supportive of seeing that these fees go to this education and job training. It is so important. It isn't enough. We need a bigger commitment to education. That is clear. 
   When I talk about education, I always quote a wonderful man who was the President in the 1950s, Dwight David Eisenhower. Ike said in those years that in order for us to be strong, it took more than just a strong military. He said you could have more guns than any other country. You could  have more missiles, more ships, and more people in uniform. But if you didn't have an educated workforce, if education wasn't front and center, it would mean nothing; we would be weak. 
   He was the first President in modern times to say there is a role for the Federal Government in education. He signed the National Defense Education Act in order to stimulate teachers to go into math and science, and so on. 
   If he were here today, I think he would be saying to us: You didn't do enough in education. You have done great on the military; we are the most powerful Nation in the world, but we had better make sure our people can run these very complicated military machines, let alone anything to do with the civilian sector. 
   My view is that we have a great opportunity with this bill. It is important that we give the high-tech community the workers they need so they will stay in this country, and so they will continue to fuel this economic growth. 
   It is also important that at the same time we are allowing so many thousands of farm workers into the country to help us--and 
   we are very happy and willing to do that--that we look at our immigration policy toward people who have been here for many years--the Latino community--and pass the Latino fairness act. 
   I think if we did both of those things we would feel very good about the Senate because it would be fairness all the way around. 
   I appreciate having this opportunity to speak on this today. I know from the Silicon Valley and other areas of my State--Los Angeles, San Diego, and even now in the Central Valley where there is more and more growth in the high-tech computer industries--that we need this visa bill. 
   I also can tell you from my Latino community that they expect to be treated fairly. They are not asking for the world. They want their families to be reunited. They want fairness and equity for all Central Americans. 
   Again, if there was persecution in one country and we opened our arms to those good people, we should open our arms to the others from the other countries who have been left out. 
   Again, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Haiti have been struggling. They need our help. 
   I think this is an opportunity to help our business community and to help our immigrants who are really making our country so strong and, in my opinion, doing the work that needs to be done every day. We couldn't find harder workers than they. They ought to be treated with dignity and respect. 
   While we are at it, we ought to raise the minimum wage. I hope we can take that up in the near future. I don't know if you can calculate what you would make if you earned a minimum wage. It is hard to survive. It is practically impossible to survive. 
   I hope we can do these things for our workers, for our businesses, for our immigrants, and move this country forward so the American dream is there for all of our people. 
   Thank you very much. Mr. President, I yield the floor.

    Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, it is with sadness that I rise to inform my colleagues of the death of former San Francisco Mayor George Christopher, who passed away on September 14th at the age of 92. I express my deepest condolences to Mayor Christopher's family and to his countless friends. 
   The city has lost an extraordinary civic leader--one whose grand vision and passion for helping people are vividly remembered by all who knew him. 
   Although many residents were not yet born during George Christopher's two terms as mayor from 1956 to 1964, the citizens of San Francisco still benefit today from his dynamic and no nonsense leadership. People like to say that San Francisco grew up during his tenure, that he made it a big league city. Indeed, it was George Christopher who brought the then New York Giants to town. 
   Mayor Christopher changed the way San Francisco looked and the way its citizens looked at themselves. He transformed the City's skyline, built the Japan Center and Candlestick Park, and he modernized downtown. He built San Francisco into a cosmopolitan, world-class city. 
   The child of Greek immigrants, as mayor he ushered in an era of stronger civil rights consciousness and was a particular hero to San Francisco's Greek community. He was a man of international stature who never lost his close connection to everyday people. Mayor Christopher's life was dedicated to public service, and the San  Francisco of today is in many ways a living testament to his achievements both in and out of office. 
   George Christopher was an exceptional leader who will be greatly missed.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I share Senator THOMPSON's and Senator TORRICELLI's concerns about weapons proliferation, and I appreciate their bringing this important matter up for debate in a non-partisan fashion. However, I believe that the amendment they have offered to H.R. 4444, legislation that will grant permanent normal trade relations to the People's Republic of China, does not address the issue in the most positive way. 
   My first concern with the China Nonproliferation Act is with the name itself. The original legislation proposed by the sponsors of this amendment specifically singled out China. But, the current amendment adds North Korea and Russia as nations that are named as covered countries under this proposal. I believe it is correct to expand the list of initial countries beyond China, but I still feel that on the issue of proliferation, every country should be treated with a uniform standard. 
   The second concern is that this amendment attempts to curtail the spread of weapons with a unilateral rather than a multilateral solution. It is clear to me that this issue is sufficiently complex to demand the cooperation of the international community in stopping the proliferation of weapons. While this amendment singles out North Korea, Russia, and China as covered countries, it also opens the door to possible sanctions on our closest allies. This is because of the requirement that countries listed in the annual section 721 report that is mandated under the fiscal year 1997 Intelligence Authorization Act be covered by this amendment. This report singles out those nations that are a source of dual-use technology which, in recent years, has included such countries as  Germany, Italy, and the United Kingdom. I do not believe that sanctioning our closest allies--those that traditionally support our interests--will further our non-proliferation goals. Furthermore, using unilateral sanctions rather than working with our allies to develop multilateral strategies is not the most effective means of curtailing proliferation. 
   Another concern with the amendment is that the sanctions would deny all state-owned enterprises of a covered country access to U.S. capital markets. This was one reason why Alan Greenspan publicly spoke out against this amendment at a hearing of the Senate Banking Committee. He stated that ``..... to the extent that we block foreigners from investing or raising funds in the United States, we probably undercut the viability of our own system.'' 
   Finally, I am concerned that this amendment will not provide the necessary flexibility for the executive and legislative branch to conduct policy on proliferation issues. The amendment gives the President only 30 days from the time he issues a report to Congress on proliferation to impose five unilateral mandatory sanctions. After the President makes this determination, the amendment allows for as few as 20 Senators to initiate a reversal of the President's decision. It would take only 20 Senators to ensure that a resolution of disapproval be referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations. The committee would then only have 15 calendar days to consider such a resolution. If the resolution is not reported in that timeframe, it would be sent to the floor with debate limited to 10 hours and a vote required within 15 days. Given the inadequate evidentiary standard of ``credible information'' that is provided for in this amendment, this expedited procedure is a recipe for bad policy. 
   I do look forward to discussing this matter further both here on the Senate floor and within the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. This complex issue requires further review and debate separate from the current business of granting permanent normal trade relations to the People's Republic of China.

   Mrs. BOXER. Senator WYDEN, it is my understanding, along with our colleague from Montana, that under section 302(a), counties must meet the purposes of title III and section 205. You will note that section 205 explicitly does not give the Resource Advisory Committees the power to either ``approve'' or ``disapprove'' projects. Rather, under section 205, the Resource Advisory Committees are given the power to ``review'' and ``propose'' projects. This is critical distinction. Because, while we want the Resource Advisory Committees to be involved--as indeed we want all members of the interested public involved--we do not wish for the Resource Advisory Committees to in any sense ``drive'' or ``control'' or ``limit'' the use of title III funds. These funds are set aside for the counties and the counties should use them in their best discretion. 
   Mr. WYDEN, would you agree that this is the intent of the bill?

   Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Chair. 
   Mr. President, I add my thanks to my fine colleague for allowing me to have this 5 minutes. 
   I say to my dear friend from Maine that we all seem to be saying we want to bring up the ESEA so we can debate education. Yet the format under which we would be going back to this bill would be a closed format. Those of us who think it is important, for example, that there be school safety, that we be allowed to offer sensible gun laws so we can, in fact, keep these guns away from these kids wouldn't be able to do it. We could not offer an amendment on school modernization. We could not offer an amendment to expand afterschool opportunities, smaller class sizes, more qualified teachers, and accountability for results. 
   When you say you want to discuss education, yet you shut out the ability for those of us on this side to offer these amendments that, by the way, many people in the country support by majorities of 80 percent, it seems to me you are not offering anything at all. 
   The interesting point is that my friends on the other side say: Well, you are just trying to delay things. Nothing could be further from the truth. In 1994, PHIL GRAMM on your side offered a gun amendment on the ESEA. All we are asking for is the opportunity to debate this and debate it so that it is relevant to the American people.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I asked for the 5 minutes because I want to discuss a timely matter in response to my good friend, Senator JOHN MCCAIN, who made a national radio address of 5 minutes to the Nation in which he criticized the President very strongly for the President's budget plans. 
   It is wonderful to see that JOHN is back and strong, healthy and feisty, and I am looking forward to testifying before his committee on the issue of violence among children. But I have to say, although I completely respect his opinion, I think his analysis of where we are in the budget debate is so upside down and inside out, I felt compelled to take to the floor today to respond. 
   Senator MCCAIN said in his radio address:  
   Our President supports excessive spending that most Americans oppose.  
   That is a direct quote. He said the President would:  
   ..... wreck the economic progress we have made during these good years.  
   That is very strong language. 
   I must say respectfully to my friend from Arizona, why have we had ``these good years'' about which he talks? Clearly, it is because this administration has given us policies that work. We only need to look back to 1992, the Bush-Quayle years. We had the worst recession since the Great Depression. I remember it so well because it is when I ran for the Senate. We had horrific deficits as far as the eye could see, almost $300 billion. We had crime rising; we had hope falling. We had unemployment skyrocketing, and there was malaise in the country. 
   The Clinton-Gore budget in 1993 changed all of that by 
   ushering in a new era of economic growth. It was a combination of discipline on the deficit and policies that would invest in our people--economic discipline on the one hand, saying to the people in the very high brackets: You have to pay your fair share, and investing in our people, in education, in the environment, and in infrastructure. 
   It does not mean everything is perfect, as AL GORE is saying. He is not satisfied. None of us should be satisfied. There is more work to do, and we need to do better. 
   But let's look at the record since AL GORE has been Vice President: Average  economic growth, 3.8 percent a year under Clinton-Gore, compared to 1.7 percent under Bush-Quayle; unemployment in 1992, a staggering 7.5 percent. In my home State, it was double digits. I will never forget the fear among the people. Today the unemployment rate is 4 percent.

   Mrs. BOXER. Home ownership is the highest ever. The $290 billion deficit has turned into a $232 billion surplus. Poverty is the lowest in 20 years. Real wage growth is up 6.5 percent. Under the Reagan-Bush years, there was a decline in the real wage growth of 4.3 percent. There are 22 million new jobs, the most jobs created in history under a single administration. 
   Now we have the other party saying the President is wrong on his budget ideas. It is their right to say that. But the American people are wise. When you oppose every policy that led to this economic growth, they are going to question you at this particular point in the debate. 
   Instead of having a radio address where you slam this administration after these great years of growth, why not hold out your hand? Why not hold out your hand to the other side? People are tired of this partisanship. 
   Let's keep these successful policies going. As Vice President GORE has said, let us do even better. Let's not be satisfied; let's make those deep investments in education and the environment. Let's do even better on paying down the debt. Let us give middle-class tax cuts, not tax cuts to the superwealthy that are going to wreck this economic recovery. Let us save Social Security and Medicare. The other side wants to do it. Let's join hands. 
   Let's join hands on a real Patients' Bill of Rights and on a real prescription drug benefit as part of Medicare--and not send our seniors off to the HMOs which really do not have the patients' benefits at heart. Let's do it together before the end of this session. Let's do it now. Let's join hands now rather than throw insults over the radio. 
   My friends, we have a golden opportunity. I think we have shown we can work together. Let's stop the partisanship. Let's join hands. Let's finish this year on a high note, go home, and feel good that we have done these things. Let's keep up the policies of the past 8 years because they have worked. But let's do even better. 
   I thank my friend for giving me this time. I thank the Presiding Officer for his indulgence. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, this Saturday will mark the 150th anniversary of California's admission to the Union. As the people of our State prepare for this Sesquicentennial celebration, I want to celebrate California's most distinctive characteristic: its tremendous diversity. 
   California is ``a nation unto itself'' with great mountains and forests, vast deserts and fertile valleys, rolling hills and rugged coastlines. Within its borders can be found virtually every climate, every crop, every landform on earth. 
   But our greatest diversity--and our greatest asset--is the people of California. 
   California's diversity was apparent from the beginning. When the first Spanish pioneers crossed the Great Desert, they met Native Americans from more than 300 tribal and language groups. By the time Mexico and California gained independence from Spain, Alta California was home to many Europeans, Asians, and Pacific Islanders as well as Hispanics, North Americans, and Native Americans. 
   In 1849, when California held its constitutional convention, its 48 delegates included men from England, Scotland, Ireland, France, Switzerland, Mexico, and Spain. Thirteen of the delegates had been in California for less than a year; and William M. Gwin, who later became one of our first two U.S. Senators, had been here less than three months. Seven delegates had been born in California: their names were Vallejo, Carrillo, Pico, Dominguez, Rodriguez, Covarrubias, another Pico, and de la Guerra. 
   The Gold Rush brought new waves of pioneers from all over the globe. In their wake came workers from China, who built the great railroads, and Japanese farmers who fed the fortune hunters and made fortunes of their own. 
   During the Great Depression, thousands of internal immigrants fled the Dust Bowls of Texas and Oklahoma for greener pastures in California. 
   During World War II, thousands of African Americans migrated from the rural South to work in California's shipyards and other defense-related industries. 
   At the war's end, California had a wave of settlers from the U.S. Armed Forces: men and women who had shipped out of our beautiful ports and returned to stay when the war was over. 
   In recent years, new immigrants from Asia and Latin America have added to California's rich cultural mix, making our state the crossroads of the Pacific Rim and the new economy.  
   Today California's great diversity is reflected in our Congressional delegation, where our state is represented by people named BECERRA, and ROYBAL-ALLARD; FEINSTEIN, WAXMAN, and BERMAN; DIXON, WATERS, and LEE; PELOSI, GALLEGLY, and RADANOVICH; and FARR and MCKEON.  
   On Wednesday, September 13th, Representatives FARR and MCKEON will host a Sesquicentennial reception for Members of both Houses and both parties. I look forward to joining my California colleagues in celebrating our great state's proud history and bright future.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, this past week, our nation and the world have been privileged to witness two dramatic triumphs by American athletes. Lance Armstrong won his second consecutive Tour de France, and Tiger Woods became the youngest person ever to capture golf's Grand Slam by winning the British Open. These are truly historic achievements. Both men are deserving of all the praise and congratulations they are receiving, not only for their exceptional performances, but also for the dignified way they have represented their country and respective sports. 
   With the example of these modern day champions in mind, today I am introducing a resolution to honor a similarly outstanding group of athletes from years ago. 
   The 1951 University of San Francisco football team, the Dons, went undefeated and untied. By almost any account, the Dons were among the most gifted college football teams ever. Ten of the team's players were drafted by the NFL. Of these, eight actually played professionally. Of these, five played in a least one Pro Bowl. And of these five, three, Bob St. Clair, Ollie Matson and Gino Marchetti, were inducted into the Professional Football Hall of Fame. 
   But despite the team's irrefutable ability and qualifications, the Dons were not invited to participate in any post season bowl games. The reason why the players and coaches were denied this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to prove themselves as a team before a national audience is as simple as it is tragic. Two of the Dons' players Ollie Matson and Burl Toler, were African-American. 
   In 1951, it would have been expected of a team with the Dons record to compete for the national championship in the Orange Bowl. When an invitation to this bowl did not materialize, everyone knew why. At this time the unwritten but well understood rule was that bowl games were strictly off limits to teams with African American players. 
   Although the Dons were not invited to play in the Orange Bowl, they did receive an invitation to participate in another bowl game, The only hitch was that they would have to play without their two teammates. To their enduring credit, the team did not think twice about standing by Ollie and Burl and emphatically rejected the offfer. 
   Refusing this offer was a heroic act, but not the only one for this team. Several members of the squad fought in WWII and in the Korean War. 
   Considered perhaps the best player on the team, Burl Toler suffered an injury during a college All Star game which prevented him from joining the NFL as a player. Instead, he went back to school, received his master's degree, became the City of San Francisco's first black secondary school principal, and later the director of services for the San Francisco Community College District. He did this while also serving for 25 years as one of the NFL's most respected referees. In fact, Burl Toler was the NFL's first black official, a position offered to him by a fellow classmate at USF, former NFL Commissioner Pete Rozelle. 
   Now almost 50 years later, I hope my colleagues will agree that it is entirely appropriate that this truly special collection of athletes receive the national attention and accolades they once earned but were denied. The resolution I will introduce today calls on the Senate to recognize the team for its achievements on the field as well as the integrity of players and coaches off it. It also calls on this body to acknowledge that the discriminatory treatment endured by the Dons and other teams and individuals at that time was flatly wrong. 
   With the Olympics approaching, and as we celebrate Lance Armstrong and Tiger Woods for their victories and the obstacles they and others had to overcome for them to reach the pinnacle of their sports, I hope we also make the effort to honor the 1951 USF Dons--a team whose combination of talent and courage we may never see again.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today the Senate is taking a big step forward in the fight against international AIDS and Tuberculosis. Today's passage of H.R. 3519, the Global AIDS and Tuberculosis Relief Act of 2000, will help those throughout the world who are suffering from these deadly infectious diseases. 
   I am particularly pleased that this legislation includes two bills that I introduced earlier in the 106th Congress. In February, I introduced the Global AIDS Prevention Act (S. 2026). This legislation authorizes $300 million in bilateral aid for those nations most severely affected by HIV and AIDS. It calls on the United States Agency for International Development to make HIV and AIDS a priority in its foreign assistance program and undertake a comprehensive, coordinated effort to combat HIV and AIDS. This assistance will include primary prevention and education, voluntary testing and counseling, medications to prevent the transmission of HIV and AIDS from mother to child, and care for those living with HIV or AIDS. 
   H.R. 3519 also includes legislation I introduced last year, the International Tuberculosis Control Act (S. 1497). This bill authorizes $60 million in aid to fight the growing international problem of tuberculosis. With this legislation, the United States Agency for International Development will coordinate with the World Health Organization, the Centers for Disease Control, the National Institutes of Health, and other organizations toward the development and implementation of a comprehensive tuberculosis control program. This bill also sets as a goal the detection of at least 70 percent of the cases of infectious tuberculosis and the cure of at least 85 percent of the cases detected by 2010. 
   H.R. 3519 has other important provisions as well. The bill includes a $10 million contribution to the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative and a $50 million contribution to the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunizations. It also contains provisions calling for the establishment of a World Bank AIDS Trust Fund with the Secretary of the Treasury authorized to provide $150 million for payment to the fund. 
   I want to thank all of the members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee for their work on this legislation. I am particularly grateful for the efforts of Chairman HELMS in pushing this bill forward. 
   This is an important step in the fight against AIDS and TB. I have no doubt that greater resources will be needed in future years to continue this effort. I am hopeful that the Senate will continue to treat the issue of infectious diseases with the seriousness it deserves. 
   There are 34 million people today living with HIV/AIDS, and one-third of the world's population is infected with tuberculosis. Much more needs to be done, and I am proud of the Senate for taking this action today.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, it has been more than a year since the Columbine tragedy, but still this Republican Congress refuses to act on sensible gun legislation. 
   Since Columbine, thousands of Americans have been killed by gunfire. Until we act, Democrats in the Senate will read some of the names of those who lost their lives to gun violence in the past year, and we will continue to do so every day that the Senate is in session. 
   In the name of those who died, we will continue this fight. Following are the names of some of the people who  were killed by gunfire one year ago today. 
   Clyde E. Frazier, 40, Chicago, IL; Ernest Jones, 57, Knoxville, TN; Jose Lopez, 29, Houston, TX; Elva V. Manjarrez, 35, Chicago, IL; Kimberly Meeks-Penniman, 39, Detroit, MI; Anthony L. Moore, 28, Memphis, TN; Donald Pinkney, 23, Baltimore, MD; James Riley, 26, New Orleans, LA; Void Sampson, 24, Philadelphia, PA; Michael A. Williams, 35, New Orleans, LA; and Unidentified male, 22, Newark, NJ. 
   One of the gun violence victims I mentioned, thirty-five-year-old Elva Manjarrez of Chicago, was shot and killed in a drive-by shooting while she was sitting in a parked car. No motive was ever established for her death. 
   We cannot sit back and allow such senseless gun violence to continue. The deaths of Elva and the others I named are a reminder to all of us that we need to enact sensible gun legislation now.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I thank the managers for their assistance in adding an amendment to the Agriculture Appropriations bill that requires the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Wildlife Services Research Center to design and implement on-the-ground demonstration projects to test the application of non-lethal mammalian predator control techniques. 
   The purpose of this amendment is to generate data that can be used in determining the effectiveness of non-lethal methods for protecting livestock from predators. These nonlethal methods include: the use of guard animals such as dogs, donkeys, and llamas; the use of predator-proof electric fencing; special light and sound deterrents; and promotion of sound animal husbandry techniques such as carcass removal, night penning, and shed lambing to protect pregnant animals and their newborns when they are most vulnerable. 
   Lethal predator control measures, such as shooting, poisoning, or trapping, should not be employed in these projects. In order to produce useful outcomes, the pilot projects should involve ranchers whose circumstances are representative of the types of livestock/predator conflicts that other ranchers experience around the country. 
   The General Accounting Office has been tasked with reporting on these pilot projects and providing an assessment of the effectiveness of these non-lethal mammalian predator control measures. I look forward to working with the Department, along with Senator SMITH and my other colleagues, to ensure that this program gets underway quickly and smoothly to begin demonstrating the value of these non-lethal predator control methods.

   Mrs. BOXER. I do not know if the Senator has mentioned this, but it seems to me this Republican Congress wants to take care of the top 2 percent of income earners in this country; and as far as the other 98 percent, they don't seem to care. 
   Why do I say that? Because you have to look at the action. I ask the Senator to again hold up that chart. What is happening here? If you asked the average person in the higher income brackets, who is doing so well in this particular time--thanks to the policies, I would say, of the Clinton-Gore team, supported by those of us in Congress--they don't need to get back $23,000 a year. They are doing extremely well. 
   Does my friend think it is time to take a little of this emotion--I watched the debate when Senator FEINGOLD offered his amendment to exempt estates of any taxes up to $100 million. I thought at least on that point our friends on the other side could join hands with us. But no, the emotion on the other side of the aisle, defending the people, the ``poor'' people who are worth more than $100 million, was so powerful that I only wished we could take a tenth of that emotion and address it to the minimum wage and prescription drugs and good public education. 
   I wonder if my friend noted the strong emotion and feeling on the other side of the aisle when it came to defending and protecting the wealthiest in this country, rather than the 98 percent of the people who need it. Did he take note of that?

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I have no problem with the Bond-Lincoln amendment, but it does nothing. All pesticides that are on the market today are approved by EPA. There are none that are not. This is a sham amendment to kill my underlying amendment, which already passed this Senate 84-14 when I offered it on the Department of Defense Appropriations bill. 
   Simply put, what we are saying is, for preventive and routine application of pesticides in national parks--where children play--don't use the most toxic pesticides, those that are identified by the EPA as known or probable carcinogens, acute nerve toxins or organophosphates, carbamates or organochlorines. EPA has identified these pesticides as those ``which appear to pose the greatest risk to public health.'' In a June 13, 2000 letter, EPA states that it ``strongly supports the goal'' of my amendment. 
   EPA supports what we are trying to do because they have a mission, which is to protect kids. While it's true that the Food Quality Protection Act of 1996 required EPA to ensure that its standards protect children, the fact is, EPA is not implementing this provision consistent with congressional intent. EPA has only applied the ``safety factor'' referred to by my colleague from Arkansas in nine--just nine--of the thousands of cases it has reviewed. EPA is currently being sued because it is not enforcing this important provision. 
   So what we are saying is, for the preventive and routine application, do not use these highly toxic pesticides unless there is an emergency, because children are not adults--they are rapidly growing, they are rapidly changing and they are, as a result, uniquely vulnerable to these toxins. 
   In its report, Pesticides in the Diets of Infants and Children, the National  Academy of Sciences tells us that children are uniquely vulnerable to the exact toxins targeted by my amendment. The NAS also tells us that current EPA standards ``could result in the permanent loss of brain function [in children] if it occurred during prenatal or early childhood period of brain development.'' 
   I am voting for the Bond amendment. And I am coming right back with my first degree amendment to protect children from these dangerous pesticides. 
   I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, this is an important amendment. What we are saying is, for routine pesticide spraying in our national parks where children play and pregnant women are present, that the Park Service should use the least toxic pesticides. In other words, for routine use, don't use pesticides that are known carcinogens, probable carcinogens, or that are toxic to the nervous system. These pesticides are identified by EPA as ``those which pose the greatest risk to public health.'' 
   I would like to place into the RECORD a June 30, 2000 letter from EPA to my colleague Senator BOND where EPA states that fact.

   Mrs. BOXER. Contrary to statements you have heard today, EPA is not opposed to my amendment. 
   Now, the Senate is already on record as voting for this before by a vote of 84-14. I hope we will see that type of a vote today. I just have to say this. There are scare tactics being used that say if there is an emergency, they could not use the highly toxic pesticides targeted by my amendment. Untrue. We have drawn up this amendment in such a way that only applies to the routine, preventive use. So please support us. 
   The children in this country are counting on us to protect them. The National Academy of Sciences has told us that children are vulnerable to the dangers posed by the pesticides targeted by my amendment. Most important, the NAS has told us that current EPA standards don't protect our children from those dangers. At a minimum, we should protect our children. Please vote aye.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I will take but 2 minutes of the Senate's time, given that it is so late this evening. 
   I thank the managers of the legislative appropriations bill for accepting this amendment. I think the Chair would be interested in it as well, given the fact that he is the chairman of the Environment Committee on which I proudly serve. 
   This amendment merely says that we would limit the use of dangerous pesticide spraying here at the Capitol and on the Capitol Grounds where we have so many children and so many families visiting us every year. My amendment prohibits the routine use of highly toxic pesticides. Those are the ones that contain known or probable carcinogens. They are acute nerve toxins and others that contain highly toxic chemicals. 
   We do permit the spraying of such highly toxic chemicals in the rare case of an emergency. If there were a sudden emergency, if there were an outbreak where we needed to go to those highly toxic pesticides, under my amendment we would be allowed to do that. But for routine spraying, we would go to the mildest forms of these pesticides, the ones which are classified by the EPA as having the greatest risk to public health. 
   I could cite studies that show how vulnerable children are to these various compounds. Children are not little adults. They are changing; their bodies are changing. They react very badly to these toxic chemicals. 
   Seven to ten million people visit the Capitol and surrounding buildings every year. A million take guided tours of our historic buildings. We don't know how many of those are children, but just by looking at the crowds, quite a number are. I know in my office alone--and I am sure the Chair has thousands of youngsters visiting in his office--we studied it, and we have visits by over 33,000 school-age children every year. I think by adopting this amendment, we are setting a valuable example here at the Capitol that I hope all the State capitols will follow. We will begin to see that we can in fact control these pests in a way that is much more friendly to our children. 
   In closing, there is a wonderful organization in California named after a beautiful little child who died of environmental causes several years ago. Her parents founded this organization. It is called CHEC, the Children's Health Environmental Coalition. They are the ones, years ago, who got me interested in this area. What we are trying to do on every bill that we can is to set this example and say we won't be using this highly toxic form of controlling pests. Tomorrow I will have a debate with one of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle. I am trying to offer a similar amendment to the Interior bill, but we may get into a bit of a debate then. 
   Tonight is the night for me to say thank you to you, Mr. President, for your indulgence, and to the managers who are here late this evening handling this. I will yield back my time, and I expect we will have a voice vote and I would like to be present for that, if we could do that. 
   I yield back my time and ask that we have a voice vote at this time.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I want to thank the managers of the Legislative Branch Appropriations bill for agreeing to my amendment to limit the use of toxic pesticides on U.S. Capitol buildings and grounds. My amendment prohibits the preventive use of pesticides containing a known or probable carcinogen, a class I or II acute nerve toxin or a pesticide of the organophosphate, carbamate or organocholorine class as identified by the Environmental Protection Agency. Such pesticides could be used, however, in the case of an emergency. 
   Every year, approximately 7 to 10 million people visit the Capitol, many of them children. The National Academy of Sciences has found that children are particularly vulnerable to the harmful effects of toxic pesticides, that current Environmental Protection Agency pesticide standards are not protective of children and that up to 25% percent of childhood learning disabilities may be attributable to a combination of exposure to toxic chemicals like pesticides and genetic factors. My amendment will help protect young visitors to Washington from the harmful effects of toxic pesticides by limiting the use of such pesticides at the U.S. Capitol. 
   Mr. President, I thank the managers for their support and I hope that they will work to ensure that this amendment is preserved in conference. May I inquire of the distinguished Ranking Member of the Subcommittee if she will support the amendment in conference with the House?

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I compliment my friend from Oregon because everything he said speaks for me. 
   I will be brief, but I think it is important that I put some comments into the RECORD because I have a sense that perhaps Senator CRAIG may be back with a similar amendment at another time, and I think it is important to lay the groundwork for why I would not support it at that time. 
   I do support what Senators DOMENICI and BINGAMAN have brought us. I compliment them for bringing this to us. I know they have been very careful not to do anything in this amendment that would, in fact, stop any environmental rules from going forward, in particular the roadless rule that we are in the midst of promulgating. 
   I will be supporting the Domenici-Bingaman amendment. I am pleased in the way it has been presented. It is, in fact, a substitute for the Craig amendment. 
   Let me ask my friend from New Mexico, does he want to have the floor?

   Mrs. BOXER. All right. 
   Mr. President, I have such a good feeling about Interior appropriations bills. My friend, Senator BYRD, and Senator DOMENICI and Senator GORTON have worked hard on this Interior bill. 
   For California it is so important. It is wonderful. I just got a reminder note from Senator BYRD on the wonderful things in this bill, for which I thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle. Funding for the historic Presidio, for Lake Tahoe, so many others, the Manzanar historical site. For those of you who may not remember, it was the site where Japanese-Americans were essentially interned. We are going to make a monument out of it. 
   So when I see an antienvironmental rider come on this beautiful bill, it is always distressing because, to me, the Interior appropriations bill, it seems to me, should be a positive statement of good things that we are doing for the environment.  
   So when I heard a rumor that Senator CRAIG would offer his amendment, I decided at that time I would try to talk the Senate out of adopting it. And this has become unnecessary. 
   So let me quickly say, I am pleased that what is before us does nothing to stop this roadless policy from going into effect. 
   As Senator WYDEN has stated, there have been countless meetings on it. The fact is, the roadless areas are the remaining gems of a forest system that has been degraded by centuries of logging and other types of heavy use. If we look at the big picture, we are really talking only about setting aside 2 percent of all our land in this country as roadless areas. What an important thing that is for us to do because it will in fact preserve our beautiful, priceless environment for future generations and preserve the fishing industry, stop erosion. It is a very important environmental initiative. 
   So there is no misunderstanding, we know there are many inroads into these roadless areas. In the next 5 years alone, we are going to see more than 1,000 miles of roads inventoried. We are moving into these pristine areas. 
   At some point, we have to say enough is enough in terms of destruction of our natural wilderness and our wonderful natural heritage. I think the U.S. Forest Service has taken a bold and positive step forward with its effort. I am very glad that nothing in this bill will stop them. 
   Let me cite a couple of poll numbers. A recent poll done by some pollsters from the other side of the aisle found that 76 percent of the public supports the protection of roadless areas, and in my home State, asking Republicans and Democrats that question, 76 percent of Californians support roadless policies.

   Mrs. BOXER. These editorials are in favor of roadless protections. The two Senators from New Mexico have offered us a great service because they have essentially, by their amendment, stopped us from a very controversial amendment that was antienvironment, that the administration would have been very opposed to, and may well have caused a veto of this bill. I thank them again. 
   I say to my friend from Idaho, Senator CRAIG, I hope he will not bring this back to us. I think it would drive a wedge into the heart of our environmental heritage. I hope that will not happen. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, the Durbin amendment to the fiscal year 2001 Defense authorization bill is a common sense proposal that will ensure that a National Missile Defense system is properly tested before it becomes operational. 
   President Clinton is expected to make a decision in the next few months on whether or not to begin the deployment of a National Missile Defense system. He has said that the decision will be based on four criteria: the readiness of the technology, the impact on arms control and our relations with Russia, the cost of the system, and the threat. Based on these criteria, I do not believe that a decision to deploy should be made at this time. 
   This amendment deals with just one of these criteria, the readiness of the technology. It says that the National Missile Defense system should be tested against realistic decoys and other counter-measures before it becomes operational. Initial operating capability is now scheduled for 2005. 
   Let me be clear, this amendment would not prevent a deployment decision this year, nor would it delay the deployment of the system. 
   Mr. President, this is no different from school. if you cannot pass the exams, you cannot graduate. In this case, if NMD cannot pass a test against realistic counter-measures, it will not be made operational. There will be no social promotion of missile defense. The strategic implications of this system are too great. We do not want to make a system operational that we are not sure will work against an incoming warhead. 
   Now the opponents of this legislation might say: Senator Boxer, this amendment is unnecessary. The U.S. would never make a missile defense system operational that wouldn't work. 
   Well, in 1969 the U.S. made a decision to deploy the Safeguard missile defense system to defend U.S. missile against incoming Soviet missiles. This system would have used Spartan missiles armed with small nuclear warheads to intercept incoming ICBMs. 
   On October 1, 1975, after spending $6 billion (over $20 billion in today's dollars), the first ABM site became operational at Nekoma, North Dakota. Five months later the project was terminated. 
   Why was the project terminated? Because it didn't work. There were at least two major problems with the Safeguard system. First, its radars were vulnerable to destruction by Soviet missiles. Destruction of these radar systems would blind the defensive system. Second it was found that when the nuclear warheads on defending Spartan missiles were detonated, these explosions themselves would also blind the radar systems. You do not have to be a rocket scientist to know that it is important for the system to work before it is made operational. 
   So why is the Senator from Illinois concerned about countermeasures? A September 1999 National Intelligence Estimate warned that emerging missile states would use counter-measures. 
   Let me quote from the unclassified version of the report:  
   Many countries, such as North Korea, Iran, and Iraq would rely initially on readily available technology--including separating warheads, spin-stabilized warheads, warhead reorientation, radar absorbing material, booster fragmentation, low power jammers, chaff, and simple balloon decoys.  
   It goes on to say that ``Russia and China each have developed numerous counter-measures and probably are willing to sell the requisite technology.'' 
   Many of our best scientists have said that the planned NMD system would be defeated by counter-measures. An April 2000 report released jointly by the Union of Concerned Scientists and MIT Security Studies Program found that ``the current testing program is not capable of assessing the system's effectiveness against a realistic attack.'' 
   So Mr. President, this is an important amendment. It would ensure that our NMD system is tested against realistic counter-measures and require detailed reports from the Secretary of Defense and the Independent Review Panel which is headed by retired Air Force General Larry Welch. 
   I congratulate my friend, Senator DURBIN, for offering this important amendment and I urge the Senate to adopt it.

   Mrs. BOXER. I thank my friend for his eloquence on this point. Doesn't it really come down to on whose side are you? For whom do you come here to work? That is what my friend is saying. He is saying that if we did a fair alternative to the Republicans on this estate tax repeal, we can take care of those small family businesses, the farms, the people who have homes and have a lot of investment in them. We can essentially say only the very wealthiest, the ones who, frankly, owe a lot to the greatness of this Nation, the opportunity this Nation provides, their heirs would pay something and they would still wind up with millions and millions of dollars. My colleague is  saying, maybe even with a little bit of courage around here, we could target those funds to those who deserve to have the same shot. 
   I just held in my State of California a very important seminar, which was a learning experience for me, on the cost of child care and the availability of important early education. What I learned is that in California, only one in five kids who need quality child care even has a slot. For four out of five of the kids, there is not even a slot. And if one is lucky enough to have a chance at that slot, does my colleague know what it costs? Almost as much as it does to go to a private college. 
   I applaud my friend and ask him this question: Isn't this motion to proceed really about whose side are we on around here? Are we on the side of the vast majority of the people who get up every day and work hard and want a little attention to their problems--prescription drugs, Patients' Bill of Rights, the things my friend has discussed, quality education, quality child care--or those who earn in the billions, and I say billions because that is really who is going to be impacted by this repeal. I ask my friend that question.

   Mrs. BOXER. One of our colleagues was saying he was visited by an extremely successful gentleman who was worth in the hundreds of millions of dollars, perhaps as much as $1 billion. The gentleman was discussing with this particular Senator this repeal of the estate tax for the wealthiest in our Nation, for the billionaires, if you will, for the most wealthy among us. This very wealthy person was making the point that he was not for this repeal for the very wealthy. 
   He said we could fix it for some of the family farmers, the small businesses, with which, by the way, Democrats on the whole have agreed. But he said: Do you know how I made my money? A lot of people have worked for me. He said: Those people have worked really hard for me. They didn't grow up to be millionaires. They got up every day, and they worked for my business. He said, in a sense, if his children had to pay some of the inheritance back, and we took the funds here and put them into education and job training and health care and prescription drugs, he would feel pretty good about it. 
   Now, granted, this is a type of a person you do not run into that often. Most people are not that selfless. But I think that gentleman really put it out there for us to contemplate. 
   This is the greatest nation in the world. With a good idea, people can come up from poverty and they can make it to the top. Their heirs perhaps may not be that hard working, but maybe they are. But the fact is, this gentleman has focused on this, to say to this great country: I want to see it continue to be great. There is a notion about that, that this gentleman, I believe, has focused upon. 
   I offer that up to my friend because he points out how much work we have to do for ordinary people who get up  and face problems every day. It seems to me to be a very small price to pay, for very few people at the very top who have, in a sense, made it mostly because of these hard-working people, that their estates give back a little bit to this great country to defend itself, to be able to afford to educate its young, et cetera. I want my friend to just comment on that.

   Mrs. BOXER. Thank you very much. 
   Mr. President, I hope people have been listening to this debate today because, frankly, I think it has been an important one so far. There are many people who are students of politics, and sometimes they get lost in what one party stands for versus what another party stands for. I think when you listen to these debates on the floor, many times you won't get the differences. But I think today you will get the differences between the parties. I think that is important. Regardless of what side you agree with, I think you need to know where people stand. 
   One of the absolute rights of the majority in the Senate--regardless of whether it is Republicans in charge, which is what we have now, or the Democrats, which we had when I first arrived here--is that the leaders have the very strong ability to set the agenda. That is one of the good things you get when you are in the leadership. You get to decide what you want to come to the floor. You get to take a look at the array of issues with which we deal, whether it is education or the environment or whether it is our children or our elderly or prescription drug benefits or Patients' Bill of Rights or pro-business legislation--whatever it is that you believe are the most important things. You get to decide which one of those things should come before the Senate. 
   As our majority leader has said many times, we are pressed for time. We have very few days remaining in this legislative agenda. We are in an election year. In many ways that limits our ability because of the press of time and the need to go to conventions, et cetera. 
   I think what this majority chooses to bring before us says a lot about who they are, whose side they are on, and in what they believe. The way my side of the aisle--the Democratic side of the aisle--responds to that agenda says a lot about who we are, whose side we are on, what we believe in, and for what we are going to fight. Today is a perfect day to draw the contrast. 
   Senator LOTT has chosen to put before us a repeal of the estate tax. I think you need to look at what that really means. What does it cost us in hard, cold dollars to repeal the estate tax? The answer is almost $1 trillion over 20 years. 
   Who in our society benefits from this repeal? What else could we do with that money if we decided to put this particular issue perhaps a little bit lower down on the priority list? 
   Once you look at all of these questions, I believe you will get a clear distinction of where the Democratic  Party is and where the Republican Party is. I think that is good. You may come out supporting the Democratic Party, thinking they are on your side, or you may come out supporting the Republican Party and say they are on your side. That is what politics is all about. That is what debating is all about. But most important to me is that there are these defining differences and there is one of those defining differences. 
   Senator BURNS spoke about how repealing the estate tax is going to help ordinary Americans, and how important it is to help ordinary Americans. 
   I say to him that if he looks at the estate tax today, there are some inequities we can fix, and that we should fix that deal with family farms and smaller businesses and individuals. But to repeal the entire estate tax is helping those at the very top of the ladder. When I say top of the ladder, I mean those earning hundreds of millions of dollars and whose estates are worth hundreds of millions of dollars--perhaps into the billions of dollars. 
   If that is considered helping the ordinary person, then I guess I don't get it because when I travel around my State, the ordinary people and the average person are working really hard every day. Do you know what they are bringing home? They are bringing home $30,000 a year, $40,000 a year. And in California where we have to earn more, we have couples working. If they really do well, they may bring in $60,000, $70,000, or $80,000 a year. They are struggling at that range to buy a home. They are struggling at that range to find child care that is affordable and that is quality. They are struggling to help their parents meet their medical bills, yes, their pharmaceutical costs or perhaps long-term care or college tuition. They are struggling. 
   I say to my friends on the other side of the aisle that to couch this repeal of the estate tax as helping the average person is terribly misleading. Let me tell you why. 
   Right now, we have an estate tax that essentially says to a couple: You are exempted if you are worth up to about $1 million. It is exactly $1.2 million. You are exempt. There is an argument to be made that is not high enough given the value of housing, and so on. I can see why that ought to be raised. 
   The Democrats have an alternative. We raise it to $4 million for a couple so that in the future, children of couples who leave an estate of $4 million would have to pay nothing but only under $4 million. Do you know how many estates? That is a very small number of estates. Probably a percent and a half or so. 
   We say to farmers and small businesses: Yes, we understand the problem. We are going to increase the exemption for you from $2.6 million for a couple to $8 million per couple by 2010. So we are saying that to the small farmer and the businesspeople who for $8 million or less there is no estate taxes. Yes, it is going to cost something for our proposal, if we were offering it, because right now we haven't even gotten an agreement from the majority that we can offer our alternative. But it would cost $61 billion over 10 years compared to $105 billion over 10 years on the Republican side. It would cost over the next 10 years $300 billion compared to $750 billion. 
   The interesting thing is in our plan we essentially exempt almost everybody, except the very tiptop of the wealth scale. Yes, the Donald Trumps, the Leona Helmsleys, the Bill Gates of the world, who did so well in this the greatest country of all. Yes, their heirs may have to pay something to help the people who want the same chance they had. Because what do we do with the estate tax? It goes into defending our country. It goes into educating our people. It goes into health research to find a cure for Alzheimer's. The people at the very top of the ladder who I talk to say: You know, BARBARA, you have a lot of work to do. One of them isn't worrying about me. I am good. I am OK. My heirs can pay a little bit. It is OK. 
   But what do the Republicans do? They want to repeal the estate tax--not just for the small family farms, as we want to, and the small businesses and make sure that if they are worth $8 million they don't have to pay anything. They want to protect the people who are worth $10 million, $12 million, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 100, 200. Do I hear more? Yes, I do because there is no top. If you are worth $1 billion, your estate doesn't have to pay anything under their proposal. 
   To stand here and say that is protecting ordinary people--the average American--is just not true. I would prefer, if this was an honest statement, to say that we are going to help the richest people in this country because that is what they are doing. That is what they are doing. 
   This is an honest statement: Helping the richest people in this country who are worth $1 billion, $2 billion. You name it; there is no cap. To do that, it will cost $850 billion over the next 20 years. 
   We can fix the problem with the estate tax for less than half of that, and we can do some wonderful things with the rest of the funds that we save. What can we do? Why don't we look at the Tax Code. Why don't we understand that people who send kids to college have a very big expense. They could use a little help with a tax deduction or a tax credit. 
   I held a hearing on the crisis in quality child care. In California today--and I assume it is similar in Nevada--for every five kids who need quality child care, only one can get a slot. It is so expensive that people are saying they have to choose between paying their mortgage late and being assessed a late fee and paying child care.

   Mrs. BOXER. The Senator is absolutely correct. My friend is right. We tried so desperately in this Senate to simply get the funding for afterschool care up to the President's level. We failed. 
   Where were my friends who say they are fighting to repeal the estate tax, to help ordinary people? Where were they when I had a chance to take another million kids off the waiting list and put them into afterschool care so they wouldn't join gangs? They could not find the funds for that. 
   That is why I think this debate we are having today, I say to my assistant Democratic leader, is so important. It is all about priorities. The other side gets the chance to set the agenda. They overlook the people who need child care. They overlook the people who need afterschool. They do not want to do school construction. They do not want smaller class sizes. They do not want a real Patients' Bill of Rights. They do not want a guaranteed prescription drug benefit. Any don't even look at other tax breaks that are going to help people who send their kids to college with a tuition tax break. 
   They come out here, with their hearts full, and fight for the wealthiest people in this country. It is a fact.

   Mrs. BOXER. Initially, it was little. Now we are simply asking for the President's level, which would be a couple hundred million dollars. I say to my friend, it is a lot less than this bill loses over the 20-year period.

   Mrs. BOXER. I was not aware it was 84 percent, but my friend has been a leader on the whole issue of dropouts. His point is well taken. 
   We are looking at $850 billion over the next 20 years, just 
   on this tax break, and they have others they will come up with, that are not capped, also, that will give to the top people. Yet they don't want to spend money on what will really make our society strong. 
   The point the Senator makes is so correct because I remember in the days I was in the House with the Senator, tracking the costs of a high school dropout to society every year. It was hundreds of millions of dollars in the course of their lifetime. 
   The Senator is exactly right, if we are talking about crime, if we are talking about drug abuse, if we are talking about alcohol abuse, if we are talking about people who are not productive, who cannot hold down jobs, who feel undervalued because they don't have a high school education. These are the competing priorities. 
   It amazes me how our friends can come with so much passion for the Donald Trumps, for the Leona Helmsleys, for the people who make all this money, and not have even a speck of compassion, it seems to me, for ordinary people.

   We are only talking about extremely large estates and a tiny percentage of people in this country. It is in the hundreds, really, who will wind up paying any type of estate tax--only those who have made it so big that, yes, maybe they can just give back a little bit to this country to pay for the defense of this country.

   Mrs. BOXER. That is what we are essentially saying. We really are saying that. That is why I say the question, whose side are you on, is very relevant to this debate. 
   We recognize the fact there has been inflation. We need to take another look at this estate tax. We are willing to make sure we help our family farmers. We want to help our small businesses. We want to help our individuals so their kids do not find themselves in a bind when they inherit the wealth from their families. We are willing to do that. We know President Clinton is willing to sign such a bill. We know he is going to veto the Republican version because he believes it is unfair to the middle class. He believes it is unfair. 
   What we are saying is we can take care of the problem and help those who have kids in college or who have kids in day care. We can give a prescription drug benefit that is guaranteed through Medicare to our seniors. We can do all these things and still have enough to do some debt reduction and a little bit for afterschool programs. That is how expensive this repeal is.

   Mrs. BOXER. I answer that question in this way: I was 
   discussing with another Senator a conversation he had with a very wealthy man who had made hundreds of millions, perhaps billions, of dollars, in the course of his lifetime in this country. Maybe this person is unusually kind and good hearted. 
   This person was saying to him: This great country made it possible for me to have this kind of accumulation of wealth, which is far beyond what any of my heirs need to have. 
   He can take care of his heirs for generations to come. 
   He said: But I have to admit that I earned all this money because a lot of folks worked for me, and those people got up every day. They did not become millionaires, but they did fine, and I want to make sure that, yes, I can help their kids. 
   That is what happens with an estate tax. How do we spend it? We defend the country for those kids. We help with  education. We help with health research. We may find the cure for Alzheimer's for one of Bill Gates' future generations because of the funds we are able to put into health research. 
   Our friends on the other side of the aisle, in the name of helping ordinary people, are ignoring the fact that the Democratic alternative--which at this point we do not have permission to offer but I am very hopeful we will get that chance; it would be wonderful; they can support our alternative. They can ease the burden on the small family farms. They can ease the burden on the small businesses. They can ease the burden on couples who have accumulated wealth through, say, buying a house, for example, which went up greatly in value, such as they have in California. I do not want those kids to have to sell the home. That is why I am supporting the Democratic alternative. 
   We have an excellent alternative that costs less than half of what theirs does and allows us to help people pay for college. It will help grandmas and grandpas get prescription drugs. If our friends on the other side of the aisle really want a bill to become law, they should join hands with us because President Clinton said he will sign that bill. He will not sign the bill that he believes is helping people who are worth billions of dollars.

   Mrs. BOXER. There is no doubt about it. If you define wealthy as $5 million, $6 million, $7 million, you are not going to have to pay anything if you are handing down a business, and up to $4 million for just the normal family exemption. 
   I say to my friend, another point I think we have not made strongly enough is that it is estimated by people on the Finance Committee that the Republican plan could discourage $250 billion 
   in charitable contributions over 10 years. Why is that? We know people look at their estate planning and they look at different ways they are going to handle it. They say: OK, I will give so much to Uncle Sam, but I also want to give some to my favorite charities. 
   The charities are up in arms about this. My friends on the other side of the aisle are often saying how important the role of charities are, and they are right; they are very important. Yet we have estimates that say the drain on charitable pursuits could go down $250 billion. That is not good news for those folks out there who run the community symphonies and the ballets and the various nonprofits. 
   If we proceed with the Democratic alternative, we will be easing the burden on the people who need the burden eased; it is costing less than half of what the Republican plan will cost; it is saying to the wealthiest among us--and I am talking about the superwealthiest, as my friends put it--we want you to do well, but we know you understand the facts of life which are if we take this kind of money out of the Federal Government, we cannot do enough for our child care tax credits and for our afterschool programs. We cannot do enough for those in the middle class who are sending their kids to college. That costs a lot. 
   The fact is, we have other things we can do that can bring much more relief to ordinary, average American families. 
   I am going to close the way I opened, and that is to reiterate that I think this debate today has been a very important debate. It is true we are taking some time here, but many times people complain they do not see the differences between the parties; they do not understand what we stand for. 
   If they did nothing more than to look at the Democratic alternative, which cures a problem but is fair in its reach, if they did nothing more than take a look at the things that we still need to do, the unfinished business around here, to help our people--if I have to hear one more story about a patient in California who tells me that she cannot afford her prescription drugs, when I know we have the resources; just look at the Republican proposal--if you just exempted those who need it, you would have enough left over to take care of the grandma and the grandpa and the person sending their kid to college and the person struggling to pay for child care; we would have enough to do the things we need to do. 
   I hope the American people will take heed of this debate because in the end it is whose side are you on. I think at the end of the debate they can truly answer the question: Whose side are the Republicans on? The Donald Trumps, the Leona HELMSleys. Whose side are the Democrats on? Ordinary working, middle-class families are who we want to help. 
   I yield to my friend for a question.

   Mrs. BOXER. Exactly right. We are simply looking at the wealthy people, who we believe are not being treated fairly because perhaps their wealth is tied up in a family farm, in a small business, in a private home, and we say, fair enough, we do not want to see your family be forced to sell these assets. We do not want that to happen. In our alternative, we take care of this. But we do it in a way that is fiscally responsible, that leaves enough to take care of the pressing needs of our people, which everybody seems to think we have--prescription drugs, afterschool care, making sure that our kids get a decent quality education. Frankly, if we can just be moderate in our approach, we can do all of those things and come out on the side of ordinary Americans and be proud of ourselves. 
   I only hope that as this debate moves forward, the Democrats have a right to offer our alternative, and that some of our friends on the other side of the aisle will recognize that if they join with us, we will have a bill that is fair, that is good, that can take care of our other needs, and that the President will sign into law. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

    Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, last March, the Senate passed an amendment I offered to the Education Savings Accounts bill that said schools receiving federal funds must notify parents prior to the application of toxic pesticides on school buildings and grounds. It also required the distribution of the Environmental Protection Agency's manual that guides schools in establishing a least toxic pesticide policy. 
   I offered that amendment for a simple reason. Toxic pesticides hurt our kids, and that hurts the education of our kids. The National Academy of Sciences has found that up to 25 percent of childhood learning disabilities may be attributable to a combination of exposure to toxic chemicals like pesticides and genetic factors. Yet, current EPA pesticide standards are not protective of children, and schools across America--where our children spend 6 or 7 or more hours a day--routinely use toxic pesticides. My amendment sought to lessen the impact of toxic pesticides on our children by urging schools to use the kinds of products that will harm children the least and to let parents know when toxic pesticides are going to be used. 
   Again, my amendment was added to the Education Savings Accounts bill. However, that bill has not gone anywhere since the Senate passed it on March 2. I could offer my amendment to the Elementary and Secondary Education Act bill, but it, too, appears dead. 
   So, I drafted an amendment to the Labor-HHS Appropriations bill to provide $100,000 for the Department of Education, in conjunction with the Environmental Protection Agency, to encourage school districts across the country to establish a least toxic pesticide policy--which is the policy in several school districts in California--and to notify parents prior to the use on school grounds of pesticides that the EPA has identified as a known or probable carcinogen, a category I or II acute nerve toxin, or a pesticide of the organophosphate, carbamate, or organochlorine class. 
   At the suggestion of my friend from Iowa, the Ranking Member of the Labor-HHS Appropriations Subcommittee, I will not offer that amendment because I understand that the managers will work to add language in the conference report that would accomplish the same thing. May I ask the Chairman and Ranking Member if that is correct?

As he has done each weekday for the past quarter century, Jim will read and comment on the news, tell a few stories, and take listeners' calls. He will help his audience start their day in a good mood, armed with good information about the world. 
   For 37 years, Jim Dunbar has served KGO and the people of the Bay Area with dignity, intelligence, and good humor. He blends solid reporting with amiable companionship without compromising either his journalist's integrity or his personal charm. He gives his listeners a good morning and his profession a good name. 
   Speaking as one of his many listeners, I must add the one piece of sad news in this story: Although Jim Dunbar will still contribute radio essays and special reports for KGO, July 14 will be his last morning show. Like thousands of others, I will miss Jim Dunbar in the morning, and I wish him all the best in his future endeavors.

    Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, when discussing the profound effect of California's Silicon Valley on our Nation's economy, we too often focus on just the raw numbers: staggering revenues, high profile IPOs and the bottom line. 
   Today, I want to focus on an outstanding example of good corporate citizenship in Silicon Valley intended to promote home ownership and honor teachers at the same time. 
   As many of my colleagues know, the Silicon Valley is in the midst of a housing crisis which makes owning a home an impossibility for most teachers. The region's high cost of living makes it extremely difficult to recruit and retain talented teachers. 
   Today, I am pleased to inform the Senate that Intel Corporation and the Santa Clara Unified School District have joined forces to create an innovative pilot program designed to help public school teachers buy homes in one of the country's most expensive housing markets: the Intel Teacher Housing Fund. 
   Under this new program, which will be administered by the Santa Clara County Unified School District, Intel will provide the fund with $1.25 million over the next five years. Eligible teachers will receive $500 each month from the fund to help with mortgage payments, for up to five years. 
   I applaud Intel's leadership in forging the much-needed local partnerships that will help lead to solutions to Silicon Valley's affordable housing crunch. It is my hope that other companies will follow Intel's lead, and show the world that America's high-technology firms are the hub and the heart of the 21st century economy.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I thank the managers of this legislation on both sides for agreeing to this. It isn't everything I had asked for regarding tuberculosis and the HIV/AIDS fight, but it is helpful. It will also take into consideration Senator FEINGOLD's request on the flooding in Mozambique. It will give an additional $30 million for the worldwide fight against HIV/AIDS, an additional $10 million for the worldwide fight against tuberculosis, and $10 million for the flooding in Mozambique. I am proud that Senators FEINGOLD, LEAHY, DURBIN, DODD, and KERRY are sponsors of this amendment. 
   I want to take a moment of the Senate's time, because we won't need to have a rollcall on this, to simply say that if we are looking at a true emergency, we have one here. The U.N. Security Council met on the issue of HIV, and it was the first time the Security Council ever met on an international health issue. 
   Last month, our own National Security Council declared that the global spread of AIDS is a direct threat to U.S. national security because of the destabilizing impact of this deadly disease. 
   One of the reasons they so found was that the CIA did something they call the National Intelligence Estimate. They titled it ``The Global Infectious Disease Threat and Its Implications for the United States.'' I am simply going to read a tiny bit from this report.  
   New and reemerging infectious diseases will pose a rising global health threat and compromise U.S. and global security over the next 20 years. These diseases will endanger United States citizens at home and abroad, threaten U.S. Armed Forces deployed overseas, and exacerbate social and political instability and keep countries and regions in which the United States has significant interest.  
   I know that my colleagues are very aware of the horrific problem of AIDS in Africa, particularly sub-Saharan Africa. Mr. President, 84 percent of all the people in the world who have died of AIDS have been from that region. It is now predominantly a women's disease. Many children are left as orphans. 
   Lastly, as far as tuberculosis is concerned, this is a disease we thought we had eliminated in the 1950s. However, the disease is making a comeback. The World Health Organization estimates that nearly 2 million people die of tuberculosis-related conditions annually. One-third of the entire world's population is infected with tuberculosis--an extraordinary number when you think about it. 
   I am pleased we have this amendment and it is in agreement. I trust and hope and pray for the sake of people all across this world and in our own Nation that these numbers will hold up in the conference. Believe me, it means so much. We know how to treat tuberculosis. We know how to stop HIV transmission from 
   mother to child. It would be a real sin, it seems to me, if we didn't push as hard as we could to fight these diseases. 
   I yield to the Senator from Minnesota.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, after I make just an opening remark, I will yield 5 minutes to my distinguished colleague from Vermont. 
   I am offering an amendment which is completely consistent with the Department of Defense guidelines on the activities of their own personnel in Colombia. It actually says that we support these guidelines, we think it is good to put limits on our involvement, and we should express ourselves on that point. 
   The first part of the amendment supports the prohibition of the DOD using its personnel, equipment, or other resources to get involved in the counterinsurgency; in other words, to get involved in what some call the civil war between the left and the right in that country. 
   Again, written by the Secretary of Defense in March 2000:   
   I am directing that no DOD personnel, funds, equipment, or resources may be used to support any training program that engages solely in counterinsurgency operations.  
   That supports that DOD guideline. 
   The same thing occurs on the second part of my amendment; that we support the fact they shouldn't be involved, our own personnel, in law enforcement activities in Colombia. Again, that mirrors the position of our Secretary of Defense. 
   The third part of the amendment says we agree with the Secretaries that our personnel shouldn't conduct any counterdrug field operation in which counterdrug-related hostilities are imminent. That is to protect our people from harm. 
   Finally, we say we agree with the Secretary of Defense that U.S. military personnel should make every effort to minimize the possibility of confrontations with civilians. 
   Clearly, what we should do here is support our own Secretary of Defense and our own administration. I don't think it should be controversial. 
   I am hopeful it can be accepted because I believe we ought to go on record in support of these limits. I think it is sensible. I think the DOD is correct on this. 
   Yesterday, we voted millions and millions of dollars to send advisers. I think it would be wonderful if we stood with our own DOD and said there ought to be limits on the participation of our own personnel. 
   I yield 5 minutes to my friend from Vermont.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am deeply distressed that the Senator from Alaska raised a point of order. I want to explain why. 
   Yesterday we voted for almost $1 billion to get involved in a very serious problem in Colombia. Our people will be exposed to a lot of danger there. All we are simply trying to do with this sense-of-the-Senate amendment is to protect them. Further, all we are trying to do is say to Secretary Cohen: You are right on your guidelines that you have issued. And those guidelines simply say our people should not be involved in counterinsurgency, that our people should not be in the line of hostile fire. It is very straightforward, and it is very simple. 
   Frankly, the way the Senate has responded to this shows me I did the right thing when I never voted for this in the first place. If we cannot stand up in the Senate and support the Secretary of Defense in his very straightforward directive, then I am very concerned about what we are getting ourselves into. I hope I am wrong. 
   I am distressed the Senator from Alaska did this. When Senator SESSIONS from Alabama, from his side of the aisle, offered legislation on an appropriations bill yesterday, no one said the amendment of the Senator from Alabama, which dealt with this very same subject, was legislation on an appropriations bill. I do not think it is fair to have a double standard. If we are going to use that rule, we ought to use it. 
   I did not like Senator Sessions' amendment yesterday. Frankly, I viewed it as a way to get us far more  involved in the counterinsurgency, but I did not make a point of order. The 
   fact the Senator did this is distressing. 
   I am not going to ask for a vote on a procedural motion because that would not even be close to the kind of vote I think I could get on this sense-of-the-Senate amendment. That is what I fear is happening. People do not seem to want to vote on the sense-of-the-Senate amendment. It is not fair.

   Mrs. BOXER. I thank my friend. I believe it is not fair play, and if there is one thing I expect in the Senate--and I think we all stand for it--it is fair play. We voted huge amounts of money into this region of the world. We have horrible problems there. We have a few disagreements here, but I had hoped we could agree that the Secretary of Defense is correct when he puts limits on the use of DOD personnel. 
   I am very saddened by this. I do not want to keep repeating it, but it is sad. The people in this country are going to be upset about it. The people in this country, when we get involved in a foreign place, want to know that we in the Senate put restrictions on the use of our personnel. 
   We have had a lot of experience in this. We have had a lot of tears over this. Yet yesterday we had an amendment from Senator SESSIONS that was clearly legislation on an appropriations bill, which I believe gets us deeper involved because it says we should support the military and the political policies of the Government of Colombia, and no one raised a point of order. But a simple amendment supporting the Secretary of Defense, and where are we? We get a point of order. 
   I am not going to play that game. I am not going to get caught in a procedural vote. I will just let it go, but I want to make it clear that we have a lot of options later when this bill comes back. If there are going to be things in this bill that violate our parliamentary procedures, some of us are going to get tough on it. It is not right. 
   This is a sad day, frankly, for this Senate. It is also a sad day for our men and women in uniform that we cannot vote on a simple sense of the Senate supporting our own Secretary of Defense on his views as to how we can, in fact, make sure our people over there are as safe as they can be. 
   I thank the Chair. I have no need to retain any further time. We will await the decision of the Senator from Alaska.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today I voted for S. 2522, the Senate version of the Fiscal Year 2001 Foreign Operations Appropriations Act. I voted for the bill despite serious reservations about parts of it because it also funds some very important priorities. 
   First, the bill provides economic and military assistance to some of America's most important allies, at the level requested by the President. 
   The bill includes $450 million for international family planning programs, less than requested by the President but more than last year.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, listening to the Senator from Delaware, one would think the Wellstone amendment is taking away all the funding from Colombia. Nothing could be further from the truth. 
   The Senator from Minnesota is leaving in place the funding for Colombia; that makes good sense. Here is what is left in this bill after the Senator's amendment: Funding for interdiction; funding for the Colombia police; funds for alternative development and internally displaced people; funds for human rights; funds for regional assistance; funds to rehabilitate soldiers under the age of 18 who have been involved in armed conflict. 
   The only thing the Senator from Minnesota is doing in his amendment is making sure this country doesn't get involved in a conflict that could hurt our people eventually. The Senator from Minnesota is saying we are going to help President Pastrana, we will help this country, we will help this region, but we are not going to get involved with the military. 
   I thank the Senator from the bottom of my heart for this amendment. I don't care if the Senator gets 2 votes or 22 votes; he is doing the right thing. 
   I clearly understand the threat that illegal drugs pose to our country, to my State of California, and I clearly understand that Colombia is a major supplier of the cocaine and heroin that reach our shores. But let me tell my friends in the Senate, we need a balanced approach to this horrible problem of drug abuse. You could have a big supply, but if no one wanted to buy it, it would not hurt anyone. The fact is, the people in this country want to buy it. And there is not 1 cent in this bill, out of $1 billion--not 1 cent to help us with education, treatment on demand, prevention. This is a lost opportunity. What my friend from Minnesota is saying is, if we in this Chamber are sincere  about fighting drugs, and a war on drugs, then we do not put $1 billion into a foreign country and ignore what is happening here at home. 
   Let me tell you what happens in California and all over this country when someone is arrested for a violent crime. Mr. President, 50 percent to 75 percent of those perpetrators of this violence are high on drugs. I cannot tell you how many times when I have been in my State--maybe it is because my State is a large State--that I have someone come up to me, a parent, saying: I have a son or a daughter who wants to get off drugs; there is no room in a treatment center; we don't have money; we have to spend a lot of money; what are we going to do? 
   I look at that person and all I can say is: Send me a letter and let me see if we can help you find some treatment program that might have a slot. 
   Does it make sense to spend $1 billion, as this bill does, and ignore the emergency here at home? We are so quick to find the money to send somewhere else, but what about our people who are ready, perhaps, to take that step to get off drugs? Telling them they have to wait 6 months to get into a program is consigning them to more months of addiction. What happens if we can stop this whole thing before it starts, with education, with prevention? I do not quite understand the enthusiasm for a bill that does not spend a penny here at home. 
   My friend from Delaware is as eloquent as anyone on this floor. He says, ``Yes, we are spending more.'' Yes, we are spending more in our regular appropriation, but if we are facing such a horrible emergency that we have to go in, with $1 billion, I have to say to my friend, why can't we see this emergency here at home, when people cannot get treatment on demand? You don't have a sale if you don't have a willing buyer. Unfortunately, the addicts are here, in this country.

   Mrs. BOXER. I will be glad to answer it. Because this is $1 billion to deal with the drug problem specifically. That is the point of it. The Senator made that point. The Senator from Illinois made that point. This is money that we are spending because we are stunned at the drug trafficking that is going on--and we should be. All the Senator from Minnesota is saying in his amendment, which I am proud to support, is we will leave 75 percent of that money intact to do the things we want to do to help the good President of Colombia. But all we are saying is before we get our advisers caught in a situation over there--you know, you may be right. Maybe nothing will ever go 
   wrong with it. But all we are saying is, how about fighting a drug war here at home for a change instead of always spending the money outside of this country?

   Mrs. BOXER. Again, I represent the largest State in the Union. My friend represents a smaller State. I would just say, maybe it is my State, but when I see these figures coming back--and my friend is a leader in the whole issue of crime prevention and being tough on crime and all the rest, and he knows it is true that if you look at the arrests for violent crime in our country--I could say particularly in California, 50 to 75 percent of the perpetrators are high on drugs. So all my friend from Minnesota is saying in his amendment is everything the Senator said about President Pastrana, everything he said about the need to help his country--I don't argue with that. That is why I am proud of this amendment. Everything is left in except getting us involved in this counternarcotics insurgency, which may well put us in a situation where we find ourselves between two bad actors: the FARC on the one hand, with a horrible story of violence and human rights violations, and the paramilitary on the right-hand side here, with the same horrible record. Unfortunately, it ties to the military in Colombia. 
   So here we are, giving us a chance to do all the good things in this appropriations bill that we are happy are in 
   there, but to take out the one for $225 million, that could lead us into trouble. 
   Here is the Boston Globe. They talk about targeting addiction. They say:  
   The Clinton proposal for U.S. intervention in Colombia's Civil War----  
   And that is what is being supported on this floor. They say it really isn't going to work. They finish saying:  
   History suggests that increased funding for treatment of addicts and programs for prevention--treatment on demand for drugs--can accomplish more to ameliorate the individual and social pathology associated with the endless war on drugs.  
   This is the Boston Globe. We have a number of editorials that are very strong on this point. 
   This is the St. Petersburg Times. We have these from all over the country:  
   Have we forgotten the lessons of our involvement in Central America in the 1980s .....?  
   They talk about the fact:  
   In an attempt to contain communism, our government provided support to right-wing governments and paramilitary groups that used the aid to slaughter thousands of innocent civilians. This time, America's stated public interest is stopping drug trafficking.  
   But, it says:  
   It could, however, draw us into a brutal civil war in which civilians are a target.  
   This would be a tragedy if we repeated that kind of scenario. We have to learn from history. I think the amendment of the Senator is protecting us from just this problem.  
   Washington should have learned long ago that partnership with an abusive and ineffective Latin American military rarely produces positive results and often undermines democracy in the region.  
   That is from the New York Times. It talks about the fact that President Pastrana is well intentioned, but all of the programs he faces, we are going to be faced with them as well. 
   Then, from the Detroit News:  
   Colombia: The Next Quagmire? 
   The Clinton Administration's proposed aid package intends to break the choke hold of the guerrillas by training and arming Colombia's military. The hope is that returning control to a legitimate government will help curb the illegitimate narcotrade. But this is a naive hope that ignores the other half of Colombia's gritty ground reality. The military is a corrupt institution with close links to the outlawed paramilitary groups that control the drug trade in urban areas.  
   It goes on. This is not Senator BOXER speaking or Senator WELLSTONE. These are editorial boards from all over the country.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator.  
   I will continue reading from some of these editorials. These are newspapers that have very different editorial policies, usually, from one another. 
   The Sacramento Bee:  
   A larger problem is that U.S. aid is meant to target only Colombia's narcotics traffickers, not a 35-year-old leftist insurgency. Yet the two have become virtually indistinguishable as guerrillas extort tribute from coca growers and traffic in drugs as well. ..... 
   The Pentagon insists that U.S. combat troops will not be used in Colombia.  
   The newspaper says that is good.  
   But Americans have heard that before, about Vietnam, and rebels say they regard U.S. advisers as targets.  
   We have the rebel groups already saying U.S. advisers will be targeted. 
   This is what the Sacramento Bee says. I associate myself with their conclusion:  
   While it may be premature to sound an alarm, it's not too early to begin a debate about U.S. interests in a conflict that has at least the potential to suck Americans into another quagmire. Congress and the administration owe it to the country to clarify what's at stake, what is contemplated and what is not, and the sooner the better.

   Since Columbine, thousands of Americans have been killed by gunfire. Until we act, Democrats in the Senate will read some of the names of those who lost their lives to gun violence in the past year, and we will continue to do so every day that the Senate is session. 
   In the name of those who died, we will continue this fight. Following are the names of some of the people who were killed by gunfire one year ago today, June 21, 1999.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I thank Senator MURRAY for giving me these 10 minutes. I compliment her and Senator SNOWE for once again bringing this matter to the Senate. We have had very close votes. I believe, if people listened to the arguments on both sides, they would come down in favor of the Murray-Snowe amendment. I want to say why. 
   The Murray-Snowe amendment will repeal the law which says to servicewomen and military dependents who are stationed overseas that they are less than full American citizens; that they, in fact, no longer have the protections of the Constitution; and that, in fact, they do not deserve the full measure of that protection. 
   I don't want to overstate this, but I think it is almost unpatriotic to take the view that a woman who gives her life to her country every single day would be denied a right that every other woman has. No other woman in America is told: Talk to your boss about the problem you've got yourself into. Get his permission. 
   I say to my colleague from Arkansas, who says some of the commanding officers are women, I suppose about 2 percent are women. But that is not the point. Whether it is a man or a woman, no one else in America has to go get permission from their employer to get a safe abortion. 
   With all due respect to Senator BROWNBACK, who says this is about protecting the unborn, this is not about protecting the unborn. This is about protecting the rights of American women, who happen to be in the military, to have the same constitutional protections as any other woman. If we want to discuss the issue of whether a woman should have the right to choose, that is another conversation for another day or perhaps for another Supreme Court, which has upheld a woman's right to choose time and time and time again since 1973. Even Justices who were appointed by Republican Presidents have done so. So although my friends want to make this issue about the rights of the unborn, that is not what this is about. This is about making it difficult and really, in many ways, dangerous for women in the military to exercise their right to choose. I think that is a rather sick thing to do, if you want to know the truth. 
   How would you like to be a woman who finds herself with this unwanted pregnancy? She may decide to go to full term. That is her choice. She may choose that. But what if she doesn't? Now she is faced with a situation where she has to go to her boss and beg to get on a cargo plane--when there is a seat available, I might say. 
   So Senator TORRICELLI is right in his point; such could delay this procedure until it was more dangerous to her health, or she could choose not to be humiliated, embarrassed, and the rest, and go to an unsafe place in a country that may well be hostile to her, try to understand what the doctors and the nurses are saying, and subject herself to a dangerous situation. Why? Why would my colleagues want to do that to women in the military? 
   With all due respect to my colleagues, I do not doubt their sincerity. But for them to stand up and say that the DOD really doesn't know how to allocate these costs so Senator MURRAY is wrong on this point, Senator SNOWE is wrong on this point; we can't figure out really what this costs, that simply flies in the face of experience. 
   For many years, this is what had been done. It was no problem getting the women to pay their fair share of the costs associated with an abortion, a safe and legal abortion in a safe military hospital. 
   In the Murray amendment, no one is forced to be involved in this procedure if they have an objection based on conscience. 
   We have covered all the bases, if you will. I don't care who stands up here and waves a piece of paper and says they can't figure out what it costs. The military supports the Murray-Snowe amendment. 
   I will repeat that. The U.S. Department of Defense supports the Murray-Snowe amendment. Why? Because they care about the people in the military. They are advocates for people in the military. They do not think you should give up your rights because you put your life on the line for your country. On the contrary. They want to thank the women in the military for putting their lives on the line, and one way to do it is to ensure they will share in the benefits of this Nation, which include being protected by the Constitution of the United States of America. 
   The Supreme Court decision that occurred in 1973, which many of my colleagues do not like--Senator HARKIN and I had a very clear-cut amendment upholding the Supreme Court decision of 1973. We got 51 votes. Roe v. Wade got a 51-vote majority in the Senate, but it is hanging by a thread. And this attempt in this bill, which the majority side of the aisle supports, to stop women, who happen to be in the military, from their constitutional right to choose flies in the face of what the military says it wants to do for our people, which is to protect them when they are abroad. 
   This is simply about the rights of women, one particular group of women, the women I thought my friends on the other side of the aisle would particularly respect because of their respect for the military. This is telling those women in the military: You cannot have the same rights as anybody else. 
   I recall when we had a debate on the Washington, DC, appropriations bill. I happened to be the minority member who was bringing that bill forward. There were many restrictions on the poor women of Washington, DC, that were not put into any other bill. In other words, the people in my cities did not get stuck with particular rules that told them they could not use city money if they, in fact, wanted to exercise their right to choose. 
   I said to my friends on the other side of the aisle: Why are you picking on these poor women in Washington, DC? Do my colleagues know what the answer was? Because we can. 
   I rhetorically ask the same question: Why are we picking on women in the military and saying they are less than full citizens of this country, that they do not have the constitutional rights that other women have? 
   I suspect an honest answer coming back would be: Because we can take this right away; because we in the Senate have the power of the purse, and we are going to exercise that power because we can. And they will do it. 
   I am hoping one or two people on the other side will change their minds on this amendment if they are listening to this debate; given the fact that the military supports the Murray-Snowe amendment. I hope a couple of people will change their minds on this. Just because we can exercise our personal religious and moral beliefs on someone else does not mean we should do that. 
   We should respect people and know we have freedom of religion in this country. That does not mean we have a right to put our moral values and our decisions on someone else. We should respect them. They are going to decide this issue. 
   I can tell my colleagues that a decision to have an abortion is one that is very serious for our people. Women do not do it in a cavalier way. They think about it, and they talk about it with the people who love them, not their boss. That is what my colleagues make people do: Go to their boss and beg to get on a plane to get a safe abortion. It is shameful. It is 
   just shameful. They  would not want that done to their children. I do not think so. They would want them to have the chance to do what they thought was right and have the opportunity of a safe, legal procedure. 
   Again, I say to Senators MURRAY and SNOWE that they are courageous to do this; they are right to do this. They lost a couple of votes on close vote counts, and they are not giving up. 
   I hope everyone who is watching this debate, be they a man or a woman, be they old or young, be they for a woman's right to choose or against it, understands what this debate is about. Nothing we do today, regardless of how this vote goes, will change the law governing a woman's right to choose. That was decided in 1973, and it has been upheld. It is a right. 
   This is not about the rights of the unborn. It is about the rights of women in the military to have the same constitutional protections as all the other women in our Nation. 
   I thank the Chair for his courtesy, and I thank Senator MURRAY for her courage. I yield the floor.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, one year ago, three synagogues in the Sacramento, California area were attacked by arsonists. Two weeks later, a gay couple was killed at their home in nearby Redding, California. Two nights after these brutal murders, a Sacramento women's health care clinic was firebombed. 
   These vicious crimes shocked the people of Sacramento. At the same time, it moved many members of the community to speak out and take action. Led by the late mayor Joe Serna, thousands of residents joined a Unity Rally at the Sacramento Convention Center and pledged to work together to prevent future hate crimes. 
   Out of this rally grew the ``United We Build'' project, which is bearing fruit this week. In the name of tolerance and unity, hundreds of volunteers are gathering and setting to work on community projects: planting gardens, cleaning up schools and parks, and refurbishing churches and senior centers. The week's events will culminate on Sunday with a Jewish Food Faire at one of the targeted synagogues and an afternoon rally at the State Capitol. 
   Mr. President, every community in America should take inspiration from the people of Sacramento. They have turned their shock, anger, and fear into positive actions. From the ashes of hatred and intolerance, they have emerged stronger and more unified than ever before. 
   Hate crimes seek to stigmatize persecuted groups and isolate them from the larger society. We must turn the tables to isolate those who preach hatred and commit hate crimes. This will not be easy: Today hate groups flood the Internet with venom, and hateful individuals flood the talk shows with vitriol. 
   To stop hate crimes, we must of course catch and prosecute the perpetrators. But we must do more than that. We must each act to root hatred and intolerance out of our daily lives. We must have zero tolerance for intolerance. If a friend or family member uses hateful speech, we must have the courage to say that this is unacceptable. If a neighbor or co-worker takes an action designed to hurt another because of that person's race or religion or sexual orientation, we must stand with the victim, not the aggressor. 
   Congress can pass laws to prevent and prosecute hate crimes. I voted to pass such legislation today, and I will do so again. But laws alone cannot wipe the stain of hatred off the American landscape. To do this--to truly secure the blessings of liberty for all Americans--we must each take every opportunity to teach tolerance and act against hatred.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise today to salute the new reigning champions of the National Basketball Association--California's own Los Angeles Lakers. 
   The tradition of greatness continues in Los Angeles. Building on the excellence personified by the likes of Jerry and Wilt the Silt, and later by Magic and Kareem, today's Lakers regained that status by players known around the world by two words: ``Kobe'' and ``Shaq.'' 
   What can you say about Shaquille O'Neal? He is the most dominating force in the game today. He was the most valuable player in the All-Star Game, the regular season and the NBA finals. 
   Kobe Bryant has that creative, slashing style that is pure excitement. The way he fought through tough injuries to spark the Lakers was an inspiration. 
   And Mr. President, I would like to acknowledge the rest of the Lakers team. The steady hand and championship experience of Ron Harper was crucial. Robert Harry's stifling defense, strong rebounding and opportunistic scoring were key. Rick Fox, whose ten years' experience and clutch three-pointer in the waning moments of Game Six were invaluable. The persistent of Glenn Rice was matched only by the beauty of his jump shot. A.C. Green, who came back to the Lakers for this championship season, reminded us of his original ``Showtime'' days when he was running the wing with Magic and Worthy. And Brian Shaw and Derek Fisher made big shots and took care of the ball during minutes off the bench. What a team! 
   Finally, the man who brought all of these elements together, is simply the best of all time--the man they call Zen master, coach Phil Jackson. 
   The Lakers victories were made more special by the determination of their opponents. Larry Bird and the Indiana Pacers deserve the respect of basketball fans everywhere. 
   Mr. President, on behalf of millions of adoring Angelenos, California and basketball fans everywhere congratulations to the 2000 World Champion Los Angeles Lakers.

   Mrs. BOXER. I would like to ask my distinguished friend, the Senator from Alabama, about committee report language on the Fiscal Year 2001 Transportation Appropriations bill that affects the use of small dummies in the New Car Assessment Program, or NCAP. Let me quote from the relevant section of the report:  
   The Committee denies the request to expand NCAP by using small size dummies in crash tests. The Committee believes that test devices should be required for use in safety standards compliance testing before being considered for inclusion in NCAP.  
   As my good friend knows, the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration (NHTSA) currently conducts crash tests using dummies that meet a standard for full-grown adult men, and I am concerned that this report language would prevent the public from learning how new cars would perform in crashes involving occupants of all sizes--smaller adults and children.

   Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Senator for his answer, and I agree that it is essential that safety dummies used in the NCAP program in fact provide adequate and reliable data to consumers and automobile manufacturers alike. I appreciate that there has been some confusion with respect to certification of the so-called small 5th percentile dummy, but I now have information from NHTSA which indicates that the dummy has been thoroughly tested and certified through the appropriate rulemaking process. 
   Would he under these circumstances commit to making every effort in the conference committee on the Transportation bill to change that specific report language to reflect this information from NHTSA?

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, the Fiscal Year 2001 Transportation Appropriations bill now before the Senate  contains, in my opinion, a very damaging and potentially dangerous provision. This provision would effectively bar the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) from acting on comments from the public and other interested parties on the critical need to revise the so-called Hours of Service rules, which regulate, among other things, the number of continuous hours commercial drivers are permitted to be on the road. 
   Over 5,300 people are killed and 127,000 are injured each year as a result of truck-related crashes, and research shows that truck driver fatigue is a contributing factor in 30 to 40 percent of all truck-related fatalities. Moreover, the Department of Transportation (DOT) finds that fatigue is directly related to 15 percent of all fatalities involving heavy trucks. 
   There are both good and not-so-good parts to DOT's proposed changes to the Hours of Service rule. While I am very concerned that the proposed rule contemplates increasing the number of continuous driving hours from 10 to 12, it would also require the use of electronic on-board recorders for long haul and regional truckers, and it would require commercial drivers to follow the 24-hour circadian rhythm cycle as opposed to the currently permitted 18-hour cycle. This is important because all authoritative studies show that the human body best resets its ``clock'' when following the circadian rhythm cycle. 
   In response to requests from groups on all sides of this issue, DOT recently extended the comment period on the proposed rule by another 90 days. Nevertheless, language in the Transportation Appropriations bill would bring the entire rulemaking process to a halt. 
   Mr. President, not only is it wrong for this body to insert itself in this way in the preliminary stages of a proposed rulemaking process, I am concerned that that this provision will set highway safety initiatives back by decades. Only by keeping the rulemaking process alive can the existing 60-year-old Hours of Service rules ever be meaningfully reformed. 
   I understand that the House Transportation Appropriations bill contains no such provision, and it is my strong hope that this provision will be rejected in Conference Committee.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I want to commend my colleague from California for offering this motion. The motion instructs the Senate conferees to the Transportation Appropriations bill to reject the anti-environment CAFE rider. 
   This anti-environment rider has been included in the Transportation bill for the past four years. The rider prohibits the Transportation Department from even looking at the need to raise the nearly decade old CAFE standards. 
   The existing standards have saved more than 3 million barrels of oil per day. We know that raising the CAFE standards is possible and would save more oil. For example, requiring sport utility vehicles (SUVs) and other light trucks to meet the same standard that applies to passenger cars would save approximately 1 million barrels of oil per day. 
   Because SUVs are coming to dominate the new car market, we must make this change. But under the CAFE rider, the Transportation Department can't even think about it. They can't even study it. 
   Instead of moving forward to raise CAFE standards, what do some want to do to relieve our dependence on foreign oil? Some propose opening the California coasts to offshore oil drilling. Others propose opening up the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to drilling. 
   Why put our natural heritage at risk when we know we could save oil by making modest changes to CAFE standards? 
   It's good energy policy and good environmental policy. 
   Mr. President, raising CAFE standards is one critical step toward restoring sanity to our energy policy. In addition to this step, I have been advocating several other proposals. 
   First, we need to invest more in energy efficiency and renewable energy. Over the past five years, Congress has appropriate 22 percent less than requested by the President for energy efficiency and renewable energy.  
   Second, we need vigorous enforcement of the anti-trust laws on oil companies. For several years I have been concerned about the practices of the oil companies on the West Coast and in my State of California. Several times I have called on the FTC to investigate possible anti-trust violations. 
   Just this week, the government began investigating the dramatic jump in gasoline prices in the midwest. There is apparently no external justification for these huge price spikes. 
   Third, we should place a moratorium on oil company mergers. By definition, mergers mean less competition and less competition means higher prices. 
   Fourth, we should prohibit the export of Alaska North Slope crude oil. The GAO reported that the lifting of the ban in 1995 increased the price of crude oil by about a dollar per barrel. 
   I hope that my colleagues will join with me in supporting this CAFE motion. It is good energy policy and good environmental policy.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, last night the other body overwhelmingly approved the conference report accompanying S. 761, the Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act, by a vote of 426-4. The Senate is expected to take the report up soon. 
   I support the conference report on S. 761 because paper-less transactions will give our Information Age economy a boost, and allow persons to shop for goods and services once unavailable on the Internet. 
   The ability to make binding contracts online, that reach across state borders, will drive down transaction costs. The financial industry alone expects to save millions of dollars a year due to efficiencies derived from electronic signatures. 
   Consumers will save money and time, also. With electronic signatures persons will no longer need to sign certain contracts in person or communicate via mail. Now, persons will be able to enter into contracts and purchase items, like care loans, from the comfort of their own homes. Certainly, consumers will save money with this new level of competition, and save time conducting their daily affairs. 
   As people are able to conduct more and more business transactions online, I think we'll look back one day and try to remember what it was like without electronic signatures. 
   Mr. President, I look forward to this bill becoming law. 
   Mr. GRAMM, Mr. President, I rise today in support of the conference report on S. 761, the Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act, also known as the E-SIGN bill. The bill establishes a uniform national standard for treating electronic signatures, contracts and disclosures are legally binding in the same way that physical signatures, paper contracts and paper disclosures are legally binding. The bill will allow American businesses to become more efficient and productive through use of the Internet and other forms of electronic commerce, rather than being forced to use paper for all binding agreements. Further, it will expand for consumers everywhere the availability of products and services as well as permit tremendous time savings. With consumers no longer bound by expensive and time-absorbing requirements to complete transactions through the mail or in person, consumer costs will decline and choices will grow. Working from home computers, people will increasingly be able to pay bills, apply for mortgages, trade securities, and purchase goods and services wherever and whenever they choose. The reach of the consumer will extend around the globe. 
   Mr. President, Senator SPENCER ABRAHAM deserves the lion's share of the credit for this legislation. He began this process back in 1998, fathering not only the Senate bill, but subsequently generating interest on the House side. He continued providing technical and drafting assistance throughout the process. Without Senator ABRAHAM's persistence, and his clear, constant vision of what we need to accomplish, there would be no bill. 
   This legislation will have a profound impact on the financial services industries. 
   ``Electronic records'' is the term in the legislation that would encompass the disclosures that banks and other financial services companies must provide to consumers. Unlike the Senate bill, the House-passed bill included references to ``electronic records'' throughout the provisions of the bill. By including electronic records along with electronic signatures, the House bill extended the scope of the bill to cover disclosures required under various laws and regulations. 
   Far more than other industries, financial services companies such as banks, insurance companies and securities firms are impacted by these disclosure laws. Not only these industries, but these disclosure laws themselves fall under the jurisdiction of the Banking Committee. I am pleased that members of the Banking Committee were able to serve on the conference committee to ensure that these provisions were drafted in an appropriate and workable fashion. 
   There remain some problems with the bill, but I do not believe them to be overwhelming. There are those who are fearful of the electronic market place, and that fear found its expression in the debates in the conference committee. It found its expression in provisions in this bill that apply standards to electronic commerce that are not applied to paper commerce. That is not unusual. Every major technological advance has met with fear before its full benefits were embraced. It may seem odd, but not over one hundred years ago there was a very spirited congressional debate about whether it was safe to buy an automobile for transporting the President. Voices were loudly raised in Congress that automobile transportation was not safe, that it was too risky to let the President be transported in anything other than a horse-drawn carriage. Governments passed restrictions on automobile use that should silly to us today. 
   I believe that many of the fears that have been raised about electronic commerce will very soon sound silly. In fact, many of them do not make much sense today. That is why I am pleased that this legislation will allow the regulators to remove many of these onerous restrictions if the fears prove unfounded, as I expect that they will. And as I expect the fear to prove unfounded, I expect the regulators to act vigorously to remove unnecessary restrictions and requirements. Electronic commerce should labor under no greater regulatory restrictions than does the quill pen, if this is to be a system for the twenty-first century. 
   We will watch very closely the development of electronic commerce. If this legislation proves to put an unnecessary burden on electronic commerce, and if the regulators fail to act, or if legislation is needed, we will then take vigorous action in the Congress to correct the situation and make the purposes of this legislation a reality.

   Mrs. BOXER. I thank my friend for again putting this issue of prescription drugs into context. 
   I am sure my friend would agree it isn't unusual for political parties to take polls. However, I think what my friend is trying to say--and I hope every American can see this document I am holding in my hand, this poll. This so-called ``research,'' done with the Republicans over on the House side, is a document that says it all. It is the most cynical document I have ever seen since Newt Gingrich had the same thing done when he took over the House, when they told the Republicans what words to use, not what bills to pass, not what would make a good piece of legislation to help the millions of Americans who need help, no, but how to get them reelected and kowtow to their friends in the insurance business, the HMOs, and so on. If the American people could just read this document, things would change around here. I am hoping they will read this document.

   Mrs. BOXER. I ask my friend if he has read the page that says ``Focus group findings.'' Again, focus groups aren't unusual. You bring people together and ask them to respond. I ask my friend about a couple of these points. 
   They say: Upset seniors don't believe politicians, especially Republicans. They don't believe that, especially Republicans, understand how important and concerning this issue of prescription drugs is to them. 
   This pollster, I am sure, made a lot of money to produce this document for my friends on the other side says. The pollster says:  
   Message: I care.  
   That is the message he wants Republicans to make:  
   I care (but say it better than that). I care (but say it better than that).  
   Then he says:  
   It is more important to communicate that you have a plan as it is to communicate what is in the plan.  
   What I want to say to my friend is this. After reading this, I expect they are going to come up with some phony deal that looks like a prescription drug plan. My friend has made a point: If that plan does nothing to make these prescription drugs affordable, what does it do for our people other than turn them off? 
   I say to my friend, he knows people in this country are going to Canada to get prescription drugs. He discussed that. I know some are going on the Internet and trying to get drugs from Mexico, prescription drugs, because they cannot afford them here. 
   The ultimate question, after making my comments, is this. This document goes through the fact that the Democrats are doing really well on these issues. Do you know why? Because the American people know we have a real plan on this. They don't think we are perfect because nobody is perfect, but we have a plan on this. The Republicans know they are going to lose this election unless they get a plan. So they tell their people to use certain expressions. 
   Can my friend share with us some of his expressions? It says: How to talk about this issue. Our friends on the other side are told how to talk about the issue, what expressions to say in addition to ``I care.'' Maybe my friend will share some of that with the people?

   Mrs. BOXER. The other interesting number here is that the Republicans have found out, much to their chagrin, that Democrats have a 34-percent advantage--in the Republicans' own poll here--on improving the access to affordable health care and a 33-percent advantage on prescription drugs. So they take this information but they don't say, You know what, the Democrats are right on these issues. Let's go over to their side of the aisle. Let's call on President Clinton. He has been talking about protecting Medicare and so has Vice President GORE, and prescription drugs. Let's work together now. 
   They don't do that. They set out a document here that instead of saying: We just found out President Clinton is right; We just found out the Democrats have been right; We have just found out that AL GORE is right when he says we need a Medicare lockbox. So maybe they cross the aisle? Maybe they come over here and visit us, we join hands, and go down the aisle together here and cast some votes for the people for a change? No. That is not the way they see it. 
   They get this information and they basically do what my friend suggested. They are going to use the right words. They are going to attack us, they are going to scare people, and they are going to go home and say they have done something. 
   I hope every American family can see this document today. In a way, I feel badly about it because it will build cynicism, but I will say this: The information in this document could be used to do the right thing. It is quite unfortunate that our friends on the other side of the aisle, instead of taking this information, recognizing they are wrong and joining us and President Clinton and Vice President GORE, they are going to create a sham plan for prescription drugs. They are going to say they are protecting Medicare while doing nothing. Sadly, the American people will lose, unless they make some changes around here. 
   I thank my friend.

</TEXT>

<DOC>
<DOCNO>106-boxer-ca-5-20000613</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I believe anyone who listens to us will agree this issue of privacy of medical records is really moving to the forefront of American public discourse. I think we all believe certain things should be private. Certainly our medical records should be private unless we are very willing to discuss them or have them discussed. I am very pleased Senator STEVENS and Senator INOUYE support this amendment, and having received assurances they will work for it in the conference, I am not going to ask for a recorded vote. But I think it is a breakthrough that the managers have accepted this amendment. 
   I wish to make a point here about privacy of medical records. The Department of Defense is no better or no worse than any other Federal agency because all the Federal agencies have been going by the rules that were set forth in 1974. I do not know how old you were in 1974, Mr. President, but it was a long time ago. That is when we wrote the rules surrounding privacy, the Privacy Act of 1974, that really govern all the rules of privacy surrounding Federal employees, be they in the military or in the nonmilitary. 
   A cursory reading of the Privacy Act of 1974 will make your hair stand on end. It governs the privacy of medical records, but it says that no one can get your record unless you give prior written consent ``unless''--and here is the part you have to hear:  
   Unless the records are disclosed within an agency to a person who needs it in the performance of the job.  
   So anyone can get your record if they decide they want to see it as they do a job performance. Then it says an agency can get your record without your approval if it is for a routine use specified in the Federal Register. They can get your record, and listen to this, give it to the Census Bureau with your name attached: BARBARA BOXER, this is her medical record. The Census Bureau needs your record so they can carry out a census survey. Maybe they want to find out which Federal employees had what disease. They can get those records for the census for statistical purposes, but they say the records would not be individually identifiable, so I suppose that is OK. 
   Listen to this. The National Archives can get your record without your permission if your record has a sufficient historical value. So I say to the Presiding Officer, maybe someone in the National Archives is interested in his dad, the great Senator who preceded him, because they feel his records have sufficient historical value. That is absurd; they could get them if the agency released them. 
   Then there is a big loophole:  
   *.*.* because of a compelling circumstance affecting the health or safety of an individual.  
   Imagine, someone decides there is a compelling circumstance to know any Senator's or any employee's or any clerk's disabilities, what medicines they are on. Oh, they can get it if there is a compelling circumstance. That is not defined. Congress can get your record. Congress has a right to get the record of every clerk sitting here, any person in any Federal agency, without their consent. Talk about Big Brother or Big Sister, as the case may be. They have the right to find out anybody's record, their medical record. What a stunning revelation this is, to read the 1974 Privacy Act. 
   How about this one? The General Accounting Office, the GAO, doing a study--and we know we ask them to do many studies--can, in fact, get the record of any Federal employee with their name attached. 
   A consumer reporting agency can go ahead and get that information. 
   So here we have the Privacy Act of 1974. I have gone through it. Out of the 12 provisions, the exceptions, only 2 of them make sense. 
   They have to do with criminality, but everything else makes no sense. 
   I am very pleased Senators STEVENS and INOUYE understand this. I say to my friend from Alaska, under the Privacy Act that applies today, it is not just the military; it is all Federal agencies. I am just doing it here because this bill came out first. The DOD is absolutely no worse than any other agency. They are just following the Privacy Act of 1974. It is chilling to see how Congress can get an individual's medical record with their name attached or how the Census Bureau can get an individual's medical record with their name attached, without approval. 
   In our amendment we simply say that, in fact, an individual needs to give permission, unless it is for a national security or law enforcement purpose. Then we say: Fine, you give up your rights in that particular case. 
   Again, I am pleased; we are breaking fine new ground. We should apply what we are doing here to every agency. I will do that, by the way, on every appropriations bill I can because this is absolutely critical. 
   I am delighted we are going to have a voice vote on this. I would like to have it accepted. A voice vote will be fine. This is not a complicated issue. This is a question of people in the military having peace of mind, knowing their records are secure. I will go away very pleased on this one. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mrs. BOXER. I thank the chairman for his graciousness. I urge my colleagues to vote affirmatively on this. I hope we can get a very overwhelming vote. 
   My amendment simply protects children at the Department of Defense housing or playgrounds, day-care facilities, schools, from poisonous and toxic materials. It is consistent with the DOD guidelines. Frankly, it seems to me we should all support it. Basically, the guidelines say they will stay away from these poisons when they do routine spraying. 
   We ought to codify this because there is a little bit of ambiguity. I am very proud of the Department of Defense in so many areas that deal with children. For example, child care centers at the Department of Defense are the best in the world, truly, and certainly are a model for so many other child care centers in our country. However, it did take some horrible mistakes before that was straightened out. We don't want to have a horrible mistake, a mistaken spraying. We want to make sure it is done right. 
   I am very pleased that the EPA is supporting this amendment. They helped with it. We spoke a number of times with Colonel Driggers who said he believed this was, in fact, consistent with the DOD written guidelines. It could be that they would rather not have us do this. I think it would be good for this Senate to go on record stating that for routine spraying against pests in these areas, let's use the less toxic materials. If there is an emergency, an outbreak of something horrible such as encephalitis, we make room for that. We certainly have a clear exception in emergency situations. We are talking about routine situations. 
   We have seen Administrator Browner, with bipartisan support, ban some of the very harsh pesticides. I think we can work very well together in a bipartisan way to stop the routine spraying of these dangerous toxins.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I thank the managers. I have had a few amendments. I think this one is not one they support. They have been very supportive of my others. I am very proud that the Senator from Iowa, Mr. HARKIN, has once again teamed up with me. We have been the team on this particular subject for awhile. 
   When I was in the House of Representatives, I served on the Armed Services Committee. It was a great honor to do so. There is nothing more important than our national security. What I found was that we were wasting many dollars. I thought we had cured some of those problems. For awhile I really didn't bring these issues before the body because I was convinced we were moving in the right direction. Suddenly, I am afraid, we see a reversal. 
   For example, in this bill, the military asked us for $3 billion less than the committee actually voted out. This particular bill that is before us is $3 billion more than the Defense Department requested. Why would we do that? Why would we not go along with what they say they need, and why would we pad this particular area, our national defense? And why do I say that? Because if we look through the bill, we will find instances of waste. 
   We understand why this bill is padded when we particularly look at one area that Senator HARKIN and I joined forces on last year. That is the area of operational support aircraft. These are aircraft used for travel by the upper echelons of the military. What we do with our amendment is strike the section that allows nine of these operational support aircraft to be leased. In this bill, they are not specified as what they are, how much they each cost. We know nothing except that the Army can have three, the Navy can have three, and the Marine Corps can have three. 
   What do I suspect they are going to do with this? I think we have to learn from history and look back to last year's Defense appropriations bill. I offered an amendment with Senator HARKIN then that would have struck this same exact language that was used by the Air Force to lease six operational support aircraft. Senator HARKIN and I lost that fight. I thought we made a valiant effort, but we are back for this reason: A lot has happened since Senator HARKIN and I brought this matter before the body. 
   First, we know the Air Force plans to lease the most luxurious jets there are, despite the fact we had people here telling us they weren't going to lease these big, beautiful jets; they were going to go smaller. 
   Let's take a look at the Gulfstream. It is pretty slick. We are told if one were to buy this, it costs $50 million a copy--luxurious travel. The Air Force has leased six. The Air Force took the same language they had in the appropriations bill last year and leased six of these. 
   Let's take a look at the interior of this plane. Senator HARKIN has a little different view. It is beautiful. This plane is used by billionaires. This plane is used by the top echelon of wealthy people in this country. We wonder why this bill has been padded with $3 billion. I think it is to do things such as this that, with all due respect, were not spelled out in this bill. 
   If I were to read--I don't have time because I have agreed to a tight time limit--the language, all one would know about it is, it is the same as was put in for the Air Force. But they couldn't find anywhere listed a Gulfstream. Yet last year we were told, at this very same time in the debate, that the Air Force was not going to go for these Gulfstreams: ``There is nothing in this language that says that.'' Yet that is, in fact, what they did. 
   We were right last year, and it is costing taxpayers a fortune to lease these jets. Let me say, it is cheaper to buy them than to lease them. 
   I ask unanimous consent to print in the RECORD a New York Times article that discusses the fact that it is actually cheaper to lease these jets than to buy them.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. BOXER. First of all, we are not buying them. We are leasing them, and that costs money. If we were to buy these nine, it would cost a half a billion dollars. I am embarrassed to say it. That amount of money could put 5,000 police on the streets. That amount of money could double the number of children we have in afterschool. That amount of money could take care of a lot of veterans' health care. 
   The other plane that is in the same category is called Bombardier. It is made in Quebec. I don't have a photo of it. It is just as luxurious, just as expensive. It goes for about the same. I say to my friends who want to make sure our generals have what they need: Why do we have to go to the top of the line? 
   If the answer comes back that we are not necessarily doing that and we are not spelling it out, then why not preclude them from going to the top of the line? Two things have happened that are important since this debate last year. 
   No. 1, those who said the Air Force would never buy the top of the line were proven wrong. We said they would do it, and they will leased these top of the line jets. 
   No. 2, Senator HARKIN, Congressman DEFAZIO, and I wrote to the General Accounting Office. Because we respect our friends who said these operational support aircraft were necessary, we said to the GAO, which is our investigative arm, Will you do a study? They did. Guess what they titled this study. The title of this study comes back: ``Operational Support Airlift Requirements are not Sufficiently Justified.'' 
   Let me reiterate sort of the partridge and the pear tree about why we should strike this language. Last year, we were told they needed the aircraft. Here is the GAO report, the investigative arm of Congress, coming back saying we do not need any more right now because we don't know what we have. I will share the quotes from that study. 
   Second, the Air Force proved they were going to go to the top of the line. This is the same exact language. After all, I guess if the Air Force has it, the Army needs it, the Marines, and the Navy, then we are going to allow them to have the same latitude. 
   Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?

   The processes that DOD uses to identify its requirements for operational support airlift have a number of weaknesses that make it difficult to assess whether the current inventory meets the wartime needs.  
   That is one statement. We will go through the statements with you. 
   The next statement:  
   Although DOD directive 4500.43 states that operational support airlift requirements should be based solely on wartime needs, the methodology that DOD used in 1995 and 1998 does not draw a clear link to the scenario for two major regional conflicts specified by the National Military Strategy.  
   In other words, the operational support aircraft have to be linked to what military needs in case of war--not that it is comfortable for generals in time of peace. 
   I understand that it is comfortable to go on a plane such as this, but that is not what taxpayers should be paying for. We should be paying for what we need in time of war. That is what the DOD is supposed to do. 
   What else do they tell us in this report?  
   The lack of clear linkage to wartime requirements raises questions about whether the support aircraft fleet is appropriately sized to meet short-notice mobility needs in wartime.  
   My friends, this is serious. We are going ahead with this appropriations--this green light--to lease all of these airplanes when the GAO is saying to us that the ``lack of clear linkage to wartime requirements raises questions about'' the fleet and whether it is appropriately sized. It may be terribly overly sized. 
   Let's see what else we have. 
   This is the one I think says it all.  
   The joint staff ..... has not maintained records documenting its previous requirements reviews, so it is not possible to determine whether some options for reducing requirements were examined.  
   I have to say to my colleagues who I hope are watching this from their offices that there is a need here to defend the United States of America, and we should do everything we can to do that. If we are going under the scenario of being prepared to fight two major conflicts--some people think that is outmoded, but if that is what we are doing--then everything we do in this budget should reflect that need. And we are being told that the Joint Chiefs do not maintain records documenting their requirements for these aircraft. 
   How on Earth can we possibly justify this kind of open-ended language in this bill? 
   The GAO sums up:  
   For all these reasons, we believe a more rigorous process is needed to better ensure that support aircraft requirements accurately reflect wartime needs.  
   I think if you really believe that supporting our military is one of the most important things we can do in making sure we have dollar for dollar the best military in the world, then you should vote for the Boxer-Harkin amendment.  
   There is no reason given in any of the documentation in the Department of Defense as to why they need this aircraft. There is no rationale. The GAO has studied this. They are nonpartisan. They are the investigative arm of Congress. They have come back and told us they can't even find their records. Yet we are going blindly ahead, it seems to me, and providing this open-ended language, which will result, I predict to you, in nine more of these aircraft, and they could be the most luxurious in the world. 
   We already know that the Defense Department has 144 jets in its fleet of operational support aircraft. This includes 71 Learjets, 13 Gulfstreams, the one Gulfstream V, and 17 Cessna Citations. 
   We know the GAO has studied all of this, and they are saying to us: Time out. What is the rush? 
   When I take a look at these luxury jets, I can only say this: We know there are cheaper luxury jets that would have to make just one stop--I have a photo of that--just one stop. This plane is about $18 million compared to $50 million, which would have to make one stop to refuel. 
   I have to say to my friends that it is a beautiful plane. It is a comfortable plane. For a general to stop and stretch his or her legs, as the case may be, and fill up the tank once on the way to a meeting in peacetime----

   Mrs. BOXER. That is a Citation X. 
   The point I am making is there is nothing in the language, I say to my dear friend, that suggests exactly what plane they are going to use. There is nothing in this language. Last year, under the same language, the Air Force leased the Gulfstream. That is the point we are making. We are not limiting them to this. 
   I have to say that I know we are in a surplus situation. But we have a lot of needs for our military personnel. I know my friends fought for that. We are looking at military personnel who are not living in adequate housing. We know that Senator MCCAIN has taken the lead in trying to get our people off food stamps. We have an unfunded priority of veterans' health. 
   I think what Senator HARKIN and I are simply saying is this: 
   It is unnecessary to have this many planes when we now have a quite unbiased report that says, ``Operational Support Airlift requirements are not sufficiently justified.'' 
   Why would we run off and buy more when we don't know what we have? We have seen with vague language we could wind up with top-of-the-line jets. 
   Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time and yield 20 minutes to the Senator from Iowa.

   Mrs. BOXER. Not at all. 
   As my friend knows, we don't even really know how the jets they have now are meeting our needs in a situation such as during wartime, which is the directive that they have to go by. The DOD has to rationalize and tell us, under their own directive, how their support meets the needs in wartime. 
   Clearly in this report it is stated there is no rationale for what they have now, let alone what they have to have. 
   Furthermore, we are saying that if they got these nine additional planes, which we don't even know if they need, under this language they would be able to buy the fanciest jets in the world, despite the fact that Senator STEVENS doesn't think they will. 
   The Senator of Alaska wasn't positive that the Air Force was going to lease the six Gulfstreams last year, yet they did. It is the same language.

   Mrs. BOXER. What it shows is exactly what my friend is saying, aircraft should be able to fly no-wind range of 5,000 nautical miles. Only two aircraft, this one called the Global Express--that is made in Canada, and then the Gulfstream V, which, as my friend pointed out, the Air Force has put out this proposal, it is in the 5,000 nautical mile range. So this is the characteristic. If you look at this and other characteristics, it can only be these luxury jets. 
   But I wanted to ask my friend if he saw the letter from the Department of Defense to the General Accounting Office on page 27 of this report. I ask him to take a look at it because it seems to me, any thinking person would read this and say the Department of Defense agrees with HARKIN and BOXER. If you look at this letter in the second paragraph, it says:  
   The department agrees with many of the findings in the GAO report. Accordingly, it will take the GAO's findings into consideration in future determinations of operational support airlift.  
   That is very nice. When will they take it into consideration? After they have sprung for half a billion dollars of the taxpayers' money? What we are saying is we have this report, folks. Yet in this particular bill before us, I wonder if my friend is aware, in order to take effect these leases must be done before 2004. So they are essentially rushing to run out and lease these aircraft so, as my friend says, they can have the same aircraft as the Air Force.

   Mrs. BOXER. Will my friend yield on the remaining time he has? I thank my friend for joining me. This is someone who knows what it is to fly military aircraft. I could not have a better partner on this amendment than TOM HARKIN. 
   I want to close this particular portion, and then we will have a few minutes left to respond to the criticism that I am sure will now be leveled at us from some very astute people. 
   Here is the point: Last year when we got in this fight, they told us: Oh, no, they were not going to go out and get these Gulfstreams. We said we thought they were; nothing in this language precludes it. They went out with an RFP. We were right: Luxury planes, $50 million a copy if you were to buy it. 
   Secondly, we said OK to our friends, you don't believe us; we will have a GAO report, the nonpartisan arm of Congress, investigate. That is what they do, they investigate. Guess what they said. ``Operational support airlift requirements are not sufficiently justified.'' Guess what else. The Department of Defense says they agree. So why are we in this bill allowing for leases of nine jets which are not defined? They can well be these luxury jets. I thank my friend and ask for his final comments.

This is the same language that was used which gave the Air Force the ability to get the Gulfstreams. 
   If my friend wants to change the language, that is great, but the language is the same. The Air Force took that language and is buying luxury jets, and besides which the GAO says do not get any more because they do not even know what they have they are so disorganized over there when it comes to the operational airlift.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Alaska for giving me a little bit of time. I began to doubt my own memory, but I am glad that he agreed that I did, in fact, yield to him. Of course, I have tremendous respect for him, but I don't agree with him on this particular issue. 
   I want to address what one of my dearest friends in the Senate, Senator INOUYE said. He said: I don't want to see our generals and people who put their lives on the line for their country flying around in a commercial jet. 
   I totally understand that. I didn't disagree with him on that. I say to my friend from Hawaii that I personally don't want the generals traveling around via United or TWA. 
   That is not what this is about. I want to make sure we have the appropriate number of operational support aircraft in the fleet. We know--because the GAO took a long time investigating--that in fact the joint staff has not maintained records documenting its previous requirement reviews, so it is not possible to determine whether some options for reducing requirements were examined. 
   I say to my friend from Hawaii that the issue isn't that we shouldn't have operational support aircraft. Of course, we have to and we must. But why on Earth do we go ahead in this appropriations bill with language identical to that which we saw last year which resulted in the Air Force going out with a proposal for six of the most expensive luxury jets? We now have the same language for nine jets. There is no limit on language that the Navy or the Army can come back with. That is why we are structuring it. We are simply saying it would be fiscally responsible. 
   I am one of the people who, years ago when I was in the House, found--I forget how much it was--I think it was an $11,000 coffeepot, something like that, and the expensive wrenches and spare parts the military was using. Every time I got up on the floor of the House I was truly lectured: You don't know what you are saying. There is no backup for this. Eventually they believed we were right. They weren't going out for competitive bids for these spare parts. 
   I question no one in this Senate in terms of their wanting the best defense we can have. But I don't think we get the best defense when we waste dollars. 
   I am suggesting that the language in this appropriations bill, believe it or not, doesn't have a cap. Am I right on that point? It has no cap. It has no dollar figure. It only caps the number of aircraft to nine. But if they do what the Air Force did--Senator STEVENS says they won't, and perhaps they won't--but if they did do what the Air Force said, it would be almost one-half billion dollars. 
   Our amendment says strike that language. Let's have more of a review. Let's not waste money. 
   We weren't born yesterday. We know people love to travel in luxury. There is not one person listening to this debate who wouldn't enjoy kicking back on this type of luxury jet. 
   Let's show a picture of it. That is not the question. But the issue is whether taxpayers have to spend that much money when we don't know what is in the requirements. We don't know what planes are in the Air Force, the Marines, or the Army. We do not have a study. It simply says operational support airlift requirements are not sufficiently justified. We don't know what is in the garage. Let's put it that way. That was the verb I was looking for. We don't know what is in the garage. Let's not go out and willy-nilly allow them to get an additional nine 
   aircraft. These are beautiful aircraft. There is no question they are wonderful. But we were told: Oh, well. Maybe the Senator from Alaska believed that he said he fully expected them to get the Gulfstream. I remember the debate a little differently. The debate was that we were not sure what they were going to wind up getting. They were going to wind up getting these. Just because the Air Force has them doesn't mean we have to have them in the Army. It doesn't mean we have to have them in the Navy. 
   I think Senator HARKIN was right. He said he knows airplanes. He knows aircraft. This is about luxury. What the military should be about is mission. What is the mission? What do we need and what do we have? The GAO report clearly is telling us they do not know what they have. 
   I think it is rather embarrassing; they do not know what they have. Yet we are going ahead as if everything was wonderful. No one on our side of the argument--we had over 30 people last time--has ever said that we don't have anything but the greatest respect for our generals and our admirals. But we have respect for the taxpayers. Senators can argue with one another. I don't know what we appropriate for the GAO every year, but they have some very smart investigators. They made an investigation and said: We don't know what they have. 
   Why should we get any more until we really know for sure? 
   Thank you very much.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today I wish to speak about a little known, but very dark chapter in American history. While many are familiar with the deplorable treatment of Japanese-Americans and others of Japanese ancestry living in the United States during World War II, there is far less discussion and understanding of what Italian-Americans were forced to endure during that period. 
   Italian-Americans refer to what happened at this time as ``Una Storia Segreta,'' or ``A Secret Story.'' Beginning before the war and until after Italy's surrender in 1943, Italian-Americans and those of Italian decent living in the United States were made suspects simply because of their country of origin. Like Japanese-Americans, they were subjected to all manner of civil rights violations including curfews, warrantless searches, summary arrests, exclusions, relocations and even internment. 
   The United States must accept responsibility for its grievous treatment of Italian-Americans during World War II. To this end, Senator TORRICELLI has introduced S. 1909, the Wartime Violation of Italian-American Civil Liberties Act, a bill to require the Justice Department to make a full accounting of the injustices suffered by Italian-Americans during World War II. After the Justice Department completes its report, the President would formally acknowledge these injustices. 
   I am pleased to cosponsor this overdue legislation. Although it may be painful to revisit and admit to the mistakes made during this time, I hope my colleagues would agree that it is the necessary and right thing to do.

   Mrs. BOXER. I thank my friend from Alaska and my friend from Hawaii for agreeing to my request. I hope we will not have much opposition because I believe that this amendment is, in fact, consistent with the stated policy of the Department of Defense. I will explain what my amendment does. 
   My amendment would prohibit the routine use of particularly harmful pesticides on Department of Defense property or grounds where children may be present. 
   I was stunned to learn, about a year after I got to the Senate--so it must have been about 1984--that the way the laws were written and the way they applied across the Government was that our environmental laws were set to protect essentially 155-pound men. 
   Now, that is fine, if you are in that category, but what we find out is that people of a lesser weight, a different gender, pregnant women, the elderly, people who are ill, and little children, react very differently to that amount of pollution or pesticide, as the case may be. So I wrote a bill called the Children's Environmental Protection Act. I am very much hopeful that we can get it passed as sort of an omnibus bill that takes care of all of our laws in every Department to make sure that children, in particular, are protected. 
   So far we have not had much luck moving that bigger package, so what I have done is, on every bill that has come before this body, I have offered an amendment that would lower the risk for our children. In this particular case, we are saying to the Department of Defense: You have been good about putting the policy forward; we want to codify it and make sure that you do not use a pesticide containing a probable carcinogen or a known carcinogen, an acute nerve toxin or other toxins that would in fact harm our children. 
   Why is it important to limit the use of these pesticides 
   around children? Clearly, by definition, pesticides are meant to kill living things. Exposure to pesticides has been linked to cancer,  neurological disorders, and learning disabilities. For example, common insecticides that schools spray on baseboards and floors to kill cockroaches and ants include an active ingredient--chlorpyrifos--that is classified by the EPA as a nerve toxin. And I compliment Carol Browner over at the EPA because she just held a press conference announcing that this particular ingredient will be banned. However, it is important to note it is going to take at least 6 months for that ban, and we do not want that kind of toxin being sprayed around children. That is why it is important to include it in this amendment. 
   We know that potential chronic effects from exposure to these kinds of harmful toxins, we know we see a decrease in neurological performance. 
   Are these risks any different for children in relation to adults? The answer is yes. I would like to refer you to the 1993 National Academy of Sciences report, ``Pesticides in the Diets of Infants and Children.'' We know that children are at greater risk to experience the harmful effects of pesticides exposure than adults. In other words, children are not just little adults. They are changing; they are growing. I often say that I am a little adult but I am not a child; I have grown to my maximum potential. But the fact is, kids at a certain age, before they reach maturity, are very susceptible to having adverse reactions to the chemicals that I would not have, nor Senator INOUYE, nor Senator STEVENS, nor our Presiding Officer, Senator ROBERTS; we are stronger, although I would say they are much stronger than I am because they are being protected because of a rule that says if you are a 155-pound male, you will be OK. 
   So it is important to bring this issue to the Senate as often as I can, and I am very pleased with the response I have gotten from colleagues thus far because we have been able to change the rules as they apply to safe drinking water; we recently had some luck on an education bill; and we have had some luck with the Superfund in committee. We make sure that when the Superfund sites are cleaned up--these are the terrible dumps that include so many harmful toxins--they are cleaned up to protect children, not just the 155-pound adults. 
   We know that pound for pound of body weight, children eat more food; they drink more water; and they breathe more air than adults so they are vulnerable. They are rapidly growing; their developing systems are vulnerable. 
   I want to show you this picture in case you are wondering what all this means because I think it is extremely interesting and it is also extremely disturbing. 
   This picture is from a study, ``Showing the Effects of Pesticide Exposure on Young children.'' One group of children in this study was from a region where pesticide use was high, both in the home and outdoors. The other group in the study was the same as the first group: same age, same ethnicity, except the second group of children was from regions where pesticides were not used--the same group of children, except for pesticide exposure. The two groups of children were asked to draw a person to test their cognitive ability, their ability to learn and understand. These are the results, results which show an unsettling picture. 
   These are the pictures that were drawn by the kids who were exposed to pesticides. You can see you don't even see a resemblance of a person. And clearly where there was very little exposure, you are getting a much more appropriate type of drawing. This isn't something that we are making up. We are seeing this response. 
   The kids who grew up without exposure to pesticide use in significant proportions did far better. They had better hand-eye coordination, and you could see it so clearly; they had better memory and their brain skills were so much sharper. 
   The study's authors also observed that children from the area with little pesticide use--and again that is clearly this group shown here--engaged in more group play; they were more creative with their activities; they were less aggressive than the children from the area with the high pesticide use. This is a study that is considered one of the first in this particular area. 
   This was done by Professor Elizabeth Guillette who is affiliated with the University of Arizona. This study clearly shows what many of us have suspected for a long time. It is a fact in evidence that our kids are damaged when they are exposed to dangerous pesticides and toxins. 
   The point I want to make about the amendment is that while we prohibit the routine use of these dangerous pesticides, we certainly do not prohibit the Department of Defense from using common and less toxic pesticides. 
   Under the amendment, DOD could still use synthetic pyrethroid insecticides to control insects. These insecticides are among the most common used today. 
   And, DOD could still use copper sulfate, a very common pesticide used today. 
   DOD also could still use ``biopesticides''--there are some 50 of these type pesticides in use today. 
   DOD could also use pheromone traps and baits--which are used heavily today to control termites and carpenter ants. 
   Finally, DOD could still use insect growth regulators, which help control insects. 
   I was asked when putting this amendment together: Suppose there is an absolute emergency and we have an encephalitis epidemic break out on a military base. We make an exception for that in this amendment. We agree, if we have to go to these harsher toxins to fight a health hazard. Of course. We have an exception in this amendment. By the way, that exception is part of the DOD guidelines. 
   We are only banning as a routine method the known carcinogens, the probable carcinogens, the nerve toxins from regular use. 
   This is a very disturbing study that was done by someone who is considered a leader in this field of understanding children and their brain development at the University of Arizona. We know for a fact that kids are adversely impacted by these toxins. I would be very pleased to see the Senate act to put on the record and put into law the official banning of these very harmful pesticides. 
   I again thank my colleague, the Senator from Hawaii, Mr. INOUYE, for his help on this. I ask unanimous consent that HARRY REID be added as a cosponsor to this amendment.

   Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Senator from Illinois for reading these names into the RECORD, for putting a human face on what is a national tragedy. He experienced this at home, and I did as well in California. 
   People are wondering just exactly what we are doing. Since Columbine, we agreed to five sensible gun amendments, one of them to close the gun show loophole, which would make it very difficult, if not impossible, for criminals and children and people who are mentally unbalanced to buy guns at gun shows; also, for example, to make sure that all handguns are sold with safety locks, so if kids get hold of a gun, there is no discharge of a bullet. 
   I want to engage my friend in a little colloquy. While we were gone last week, there were two horrific stories, just two that made the national news. God knows there were more. 
   One of them involved a student who was acting out on the last day of school. He was throwing water balloons. And the teacher said: Listen, you are just going to have to leave school. You don't belong here. We don't have tolerance for this kind of behavior. 
   The child left school, went home; he told someone he was going to get a gun. The child who was told this didn't believe it. Sure enough, he went to his grandfather's stash of guns and got one. It had no safety lock on it. He returned, and he killed a very wonderful, kind family man, a teacher at the prime of his life, in his thirties. 
   Then we had the incident in Queens where a disgruntled employee essentially executed people who worked at a Wendy's. 
   What do we do here? Nothing. We do nothing. I am listening for the majority leader. We already passed these amendments in the Senate, and the amendments are languishing in the committee. I say to my friend, what are the American people to think about this inaction? I would like him to comment on that. Then I have another question about the NRA convention. 
   If my friend could comment, because he feels so strongly about this, what are the American people thinking about the Senate and Congress, controlled by Republicans, who do nothing about the issue of the killing of our people at a far greater rate than our soldiers died in Vietnam? We have a war in our streets. What do you think they should do about it?

   Mrs. BOXER. I say to my friend, what is extremely frustrating is the talk we hear: Gee, it does not make any difference who gets elected. I want to make a point straight from the shoulder, and I am known for that. The fact is, every single Democrat voted for these sensible gun measures, except one, and we had just a few on the other side join us. 
   There is a difference. I ask my friend if he happened to hear the NRA convention speeches that were made or if he read them, and, if so, what he thought. I was, frankly, stunned at the all-out personal attack on AL GORE that I heard. I have no objection to people having differences. If they want everyone to carry a concealed weapon, that is their choice to make that decision. I do not think we want to see an America that is a shootout at the OK Corral. I do not think that is going to make our country great. But if somebody thinks that we all ought to pack a weapon, that is their right, but to personally attack the Vice President because he supports sensible gun control laws--which, by the way, are supported by 80 percent of the people--to make this a personal, vicious attack on AL GORE--and I read Wayne 
   LaPierre's speech and I read Charlton Heston's speech. They named AL GORE in the most vicious way and attacked him in the most personal way. 
   I ask my friend if he would like to see this debate elevated above these personalities. It is dangerous to start attacking people in such a way, and I hope we can keep our disagreements over the issues rather than attack a Vice President who is simply reflecting the views of 80 percent of the people. 
   When we hear the NRA executive say: When George Bush is elected, we are going to operate out of the White House--that sends chills up and down my spine. No group should operate out of the White House, whether it is Sarah and Jim Brady's gun control group or the NRA. For them to say when George Bush is elected they are going to work out of the White House is a frightening thought to me. 
   I hope the American people will tune in to this and not say all the candidates are alike and not say all of us are alike. They are not going to find us perfect, that is for sure. No one is perfect. Doesn't my friend believe this is an issue where there are serious differences between the two parties?

   Mrs. BOXER. I thank my friend for raising the issue of the Supreme Court. I should have raised it myself. He is so right on that point. The Supreme Court up to now has, in fact, said it is OK for Congress to work on gun laws that keep guns out of the hands of criminals and children, and that it is not, in fact, a violation of the second amendment because we say: Sure, if you are responsible and you need to have a gun and you have a reason to have it--for recreation or to defend your family--and you are a responsible gun owner, that is one situation. But if you are a criminal, you are mentally unbalanced, if you walk in and buy a gun, by the way, when you are high on drugs or alcohol, this is not going to be good for this Nation. The Supreme Court up to now has upheld our ability to regulate. 
   There is no question that with the NRA operating out of the George Bush White House, we are going to see in the Congress not only a lack of future progress on controlling these guns and who has these guns, but we are going to see the Supreme Court tilt and say: Congress, you have no business dealing with this issue. 
   I ask my friend this: If we have no other role to play, shouldn't it be that we protect the health and the safety of the people of this country? I know we are trying to get a Patients' Bill of Rights. This is another issue for which we are fighting hard because that is our sacred obligation, if nothing else. 
   We can have the greatest economy in the world, the best economy in the world, people can be working and thriving, but if some child goes home and gets his grandpa's gun and shoots a beautiful teacher in the head, if some disgruntled employee who has a criminal record can get a gun at a gun show, what good does it do if you have the best job and the best future in the world? 
   My friend has read the names of people shot down in the prime of their lives. We are supposed to live to our seventies, and a lot of these people are shot down in their teens, in their twenties, or in their thirties. 
   My friend is so right to raise this issue of the Supreme Court. I thank him so much for engaging in this colloquy. 
   I know this talk is hard talk. By the way, it certainly raises our names to the NRA; and that is not easy for us,  either. But the fact is, I believe in my heart that the NRA gives a lot of money to people in Government but there has to be some of us who stand up. I am proud to say every single Democrat, many of whom absolutely believe, as we do, in the right to gun ownership, have stood strong and said we must keep guns out of the hands of children, the mentally unbalanced, and people with criminal records. 
   I say this to my friend: This is a fight we are going to wage on this floor. We are not going to let George Bush hide behind the fact that he says nice things. I am amazed that the polls don't reflect that people know what he stands for, making it possible to carry a concealed weapon into a church--we had a horrible massacre in a Texas church--or into hospitals. Why do you need a gun in a hospital--explain that to me--a place of healing, a place of peaceful recuperation? 
   Why do you need a gun in a church? Why do you need a gun in a hospital? What about an amusement park where there are so many kids around? This makes no sense. He did it because the NRA wanted it done. We have to speak the truth here if we are worth anything. 
   I thank my friend for speaking the truth, for reading the names of those who died, and for bringing this issue day after day to the floor of the Senate. I will be by his side.

   Mrs. BOXER. Again, I thank my friend for connecting the dots. To those Americans who say there is no difference between the parties, there are no issues in this election, that it is a matter of who has the best smile, I say that is not what it is about. 
   It is about issues that impact millions and millions of Americans; 30,000 Americans die every year of gunshots. My friend pointed out that about 13 a day of those are children--children. The Democrats are saying we need sensible gun laws, and our Republican friends are saying we don't need anything, just hang it up in the conference committee and say a few words here and let's move on. We will not let that issue die, if you will, nor the Patients' Bill of Rights and prescription drugs. Again, it is about millions of people. 
   What always fascinates me is my friends on the Republican side--oh, they are tough on law and order. And I agree with them. I am as tough as they come. I will support the death penalty for heinous crimes. But when an HMO kills a patient because they won't approve the appropriate test--and I have seen it time and time again in my State, where tests for cancer were denied because they were expensive diagnostic tests, and HMOs wind up essentially killing a patient because they got treatment too late--they let them off the hook: We don't want the right to sue. Let these people just walk away with maybe a slap on their wrists. 
   Where is the outrage? Where is the outrage when people die because of medical malpractice or an HMO not willing to invest in our people? 
   Take the issue of minimum wage, where people are actually living in poverty. For goodness' sake, some in our military are on food stamps. Yet our friends on the other side will vote for luxury jets to ferry around the generals. I don't know where the shame is. I don't know where the outrage is. I can only say that this is where it is today. It is reflected in the Presidential race, and it is reflected in the Senate races and in the congressional races. 
   I only ask the American people to wake up, regardless of what party they are in, because that doesn't matter to me. These are not partisan issues. These are issues of right and wrong. These are issues of fairness. 
   I really think my friend has connected the dots on several of these issues--the gun issue, the Patients' of Bill of Rights, prescription drugs, minimum wage. What do these have in common? They are all issues that matter to America's families, the way we live, and the kind of life we have. They are crucial issues. No matter what happens in the Senate when the majority leader brings legislation forward--or doesn't--whether we do nothing or we do something, we are going to come home with these issues and talk about them, and we are going to organize around these issues. Otherwise, I don't think we deserve to be here if we are silent in the face of inaction. 
   I thank my friend again for taking this time and for engaging in this colloquy.

   Mrs. BOXER. Again, my friend raises a very crucial issue. I have the paperwork here, and my friend is right on target. George W. Bush's tax cut proposal is $1.7 trillion from 2002 to 2010, and going to his privatized plan for Social Security will cost $1 trillion. My friend said $800 billion; it is $1 trillion. The projected on-budget surplus, if the economy continues to do well--and you never can count on that, but we certainly hope so--is $877 billion, which leaves a $2.7 trillion deficit. We are going to go back into the bad days. 
   So not only are George W. Bush and the Republican Party not wanting to act and make life better by moving forward on the issues about which we talked--the gun issue, prescription drugs, the Patients' Bill of Rights, and the minimum wage. So not only won't they change for the good, they want to go back, and we are going to be facing these horrific deficits, a national debt that will start to soar again, the markets will react with high interest rates, and we will be back into the deepest trouble. We will be bailing ourselves out. 
   I have to say again that by looking at this entire choice we have in this election, it is very interesting. As I listen to my friend, I realize what we face. We face a situation where either we are going to go forward on certain issues but keep fiscal responsibility, or not move on crucial issues that are really life-and-death issues and go back to the days of horrible economic times. 
   We all remember when President Bush went to Japan and threw up his hands and said: What are we going to do? We are in deep trouble. Help us. 
   That was not a high point in American life. Now, with the Clinton-Gore team, we are leading the world, but we will only continue if we don't go back to those bad old days of deficits. 
   I thank my friend.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President. I am delighted today to introduce legislation to restore federal recognition to the Graton Rancheria, which is composed of Coastal Miwok and Southern Pomo tribal members. This bill is identical to legislation that has been introduced in the House of Representatives by Congresswoman LYNN WOOLSEY. It is my great pleasure to carry this legislation in the Senate and to correct an injustice committed against these original inhabitants of the region some 34 years ago. 
   The Coastal Miwok and Southern Pomo Indians flourished in Marin and southern Sonoma counties for many hundreds of years. At the time of European settlement, there were as many as 5,000 of these tribal members. By the end of the 19th Century, however, disease and enforced labor had killed off most of them. And the federal government formally terminated the tribe's identity in 1966 under the California Rancheria Act, after concluding, incorrectly, that virtually all of the members were deceased. 
   The descendants of 12 Graton Rancheria survivors now number over 300, and they refer to themselves as the ``Federated Indians of Graton Rancheria''--after the town in southern Sonoma County where an acre-sized piece of their original reservation is still owned by a Miwok descendant. 
   This legislation not only restores dignity and a sense of identity to the Graton Rancheria, it will restore all federal rights and privileges to the tribal members including health, education, and housing services. It will also permit the Graton Rancheria to maintain an existing cemetery and place of worship. Finally, this bill is unique in that it contains a clause whereby the tribe permanently waives any right to casino-style gambling on their land. 
   Mr. President, the tribes of the Graton Rancheria are an integral and important part of the Bay Area's cultural heritage and history. It was wrong to terminate their status in 1966, and it is only right to restore their formal recognition now. 
   By. Mr. BOND:

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, as the country enters this Memorial Day weekend to pay tribute to those who gave their lives to protect and defend the United States, I come before the Senate to introduce legislation aimed at making it easier for veterans to receive medications through the VA health care system. 
   Right now, VA pharmacies are prohibited from dispensing medications that are prescribed by non-VA practitioners. This means that veterans can not have their prescriptions filled at a VA facility if it is written by their private doctor. Under current law, veterans only have to pay $2 for each 30-day supply of medication supplied by the VA. Therefore, if a veteran needs to have a prescription filled by a non-VA practitioner, it can mean great out-of-pocket expenses. My legislation would change the current system to allow the VA to fill prescriptions that are written by non-VA practitioners. 
   This bill has been endorsed by The American Legion, the National Association of Uniformed Services and the Non-Commissioned Officers Association. I believe it is a common sense approach, and I think we owe it to veterans to make health care as affordable and accessible as possible. 
   Earlier today, I had the pleasure of speaking at the Veterans Washington Rally which was sponsored by the Vietnam Veterans of America, Rolling Thunder, the Jewish War Veterans and other veteran supporters. These veterans were asking for full funding for the VA health care system as spelled out in the Independent Budget, a comprehensive analysis of the VA budget which is prepared each year with the support of several veteran organizations. 
   Veterans are rightly concerned that current budget plans are barely enough to keep up with health care inflation and is nowhere near enough to provide quality emergency and long-term care or begin a serious fight against hepatitis C. I was proud to see these veterans fighting for the benefits and services that are rightly theirs, and I hope we can address their concerns when the Senate considers the VA-HUD appropriations bill later this year. 
   Thank you, Mr. President. And, may God bless all of America's veterans this Memorial Day.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, after long and difficult deliberation, I have decided to vote for permanent normal trade relations with China. The House of Representatives has now passed the bill and I expect the Senate to take it up next month, after the Memorial Day recess. 
   California is the leading state in world trade. Its location on the Pacific Rim makes our relationship with Asia extremely important. 
   During my congressional career, I have supported some of the trade relations proposals we have considered and opposed others. I believe that each trade proposal should be considered on its own, and I do not have an ideological bent on the issue of trade. 
   The decision on this bill--to grant permanent normal trade relations status to China--has been one of the hardest I have ever had to make, because the arguments on both sides have merit. I would like to review in this statement the excellent points made by both sides in the debate. 
   First, with respect to human rights, those opposed to PNTR cite China's continuing terrible human rights record. They argue that by not having annual review of China's trade status, we will lose our strongest leverage to force China to change its behavior. It is also argued that by granting China permanent normal trade relations, we are rewarding and legitimizing the leaders who have such a bad human rights record. Finally, the argument that increased contact with China will improve human rights conditions is undermined by the facts. According to the 1999 State Department Human Rights Report, the Chinese government's human rights record has deteriorated over the past several years, despite increased contacts between China and the United States. 
   But there are human rights advocates who support PNTR for China. They believe that isolating China will be bad for human rights, because the leaders will then be under no outside pressure to change their behavior. They also argue that, over time, people to people contacts through the media, internet and travel will expose the Chinese people to international standards and values and will continue to gradually loosen rigid, authoritarian structures. This is why such esteemed human rights leaders as the Dalai Lama and Wang Dan, on of the Tiananmen Square leaders, support PNTR for China. 
   The human rights concerns are why inclusion of the Levin amendment in the House bill is so important to me. This regime to monitor human rights and worker rights in China will put these issues in sharp focus and will significantly increase our knowledge about whether the Chinese people are making progress in these areas. I commend Congressman LEVIN for his leadership in attaching this important safeguard to the legislation. 
   Second, with respect to the impact of PNTR on American jobs, there are arguments on both sides. Opponents say that bringing China into the World Trade Organization and granting it permanent normal trade status will result in the loss of more than 800,000 jobs in the United States. They believe it will allow multinational corporations to move many operations into China, where worker wages and benefits are much lower, wages being as low as 13 cents an hour. 
   The principal argument in favor of PNTR is that we must pass it in order to get the benefits of the trade agreement negotiated by the Clinton administration last year, which requires China to lower trade barriers and open up the Chinese market to all kinds of American products and services, including many from my State of California. Supporters estimate that implementation of this agreement will increase exports of U.S. goods to China by more than $13 billion per year by 2005. Supporters also argue that granting PNTR to China will give the U.S. the ability to force Chinese compliance with all terms of the trade agreement,  including with WTO-authorized sanctions if necessary. If PNTR is not granted, the U.S. could not avail itself of WTO enforcement procedures. 
   So it is clear that there are strong arguments on both sides of the human rights and workforce/labor issues. 
   But the reason I have decided to vote in favor of permanent normal trade relations status for China is because, first and foremost, I believe that it is my responsibility as a United States Senator to put the national security of the United States above all other considerations. And on the national security question, in my opinion, there is only one rational view. 
   I believe that through engagement with China we have the best opportunity to avoid a cold war type atmosphere, which hung like a cloud over this nation--indeed, the world--for 45 years after World War II. 
   A vote against PNTR would suggest that the U.S. views China as an adversary and would make it much more difficult to engage China to work with us constructively in key strategic areas. Of particular concern to me is China's role in efforts to bring peace and stability to the Korean Peninsula. China encouraged North Korea's compliance with the U.S.-DPRK (North Korea) framework which halted the North's nuclear weapons program, and China will undoubtedly have to be part of any solution that integrates North Korea into the international community. 
   China also plays a key role in the international community's response to the continuing conflict between India and Pakistan. China has in fact condemned both nations for conducting nuclear tests, and has urged them both to conduct no more tests, to avoid deploying or testing missiles, and to work to resolve their differences over Kashmir through dialogue, rather than military action. 
   Finally, China is playing an increasingly active and constructive role in Asian security and stability. U.S. isolation of China would seriously undermine our ability to influence China's future orientation, and would set us on a dangerous path of confrontation. 
   I am under no illusions that granting PNTR to China will make it our new best friend. But failure to do so could well make it an adversary of the sort that we lived with for almost half a century until the fall of the Berlin Wall and the disintegration of the Soviet Union. That is a risk we should not take.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, it is interesting that Senator GRAMS and Senator SANTORUM came to the floor to praise Governor Bush's Social Security plan. I come here to express my deep alarm over this plan and to place into the RECORD the reasons I believe it is very dangerous to the future of this country, to our senior citizens, and to those who really depend on Social Security for themselves or for their aging parents. 
   I think the first question to ask is, What is Social Security? Why is it called security? 
   I used to be a stockbroker. I can tell you that I have seen the smiles when the market goes up, and I have seen the tears when the market goes down. At the time I was a broker, there was a very traumatic period in our history. It was the tragic assassination of our great President John Kennedy. I will never forget, the market was just crashing that day. It went down so much that there was a halt in the trading. Anyone who retired that day, and had an annuity plan, would have been in the deepest trouble. 
   I believe in investments in the stock market. I believe in investments in the bond market. I think it is very important that we let our people know Social Security is not meant to be your full retirement. What it is meant to be--and what it has worked so well as--is a basic foundation, a safety net, not guesswork but a basic return you can expect every month with a check you will get which will meet your basic needs. 
   Let me describe it this way: You have a house. It is very modest, but it is good. It has a roof. It protects you. It is a place where you can be comfortable, warm. It works for you. 
   Maybe you want to add a room to that house. That is wonderful. That is an amenity. That is something additional you could use--a family room, an extra bedroom. But you do not mess with the foundation of the house. You keep that a solid house--that Social Security. Anyone who challenges this idea is making a huge mistake. I will explain why. 
   You do not have to go that far to look at the ultimate result if we just said: People can just have individual accounts and forget Social Security. Because we know that happened in Texas. I will show you what happened in Texas when three counties left Social Security and went into the market and said to their people: We will allow you to deal with your accounts. This isn't theoretical; it has actually happened in Texas. Let me tell you about the Texas example where every single family lost out. 
   It was the same idea Governor Bush has. He started off talking about 2 percent of your Social Security being diverted. As I understand it, last week he said he could foresee a time when everybody has private accounts--100 percent. We know what happened in this experiment. The source here is the U.S. General Accounting Office, February 1999.  
   They did a study of the Texas experiment. This is what happened. Those counties went off Social Security, instead of saying: We will have a supplemental plan, like a 401(k). Keep your Social Security. Let's do a supplemental plan. 
   By the way, around here, a lot of us have a supplemental plan. We have our basic Social Security, and then we have what we call thrift savings, which is added on. That is fine. But we do not mess with Social Security. 
   These counties messed with Social Security. They walked 
   away. This is what happened: The bottom 10 percent of earners, had they stayed in Social Security, would be getting a monthly benefit of $1,125. But in their retirement plan--where they just said forget Social Security, we will have an individual account--they are getting $542 a month. That is utter poverty. If they are in the median, the moderate income, instead of getting $1,488 a month from Social Security, they are getting $810 a month. If they are in the highest income, instead of getting $1,984 a month, they are getting $1,621 a month. 
   So when Senator SANTORUM and Senator GRAMS come to the floor--I say to my friend from Illinois, they have been lauding the Bush plan--I think we have to note that if you took the Bush plan to its ultimate, which he in fact said he could foresee, abandoning Social Security for individual accounts, every family lost, regardless of their income bracket. 
   I do not want to see this for America's families. I do not want to see it. I ask the next question: What happens if we go this route, and people are living in poverty instead of having a social safety net because of this? Do you think Congress would turn its back on the families of America? You know we would not. What would we do? We would say: Oh, my God, we had better bail them out. We have done it before for the savings and loans. We do not want to see people go destitute. 
   Then you have to ask yourself a question: If George Bush is President and he gets this huge tax cut for the wealthy but has used up all the money for that tax cut, where is he going to find the money to do this bailout? Are we going to go back to the days of printing money? We just finally got out of that situation--thank God--where we were running these deficits; we finally got it under control. 
   Let me tell you, this election is a watershed election. This is a risky plan. 
   The women Democratic Senators held a press conference just a few days ago. We decided to look at what this plan would do to women in our Nation. We went to the experts and asked them how they felt about it. This is what one of them said. I want to put his credentials into the mix. This is John Mueller, of Lehrman Bell Mueller Cannon, Inc., a former adviser not to AL GORE, not to BARBARA BOXER, not to DICK DURBIN, but an adviser to Representative Jack Kemp, an adviser to Republican Jack Kemp. This is what John Mueller said:  
   ......the largest group of losers from ``privatizing'' Social Security would be women. This is true for women in all birth-years, all kinds of marital status, all kinds of labor-market behavior, and all income levels.  
   Why does he say this? We went into this in the press conference we women Senators held. I want to try to find that clip so I can share with you why it is a fact that women will suffer. 
   First of all, there is no question that private accounts will lead to the reduction of benefits. Why do I say that? I want to make sure people understand that, because when you divert money away from Social Security into private accounts, what happens? The Social Security fund drops, and we do not have enough money to keep paying those benefits. So benefits would have to be cut. Women live longer, and they count on those benefits, so they would lose more; they would suffer more. 
   Now, here is an irrefutable fact, and the group that analyzed this was the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. With just a 2-percent privatization--in other words, taking 2 percent of your taxes and putting it into an individual account--the trust fund will go broke in the year 2023. That may sound like a long way off, but trust me when I tell you it is not; 20 years is not a lot of time. I remember back to 1980, and it doesn't seem that long ago. Twenty years from now, with the 2-percent privatization that George Bush is calling for, assuming he does nothing to cut the benefits--and he won't admit to that--the trust fund goes broke. 
   Right now, without doing anything, the trust fund is solvent until 2037, so we make this trust fund go broke by many years. That is 14 years sooner that the trust fund is broke. AL GORE has a plan to take the interest payments on the debt he is going to save because he is much more conservative than George Bush in paying down the private debt, which is the bonds. He is going to absolutely make sure we don't have to keep issuing more bonds and we will pay down that debt. His plan keeps the funds solvent until 2050. 
   So let's take a look at the three scenarios. If you do nothing, the fund is solvent until 2037. If you follow the Gore plan, the fund is solvent until 2050. If you do the Bush plan and you don't cut benefits or raise taxes--which he will not tell us what he is going to do--you go bust in 2023. This is from a conservative. We know if you carry this plan to the ultimate extreme and go beyond 2 percent, you essentially know, from looking at what has happened before, people will suffer. You set up a real problem and you may have to do an S&L-type bailout. That is not good. 
   So the women Democratic Members are very clear on all of this. Let me say, in closing--and I know my friend, Senator DURBIN, is anxious to address this issue--I think a robust debate over Social Security is right on target. I think encouraging people to save and put money into the stock market and have a nest egg there is good because I believe that is a good idea. But don't mess with Social Security. If you want to have a supplemental plan, your basic Social Security plus a 401(k), a thrift savings plan, and IRA, added on to the basic safety net, that is just fine. I believe in that. I think it is smart and good. But if you mess with the foundation, you are in a lot of trouble. 
   Senator SCHUMER was talking about this earlier today. He made the point that he is saving for his kids' college education. He decided he needed to have that money, no ifs, ands, or buts. He took that money and put it into the safest Government bond-type of investment because he can't gamble. What happens if on the day he has to start paying those bills the market goes down? We have seen the volatility of these markets. He says: My kids have to go to college. I am not going to tell them they can't go. So, yes, for other types of savings; it is a good idea to invest in markets; but for your basic retirement, don't gamble as they did in Texas. Don't gamble as the candidate for President, George Bush, wants to do. There are a number of us who are sending a letter--and I hope Senator DURBIN will describe it--to Governor Bush asking him to come clean on the details of his plan.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, his plan will take us into the red. Combined with his risky tax scheme, he won't be able to bail out the people. So it is a dangerous idea. Stock market investments are good, but not as a foundation of an insurance plan, which is what Social Security is. 
   You will be hearing a lot more from the women Senators on our side of the aisle on this question because, under the leadership of Senator MIKULSKI, we have set up a checklist where we are going to judge every plan against this checklist that women should be able to count on. We should be able to count on several things: Preserving the Social Security guaranteed lifetime inflation and protecting the benefit; preserving Social Security protections to workers when they are disabled, as well as when they retire, and for workers, spouses, and children, and when workers are disabled, retired or die; three, protect against impoverishment of women by maintaining Social Security's progressive benefit structure;  four, strengthen the financing of the Social Security system while ensuring that women and other economically disadvantaged groups are protected to the greatest degree possible. 
   Look at that plan. Does it further reduce poverty among older women? I told you that his plan does not. We certainly want to see if it includes retirement savings options. Are these options something that will work for women? That is where we are. 
   I will close by repeating a quote from an expert, John Mueller, a former adviser to Representative Jack Kemp, who said:  
   The largest group of losers from ``privatizing'' Social Security would be women. This is true for women in all birth-years, all kinds of marital status, all kinds of labor-market behavior, and all income levels.  
   If you look at this experiment in Texas, everyone lost--all families, women, everyone. Let's not go down this path. We can't afford to do that.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. BOXER. I thank my colleague. Once again, he has explained quite clearly what the risks are to this Bush plan. 
   I was reading some of the quotes that appeared in the press surrounding the Bush plan. I ask my colleague to comment on some of them. 
   Bush's top economic adviser, Lawrence Lindsey, acknowledged somewhat sheepishly he bailed out of the market years ago. He said: That was because of my personal situation. I don't take risks. I hate losing money. 
   That was from the Philadelphia Inquirer: I don't take risks; I hate losing money. 
   I think that reflects certain people are more conservative. Others are willing to take a risk. 
   The point my colleague and I have tried to make is that we think it is fine if you want to take a risk with certain accounts you have, but you don't want to risk the foundation of your retirement, the safety net of your retirement. You want to count on that. 
   Bush's top economic adviser is saying he hates losing money, and yet the person he advises is essentially putting money at risk for other people. 
   I want to mention something else. The word ``privatization'' is a good word. I like it. It is similar to the word ``deregulation.'' It is a nice word. Everybody likes ``privatization.'' It is a nice word that indicates individual control. Of course, much of what we do in our life is privatization. We have our own accounts, whether they are savings accounts, or we own bonds, and we direct them. However, Social Security is a little bit different. It is the foundation. 
   The Houston Chronicle reported that Bush said on Tuesday, his plan to create private savings accounts could be the first step toward a complete privatization of Social Security. That would be the end of a program that has worked for 70 years. There is more at stake than a 2-percent diversion of funds. 
   Finally, the New York Times reports, when answering the question about his plan, Mr. Bush said the Government could not go from one regime to another overnight. It is going to take a while to transition to a system where personal savings accounts are the predominant part of the investment vehicle. When he is asked by the Dallas Morning News, would beneficiaries receive less money, he says: Maybe; maybe not. 
   I ask my friend for his comments on the volatility of the stock market expressed by Bush's own top economic adviser, the fact that this could be the first step toward the end of Social Security, and the fact that George Bush cannot answer today whether anyone would have to take a cut in your benefits.

   Mrs. BOXER. If my friend will yield further, I understand Senator GRAMS came down and quoted me as saying I like the idea of people investing in the market. I do. But not taking it away from the foundation of Social Security. Social Security is that foundation. As my friend pointed out, this is really serious. 
   Since Governor Bush is now saying he envisions the day when we don't have any more Social Security, when it would all be private accounts--that is not Social Security. He is right to point out: What happens to those of us who have worked our 40 quarters? There would be nothing going into the Social Security fund to pay those benefits. What does that mean? We are not going to let those people go poor; everyone knows that. The pressure will be on us. We will bail out the system. 
   If you take it a step further and look at his $2 trillion tax cut, where is he going to get the money? He will print it. We will go back to those days his father oversaw, with $300 billion deficits which added to the national debt. As my friend well knows, we had more debt in the Reagan-Bush years than we had from George Washington to Ronald Reagan. 
   We do not want to go back to those days. We don't want to go back to those days when our President had to go visit another country to find out how to run the economy. Those were  bad days for this Nation--bad, bad days. It took us a long time to get out of it. A lot of people lost their seats around here because they had the courage to vote to balance this budget. It did not take courage to vote for a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution. It did take courage, however, to vote to actually balance the budget. It meant some tough stuff. 
   I want to ask my friend, we have a colleague on this side of the aisle who says: Yes, we ought to go into privatizing Social Security. But he is one of the most courageous and straightforward colleagues, Senator BOB KERREY. What does he say about it? He says if you are going to go that route, this is what you have to do: Raise the retirement age. 
   My friend has already pointed out we have raised it to 67 over time. What is it going to be, 75? People will die long before they get their checks or they will be too old to really appreciate it. We don't want to see that happen, raising the retirement age after people worked so hard, and then make them work longer, or raise taxes on the Social Security that you get, or on your interest from these personal accounts. Raise taxes, raise their retirement age, lower benefits--you have to do a combination of those things. 
   I have to say, there are a lot of things we do around here that are not very good. But would my friend not agree we have a good system here that has lasted through time--70 years, as he points out? It is a basic retirement, a basic safety net. 
   One last point I would make for my friend to comment on. Around here we are like everybody else; we want to make sure we can take care of our families. I think what we do around here is a good system. We have had Social Security since the 1980s. We decided to make sure we paid in. We have Social Security retirement as our basic foundation, and then, if we want, we can add a thrift savings plan. So, yes, we can pick out investing in the market--or, by the way, Government bonds, or corporate bonds--in addition to our Social Security. 
   That will be my last question to my friend. We know it is good to not put all your eggs in one basket, but we also think it is important to have a basic account, No. 1; No. 2, don't go back to the bad old days of these yearly deficits that were dragging our economy down. Yes, you want to add something to sweeten your retirement pie, take a little risk with it. We know some people who have taken some risks and didn't do too well; others have done very well. That is fine. Don't mess with the foundation of the house. If you want to add a room, fix it up. That is great. But don't mess with the foundation.

    Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, on the second Saturday of each May, letter carriers across the United States collect food donations on their postal routes to deliver to community food banks, shelters and pantries. I commend the National Association of Letter Carriers (NALC) for creating and sponsoring the largest one-day food drive in the country with over 100,000 letter carriers participating in more than 10,000 cities and towns. 
   Not only do America's postal workers perform an important function in our economy and in our daily lives, they make a difference in improving the lives of needy citizens. I extend my appreciation and thanks to NALC's leaders and members for their dedication and commitment to their strong tradition of community service. 
   The food drive started as small pilot program in 10 cities and, as a result of its huge success, was expanded nationwide. The program asks postal patrons to place a box or bag of food next to their mailboxes. The food is picked up, sorted at postal stations and then delivered to area food banks by letter carriers. 
   I am pleased to note that in my home state, the California State Association of Letter Carriers was among those state associations which donated the largest amount of food in the national drive. It is my hope that during the month of May and throughout the year, Americans will consider becoming involved in the NALC Food Drive and in other activities serving the less fortunate in our communities.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I stand in support of the Daschle amendment. I want to get back to what it says. We heard a lot of excited debate, but here is what the Daschle amendment says. 
   No. 1, we commend the million moms--by the way, I think there were more than a million people across this country--for exercising their rights to gather and to send a very strong message to the Congress; in this case: Save our children, stop the violence; stop the mayhem; stop the school shootings; stop the church shootings; do what we are supposed to do. 
   It was a very clear message. We commend them today. 
   Second, the Daschle amendment says bring back the five sensible gun laws that passed the Senate already, get that conference to meet, get the juvenile justice to meet, and send those laws to the President for his signature. Very, very simple. 
   What does the other side say? I ask with great respect the Members on the other side who are great debaters. I was here last night until quite late, listening and debating. 
   The other side says no laws are needed, a change in behavior is needed. They said: Laws don't change behavior. I will take that to its logical conclusion. If laws don't change behavior, why do we have laws against murder? Why do we have laws against rape? Why do we have laws that regulate products so when our kids pick up a doll, they don't choke on it? We do it to protect our citizens. 
   We are a government of laws, not men. That was stated by our founders. It is a basic foundation of our Nation. I believe personally that guns should not be in the hands of children. 
   Children and guns do not mix. I believe, personally, that anyone who is mentally unbalanced should not have a weapon because they do not know what they are doing. We heard from a woman who said, ``My brother is a manic schizophrenic and he has threatened my family. I do not know what to do because he could go to a gun show, get a gun, and kill my child.'' So I believe mentally unbalanced people should not have guns. I also believe criminals should not have access to weapons. 
   That is what the people on this side of the aisle are trying to do. If you are a responsible adult, yes, you can have that weapon. If you have responsibility and you understand what you are doing, that is one thing. But if you are not responsible, no way; that is it. 
   What is so controversial about that? My friend says, if there is a murder with a weapon, put that person away. Of course, put that person away. Enforcement is up in this Nation.

   Mrs. BOXER. I thank Senator MURRAY, and I thank the Chair. 
   It has been more than a year since the Columbine tragedy, but still this Republican Congress refuses to act on sensible gun legislation. 
   Let me repeat that. It has been more than a year since the Columbine tragedy and this Republican Congress refuses to do anything as it relates to sensible gun legislation. That is why Leader DASCHLE offered his amendment. 
   Since Columbine, thousands of Americans have been killed by gunfire. Until we act, Democrats in the Senate will read some of the names of those who died in the past year, and we will continue to do so every day that the Senate is in session. We will read those who died of gunshots. In the name of those who died, we will continue this fight. 
   The following are the names of some of the people who were killed by gunfire 1 year ago today. These names come from the Conference of Mayors: James Allen, 27, Houston, TX; Ladrid Austin, 21, Chicago, IL; Jeremiah Buchanan, 22, Houston, TX; Karamoh Daramy, 23, Detroit, MI; Rufus Dinuwelle, 50, Charlotte, NC; Maurice Harris, 27, St. Louis, MO; Raul Martinez, 27, Chicago, IL; Marty Owens, 31, Chicago, IL; Andre Parker, 19, Chicago, IL; George Robinson, 39, Houston, TX; Robert Simms, 30, Washington, DC; Jon Vermillion, 32, Houston, TX. 
   Those are some of the names. We will be here every single day until there is action. The other side is going to say: Shame on you for interfering with the Senate's business. 
   I say to them: There can be no more important business than protecting our children, than protecting our citizens. We are losing them at alarming rates, more than any other civilized country. Indeed, all the other civilized countries combined 
   don't have the deaths from gunshots that we have in this country--30,000 of our good people every year. 
   The other side says it is not about laws; it is about community and caring and family. Of course, they are right. But I say to them that those young kids who were cut down before their prime in Columbine came from good families. They prayed to God. They got down on their knees and prayed, and they were shot. 
   To be scolded on the floor of the Senate for defending our children is something that will not stand. I am glad the good Senator put up the chart from the Million Mom March because when I look at that, I think to myself, there is hope. 
   The Senator implies that we have before us an agenda on licensing of guns. We do not have that. That is not in Senator Daschle's amendment. He is calling for the release of the five gun amendments we already voted on, simple, straightforward: trigger locks, no high-capacity clips, a study of the gun manufacturers' techniques as they sell to children, raising the age where a person can buy an assault weapon from 18 to 21. Those are simple and straightforward.  
   Closing the gun show loophole is another. The woman who got the guns for the deranged children who murdered those kids said if she had to go through a background check, she never, never would have, in fact, bought those guns. 
   So please don't chastise us. It was the other side that stalled for 5 solid hours yesterday and didn't let us have our debate. We would have been done with this debate. 
   I have to say, when we look at these numbers, 12 kids a day, 30,000 people a year, it is almost too much to comprehend the pain and suffering that goes along with it. Eight times as many as those people are wounded, sitting in wheelchairs for the rest of their lives, some of them vegetables for the rest of their lives. We don't even begin to touch it when we talk about only the deaths. It is the physical pain and agony of those who survive with wounds, and we have seen in Columbine children committing suicide because they can't handle the trauma. What is the answer of the other side? We don't need laws. Why don't they think about licensing?

   Mrs. BOXER. I will take a deep breath to see where we are in this great body. 
   Senator DASCHLE, on behalf of many Members on this side and on behalf of 750,000 moms and their families, offered a very simple amendment to the bill. By the way, that happens all the time or should happen all the time around here. He offered a simple amendment to a bill commending the Million Mom March and simply asking that the conference committee that is taking up the juvenile justice bill release that bill, bring it back with the five sensible gun laws, and send it to the President for his signature. These five sensible gun laws are to stop the killing, the violence that is happening in our streets, in our cities, in our suburbs and our rural areas, in our schools, even in our churches, even in our Jewish community centers, a simple, straightforward amendment. 
   The majority leader said today he didn't see it coming. What was coming? An amendment, a simple, straightforward amendment. The majority leader acted as if he was hurt to the core that this amendment would be offered. 
   Let me say with great affection to the majority leader, he shut the Senate down for 5 hours yesterday because he didn't want to vote on that simple, straightforward amendment commending the Million Mom March and asking that conference committee to come back with the legislation. He shut the Senate down for 5 hours. It took 24 hours until we were able to vote. Might I just say when we thought we were ready to vote, he made a point of order that hasn't occurred in 16 years to try to do away with that vote. He wonders why those on this side felt we were being gagged. 
   On the bright side, we won that vote today. The Senate has gone on record for the second time--the first time with the Reed amendment, and the second time with the Daschle amendment--to bring five sensible gun laws to this body for action. The Senate has spoken. The majority leader made light of it and said, ``No one really cares about it. It is a sense-of-the-Senate amendment.'' That isn't being respectful of the Members here, a few of  whom crossed over from that side of the aisle. I thank those three or four who did so. I think the majority leader is wrong to think the conference committee would not listen. I hope it will. 
   One of the things the majority leader said is we want to get to the ``real'' bills. I close with this: Is the majority leader implying that it is not a ``real'' tragedy when 12 children are shot down and killed every day? Does the majority not think it is a real issue, it is a real concern, when 30,000 Americans are killed every year--300,000-plus over the last 11 years, and 8 times as many injured, many in wheelchairs, suffering posttraumatic stress. 
   This has been an emotional couple of days for this Senator. This is the Senate. We should not be gagged. We should be heard.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I had a tremendous honor this weekend to march in the Million Mom March, along with about 750,000 citizens of this great country. They were moms; they were dads; they were grandmas and grandpas; and children in strollers. 
   We really all had in our hearts one wish for Mother's Day--to turn around the gun violence that is plaguing our Nation. 
   It was quite a march. It was quite an event because the emotion was high. The spirits were high. Perhaps the most touching part of it, for me and for many others, was the presence of so many moms and dads whose families have been touched by gun violence, whose children have been killed by gun violence, cut down by gun violence, maimed by gun violence. 
   The victims were there with a message: That they want to make sure other families never have feelings of pain and loss and anguish which will last all their lives. 
   I am embarrassed to say to my constituents that this Congress has done nothing--nothing at all--to reduce gun violence in our country. After Columbine, we passed five sensible gun measures--very modest, good, sensible gun measures--such as making sure every handgun is sold with a safety lock, 
   and others that are very sensible: closing the gun show loophole so that a mentally imbalanced person or a criminal cannot walk into a gun show and simply be handed a gun--hand the cash over and get the gun with no background check. 
   We know the background checks work, but they don't apply to gun shows. So Senator LAUTENBERG offered a very important amendment and it was added to the juvenile justice bill to close that gun show loophole. Vice President AL GORE cast the tie-breaking vote. We know that will keep guns out of the criminals' hands. But what has happened in this Senate? Nothing. The power of the gun lobby can be felt in this Chamber--the power of the money of the gun lobby, the power of the threat of the gun lobby, and the gun lobby rules in this Senate, the gun lobby rules in the House of Representatives, and the gun lobby says if one of the candidates is elected President--namely, George Bush--they will run an office out of the White House. 
   Mr. President, enough is enough. Let's look at the deaths from gun violence in our country. There were 58,168 deaths in Vietnam over 11 years. They were tragic deaths. People were cut down in the prime of their lives. In 11 years, there were 58,168 deaths. Let's look at the last 11 years in America--the war on our streets, the war in our schools and, yes, even the war in our churches and Jewish community centers, where gunmen come in and cut people down in the prime of their lives; and they cut children down. There were 395,441 gun deaths in the 11-year period. 
   Now, we stopped the war in Vietnam--Democrats, Republicans, Independents, people of every race, color, and creed. We stopped that war. We can stop this war. But I will tell you, it isn't going to be easy. The gun lobby is not going to make it easy. We have to have courage. There are those of us in this Senate who are going to be on this floor from now on, in the name of the million moms who marched with the dads, the grandmas, the grandpas, and the children. We are going to be here. We are going to be here day after day. We are going to force this Senate to look this issue in the eye, to look families in the eye, to bring out the five sensible gun control measures that are in the juvenile justice bill. What excuse is there since Columbine High School, where 13 people were killed? Thirteen kids are killed every day. 
   Thank you, Mr. President. We will be back on this issue.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I thank the majority leader for getting us to a place where we can in fact consider the Daschle amendment, which simply says that on Mother's Day an estimated 750,000 mothers, fathers, and children united for the Million Mom March on The Mall in Washington, and they were joined by tens of thousands of others in 70 cities across America in a call for a meaningful, commonsense policy. 
   Essentially what this amendment says is that the organizers of the Million Mom March should be commended for rallying to demand sensible gun safety legislation and that Congress should immediately pass a conference report which will include the meaningful, sensible gun laws that were passed here in the Senate as part of the juvenile justice bill. 
   I had the privilege and honor of marching with so many American families of so many diverse backgrounds and so many Americans of different ages all united in a call for a safer America. 
   I am very pleased that my leader, Senator DASCHLE, has placed this amendment before the body. I hope all Members will vote for it. 
   I see that the Republican side has responded with a litany of attacks on President Clinton, which I think is most inappropriate. This should be a time when we reach across the aisle and say we want safety for our children. I hope maybe they will reconsider. 
   Believe me when I tell you that the million moms and their families are not Democrats, Republicans, or independents; they are Americans. Many were touched by violence in their families and violence in their communities. 
   At this time, I ask the Senator from Massachusetts, Mr. KENNEDY, if he would like to take up to 30 minutes to discuss these amendments. If so, I will now yield up to 30 minutes to the Senator from Massachusetts.

   Mrs. BOXER. I thank my friend from Maryland. It was an honor to march with her and to stand with her. She brings to the Senate a sense of reality for our families, our seniors, and our children. She fights for them every day. She is fighting for them tonight. 
   With that, I yield up to 30 minutes to the Senator from Massachusetts, Mr. KENNEDY.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I simply want to say to my friend that everything he said was true, except one small point. He said it has been 2 hours. It has been since 2 o'clock, I say to my friend from Massachusetts. They delayed for 5 hours the simple vote to say to moms who gave up their Mother's Day and came here: Thank you for what you are doing.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I thank my friend for his remarks. I know he watched with great pride while KERRY, KENNEDY, Cuomo, and Kathleen Kennedy Townsend spoke at the Million Mom March with hearts full. I know the people who came to that march, particularly those who witnessed and experienced pain, loss, and suffering have inspired people across the country. 
   I say to my friend, before I yield time to my friend from Illinois, that he is powerful on this issue. He is a powerful spokesperson for the children of this Nation. I was so happy he chose to come over here tonight. It is late in the evening. I know we will work together, as so many of us will on this side of the aisle, and hopefully a couple from the other, in making sure those moms who gave up their Mother's Day for a cause that is so important will be commended by this Senate. For goodness' sake, will be commended. As Hillary Clinton said, they did not care about the flowers; they did not care about the fancy dinners or breakfast in bed. They gave up their Mother's Day to march for something that was very important to them, more important than anything else: the safety of their children and the safety of the communities' children. 
   I say to my friend, thank you for making this point over and over. The other side seems to be fearful of these moms. Why don't they vote down our resolution if they do not like it? No, they stalled 5 hours because they wanted the clock to tick, and they are not even here to debate us on this amendment. 
   We voted out sensible gun measures. What are they afraid of, I ask my friend from Massachusetts? Sensible gun measures passed the Senate--child safety locks, background checks at gun shows, the banning of the superlarge capacity clips, a study to investigate how the gun manufacturers are marketing to our children, and changing the age at which one can buy an assault weapon from 18 to 21. A few of them crossed over, and this Senate voted for those measures. 
   Before my friend leaves, I want to ask him this question, and then I will yield as much time as he would like to the Senator from Illinois. I wonder if my friend can explain to me, because he has been around here a long time, of what are they afraid? Why don't they just vote it down? Why don't they just say: No, we don't want to commend the moms; no, we don't want to bring these 
   commonsense gun laws to the Senate? Why are they using every parliamentary trick not to have to vote on that?

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I think the Senator makes a very important point here. When we call for sensible gun laws, the other side gets up and says we can handle it all with enforcement. Do you know what we say? Excellent idea--enforcement and sensible gun laws. Let's join hands and do it all; that is what we need to protect our people. Yet as my friend says, when he attempted to do just that, the other side found fault with it. 
   I want to ask my friend if he is aware of what the Republican Appropriations Committee did on the House side with a number of Capitol Police officers? 
   I know my friend is just as distressed. I discussed this with him. 
   We lost two beautiful Capitol Police officers. What were they doing? They  were protecting the people in this building. They were protecting the Members of the House and the Senate, and they were shot down in the prime of their lives. They have magnificent families. We went to a funeral. We all cried. Republicans and Democrats cried tears. Now what happens? The people who want the enforcement, what have they done on the House side?

   Mrs. BOXER. The old expression is hackneyed now but ``actions speak louder than words.'' I think when you stand up on the floor and you say, ``More enforcement, more enforcement,'' then you cut 400 police officers out of this Capitol Police Force, and you go to Senator DURBIN's resolution on hiring more agents so we can crack down on the gun criminals, it doesn't add up. Something is not adding up here. 
   I have to say it is time we just spoke very directly about it. It is hard. It is hard to pick a fight, and it is hard to get into an argument and debate on the other side of the aisle because we don't control this Senate. But we have our rights. Senator DURBIN represents a very large State. I represent a very large State. People sent us here not to just sit back and do nothing but in fact to speak out. 
   I thank my friend, and he can continue for as long as he wishes tonight.

   Mrs. BOXER. This is very brief. I have been touched reading some of the comments that have come via the Internet on the Million Mom March web site. I simply read two which I think indicate why the Democratic proposal commending the Million Mom March is so on target. It speaks for so many people across America. I want to get a quick response from my colleague to these two very brief statements. 
   A woman from Mount Royal, NJ, writes:  
   I wholeheartedly support the Million Mom March. I lost my 25-year-old son in November of 1999 to a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head. I firmly believe that he would still be here today if there would not have been a gun available to him. My prayers go out to all those who are marching on Washington.  
   And Elizabeth from North Carolina writes:  
   Five years ago my sister was murdered by her ex-husband in a courthouse that had no metal detectors. She had warned the court of his threats and they took his guns away. But because of the easy access to guns, he just went out and got another. And he used it to kill her in front of their 6-year-old child.  
   She says to the million moms:  
   God bless all of you for walking in this march and raising awareness of the horrible problem we have with gun violence on behalf of my sister and her child. I thank you all for caring.  
   I say to my friend before he leaves the floor tonight--he has been so generous to share his tremendous wisdom--isn't the reason the Democratic proposal, which praises the million moms for doing what they did, makes sense because people such as these have felt so alone? Is that my friend's perspective?

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I don't intend to use the entire time. At the appropriate moment, I will be happy to make that unanimous consent request. 
   I want to say to the Senator from Wyoming I really enjoyed listening to him, and much of what he said I agree with. But I have to say that, as my friend explained the needs of our communities to be closer and the needs of our children to be paid attention to and to be taught respect and accountability and love, he is very right. 
   But I might say to my friend that every day in this country 12 children are cut down by gunfire. Most of them come from families who love them, come from families who respect them, come from families who have taught them the values of love and community and country. 
   So I say to my friend from Wyoming, who told some very tender stories about how good most of the youth are in this country--and I agree with him--a lot of those wonderful young people are being shot in schools and in churches. There seems to be no limit today on what can happen. So he can speak about the need to be close with our families. He is exactly right. Most of us are. But for those who are alienated, who don't have that love, why should the rest of the children pay the price and fear for their lives? 
   In some of our communities, if you ask those children, I say to my friend, the sad reality, for whatever reason, is that they are afraid. Many of them know someone who has been cut down by gunfire. 
   So I say, yes, the world he paints is a world I want for every child in America--a loving family, the ability to feel secure, the ability to feel responsibility, the ability to feel confidence. But also, I might add, if we don't pass sensible gun laws--and my friend doesn't want any more sensible gun laws--no matter what type of families our children come from, they are not protected. 
   I also want to address the point of my friend from Wyoming on why we are doing this on the military construction bill. Over on the House side, I served on the Armed Services Committee, and I know how important that bill is. I want to make it clear to my friends that the Democratic leader, TOM DASCHLE, didn't want to go this route. He asked unanimous consent to bring up the gun amendments that passed the Senate and are trapped in the conference committee, take them up immediately, and resolve them, and pass them in honor of the moms who  gave up their Mother's Day to come here and express themselves. 
   The Republican side said no. They objected. So what choice did he have but to offer up an amendment? 
   I say to my friend that the Republican leadership waited 5 full hours before they allowed us to be heard on the subject of sensible gun laws; 5 full hours before we could offer our amendment and be heard on our amendment which commends the moms for coming out on a day when they could have had breakfast in bed, have gotten flowers, and been treated to dinner, to say thank you for being selfless as moms are. That is what you learn when you are a mom--how to be selfless. 
   As my friend pointed out, military construction is funded for 4 more months. We are not up against any clock--4 more months. Would it hurt us to take a few hours to pay tribute to those moms who worked so hard to organize that march of 750,000 strong, and thousands across the country adding up to more than a million moms? By the way, plenty of dads, too; plenty of grandmas; plenty of grandpas; plenty of daughters and sons. Would it hurt us? My God, in the 5 hours the Republicans stalled before we could get to this measure, we could have had the debate and could have voted on it. Who is wasting time? 
   The Democratic leader said let's just take this matter up and vote it out. He would have agreed to a very short time limit. But, no, 5 hours of delay. So here it is 5 minutes to 9. 
   You know what. I am grateful we are taking this up. I am grateful even if it is late at night. Even if I have some other things to do, it doesn't matter at all. We will take it up tomorrow as well. By the way, we will take it up again, and we will take it up again, and we will take it up again because too many people are dying in our country. How many? Let's take a look. 
   We have a war at home. It is a war in our streets. It is a war in our schools. In Vietnam, we lost 58,168 of our people. This country came to its knees. We wanted to end the war. The vast majority of people thought it was a mistake. Republicans, Democrats, and Independents marched. And President Nixon ended the war in Vietnam. That is 11 years. 
   Let's look at what happened in the last 11 years in our Nation--395,441 people have been shot down by gunfire. That is from the National Census for Health Statistics. 
   We have a war here at home. It is shocking to look at that, isn't it? I find it so. 
   That is why we are going to come back again and again. It is not easy to be here late at night. But I think we are going to have to do that because we have to face it. 
   Let's look at murder by handguns compared to other countries. A lot of people say, well, this is just the way it is in a society that is free. I would argue that Japan, Great Britain, and Canada are free countries. They are our allies. They are democracies. By the way, in Canada, murder by handguns per 1 million population is .12 per 1 million; .51, 3.64 in Canada. And in the United States, it is 35.05. 
   What is wrong? My friend from Wyoming talked about lack of community. He is certainly right on that point. But why is it always in this debate either/or? Why don't we want to work on that issue of community, work on those issues of respect for families, and work on those issues that we have to work on--yes, in the media--and also face one fact, that the only product in this country that has not one safety regulation is guns? Does that make sense to you? 
   In 1968, after the tragic assassination of Robert Kennedy--killed, shot down in the prime of life, who might have been our next President, shot down in the prime of life 
   with an imported handgun--this Congress acted to ban Saturday night specials from being imported. As I remember, some of my colleagues who are still here on the other side of the aisle voted for that. But guess what they didn't vote for. They didn't vote to ban Saturday night specials from being made in America. So if you try to import a Saturday night special, you can't do it. You can't import a handgun. But guess what. They are made all over this country, particularly in my own home State. I am proud to tell you that recently with a new California Legislature and a new Governor, we have banned those Saturday night specials in California. 
   We are making progress. We are making progress. I am very proud of that. 
   After Columbine High School, this Senate gathered, and all said we are going to work together. We passed five sensible gun laws. They are so modest. They are so sensible. They passed this Senate and closed the gun show loophole that allows criminals to go to a gun show and not have to have a background check. It would have made a difference in Columbine. The woman who got the guns for those kids said so. It would ban the importation of high-capacity clips which are used in semiautomatic assault weapons. That is the Feinstein amendment. The first one is the Lautenberg amendment. Requiring child safety devices be sold with every handgun is the Kohl amendment. It requires that the FTC and the Attorney General study the extent to which the gun industry markets to juveniles. That was my amendment. I will talk more about it. It makes it illegal to sell or give a semiautomatic assault weapon to anyone under the age of 18. That was written by a Republican Member of this Senate, Senator ASHCROFT. Those amendments passed. And they are languishing in a conference committee that doesn't even meet. 
   On April 20, 1999, the Columbine High School shooting stunned America. On May 11, a month later, the Senate begins debate on those gun measures. On May 20, just a month after Columbine, this Senate passed a juvenile justice bill by a vote of 73-25 that included those five sensible gun control amendments that I talked about. 
   The Senate and House go to conference 3 months after Columbine, and guess what. That was July. There is one meeting of the conferees. Here we are more than a year after Columbine and we have done zero, nothing, nada. 
   I am embarrassed to face my constituents. I was embarrassed to face these marching moms and look them in the eye. It is not their job to pass legislation. Hello. It is our job. It is not their job. It is our job. What are we doing? Nothing, zero, zip. I am embarrassed about that. I am angry about that. 
   I tell you that there are a number of us who are not going to go away on this point. We will be back here. That is why I say to the Presiding Officer sitting in the Chair today that we chose to move forward on this bill. We tried to get a separate resolution. We offered it. The Republicans said no. I don't know, I just do not know why the fear is in this Chamber about voting this thing up or down. All we said is commend the Million Mom March for what they did. It is the American way--standing up and being counted. 
   Moms attended who are Republicans, Democrats, Independents, some who don't have any affiliation whatever with politics, many of whom are never political. They want Congress to act. We do nothing. 
   I hope these moms continue to work on this matter, to connect this political process with the facts and the realities of the deaths that go on day after day after day after day. 
   We had a hearing the day after the Million Mom March and an art teacher from Columbine spoke. With a trembling voice she told us what it was like to be in that library, to tell the kids: Go under your desk. Call 9-1-1. 
   She said: I used to be in favor of no gun laws and now I am here asking you to act because I don't want anyone else to suffer in this way. 
   I talked about the five commonsense measures. I think the one that I wrote is very important. We learned when we looked at the cigarette industry how they marketed to kids. We have to realize how the gun industry is marketing to kids. Here is an ad in ``Gun World'': ``Start 'em Young! There is no time like the present.'' Here is a child, definitely under 18. It is a toy gun that looks like a real handgun. Now, under the laws today you can't buy a handgun in a licensed dealer shop until you are 21 years of age and you can't buy it from anybody, including a gun show, until you are 18. Here is a young man: ``Start 'em Young!" 
   Let's take a look at what some of the gun people say about marketing: ``.....greatest threat we face is the lack of a future customer base.....''; ``.....we continue to look for every opportunity to reach young people.....''; ``Building  the next generation of customers takes work and commitment. But it must be done.'' 
   Sound familiar. 
   Let's hear what the tobacco companies said in the documents we found through the lawsuits. We will hear how the tobacco company and the gun companies sound alike. 
   Tobacco company documents: ``If our company is to survive and prosper, over the long-term we must get our share of the youth market.'' ``Today's teenager is tomorrow's potential regular customer.'' 
   This sounds very familiar. 
   Here are the gun companies: ``.....greatest threat we face is the lack of a future customer base.....''; ``.....we continue to look for every opportunity to reach young people.....'' 
   Are they trying to reach young people? I argue they are. 
   We no longer see Joe Camel. Because of the lawsuits, tobacco companies agreed to stop using a cartoon character to lure kids to their product. Well, here is Eddie Eagle. If all Eddie Eagle did was to promote safety, it would be one thing, but it is absolutely a way to get kids interested in guns at a young age. ``Start 'em Young!'' begins to take on new meaning. 
   Here is a photograph from a gun magazine. This child is 4 years old and he is watching an adult load a handgun-- ``Start 'em Young!" 
   This is a very pressing issue. That is why we offered this amendment. We thank the moms for coming here. We call on our colleagues to free that juvenile justice bill and pass these laws. 
   My friend from Wyoming, in his opening remarks, said the people in his State don't want any laws. Quoting him the 
   best I can, the Senator from Wyoming said: You can't make people behave. We don't need a bunch of laws. 
   Let's take that to its logical conclusion. You can't make people behave; you don't need a bunch of laws. OK. Should we have no laws against murder because you can't make people behave? Should we have no laws against rape because you can't make people behave? Should we have no laws on the books that say if you drive a car you have to have a license? 
   And the NRA takes out an ad and says, by the way, licensing a car doesn't save kids from getting hurt. They have to look both ways when they cross the street. 
   There is another either/or strawman. Of course, you have to look both ways when you cross the street. But if the driver didn't have to get a license and couldn't see and went up on the sidewalk, you would get killed. So what is this either/or? You don't need laws to make people behave? You want to repeal the laws for getting a license to drive? You want to repeal the laws on registering a car? Yes, you can look both ways, but if the guy's brakes don't work, you are hit. So we keep setting up these either/ors. It is not about either/or. Look both ways, yes. But also make sure that your driver is licensed, the car is registered, it is safe, he or she can see, can hear, and can drive. 
   With this refrain that laws can't make people behave, if you take it to its logical conclusion, we wouldn't have any laws at all. We wouldn't have a country that was a country of laws. That is, by the way, what makes America the greatest country in the world because we are a country of laws, not men; I add, we are a country of laws, not men or women. 
   We have laws for safe toys; we have laws for safe products. We have the safest products in the world. Not because people are wonderful. Yes, some are; they would never make an unsafe product; they wouldn't do it. But some people aren't wonderful and we have to protect our people from those people who would make a shoddy product. Guess what. We have the safest products in the world. 
   The only product that is not regulated that I know of is a domestically produced handgun. If you try to import it, there are safety standards. But not if you make it here. 
   I would say to my friend, I do not agree with him. If he does not think laws make people behave, I don't know exactly what we are doing here. We do pass laws every day to protect our people. Laws are the bedrock of a civilized society. 
   The NRA took out a full-page ad--the same one where they said when you license a driver or register a car you do not make our kids any safer--so I already think I addressed that. But they also basically said: What kind of mother would march? This is a political agenda. 
   I wish those NRA members who wrote that ad could have been at the Million Mom March. I have been in politics all my life. I have to say, these people were authentic American moms, dads, grandmas, grandpas, aunts, uncles, sisters, brothers, daughters. Do you know why they were there? They said it: Enough is enough. Enough is enough. Many of them had lost children, relatives; they feel the pain; they feel the hurt. They are scarred forever. Many of them knew people who were injured, who were paralyzed for life. Enough is enough. That is why they came. That is why they marched. They could have stayed home, had their breakfast in bed once a year for Mother's Day, but they chose not to do it. I am proud of them. 
   For the National Rifle Association to take out an ad condemning those mothers is an insult to the women of this country. By the way, they were women from every political party imaginable, every age, every ethnic group. It was the most amazing picture. People out there saying: Enough is enough. 
   They want us to act. So, yes, I think it is worth a couple of days of debate in the memory of the almost 400,000 Americans shot dead by gunfire in the last 11 years. I think it is worth a couple of days of debate to say, in the name of these 395,441 people, that we will take a few hours; that we will commend the Million Mom March; that we will encourage them to keep on fighting for what they believe in--a safe America. 
   Many years ago, when I first got into politics, I was involved in trying to ensure that my children, who are now old enough to take care of me, had a safe future. We were embroiled in that Vietnam war for years and years. There was a bumper strip that came out and a lot of people put it on their cars. It said: Imagine peace. Because the war had gone on so long it was hard to imagine what it would be like, not to have this divisive war, where Americans were arguing with one another, where generations were having debates until most of the country came around and believed it was wrong. 
   I think we need to have a new bumper strip that says: Imagine an America with no gun violence. Maybe every day we could think about what it would be like to put on the television set at night and not hear story after story: A child goes to the zoo and shoots a gun and hurts a child; a 6-year-old brings a gun to school and shoots a 5-year-old; two high school kids go into their high school and kill people randomly. Every day 12 children die. Imagine what it would be like to turn on the television at night and not have to hear these stories. God, what a wonderful thing it would be for our Nation. 
   I will say this. If we take the attitude that laws do not mean anything, then we are giving up. We could stand up here, as many nights as we could, and say how much we need to feel a sense of community and how much mothers and fathers have to work 
   with their children and how important it is that we respect each other and admire each other and love each other and come together as a community--and, my God, we should say that. 
   But we cannot stop there. Because the mothers who grieve for their children every day in America love their children and they gave their children values and their children went off to school and they never came home. So you can stand here, day after day and say that it is about a sense of community, and I will agree with every word that you say. But that does not mean we do not have the responsibility to protect the good children and the good families. We can do it. Five sensible gun laws that we have already passed here, seeing how we market to children, making sure we do not import those high-capacity clips, making sure that guns are sold with safety locks, making sure you cannot buy an assault weapon until you are 18. 
   The bottom line is we can do it. The last one, of course, is closing the gun show loophole. If you ask the woman who got those guns for those kids at Columbine, she says it clearly: If I had to undergo a background check at the gun show, this whole thing would not have happened.  
   So no one can get up here and say laws do not make a difference because I do not believe that. These people are telling us to pass these laws. We are not all that smart here. None of us is. But if we turn our back on the people who have experienced this violence, the Sarah Bradys, the Jim Bradys who beg us to pass waiting periods and background checks--if we turn our back on those Americans, I do not think we deserve to be here, really. Maybe that is what this election in November is going to be all about. We are going to see how much people really care. 
   I know it is late. The Senator from Alabama is here. I know he wants to talk. I know he is not going to agree with one thing I said--and that is good because that is what this is all about. That is what it is all about. That is why I love the Million Mom March, because it is what the country is all about: standing up and being counted, standing up and giving up Mother's Day to come out there and do what they think is right. We have a simple, simple opportunity for people to praise those moms. 
   I am going to close by reading from Senator DASCHLE's amendment and hope my friends on the other side will join us and will vote for it:  
   Since on Mother's Day, May 14, 2000, an estimated 750,000 mothers, fathers, and children united for the Million Mom March on the National Mall in Washington, D.C. and were joined by tens of thousands of others, in 70 cities across America, in a call for meaningful, common-sense gun policy; 
   Since 4,223 young people ages 19 and under were killed by gunfire--one every two hours, nearly 12 young people every day--in the United States in 1977; 
   Since American children under the age of 15 are 12 times more likely to die from gunfire than children in 25 other industrialized countries combined; 
   Since gun safety education programs are inadequate to protect children from gun violence; 
   Since a majority of the Senate resolved that the House-Senate Juvenile Justice Conference should meet, consider and pass by April 20, 2000, a conference report to accompany H.R. 1501, the Juvenile Justice Act, and that the conference report should retain the Senate-passed gun safety provisions to limit access to firearms by juveniles, felons, and other prohibited persons; 
   Since the one year Anniversary of the Columbine High School tragedy passed on April 20, 2000, without any action by the Juvenile Justice Conference Committee on the reasonable gun safety measures that were passed by the Senate almost one year ago; 
   Since continued inaction on this critical threat to public safety undermines confidence in the ability of the Senate to protect our children and raises concerns about the influence of special interests opposed to even the most basic gun safety provisions; 
   Since this lack of action on the part of the Juvenile Justice Conference Committee and this Congress to stem the flood of gun violence is irresponsible and further delay is unacceptable; and 
   Since protecting our children from gun violence is a top priority for our families, communities, and nation: Now, therefore, be it 
   Determined, That it is the sense of the Senate that--

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, earlier today, I introduced in the Senate a bill that passed the House of Representatives on Thursday, May 11--the Conservation and Reinvestment Act of 2000. I introduced the bill and asked that it be put on the Senate calendar for one simple reason. I believe that the fastest way to pass legislation to protect our national lands legacy is to take up where the House left off last week. 
   I know that the Energy and Natural Resources Committee has been trying for many months to get a lands legacy bill, and I commend the efforts of Senator BINGAMAN, Senator LANDRIEU and others. But I am also aware of the great differences of opinion on the Committee. I personally support the Bingaman bill, which is similar to legislation I introduced last year, the Resources 2000 Act. Some Senators support the Landrieu bill. Others oppose both approaches. 
   Thus, it may not be possible to get a strong bill out of the Energy Committee this year. And, Mr. President, we are running out of time. There are probable fewer than 60 working days left in the 106th Congress. So that is why I have asked that the House bill be placed on the Senate calendar, so that at any time the Majority Leader can take it up and place it before the Senate. 
   The House bill isn't perfect. I would like to see further changes. But it would be a good start for the Senate. We must not let this session of Congress end without passing this critical legislation to protect our natural heritage.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, each May, hundreds of civic organizations, community groups, students, and public agencies around the nation organize events to celebrate Asian Pacific American Heritage Month. Throughout the month of May, we salute the profound contributions that Asian Pacific Americans have made in all areas of life in the United States. From the arts and sciences to politics and education, their accomplishments have helped shape our culture and build our nation. 
   In my home state of California, May brings major events celebrating Asian Pacific American culture in Sacramento, Oakland, San Francisco, San Jose, Los Angeles, and San Diego. For more about these events and other interesting information, I invite everyone to consult my special Asian Pacific American Heritage Month web page at http://boxer.senate.gov/apa/index.html. 
   Asian Pacific American Heritage Month originated in 1977, when Representatives Norman Mineta and Frank Horton introduced a resolution calling on the President to proclaim the first ten days of May as Pacific/Asian Heritage Week. Senators DANIEL INOUYE and Spark Matsunaga introduced similar legislation in the Senate. The following year, President Jimmy Carter signed a Joint Resolution proclaiming Asian/Pacific Heritage Week. The celebration was significantly expanded in 1992, when May was officially designated Asian Pacific American Heritage Month by an Act of Congress. 
   The term ``Asian Pacific American'' denotes scores of Asian and Pacific Island ethnic groups with diverse languages, culture, and history. Asian Pacific American Heritage Month offers every American an opportunity to learn more about these peoples, who have woven so many beautiful threads into the tapestry of American life. During the month of May and throughout the year, I hope that every American will take a moment to learn and appreciate more about the rich traditions and major achievements of Asian Pacific Americans.

   Mrs. BOXER. Reserving the right to object, I just want to make sure that those of us who want to speak about the Million Mom March that is coming this weekend, where we may see a quarter of a million or more moms here, and thousands more across the country, are not precluded under this UC from speaking on it in morning business. If it requires an amendment to the UC, I would hope we could work that out. Otherwise, I will object because we could talk about a lot of things, but there is no question the Million Mom March deserves to be discussed. Senator LAUTENBERG has a resolution praising the moms, and I think we should be able to discuss that.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I thank my friend from New Jersey. Let me echo what he has said on the floor in this matter--that we want to protect our children and our families from gun violence. He will be sorely missed. 
   I want to pick up on something that was said about the million moms. I think Senator LAUTENBERG, as a grandfather, has spoken most eloquently as to what the women of this country really want. 
   It is hard to generalize about it to people, but I can truly say, if there is anyone in our society who is more selfless than any other, it happens to be moms. When you love someone more than you love yourself, that is what happens. The fact that they are coming here in such amazing numbers is truly remarkable. I think when everyone across the Nation who is coming here on this issue is added up, it will be a million moms. 
   There is a web page for the Million Mom March. It is called the Tapestry, and moms are calling that site; they are writing their stories. 
   One woman from El Cerrito writes:  
   Ten years ago, my beautiful son, Andrew, killed himself with a bullet to his brain. He  was mentally ill, and never should have been able to buy a gun. I will be at the March with one of my daughters, who is also a mother, because something has got to bring Congress to its senses.  
   Then there are several others. One wrote the following:  
   Once I wrote a letter to my Congressman asking him to support sensible gun laws. He sent me back a three-page letter upholding the second amendment, but this had no effect on me as in my life I have lost my father and uncle and a nephew by marriage to guns. One was murder, one was a suicide, and one was accidental. Had guns not been around and easy to get, none of these untimely and sad deaths would have occurred.  
   We are at a time in our history when we can look back at what is happening to our people. When I was a young mom--now I am a grandmom--the reason I got involved in politics was that I thought the Vietnam war was wrong. I marched with my children in California at that time to say enough is enough; let's end the killing. 
   We lost 58,168 of our valued sons and daughters in that war. For that period of 11 years, let's look at the statistics we have in our Nation from a different kind of war, a war in our streets, in our suburbs, in our schools, in our counties, our cities, in churches and child care centers: 395,441 dead. If the moms of America marched to end the war in Vietnam where 58,168 died--and they did help end it--we can turn around this tragic number and win this war in our streets. 
   I say straight from my heart, we will not win this war unless people in this body have the guts and the courage to stand up to the gun lobby. We will not win this war if people in this body and in the House of Representatives do not have the heart and the guts and the courage to stand up to the gun lobby and its power. I pray that we will have that courage and we will have the strength to do it and turn around what is happening. 
   Senator LAUTENBERG has talked about the juvenile justice bill. It is stuck in limbo, twisting in the wind in the conference committee after we had five sensible gun laws attached to it. They are very sensible and include: closing the gun show loophole so that people who shouldn't have a gun cannot get a gun at a gun show; banning the importation of high-capacity ammunition clips for automatic weapons, Senator FEINSTEIN's amendment; requiring child safety devices be sold with every hand gun, Senator KOHL; an amendment by Senator ASHCROFT that says it is illegal to sell or give a semiautomatic to anyone under the age of 18; and the fifth, requiring the Federal Trade Commission and the Attorney General to study the extent to which the gun industry markets to juveniles. 
   If we thought Joe Camel was bad--and we know Joe Camel was bad--let's look at what the National Rifle Association is doing to market to our children. This is the beautiful, quite lovely NRA logo with the eagle. This is their logo. Here we see the cartoon version of that eagle, ``Eddie the Eagle.'' This is the gun lobby kids' cartoon. This is the eagle of the NRA. These kids are not 18. They are nowhere near 18. They are babies. 
   What makes us think the gun lobby wants to market to kids? Let's take a look at what they say in an ad from a firearm manufacturer: ``Building the next generation of customers takes work and commitment. But it must be done.'' ``Our greatest threat is the lack of a future customer base.'' ``We continue to look for every opportunity to reach young people.......'' 
   There shouldn't be any question about it. Just as Joe Camel was aimed at kids, so is Eddie the Eagle aimed at kids. 
   Here is Joe Camel, the cartoon version of the camel advertisement. Here is the gun lobby kids' cartoon. It is hard to do this all in 10 minutes, but that is all my colleagues on the other side would let me have. Here are Eddie Eagle products for kids: Eddie Eagle lunch box, Eddie Eagle Jitter Critter, 3D glasses, tattoo pac, Eddie E. B-Nee baby. 
   That is not marketing to grownups, my friends; it is 
   marketing to kids. The gun lobby doesn't want us to look at it, but we will. 
   When they had the tobacco lawsuits, we were able to find out what the tobacco company said in secret memos: ``If our company is to survive and prosper.......we must get our share of the youth market.'' ``Today's teenager is tomorrow's potential regular customer.'' 
   Sound familiar to the gun lobby? 
   Look at what they say: ``The greatest threat we face is the lack of a future customer base.......'' ``We continue to look for every opportunity to reach young people.......'' 
   Cigarette companies, Joe Camel, firearms company, Eddie the Eagle. 
   I don't have any objection in terms of a family learning to hunt, but tell me what is right about teaching a 4-year-old child how to load a handgun. Yet this ad is proudly displayed in gun magazines. This child is 4 years old. 
   This sums it all up. How is this for an ad in Gun World: ``Start 'em Young! There is no time like the present.'' 
   This is a very young boy, maybe 15, holding a toy gun, that looks like a real gun, shooting at a can of soda. It is a little bit of a love letter from him about shooting. ``Start 'em Young!'' 
   In the juvenile justice bill, I was fortunate enough to get through this Senate, by a unanimous vote, a study of the gun dealers marketing to children. Guess what. ED MARKEY took that on the House side and got the same thing passed. So we have identical amendments in the House and Senate. Out of all of the gun amendments we passed, this is the only one that had identical language in the House and Senate. What does that mean? It means we could make this the law of the land tomorrow if there were good faith in this Republican Congress. We can in good faith take my amendment that passed here by unanimous vote, and passed over in the House unanimously, and start this study right now. 
   But no. To all who say politics doesn't matter, let me state what this wasted time means. It means that every day they are starting them young. It means that every day, a child might pick up a gun because it so much fun--they see it in the ads. And they can pick up a gun and accidentally injure themselves or someone else. 
   It is an unbelievable situation that a year after we passed five sensible gun measures, we have done nothing. 
   Let me close with something from the Million Mom March from Janet Lazar of Menlo Park, CA. Listen to this.  
   As a social worker for children and families, I have heard the voices of many children who have become victims of violence. Listen to the still voice of a child describing her mother held at gunpoint by her father. Listen to the cold, dead voice of a beautiful 15-year-old girl describe the six friends and relatives she lost to gang warfare. Listen to her bewilderment as she wonders if she will live to raise children of her own. Listen to the suicidal voice of the young man who accidentally killed his best friend as they fooled around with an unlocked handgun.  
   She writes:  
   My heart cries for someone to listen to the children. The time to act is now.  
   To the creator of the Million Mom March, who is a constituent of Senator LAUTENBERG--and how appropriate that is--I say thank you. I say thank you for caring about the children. I say thank you for giving up your Mother's Day and coming here. I say thank you for taking a risk that maybe your idea would not catch on. I say thank you for doing what we Americans do best, acting--acting on facts, acting on information, and, yes, acting on anger. 
   It is an honor to be on the floor today with my friend, Senator LAUTENBERG. It is an honor to stand by his side as we, together, fight to make sure the laws of this land reflect the priorities of the people and the mothers and the children and the families.

   Mrs. BOXER. Let's be clear here about what is being objected to. This is a resolution that says to the million moms: Thank you for caring about our children; thank you for being good mothers; Thank you for giving up Mother's Day to be here, to stand for a cause that is bigger than each of us separately. 
   It is hard for me to believe the Republicans would object to welcoming the million moms to this town, moms who are Democrats, Republicans, those declining to state--maybe they don't have a party. This is not a partisan issue. 
   I say to my friend, thank you for bringing this to the floor. I think the American people are finally going to see who stands up for what is right.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, it is an honor to be able to talk to Mike for just a couple of minutes and to do so with my friends whom you and I care so much about and to say, particularly to Senator WELLSTONE, thank you for standing up in the caucus and for telling us about Mike's battle and inviting us to speak with him. 
   The message I want to give you today, Mike, is that you have made a mark in the Senate. It is hard to do that because I am sure you know we have at least 100 fairly large egos around here. To make a mark in such a place is a tribute to you. You have made a mark among so many Senators--by the way, you picked some wonderful ones to work for--and also among staff. 
   I don't know whether you can see the staff here, Mike, but there are quite a number of them here today. If they could grab a microphone away from us, I know they would. They also send their strong and best wishes to you and their love. 
   It is kind of unusual for someone to have that kind of amazing respect and admiration from Senators and staffers alike. There is a reason for it. You chose this career for the right reasons--not for the power, not for the influence. In many ways, you have that through the powerful and effective people for whom you work. 
   But that is not why you decided to make your career in public service. It is really because inside you, you have this burning feeling that we need to make life better for all the American people. That is reflected in the work you do, as well as the people for whom you chose to work. That is reflected in making life better for families, children, and workers, regardless of who they are or what their status is. 
   But I want to tell you, Mike, I remember just a couple of weeks ago when I was feeling my oats because we had won an amendment on the floor dealing with sensible gun laws. It had been such a struggle. I found myself in the subway, going back to my office with you, Mike. Boy, I was feeling good because we don't win a lot around here these days. It was a good feeling. You looked at me and instead of saying, good work--which is of course what I wanted to hear from you--you said: You know, we really have much more to do on this. We have to build on this. We have to take it the next step. 
   At first, I thought, this was not what I wanted to hear. I wanted to relax and enjoy the moment. When I got back to my office I realized: He is right, we just have to build on our success. We have to keep on working and keep pushing. 
   That gleam Mike always has in his eye really comes with this message of fighting. That is why I think he and PAUL WELLSTONE are such a great combination. You can't have more of a fighter for the people than PAUL WELLSTONE. It is a great and contagious quality. We need more of it around here. It is easy to give up, whatever side of the aisle you are on, or wherever you stand on the issues. It is tough to get in some of these battles. It is tough to stand and debate and fight for your point of view. 
   There is a lot at stake, Mike, and you always understand that. I hope you can take that amazing spirit, fight, and spark with your family, engage in this fight you are in right now, and know that a lot of Members, including staff and Senators alike, really care about you and respect you so much. 
   Thank you.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Nevada, Mr. BRYAN, and Senator REID, the assistant Democratic leader, for their incredible leadership, and I might say sometimes lonely leadership, on this issue of nuclear waste safety. 
   I strongly oppose S. 1287. I believe the bill is bad policy. President Clinton has rejected it, and I urge my colleagues in the Senate to join him. I think it is a dangerous bill. I think it is important to note that this Senate has stopped this bill in its tracks five times at least. I believe today we will stop it again. So the question is, Why do we keep turning to this bill over and over and over again when so many people, including the President of the United States and the Vice President, have so many concerns that, in fact, it would be quite dangerous for our people? Why do we turn to it? 
   I think Senator REID was quite eloquent when he made the point, it is not as if we do not have other things to do. It is not as if there are not issues that are crying out to be debated and discussed on this Senate floor. He mentioned a few of those. I thought it would be good to simply summarize what I think about what he said. 
   Clearly, we need to take up education. We are going to an education bill. However, we are now taking time away from that education debate when people want us to make it the No. 1 issue: smaller class sizes, afterschool--we know the things people want--school renovation, teacher training. We are now taking precious time of the Senate away from that when we could be starting that debate. 
   A good Patients' Bill of Rights bill passed out of the House of Representatives. I thought the bill that passed out of the Senate was not as good. It was really a sham. I thought it was an HMO Bill of Rights for the HMOs. But that is in the conference committee. We ought to work on that. 
   Sensible gun control--we passed five sensible gun control measures in the juvenile justice bill. 
   Every day 12 children die of gun violence. In my State of California, it is the No. 1 cause of death among children. Senator REID had an incredible cartoon that ran showing the amazing number of deaths. During the Vietnam war, there were 58,000 deaths over an 11-year period. In the last 11 years, we have lost 300,000 Americans to gun violence. Why are we taking up a bill that is dangerous--and I will get into why it is dangerous--when we could be making our lives less dangerous? It does not make sense. 
   Then Senator CRAIG from Idaho says this administration has no energy policy. Maybe that is because the Republican side keeps reducing the amount the President wants to spend on energy efficiency, which is so important. It is the cheapest way to get more energy. 
   Campaign finance reform is an issue Senator MCCAIN and Senator FEINGOLD bring continually before us. It passed in the House, but it is getting the death knell in the Senate. This is just a handful of issues. If protecting the health of our citizens is our highest priority--and indeed it should be--then we should not be taking up a bill that will expose our people to illness and danger. This is not a bill that makes life better for our people. It is a bill that is going to make life worse for our people. 
   It has been described as a compromise bill, but, in my view, it is still an attempt to bypass and preempt science and legislate the scientific suitability of Yucca Mountain, NV, as a high-level nuclear waste dump. It is not based on reality or on fact. Instead of finding a repository that meets the health and safety standards we have established in law, this legislation attempts to weaken our health and safety standards to make Yucca Mountain fit because some people committed themselves to Yucca Mountain, and it does not seem to matter what the facts are; they just keep on going down that path. I cannot, and I will not, support such action. 
   For many years, we have debated the suitability of a high-level radioactive waste dump at Yucca Mountain, and for years I have been on the Senate floor with my colleagues from Nevada fighting to protect the health and safety of the citizens of Nevada. 
   I want my colleagues to know that today I am fighting not only for their citizens but for the citizens of the State of California. In fact, because of recent studies, we know that if we go forward with Yucca Mountain, it will seriously impact the people I represent. 
   Yucca Mountain is only 17 miles from the California border and from Death Valley National Park. I have a map to show how close we are. We can see where the Yucca Mountain repository site is and how close Death Valley National Park is to Yucca Mountain. There is Yucca Mountain, Death Valley National Park in Inyo County, and then San Bernardino County. 
   I want to show my colleagues the beauty of Death Valley National Park. This is one magnificent view of Death Valley National Park. It amazes me when we make these incredibly important investments in our environment and in the beauty of our Nation to protect and preserve it, with the next vote, we vote for a nuclear waste dump that can adversely impact on this national treasure. I will explain that. 
   The development of Yucca Mountain has the potential to contaminate California's ground water. It poses a threat to the 
   health and safety of Californians from possible transportation accidents related to the shipping of high-level nuclear waste through Inyo, San Bernardino, and neighboring California counties. 
   Since its inception as a national monument in 1933, the Federal Government has invested more than $600 million in Death Valley National Park. The park receives over 1.4 million visitors each and every year. 
   The communities surrounding the park are economically dependent on tourism. The income generated by the presence of the park exceeds $125 million per year. The park has been the most significant element in the sustainable growth of the tourist industry in the Mojave Desert. This chart is a blown-up photo of how close the national park is to Yucca Mountain and why these two counties have concerns. 
   Scientific studies show that a significant part of the regional ground water aquifer surrounding Yucca Mountain discharges in Death Valley because the valley is downgradient of areas to the east. If the ground water at Death Valley is contaminated from nuclear waste stored at Yucca Mountain, it will be the demise of the park and the surrounding communities. 
   The long-term viability of fish, wildlife, and human population in these areas are largely dependent on water from this aquifer. The vast majority of the park's visitors rely on services and facilities at the park headquarters near Furnace Creek. These facilities are all dependent upon the ground water aquifer that flows under or near Yucca Mountain. Unfortunately, there is no alternative water source that can support these visitor facilities and wildlife resources. So I cannot understand why, on the one hand, we create a magnificent park--we spent $600 million on it; we get tourist dollars from it--and on the other hand in another vote we endanger this magnificent monument and the people who live in the surrounding areas. 
   Water is life in the desert. Water quality must be preserved for the viability of Death Valley National Park, the dependent tourism industry, and the surrounding communities. 
   We do not have the science that tells us that Yucca Mountain is safe, and the potential loss is far too great. It has been hard to get the Energy Department to accept California's connection to the site. Every time they talk about the site, they talk about Nevada. Finally, they recognize that Inyo County, CA, as an effective unit of local government under the Nuclear Waste Policy Act, actually qualifies. There had to be, unfortunately, a lawsuit by the county that resulted in DOE granting affected unit status in 1991. 
   It is very important my colleagues understand that my concern comes from the local people. 
   I ask unanimous consent to print in the RECORD a letter from the board of supervisors of the county of Inyo.

   Mrs. BOXER. I shall not read the entire letter. The Board of Supervisors, County of Inyo--and these are the local government officials to whom my colleagues on the other side of the aisle are constantly saying we have to pay attention--let us pay attention to them. They are saying:  
   [We] are writing to express concern with S. 1287, the Nuclear Waste Policy Amendments Act of 1999.  
   They go on to say why it is flawed. They say there is a ``significant long-term risk that development of the repository places on California''--that it places California in an untenable position. In very strong language they ask that we not approve this. They say it does not ``provide adequate protection for Inyo County resources or citizens'' and that they are very concerned about it.

   Mrs. BOXER. In this letter they reiterate their opposition to this bill. They say it would be very dangerous for their residents because the waste could be transported through Ventura County. 
   On this map I show my colleagues, even the counties next to Inyo and San Bernardino are very upset that waste will come all through California. Ventura County is taking a stand. They say:  
   Please vote against S. 1287.......

   Mrs. BOXER. This letter is quite long and goes into all the objections, with detailed comments, and the concerns they have about Yucca Mountain. 
   I think the important point here is, this is not just a Nevada issue. Even when in my mind it was, I would never subject the people of Nevada to this kind of a dangerous policy. It now includes the people of California. We are very concerned about transportation routes, very concerned about the ability of this material to migrate into an aquifer that serves the counties surrounding it, and we could go on and on. 
   Even the Western Governors' Association has repeatedly asked the Energy Department to complete an analysis of the transportation routes to Yucca Mountain, to no avail. 
   So we have a lot of problems with this bill in my home State of California. 
   The radiation to be allowed at Yucca Mountain would be much higher than is allowed under current regulations. The DOE study finds that maximum doses at the site would be 50 millirems per year. I am sure my colleagues have gone into it, but sometimes you repeat facts because they are very important. I would like to put the numbers into perspective. 
   That amount of radiation would equal approximately 5,000 chest x rays annually. It is 2,000 times higher than what the public is currently permitted to receive from an operating powerplant under EPA regulations. 
   I will say, under NRC and DOE risk estimates, it is my understanding--I am going to just double-check here--studies have shown that if these people were exposed to the maximum, virtually all of them would get cancer. That is how much and how high these levels are. 
   In conclusion, my colleagues from Nevada have done us a great service. Even before I knew the extent to which they were actually fighting was not only for Nevada but for California, I knew they were doing the right thing, because if we do not stand up and protect the health and safety of the people we represent, what use are we? What good are we? 
   When a physician takes his or her test to get licensed, they say: Do no harm. At a minimum, do no harm. This does harm. If we were, in fact, to allow this matter to move forward, I think the people would become even more cynical than they are about Government. They will ask: What special interests are behind this one? How on Earth can we throw out the health and safety regulations to push through this site? Is that the best we can do for this site? 
   I will tell you, it makes me sick at heart. The only thing that keeps me going on this one is my colleagues from Nevada, who have stood up in the face of powerful committee chairmen. And you will hear them today. Oh, you will hear them today. The Senators from Nevada have stood up for the people of this country. I stand with them. I stand with the people of California, who want to protect Death Valley National Park, who want to protect the water supply there, who want to protect our Federal investment there, who want to protect the health and safety of the people who have to drink the water and live there. 
   So let us do what we have done five times before. Let us beat back this ill-advised attempt to put a nuclear waste dump where it does not belong. Let us feel good that we have protected the people of this country. Let us turn to  the 
   matters to make life better for our people: Sensible gun laws, an HMO Patients' Bill of Rights, education, afterschool programs, smaller class sizes, and campaign finance reform. 
   For goodness' sake, let's do something in this Chamber that helps people, not exposes them to risk. 
   Yesterday I was at the Albert Einstein Medical School in New York. They are doing extraordinary things to find cures for cancer, to invest in ways to make our people healthier, to work with the Federal Government to make sure we have enough money going into research. Why would we do things around here that would elevate people's risk of getting cancer? I do not understand it. It does not add up. I listened to the arguments on the other side. They simply do not add up. 
   So, again, I associate myself with my friends from Nevada. They are courageous. They are brave. They are right. They are protecting the people of Nevada and the people of California. I hope they will be successful. I will be working with them. 
   As I understand it, the Senator from Nevada, Mr. BRYAN, will now have some time for further remarks. 
   Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.

    Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise in recognition of California's Veterans Appreciation Month, which is celebrated in May 2000. The people of our state and our nation owe more to our veterans than we can ever repay. The world is a safer place, and our Democracy has thrived because of their heroism. 
   This year, as in years past, the State of California is making an extra effort to assist its veterans who suffer from a lack of suitable employment. California calculates that about 40,000 of its veterans are unemployed or underemployed. This is a tragic situation for these fine men and women who have given so much to America. 
   During the month of May, California's Employment Development Department will focus special effort to find jobs for these veterans. Local Veterans Employment Representatives and Disabled Veterans Outreach Program staff will be contacting employers, organized labor and government leaders to promote hiring veterans, and they will provide job training and job-search training to former military personnel. Quite simply, the goal of California's Veterans Appreciation Month is to show the appreciation of a grateful nation by providing the employment opportunities that veterans so richly deserve. 
   I commend the California Employment Development Department for all its fine efforts on this program and I encourage all Americans to support similar efforts in their states.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I came to the floor of the Senate because I noted that my friend, Senator HARKIN from Iowa, was talking about a very important subject, a woman's right to choose. This right has been protected.  After the case Roe v. Wade in 1973, a woman has had that right. 
   Today we are looking at a different type of constitutional amendment. Senator HARKIN made the point that, in fact, we have a case being heard at the Supreme Court which is going to essentially look at a woman's right to choose. I think it is appropriate that he would come over to make a few points, and I would like to engage him in a colloquy, if he would be willing to do that. 
   First, I ask him to reiterate for me the basic point he made. We see in the Senate tens of votes we have to face on the issue of a woman's right to choose and the different aspects of it, whether a person who lives in the District of Columbia can use her insurance paid by the city to obtain a legal abortion, whether a Federal employee has that right, whether a woman in the military has the right to use a clean medical facility to exercise her rights, whether a woman in the late stage of a pregnancy that has turned desperately wrong has the right to have her health protected. We stand here on so many occasions casting these votes, having this debate ostensibly about a narrower issue surrounding a woman's right to choose. 
   I wonder if my friend believes that is the real goal of the people who continually bring up this matter or whether it is, in fact, something quite deep, which is trying to erode a woman's right to choose, that basic right that was given to her after the Roe v. Wade decision in 1973.

   Mrs. BOXER. There were a couple of Members who were not here. To think that a basic right won by women when we were very young, in 1973, all those years ago, would be hanging by a thread in the year 2000 is really amazing. I really do pray that the Supreme Court, as they independently decide these issues in this particular case of the Nebraska statute will recognize that what the Senator from Iowa says is absolutely true. It is so important. 
   We have a big debate over some made-up terminology that doesn't even exist in medical books. There is no such thing as partial-birth abortion. There is either a birth or an abortion. That is it. The description of the method used is really a method that is used in the early stages of a pregnancy as well. So if, in fact, that Nebraska case is upheld, women will be denied what is considered by many doctors to be the safest method. That undermines Roe because Roe was a very moderate decision. It basically said that before that fetus is viable, the woman has an unfettered right to choose. But at any stage in the pregnancy, one thing has to come first: the woman's life and the woman's health. 
   I say to my friend, when we get into a pattern of outlawing specific procedures and playing doctor--by the way, we do have one doctor in this Senate, but he is not an OB/GYN--when we start to play doctor in the Senate, we are going to endanger women's health. 
   If we start outlawing procedures we don't like--by the way, there is no medical procedure--something that is gruesome or you don't get upset by--if we start doing that, we will overturn Roe right here because we will be saying a woman's health really is subordinate, doesn't matter, and what does it matter if a woman can't have a particular procedural and as a result she is paralyzed or can never bear another child? It would be a disaster, and it would be overturning this basic right. 
   So I want to say to my friend that I appreciate his leadership. I enjoy working with him on this because we feel so deeply about it. Before he leaves, I will make one more comment. I trust my friend mentioned this, but I am not sure because I was on my way over here. The House of Representatives denied the House the opportunity to vote on the Harkin-Boxer amendment. The House of Representatives in this year has used a gag rule, if you will, to deny the Members of the House a chance to stand up for or against Roe v. Wade. I wonder what they are so afraid of. Are they afraid that some of their Members are so to the right on this issue and so against public opinion, it would hurt them in their reelection? 
   Now is the time to be heard, when Roe is hanging by a thread, and we need to have a vote over there. I hope my friend will continue to press this point, as we say together that it is wrong to deny the House a chance to vote up or down on Roe. 
   I ask my friend for his closing comment on that.

   Mrs. BOXER. I thank my friend. I see the Senator from Arizona on the floor, so I will wrap up. 
   I think it is interesting and important, as we look at new amendments to the Constitution, that we think about the rights we already take for granted. The women in this country have counted on the Constitution to protect their right to choose. I only hope they will continue to have that right. It is, in fact, hanging by a thread here in the Senate with only 51 votes supporting that basic decision. 
   So I say it is a day to look at our rights, as we are looking at victims' rights, or their lack of rights, and what ways we want to make sure victims have rights, and that we also consider if a woman is denied a fundamental right to have control over her own  body, if she is denied that, she will be a victim--a victim of this Government thinking that, in fact, it knows better than she or the people who love her, and that the Government would think it would know better than her family, her God, and her conscience to make such a basic decision. 
   So it is a good day to talk about Roe v. Wade. As we look at new rights we are giving people, let's also make sure we don't take away any rights. 
   I thank the Chair and yield the floor.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I want to say to Senator REED, he is a very powerful voice in favor of sensible gun laws. He is taking every opportunity he can. He has stated this many times, to bring this matter of the juvenile justice bill that contains all these important gun control laws to the floor of the Senate. Today he said we should not adjourn until we take care of this. I think he is making a very important point. We have five important, sensible gun control measures in the juvenile justice bill. We voted for them here. On one of them, it was AL GORE, the Vice President, who broke that tie vote on closing the gun show loophole on which Senator LAUTENBERG had worked so hard, to keep away from children, and to keep away from people who are mentally unstable, and keep away from criminals, access to weapons. 
   It is a very sad day indeed that we are going home, now, right on the heels of the tragic anniversary of Columbine--those killings occurred a year ago--and we have done nothing. 
   I want to state for the RECORD, every time my friend Senator REED comes to the floor, I will be there with him as long as it takes. We are going to have a Million Mom March. I don't know whether a million moms will come, but thousands will come to march in favor of these very responsible gun laws. I intend to be there, and many of us will be there with them. We will not stop the pressure. 
   Mr. President, every budget is a roadmap. This budget takes us down the wrong road at almost every turn. I agreed with one thing that happened in the conference, and I want to say thank you to the House. I am very careful not to say thank you to my chairman, who told me not to thank him for this because he is on the other side. The language calling for drilling in the Arctic wildlife refuge was removed. I am very pleased about that. I thank the House for doing that. I hope we do not have to face that fight this year, next year, or the year after. 
   But in terms of everything else that happened, this budget got decidedly worse. It is leading us down the wrong road, a road that does not adequately fund education or prescription drug benefits, a road that doesn't reduce the debt enough, a road that leads to risky tax cuts that can derail our economic recovery and therefore endanger Medicare and even Social Security. 
   This is a road that lacks fiscal responsibility. It has no room in it for a lands legacy bill that people on both sides of the aisle want to see, where we can take offshore oil revenues and put them into good use by expanding our public ownership of precious lands we are losing and preserve historic areas. I think this budget puts America in a risky, dangerous position and it does not meet the needs of our people. 
   We know what will happen if this budget goes into effect, as it will, and the appropriators carry it out. We will see cuts to the most vulnerable population--cuts in the Women, Infants and Children feeding program, cuts in Head Start, in the Job Corps, in child care, in children's mental health. Those cuts will be perhaps more than 10 percent. 
   We could not get more funding for afterschool programs even though we  had some bipartisan support. The police chiefs all across this land know that is the best crimefighting program. We could not get that. We know juvenile crime peaks between 3 p.m. and 6 p.m. What does this budget say? We are holding the line on afterschool programs, and the million kids waiting to get in will simply have to wait. One million kids are waiting to get into afterschool programs. That is how popular they are. Ninety percent of the American people want them. The police want them. The President put it in his budget, and they have cut his request in half, leaving 1 million people out of the loop. 
   I do not understand how we can say we speak for the people when we walk away from a program that has 90 percent approval and one we know works. 
   Senator KENNEDY has talked about the flimsy prescription drug benefit. It is not going to help our seniors if we make them think we are doing something for them but we do not back it up with funding. Senator CONRAD, who will speak after I finish my remarks, has talked long and hard about a lockbox for Medicare. That was voted down. That is gone. 
   We agreed to lock up Social Security but not Medicare. It does not do us any good if our people get their full Social Security benefit and they have to turn around and pay more and more for Medicare. They are going to be poor one way or the other. If my colleagues support Social Security, they have to support Medicare. This budget simply does not do it. 
   My colleagues should see the letters that come from the people in my State who are forced to cut their medicine in half in order to make ends meet. They are choosing between prescription drugs and eating dinner. This is America. This is wrong. 
   Why does this budget turn out this way? Because of a risky tax cut. 
   Maybe some say it is good to have a tax cut; maybe they look at the tax cut as helping people who really need it. One roadmap we have is George W. Bush's tax cut. Let's look at that one. What happens if one earns over $300,000? They get back $50,000 a year. They will be popping those champagne corks in the boardrooms. But if one earns $38,000 a year, they will get back about $260 or $280 a year. 
   Summing up, this budget takes us down the wrong path any way one looks, whether it is looking at tax cuts that are fair and targeted, sensible and fiscally responsible, or it is a prescription drug benefit that makes sense for our seniors, protecting Medicare that makes sense for our seniors, or investing in education which makes sense for our children, or having a reserve fund for our environment. 
   By the way, on energy efficiency, they slash and burn the President's proposal, and then they say he has no energy policy. This budget takes us down a bad road. It should be rejected, Mr. President.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I want to take this occasion to say something about the Elian Gonzalez case. I have not spoken formerly in the Senate about it, but it has been addressed by several of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle. For me, it is simple because it is not about politics; it is about the heart; it is about family. 
   Some may call me old fashioned. I think kids belong with their parents--I have always believed that--unless there is some reason a child should not be with the parent, if the child has a bad parent. There is no proof of that in any way, or suggestion of that, except at the last minute the relatives who are caring for Elian, now, have made these charges. 
   It seems as if every time the father comes closer, he becomes a worse person. First, he was wonderful. They said, he is wonderful but he doesn't care about his son; he is not here. Now he is here, and they still will not turn the child over. 
   I have a little grandson. He is about a year younger than Elian, so I am pretty familiar with kids that age because I have watched him so closely. They are babies; they really are. They are little children. They are babies. They are impressionable. That is why it is so important to treat them well and to not use them for any purpose--let them be children. 
   I have to say unequivocally as a grandmother, not as a Senator, I believe it is very harmful for a child to be exposed to screaming adults outside of his home, day in and day out, shouting things. There is something wrong with that. It is harmful to a child. 
   I also want to point out there is room for politics over the Cuba issue. Of course there is. But it is not around this case. It should not be around this case, either by those in this country who want to make it a political issue, or Fidel Castro, who may well want to do that if and when Elian is back. That would be deplorable. 
   We have to treat this child gently. We have to reunite this child with his living parent. I just would like to make a plea to those who do not want to do that and who have said that to get Elian with his father is going to take people coming to the door, that they will not relinquish this child except if there is force used, that is not the way we do things in this country. 
   This is a country of peaceful laws. That is why we have courts. That is why people have to obey court orders. We have laws. We cannot, because we disagree with them--God knows, every one of us disagree with jury verdicts; we disagree with laws; we disagree with decisions. The beauty of our Nation is  that we are a country of laws. We must make it clear those laws should be obeyed. We ought to do it in the best interests of this child, which means gently and peacefully.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, each year on April 24, we pause to remember the tragedy of the Armenian genocide. On that date in 1915, more than two hundred Armenian religious, political, and intellectual leaders were arrested in Constantinople (now Istanbul) and killed, marking the beginning of an organized campaign to eliminate the Armenian presence from the Ottoman Empire. This brutal campaign would result in the massacre of a million and a half Armenian men, women, and children. 
   Thousands of Armenians were subjected to torture, deportation, slavery, and murder. More than five hundred thousand were removed from their homes and sent on forced death marches through the deserts of Syria. This dark time is among the saddest chapters in human history. 
   But Armenians are strong people, and their dream of freedom did not die. More than seventy years after the genocide, the new Republic of Armenia was born as the Soviet Union crumbled. Today, we pay tribute to the courage and strength of a people who would not know defeat. 
   Yet independence has not meant an end to their struggle. There are still those who question the reality of the Armenian slaughter, who have failed to recognize its very existence. We must not allow the horror of the Armenian genocide to be either dismissed or denied. 
   Genocide is the worst of all crimes against humanity. As we try to learn from the recent genocidal conflicts in Kosovo and Rwanda and prevent future atrocities, it is especially important to remember those who lost their lives in the first genocide of the twentieth century. We must never forget the victims of the Armenian genocide.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I know the majority leader is looking over amendments that Members on this side of the aisle want the opportunity to offer to the bill on the marriage tax penalty. I certainly hope the majority leader will be able to accommodate us. After all, if we were using the regular rules of the Senate, we could offer any and all amendments; that is, the rules of the Senate provide Members can, in fact, offer amendments on bills that come before the Senate. 
   The Senator from Montana, who has done so much work on this marriage tax penalty issue, and I were talking about how much the procedure around here is like the House of Representatives with tremendously restricted opportunities for debate and restricted opportunities to offer amendments. 
   We are working very hard, on our side of the aisle, to fight for the right merely to put matters before the Senate. We may not win every time, but the fact is we are here for a reason and that is to legislate; it is to bring these matters before the American people in this forum called the Senate. 
   The bill purports to take care of the marriage tax penalty, but I have big news for everyone: It does not take care of the marriage tax penalty. Why do I say this? I get this directly from Senator MOYNIHAN's work on this issue as the ranking member of the Finance Committee. We know there are 65 marriage tax penalties in the code for all taxpayers--65. 
   So if you really believe the marriage tax penalty is your biggest priority and that is all you want to do, that it is the most important thing as you look at the Tax Code--and, frankly, from my point of view, it is not the only thing I want to do and there are more important things we can do to help the middle class in this country--the most honest thing to do is repeal the penalty in these 65 occasions in which it appears in the Tax Code. 
   However, the GOP plan fully eliminates only 1 of these penalties, partially eliminates 2 others, and it leaves 62 marriage penalties in the code. 
   We have a situation where we are told we can do away with the marriage tax penalty, but when we look at the fine print, we are not doing away with the marriage tax penalty at all. We are only doing it in one place, completely, where it appears, and partially in another couple. And we are leaving 62 penalties in place. 
   So I do not really think this is a good way for us to proceed because it is so expensive and we have not taken care of the marriage tax penalty. It is another one of these risky tax schemes that is going to come back to haunt us because it is going to rob us of debt reduction. 
   When you add it to all the tax bills that have already passed the Senate with majority support from the Republicans, it is breaking the back of the non-Social Security surplus. We will have no surplus. Pretty soon, we are going to start eating into that surplus. 
   We are going to hear Senator BAUCUS talk about why he believes this plan is flawed. It actually hurts some people at the lower end of the scale. It does not do what it purports to do. 
   We are going to hear from Senator BAYH, who has another idea that is certainly more affordable and would allow us to do other things we need to do for our people, such as the prescription drug benefit. 
   We now know for sure that our people are suffering because they cannot afford prescription drugs. If we listen to Senator WYDEN, who has spoken on this eloquently, we know our senior citizens are not taking their prescription drugs. They are cutting their pills in half. They risk getting strokes. They risk getting heart attacks. They cannot afford the prescription drugs. 
   While we are talking about a marriage tax penalty--and a lot of relief goes to people who are earning a lot of money in this country--what about the prescription drug benefit? What about a tuition tax break for parents who are struggling to send their kids to college and college tuition goes up each and every year? 
   We cannot do these things in a vacuum. We have to look at 
   the entire picture. We have to ask ourselves: Do we want to give tax breaks or do we want all the money to go to debt reduction? I myself would like to give targeted tax breaks that we can afford to the middle class, who needs them, and use the rest of the money for debt reduction and for investments in our people, in our children. 
   In closing, there is something we can really do for married people here, those at the lowest incomes who are working at the minimum wage, more than 60 percent of whom are women. Raising the minimum wage would go a long way to doing something good for people who are married and in the low brackets. A tuition tax break for people who send their kids to college would go a long way to helping married people and their families. A prescription drug benefit would help those families who are seeing their moms and dads struggling along, not being able to afford prescription drugs. 
   So the question we face, just to sum it up as we look at this Republican plan, is this: Why would we do something that says it is relieving the marriage tax penalty when it leaves 62 marriage tax penalties in place? Why would we do that? It is not real. We are telling people we are doing something we are not doing. We are backloading it. We are breaking the Treasury. We are eating into the non-Social Security surplus. Why would we do that? 
   Why not look at a more modest plan? We have some ideas on that. We are going to hear about one of them today. Why don't we look at raising the minimum wage? Why don't we look at the prescription drug benefit or the tuition tax break for our families who are struggling to send their kids to college? Why don't we look at this economic recovery and together, both sides of the aisle, say we do not want to derail it by doing these tax breaks, one after the other after the other after the other. They are adding up to hundreds of billions of dollars. 
   If our President were not so strong in saying let's keep this country on a fiscally sound basis, we would be in a lot of trouble, if those bills had been signed. 
   I asked of the Senator from Montana yesterday--I was talking to his staff--how many tax bills have already gone through here with the votes of the other side of the aisle. I think his staff told me it was about $500 billion at this point, $500 billion of tax breaks--by the way, most of them to people who do not want them, who do not need them, who are asking us to keep the economy strong, reduce the debt, and do targeted tax breaks for the people who really need them. 
   I hope the majority leader will accept these amendments we have come up with, allow us to debate as Senators, not turn us into the House of Representatives which gives its Members very few rights to offer amendments. I hope we will reject this Republican plan because it does not do what it says it does. It is fiscally irresponsible, and it stops us from doing the good things we need to do for our families.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I thank once again the Senator from Illinois for his eloquence on the issue of sensible gun laws and add my voice to his plea that the Senate do what it is supposed to do, which is to bring out the juvenile justice bill with five sensible gun control measures, sensible measures that will reduce gun violence. 
   I thank the Senator from Rhode Island, Mr. REED, who is on the floor as well, for his very important sense-of-the-Senate Amendment to the budget resolution, which actually says it is the opinion of the Senate that we ought to be voting on those gun measures. It passed by a slim majority, but so far we have not seen any results.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, the reason I take to the floor today is not only to underscore what Senator DURBIN has said but to say that while I think we should be doing this juvenile justice bill and passing the gun measures that lie within it, what we are doing today makes no sense at all, in my view, which is to cancel, if you will, the 4.3-cent Federal tax on a gallon of gasoline which, in the case of my State, if carried out over 2 years, would lose my State $1.7 billion in highway funds and transit moneys. 
   The people in my State are very smart. We are suffering from the highest gas prices in the United States, but we also understand the answer is not to use this as an excuse to slash highway funds, to begin drilling off the coast of California or to open up the Alaska Wildlife Refuge to drilling. People in my State understand we need an energy policy, not some kind of gimmickry that the other side is using to lash out at Vice President GORE and say he, in fact, wants higher gas taxes, which is just a made-up story. 
   What we need in this country is an energy policy. What does that mean? First, it means having a Department of Energy that comes forward with an energy policy for safe ways to produce energy in this Nation and ways to save energy. 
   What does the Republican Congress want to do? I think we can look over history if we want to find out. First, when they took over in 1994--they got sworn in in 1995--one of the first things they tried to do was eliminate the Department of Energy. That makes a lot of sense. We need an energy policy, so what is the first thing they do? Try to eliminate the Department of Energy? I have to say, Bill Richardson did a masterful job of going around the world convincing the producers of oil to do a better job, to increase their supply. But, if the Republicans had their way, there would be no Cabinet position because there would be no Department of Energy. So that is the first thing they did in order to have an ``energy 
   policy.'' 
   What else did they try to do? Every year, year in and year out since they took over, they have not provided adequate funding for alternative and renewable energy, which would lessen our dependence on foreign oil. This is shortsighted and it only means our dependence on foreign oil will increase. We need more investment in energy-efficient technologies, not less. 
   If you think I am just stating something that perhaps I cannot back up, let me give you the facts. On solar and renewable energy research and development, between the years 1996 and 2000, the Republicans have cut President Clinton's requests by 23.6 percent. On energy and conservation R&D, they have cut the President's requests 20.3 percent. Energy conservation grants, which are so important to encourage energy conservation--by the way, that is the best kind of energy policy, conservation; everybody wins. It costs the consumer less, and it destroys our environment less--they cut those grants by 25.4 percent. So the bottom line is they first wanted to do away with the Department of Energy. That was their program. Then they took the funding for energy efficiency and renewable energy and cut it by 22.2 percent. 
   How about this one? Our Secretary of Energy goes around the world and gets an increased oil supply of about 1.7 million barrels a day, which is excellent work--he did a good job. We could save 1 million barrels of oil a day if we increased the fuel economy of SUVs and light trucks to 27 miles per gallon. Now they are at about 20. We could save 1 million barrels of oil a day from that simple step. What happens around here? The Republicans, in 1995, put a rider on appropriation bills prohibiting the administration from raising fuel economy standards for SUVs and light trucks just to get it to 27 miles per gallon, which it is at now for cars. 
   This sounds like ``and a partridge in a pear tree.'' We have continual moves here: Eliminating the Department of Energy, providing in adequate funding for alternative and renewable energy, and riders prohibiting raising fuel economy for SUVs and light trucks. 
   Here is another one. We know when energy prices go up, it is very important that the President have the ability to tap the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. It is there when there is an emergency. It is very important that he have that power. The Republican Congress has failed to reauthorize the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, and without new reauthorization, no funds can be appropriated for the purchase of new oil for the reserve. So the reserve is not going to increase. That is very important. 
   This is four policies, all of which undermine an energy policy for this country to lead to U.S. independence from foreign oil: Eliminating the Department of Energy, providing inadequate funding for alternative and renewable energy, stopping us from increasing fuel efficiency for SUVs and light trucks, and failing to reauthorize the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. 
   What do they come up with today? Repealing the gas tax. That is not an energy policy; it is a disaster--$1.7 billion lost over 2 years to my State. It would hurt my State. The country as a whole would lose $18.8 billion from the measure that is going to come before us. I hope we will not get cloture so we do not take it up. The Senate, frankly, has expressed itself on the budget resolution against this 
   shortsighted amendment. 
   This is not, however, the only thing my friends on the other side of the aisle are pushing. I mentioned in my opening statement drilling in the Arctic Wildlife Refuge. There is a big debate over that: Should we allow drilling in a wildlife refuge? I say we give this the commonsense test. When President Eisenhower set up this refuge, do you think he thought about oil drilling in a refuge for the most magnificent wildlife you could find? I do not think so. Just think about it. What kind of refuge is it, if you have oil drilling there, with the risk of spills and all the traffic that comes with it? 
   Some are again calling for drilling off the coast of California. I have to explain to my friends who think that is an energy policy that that would undermine California's economy because our tourism industry is dependent on a beautiful, magnificent coast. Our recreation industry is dependent on a beautiful, unspoiled coast. We should not use this spike in gas prices as an excuse to destroy the highway fund, to destroy the coast, to destroy a wildlife refuge. I think the American people can see through this. It does not an energy policy make, to repeal a tax which is earmarked for highways. It makes no sense whatsoever. 
   Here is another fact: Right now in America there are 68,000 barrels a day  being drilled and exported out of our country. While colleagues are talking about drilling in a refuge and drilling off the coast, we are exporting 68,000 barrels a day. 
   There are 1 million barrels a day wasted because they will not vote to increase the fuel efficiency standards for SUVs and light trucks. They vote down energy efficiency budget recommendations by this President. They do not give him the tools for increasing the quantity of gas or oil in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. They turn a blind eye to the oil companies that are merging at a rapid rate. I was an economics major in college many years ago. I am the first one to admit that it was a long time ago. One thing I learned and which has not changed was that competition is important for the consumer. When we have less competition, the consumer suffers. We have seen merger after merger. Yet we do not hear anyone on that side of the aisle saying maybe it is time we put a moratorium on these mergers. On the other hand, they support these mergers, as far as I can tell. We need to impose a moratorium on these mergers. 
   Mergers are at a near frenzy. Shell and Texaco entered a joint venture, which is essentially a merger, in 1997. British Petroleum and Amoco merged shortly thereafter. Last year, Exxon and Mobile merged. BP/Amoco is currently attempting to acquire California-based ARCO. If one overlays gas prices with these mergers, it is straight up. It is common sense: Less competition, higher prices. 
   There are secret oil company documents that we know have been filed as part of the Federal Trade Commission's lawsuit to 
   block the merger. Those secret documents ought to be made public. One can see, if one reads the filing, that the FTC has made explosive charges of oil price manipulation by BP. We know that a lot of BP's oil is being exported from this country. If we are going to allow this merger to take place, we should at least insist that oil stay here rather than stand up in this Chamber and say we are going to repeal the 4.3-cent-a-gallon tax which is going to destroy the highway trust fund. The people in my State are against this proposal. 
   Between 1973 and 1995, we banned the export of the Alaska North Slope crude. The GAO has said that lifting this export ban increased the price of crude by more than $1 a barrel. 
   We can create an energy policy that will result in the lowering of gas prices and, by the way, help the environment and clean up our air. What do we do around here? We do not do the long-range planning. We are not listening to the people who have studied this issue for years. We are turning a blind eye to these mergers which make prices skyrocket. We are not doing anything about stopping the exportation of Alaskan oil. We are not increasing the fuel economy standards. 
   We are taking the short view and trying to make political points by saying: If we take away that 4.3-cent-a-gallon tax, it is going to solve our gas price problem. That is not the answer. The American people are smart. They see this for what it is: A political ploy; it does not do anything; it robs our States of needed money for highways while they keep cutting back the funds the President requests for energy efficiency. 
   I stand here as someone who has been involved in energy efficiency issues since I was a county supervisor in the seventies. That is when we had those long lines because gas prices were high and people were scared. By the way, that is when the American car companies lost their market share because it was the foreign carmakers that were making the fuel-efficient cars. Why don't we learn from history? Why don't we do the right thing instead of this short-term idea that makes no sense at all, that will only hurt our environment, will hurt our people, will hurt our ability to build the highways we need in the future, and absolutely does nothing about lessening our dependence on foreign oil. 
   I am very pleased I had this opportunity to speak because I think this issue is clearly one of the most important we can consider. 
   My last point is, half of our trade deficit is due to imported oil. What is reducing the gas tax 4.3 cents a gallon going to do to lessen our dependence on foreign oil? Zero. Nothing. Nada. Let's do something that is going to help our balance of trade, that is going to help our environment, that is going to help our economy, and that is going to help our people. 
   I thank the Chair.

   Mrs. BOXER. I thank my colleague. This is truly a bipartisan effort. As this budget stands, it is the most antienvironmental budget in history because it is the first time any budget resolution has called for drilling in a wildlife refuge. We know that when President Eisenhower declared this a refuge, he never envisioned drilling in it. Drilling in a refuge is not only unnecessary; it is destructive.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I thank the assistant Democratic leader for this time. I came to talk about the MIKULSKI amendment, which I was honored to carry for her in the Budget Committee. But I also feel the need to respond to my friend from Idaho, who is an eloquent voice for the status quo when it comes to gun violence. 
   The Senate did act, the Senate did act on five sensible gun laws. The fact is, we should be pushing for them because over his opposition we did pass those laws and they are stuck in the conference committee. The Reid amendment would simply call on the conference committee to do its work and report these laws out so we can turn around the tragedy that is meeting too many families, too many children. 
   I heard a statistic the other day: 75 percent of all gun murders of children in the world occur in the United States of America, the land of the free and the home of the brave. It does not matter how brave a child is. Twelve a day are killed. I say to my friend from Rhode Island, I appreciate him offering his amendment. 
   Also, I say to the Senator from Maryland, Ms. MIKULSKI, I was honored to offer a very similar amendment in the Budget Committee. The good news is that amendment was adopted unanimously, and Chairman DOMENICI accepted it. The difference between Senator MIKULSKI's amendment, which I cosponsor with her, and the one in the committee is that this one has solid numbers behind it. The amendment in the committee was a general vow of support from the Budget Committee to bridge that digital divide. We offer in this amendment a comprehensive approach to building human capital and physical infrastructure that is needed for sustained success in this century. 
   I want to make two points about the great need we face for our children. We have a public education system in this Nation that is essentially a great equalizer. It gives all children a chance to grow up and be what they want to be, in my case a Senator. I want to see that occur for all of our children. It will not occur if they do not have access to computers and teachers who understand how to use the computers. 
   I come from a State that boasts Silicon Valley. In Los Angeles, we have a similar high-tech area. In San Diego, we have a magnificent high-tech area, and it is moving all over our State. Those companies have to go to foreign countries to get human capital. People are being offered very high salaries to come to America. Therefore, we must train our young people or all those good jobs will not go to Americans, and that will be a very sad situation, indeed. 
   The last point I will make is that if you have young children or if you have grandchildren--and I am fortunate to have a grandchild--you can see that 2- and 3-year-olds find their way on computers. A lasting memory I have of my grandson is at the age of 2 1/2 , with his thumb stuck in his mouth, his blanket hanging down, and the other hand on the mouse figuring out how to use the computer. Now he is 5. I hate to admit it, but he understands computers probably as well as I do. At least when the computer freezes up, he figures out a way to make it work. 
   If children are gravitating in that direction and they can understand at that age--because their brain capacity is expanding at amazing rates at age 3, 4, and 5--we have to make sure our families can give them this opportunity. It is the right thing to do for them. It is the right thing to do for our education system. It is the right thing to do for our Nation. 
   The Mikulski-Boxer amendment, which is supported by many others too  numerous to mention, is so important. Since we can look back at the budget vote and see that a similar amendment was, in fact, adopted across the board by the committee in a bipartisan vote, this is the logical next step--to put the numbers behind the idea that every single child in America should come on board this information age and do well in school, do well in the family, and do well in a future career. 
   I thank the Chair, and I thank my assistant minority leader.

   Mrs. BOXER. I say to the Senator from New Mexico, I am proud to be a sponsor of his amendment. The Senator goes to the heart of what our country's priority ought to be--frankly, what all of the Republicans and Democrats alike say our priority ought to be. When we look at numbers, we realize the Republican budget is going to be devastating to education. 
   I engage my friend in a question about afterschool programs. The Senator and I have worked hard in getting more funding for afterschool. Thanks to a lot of hard work in this Congress and with the Vice President's leadership, we have seen spending on afterschool programs go up to about $453 million in the year 2000. By the way, a few years ago it was $1 million; then it was $40 million. The need is tremendous. 
   The President is asking in his budget to accommodate the waiting list of children, which is more than one million children. He envisions spending $1 billion on afterschool programs to accommodate that wait. In the Republican budget, that number is cut by $547 million; it freezes the amount for afterschool. 
   I ask my friend, because he works so hard on the issue of school dropout rates and helping kids who need a hand, and he does so much work on gang violence prevention, does the Senator think this Republican budget is going to harm these million children? If we go with the President's numbers, they will be included in his programs.

   Mrs. BOXER. I know the Senator is aware, but I want to underscore the incredible support afterschool programs have with the American people. Ask the American people, and 90 percent of them support safe afterschool programs for our children. 
   In addition, is the Senator aware that this is a top priority for law enforcement? Look at the FBI statistics. Juvenile crime occurs from the hour of 3 p.m., and it starts to go down around 6 o'clock or 7 p.m. 
   If my friend could answer that question, is he aware that this is a priority with the American people? 
   Again, I do agree with the Senator from California that this is a top priority with the American people and with much of law enforcement. I have had law enforcement officers in my State, police from local and State Police organizations, tell me they wish we would do more to deal with juvenile crime in these types of programs so they would not have to do so much afterwards, when crimes have been committed.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I thank Senator ROTH for offering this amendment. I offered almost an identical amendment in the Budget Committee, and it failed on a tie vote. I am very hopeful that we will do better on the floor of the Senate. We were able to pick up one Republican in the committee. We had all the Democrats. I think we have a good chance of picking up, with the help of Senator ROTH and Senator CHAFEE, some more on their side of the aisle. 
   This amendment would strike from the budget $1.2 billion in receipts that  the budget resolution assumed would be received from oil exploration or drilling operations in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. 
   I stand with those who have spoken very eloquently tonight, and say that we cannot allow that beautiful, pristine sanctuary--one of the most remarkable wildlife habitats in the world--to be spoiled. 
   We have a beautiful picture, with which I am sure Senator MURKOWSKI is familiar. 
   The wildlife refuge was established in 1960 by a Republican President, President Dwight D. Eisenhower. And it was for the benefit of his generation and future generations; that is, all of us. I think we have an obligation to keep that going, just as he kept it going for us. 
   From the very beginning, support for this refuge has been bipartisan. Thank goodness we see evidence of that on the Senate floor. Too few times, I am sad to say, do we see such bipartisanship. That is why I am delighted to work with Senator ROTH on this. 
   This land that President Eisenhower set aside in the Arctic wilderness is ecologically unique. It is the last remaining region where the complete spectrum of Arctic and sub-Arctic ecosystems can be found. It includes the highest peaks and glaciers of the Brooks Range. 
   President Eisenhower's Secretary of the Interior, Fred Seaton, called the new Arctic Refuge ``one of the most magnificent wildlife and wilderness areas in North America.......a wilderness experience not duplicated anywhere else.'' 
   Nothing has changed since then. It is still there. But we can destroy it here. 
   I am stunned that the Budget Committee let this go. I am stunned the majority on the Budget Committee put in $1.2 billion as if we were going to allow this to happen next year. We are not going to allow this to happen. 
   I would like to say tonight to my good friend from Alaska, whom I respect--we have some good arguments now and then, and we probably will have them again--that we are going to fight this out. To put $1.2 billion in as if we were going to start getting receipts from this next year makes no sense at all. 
   I can guarantee--I shouldn't say that because you never can guarantee anything around here, but I believe we will have more than 41 people who will stand on their feet as long as it takes to stop that from happening. 
   To put it in the budget resolution, No. 1, is wrong because it is presuming the Senate is going to approve this when I don't believe it will happen. 
   This area is tremendously rich with nearly 200 different wildlife species including polar bears, grizzlies, wolves, caribou, and a whole list of others, including millions of migratory birds. Amazingly, birds from the Arctic Refuge fly to or through every State in the continental United States of America. This is not only an Alaska issue. We all benefit from this refuge. I cannot reconcile the concept of drilling with a wildlife refuge. It seems to me they don't go together. If you are going to set aside a wildlife refuge, you should not allow drilling there at all. Drilling will raise disturbing questions about what our refuges are for. If wildlife are not guaranteed protection from oil drilling, where are they safe? 
   My colleague, Senator ROTH, has introduced legislation, of which I am a cosponsor, which would forever safeguard this great national treasure by designating it wilderness area. This permanently protects it from oil exploration and development. That protection is warranted and reasonable. As Senator DURBIN has pointed out, nearly 95 percent of the arctic slope is available to industry for oil and gas development. It makes sense to shield this last remaining piece. I hope Chairman ROTH's wilderness proposal will get full consideration. 
   Instead, what are we seeing? Instead of moving forward with that wonderful piece of legislation that has bipartisan support, we have a budget resolution that essentially slaps its hand at Senator ROTH's legislation and includes $1.2 billion, as if we will open it up without a fight. 
   It isn't going to happen. It is not realistic. It is funny numbers. It isn't going to happen. We are not going to let it happen. What we should be doing is passing Senator ROTH's legislation for our wilderness instead of plugging in a number. 
   It reminds me of the fight over the Presidio. Senator MURKOWSKI from Alaska helped me save the Presidio. One year, I say to Senator MURKOWSKI, there was a plug put in the budget of $1 billion for selling the Presidio. As I explained to my friends, that will never happen; the city and county of San Francisco would not allow this magnificent former military base to become anything other than a park; you are not going to get $1 billion there. Finally, I prevailed on my colleagues. They backed off and we never put the plug in. 
   And we are prevailing tonight. Don't put that $1.2 billion plug in because it is not real. It is wrong. It goes against what we ought to be doing. 
   I understand the rising gas price phenomenon because I am in a State that has some of the highest gas prices. Believe me, it hurts at the pump. We are looking at $2 a gallon where I come from. 
   My constituency wants me to do something about it, and I have come up with a plan. The plan is pretty straightforward. No. 1, why are we exporting gas from Alaska to other countries when we need to use it here? That is 68,000 barrels a day. Second, why don't we increase the energy efficiency of SUVs and light trucks? That will bring 1 million barrels a day. We can do that to get them up to 27 miles per gallon. That can be done. 
   Why don't we say there should be a moratorium on the oil company mergers? We know less competition brings higher prices. It is the rule of a capitalistic system. We need more competition. That is what we ought to be doing. We ought not be drilling in a wildlife refuge on the coast of California or any of our magnificent offshore areas.

We delivered every single Democrat for the environment. I was proud of that. I was very pleased we had an additional vote in the committee from the Republican side, Senator SNOWE. I thank her from the bottom of my heart. 
   Again, this is a bipartisan issue. It dates back to the Eisenhower administration. Let us stand together across party lines. Let us get rid of this $1.2 billion revenue. It is wrong to put it in there because it is wrong to drill in this refuge. It is wrong to put it in there because it, frankly, isn't going to happen.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise as a member of the Budget Committee. I am honored to serve on that committee. Our chairman, PETE DOMENICI, is an expert on understanding the budget. Our ranking member, Senator LAUTENBERG, whom we will miss greatly when he retires, is likewise an expert. 
   What is intriguing about this year's budget is that it shows the difference between the two parties. Sometimes we come to the floor and it is hard to know the differences between the parties because the rhetoric may sound the same. The budget is dealing with hard dollars, and we are placing those hard dollars in different categories. No one can run away from the fact that they do less for debt reduction, they do less for prescription drugs, they do less for education, and they do more to help the wealthiest in our society. The numbers are there; you cannot hide the numbers. 
   I say with due respect to my chairman, PETE DOMENICI, he doesn't want to do that. He wants to make the fight on the differences. And so do I. 
   The reason I have always chosen to be on the Budget Committee both in the House, where I served for 10 proud years, and the Senate, where I am now serving for 7, is that the budget we do once a year--and, by the way, I think it is important to do it once a year; I don't support the notion of going to budget every 2 years--is the budget that is the roadmap to our Nation. It is not a dry document. It may appear boring because we are putting numbers next to functions, but when we get behind the numbers, what does it mean? Look at defense; we know what it means. Look at domestic discretionary; we know what it means. We know what it means for education. We know what it means for the environment. 
   By the way, I want to make a point about the environment. I am thoroughly distressed that for the first time in the history of the Senate in a budget resolution, this budget resolution calls for oil drilling in a national wildlife refuge. 
   Never before in a budget resolution have we done that. And not only are we calling for drilling in this preserve, we are putting the receipts for this drilling in this budget, over $1 billion of receipts. 
   I am proud to say we are going to have a bipartisan amendment to delete that reference to drilling in Alaska, the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. It is called ANWR. Those who do not care about the environment are using the gas prices as an excuse to open this area up while they are turning away from energy efficiency, turning away from the fact that, as we speak, we are exporting Alaskan oil that belongs to the American people. We are exporting it to Asia instead of keeping it here--68,000 barrels a day. And they are turning their heads to the fact we are allowing huge mergers to take place in the oil industry, which is, in fact, manipulating the supply. 
   What do they want to do? Open up the wildlife refuge in Alaska. I ask you a commonsense question. You have a wildlife refuge. How is that consistent with drilling oil? We have seen the oilspills. We know the devastation that can be wreaked. The bottom line is, I am very distressed that this budget is clearly a document that is antienvironment, and the American people support the environment.  
   I want to ask a commonsense question. If you are living in a time of the greatest economic recovery in the history of the United States of America, and you know what policies led to that--fiscal responsibility, targeted tax cuts to those who need it and not to those who do not need it, investments in education, investments in the environment, protecting Medicare and Social Security--why would you not continue those policies? 
   I am going to show you some charts that indicate we have had the greatest economic recovery in generations and generations and generations. Why would you turn away? Why would George W. Bush have policies that turn away from this success? Why would the Republicans in the Senate have policies that turn away from this success and would take us back to dangerous times? To me, it makes no sense at all. It is common sense that if something is working in a business and you are doing great because of the policies you put into place, you don't turn away from those policies. You continue those policies. This budget leads us away from those policies. 
   Let me talk about this return to fiscal strength. In 1992, we had a record deficit of $290 billion and we have a surplus of $179 billion in 2000. In the last 2 years, we paid down the debt for the first time instead of racking up huge debt. This has sparked the longest economic expansion in the history of the country, 108 consecutive months, and counting, of economic growth; 20.8 million new jobs; the lowest unemployment rate in 30 years--4.1 percent versus 7.5 percent that prevailed in 1992--and record American home ownership of 67 percent. 
   Those are the facts. Those are not made-up numbers. Why would we turn away from those policies? That is what the Republican budget does; it makes a U-turn on those policies, following the leadership of George Bush. 
   Let me show you these charts. Here you see the budget deficit was $290 billion. We now have a surplus of $179 billion. What was the projection in 1992, before the Clinton-Gore team came in? It was $455 billion worth of deficits. That was the projection; instead, there is a $179 billion surplus. 
   We have paid down $140 billion of the debt in the last 2 years. Here is where we see that. Instead of $761 billion of projected debt increases for 1998-1999, we actually are paying down the debt. 
   This chart is titled ``Fiscal Discipline Sparks Robust Private Sector Investment.'' In other words, when you do not have to pay so much interest on the debt, there is money around for the private sector to invest. Look what happened just in equipment and software investment. The investment is up 12.1 percent. The unemployment rate, I told you before, declined from 7.5 percent to 4.1 percent. Some people consider this full employment. 
   Another way to look at the jobs, 20.8 million new jobs--this is a beautiful number here, charted straight up since 1992. Record home ownership, up from 64 percent to 67 percent. The American dream is being realized; 67 percent of Americans own their own home. 
   We have rising incomes for all groups. In every single group, we have seen rising incomes. These are the quintiles: 10 percent in the first, or lowest-income people; increase, 11 percent in the second quintile; 10 percent in the third; 10 in the fourth; and 12 in the higher incomes. All the talk about, oh, we are taxing the people in the upper incomes; they are getting killed--they have had the largest increase in their income, 12 percent. 
   The Federal income tax burden has declined. It has declined for the average family of four. ``Federal Tax Level Falls For Most,'' this is an article from the Washington Post. We are paying less income taxes than we did before. 
   This record economic expansion presents a historic opportunity, and I think the Democratic budget, the alternative we have to vote on, seizes this opportunity. It meets the fiscal challenges ahead because we cannot take this for granted. We know that. We need to strengthen Social Security. As somebody said: When the Sun is shining, you fix the roof. You don't wait for the rain to fall. 
   That is what our Democratic budget does. It strengthens Social Security and Medicare. It sets up a lockbox, not only for Social Security but for Medicare. Let the record show, when Senator CONRAD offered a lockbox for Medicare, the Republicans voted in lockstep against it. They are not protecting Medicare. 
   We place a top priority on adding a prescription drug benefit. We pay down the national debt. We use honest budget numbers. And we expand opportunity by investing in education and other priorities to help people realize the American dream. In my opinion, the Republicans squander this opportunity with an irresponsible tax cut. As Senator DURBIN has said, it is targeted to the wealthiest; it is going to risk Social Security and Medicare; it is going to make it impossible to do a prescription drug benefit; and it is going to make it impossible to invest in education and the environment and the kinds of things the American people want. 
   Why do I say this? Because the Senate Republicans take the nondefense discretionary money--in other words, the money we can spend on education, the environment, Medicare, and the rest--and they actually cut it below a freeze. This is not me talking; this is the Congressional Budget Office. They say a freeze is $296.1 billion; the Senate Republicans come in at $289 billion. 
   That is unrealistic, and it is not what the American people want. They do not want a risky tax cut. They want a targeted tax cut to the middle class, leaving enough money to invest in their priorities. This is the hub and the nub of the problem. 
   The Republican budget cuts domestic priorities--$89 billion to $117 billion of domestic cuts between 2001 and 2005. 
   What does this mean? Let's talk turkey about what this means. 
   Education: It will prevent the hiring of 20,000 new teachers to lower class sizes. 
   Head Start: 62,000 fewer children served. 
   Basic research: 19,000 fewer researchers receiving support. 
   Environment: Funding eliminated for all 15 new federally led cleanups. 
   Law enforcement cuts: No funds for hiring additional police officers. 
   The Republicans have admitted it. They said: We will take these tax cuts one salami slice at a time. That is what Senator LOTT has said; he has admitted it. And he shows the different salami-sliced tax cuts: 
   $182 billion for the marriage penalty tax. We know we need to fix that problem. It does not take $182 billion to do it. We can do it for less; 
   $122 billion in small business tax breaks. We can do it for less; 
   $21 billion tax breaks contained in the education savings account that go to the wealthiest among us. 
   It goes on and on. They are doing it one salami slice at a time, and it adds up to one big salami which is going to put us back in the red. It is going to use the entire non-Social Security surplus and maybe even dip into the surplus. 
   Senator DURBIN showed my colleagues the Bush tax cut. I want to ask one question: Is it fair to give a $50,000 a year tax cut to people earning over $300,000 a year? It is unbelievable. People work for the minimum wage. They make $11,000 a year. The wealthiest will get $50,000 a year. 
   I ask unanimous consent for an additional 3 minutes to conclude.

   Mrs. BOXER. This Bush tax cut is not fair. This is not fair. It jeopardizes our economic recovery. Do my colleagues know what people who are in the bottom 60 percent with incomes below $39,000 get? They get back $249 a year. If one earns over $300,000, they get back over $50,000 a year. It makes no sense. Why not give the tax breaks to the people who need it, not the people who do not need it. Their tax burden is not overly high. They are doing very well, thank you very much. 
   Some of the wealthiest people in America live in California in the high-tech sector. Do my colleagues know what they tell me. They say: Senator BOXER, don't do this. I don't need the money. I am making millions of dollars. I don't need a risky tax break that is going to jeopardize this economic recovery. 
   It makes no sense.

   Mrs. BOXER. Yes, and I have referred to them in these remarks. It was a tremendous series that essentially showed the average families paying less of a burden in Federal income taxes. It makes no sense at all to give back $50,000 to the people earning over $300,000 and set at risk this amazing economic recovery. The American people want debt reduction, and that is what our Democratic alternative offers. 
   I say to my friend, doesn't he think that is the wise thing to do--debt reduction and sensible investments in education, the environment, and other priorities, and targeted tax cuts to the middle class?

   Mrs. BOXER. There is absolutely no question. I know my friend knows this, but I want to quote to him Chairman Alan Greenspan, a Republican, who said:  
   Saving the surpluses is ..... in my judgment, the most important fiscal measure we can take at this time to foster continued improvements in productivity.  
   He says basically pay down the debt, and the Republicans are blinded on that point. They have a Presidential candidate who has made a bad decision. He will not back off from it. The people are going to understand that it is going to put our economic recovery at risk. We have to save Social Security. We have to save Medicare. We need a prescription drug benefit for our senior citizens, and we need to be wise and continue this economic recovery. 
   In conclusion, I hope the Democratic budget proposal will win the day. Having said that, I am a realist, and I know we are going to see a party-line vote for this Republican budget. I will say unequivocally, the Democratic plan reduces the debt; it makes investments in Medicare, the environment, and education. I hope we will not turn our backs on this economic recovery. The American people want it to continue. 
   I thank the Chair. I thank my chairman for allowing me this time.

    Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, it is a pleasure to alert my colleagues to the March 31 dedication of Willie Mays Plaza at the new Pacific Bell Park in San Francisco. This dedication is the first in a series of events leading to opening day on April 11, when the hometown Giants begin a new era against their old rivals the Los Angeles Dodgers. 
   The opening of the new park is cause for great excitement among baseball fans in San Francisco, in California and throughout the country. Situated a short distance from downtown and directly on the Bay, Pacific Bell Park is both an architecturally stunning building and a state-of-the-art baseball facility. Notably, it is the first privately financed professional ballpark in the United States in 35 years. And unlike the Giants former home at Candlestick Park, PacBell Park is for baseball only. 
   Willie Mays Plaza is located at the main entrance to the park at Third and King Streets. In recognition of Willie Mays' number, the official address of the stadium is 24 Willie Mays Plaza. In addition, the plaza features 24 palm trees and a nine-foot bronze sculpture of the hall of famer. This handsome public space is a fitting tribute to a living legend. 
   It is very appropriate that the Giants have chosen to honor Willie Mays in this way. Arguably the greatest all-around player to ever play the game, if Willie Mays is not synonymous with baseball, he is certainly synonymous with the Giants. He began his career with the team in 1951 and made the move to San Francisco with the club in 1957. All told he played 20 years in a Giants uniform. Over the course of his fabled career, he hit 660 homeruns, had 3,283 hits and 1,903 runs batted in. And if this were not enough, he scored 2,062 runs, stole 338 bases, earned 12 consecutive Gold Gloves and had a career batting average of .302. A true student of the game, it is small wonder that Willie Mays remains a hero to countless fans the world over. 
   After a brief stint with the New York Mets at the very end of his career, Willie Mays soon returned to the Giants. Since his retirement in 1972, he has never strayed far from the game or the organization. He is currently Special Assistant to Giant's President Peter Magowan. In this capacity, he is an ambassador for the team at all manner of civic and charitable events. 
   On the field and off it, Willie Mays has always embodied dedication, teamwork and the pursuit of excellence. In naming this prominent part of Pacific Bell Park in his honor, the San Francisco Giants are assuring that the Say Hey Kid's example will grace this city, this team and its loyal fans for many years to come.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise to oppose amending the Constitution of the United States to outlaw flag burning, and I will support the McConnell statute to punish flag burners who want to incite violence. The flag stands for freedom, and so does our Bill of Rights. I believe that both must be protected. 
   Colin Powell recently wrote, ``I would not amend that great shield of Democracy to hammer a few miscreants. The flag will still be flying proudly long after they have slunk away. Finally, I shudder to think of the legal morass we will create in trying to implement the body of law that will emerge from such an amendment.'' 
   As our good friend John Glenn, a great Senator, a great astronaut, and a great Marine, once declared, ``[I]t would be a hollow victory indeed if we preserved the symbol of our freedoms by chipping away at those fundamental freedoms themselves. Let the flag fully represent all the freedoms spelled out in the Bill of Rights, not a partial, watered-down version that alters its protections.'' 
   We can solve this problem with an amendment that is identical to a statute written by the Senator from Kentucky, the Flag Protection Act of 1999. 
   This amendment would protect the flag of the United States from being destroyed or damaged in certain situations. Under this amendment, any person who destroys or damages the flag of the United States with the primary purpose and intent to incite or produce imminent violence or a breach of peace will receive a stiff fine, imprisonment, or both. 
   This amendment also increases the fine and imprisonment penalties for damaging a flag belonging to the United States or damaging a flag on Federal land. 
   I support this amendment because I believe that our flag is the very symbol of our liberty, unity, and equality as a nation--a proud reminder of the democracy we hold so dear. But while we should protect the American flag, we also must remain vigilant in our protection of the Constitution. 
   This amendment stands on solid constitutional ground. Although the statute criminalizes the destruction or damaging of the American flag with the intent to provoke imminent violence or breach of the peace, Supreme Court precedent supports this approach. In Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire (1942), the Court upheld the constitutionality of laws that prohibit expression calculated, and likely to cause, a breach of the peace. 
   So I support this amendment because it not only protects our American flag, but it also preserves the rights and freedoms established in the United States Constitution. 
   Today, we have an opportunity to protect our flag. But just as important, we can preserve the constitutional ideals symbolized by the flag.

   Mrs. BOXER. I am pleased to introduce legislation to expand the boundary of Sequoia National Park to include Dillonwood Grove. 
   The 1,540-acre Dillonwood Grove is the largest privately owned stand of giant sequoias and borders the southern boundary of Sequoia National Park. 
   The Dillonwood and Garfield Groves together form one of the five largest giant sequoia groves in the world. The Garfield Grove is already in the Park. Management of these groves as a single unit as part of the National Park will reunite the 3,085-acre Dillonwood-Garfield Grove, historically separated in name only. 
   For more than one thousand years, the massive trunks of Dillonwood's giant sequoias have towered above the headwaters of the North Fork of the Tule River at the foot of Moses Mountain in California's southern Sierra Nevada. 
   Home to mountain lions and bears, Dillonwood's canyons and steep mountain ridges funnel wind currents flown by some of the last California condors seen in the wild. 
   More than a thousand years ago, Indians gathered at a high-elevation summer camp below Dillonwood's granite outcroppings. 
   In the late 1800s, early settlers operated a mill on the site. Today a healthy, 120-year-old giant sequoia forest is rising among the ancient monarch trees. No second-growth giant sequoia forest of this age is currently fund anywhere in the Park. 
   The Save-the-Redwoods League has negotiated an option to purchase the Dillonwood Grove for $10 million, based on its appraised value. This funding will be equally matched by federal and non-federal sources. 
   I am pleased that my Republican colleague Congressman RADANOVICH introduced the identical bill in the House last week. I also want to thank my colleague Senator FEINSTEIN for cosponsoring my bill. 
   Dillonwood's rich natural and cultural heritage will be an important and significant addition to the legacy of our national parks. I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, gasoline prices have reached astronomical levels. Nowhere has this price increase been more apparent than in California. For several years now, we have been experiencing gasoline prices well above what the rest of the nation has faced. 
   But now, this problem, which started on the West Coast, has moved east and is affecting everyone. On Monday, the Energy Information Administration reported that the average price of gasoline in the United States was $1.52 per gallon--the tenth straight week gasoline prices have gone up. That price is  52 cents higher than the national average price just one year ago. 
   As I said, in California, the problem is even worse. The average price for a gallon of gasoline is now $1.79--up 57 cents per gallon from this time last year. 
   These prices are all-time highs. 
   Mr. President, I believe that there are several steps that can be taken to address this problem and to help American consumers. We should impose a moratorium on major oil company mergers. We must have vigorous enforcement of the antitrust laws. We should increase the Corporate Average Fuel Economy standard for SUVs and light trucks so that it equals the standard for cars. And, we should ban the exportation of crude oil from Alaska's North Slope. 
   I want to talk about this last suggestion, because it is the subject of a bill I am introducing today, called the Oil Supply Improvement Act. 
   For 22 years--from 1973 to 1995--the export of Alaska North Slope oil was banned. We banned it to reduce our dependence on imported oil and to keep gasoline prices down. 
   Unfortunately, at the behest of oil producers--and despite warnings of higher gasoline prices--the ban was lifted in 1995. Clearly, the fears of those of us who opposed lifting the ban have become reality. The General Accounting Office has confirmed that lifting the export ban resulted in an increase in the price of crude oil by about $1 per barrel. 
   In fact, some oil companies have used their ability to export this oil to keep the price of gasoline on the West Coast artificially high. The Federal Trade Commission makes this charge in its lawsuit to block the merger of BP-Amoco and Arco. That suit also alludes to secret internal company documents showing that there was price manipulation. Alaska North Slope oil was exported specifically to keep gasoline prices on the West Coast high. 
   Mr. President, I am not suggesting that this bill alone is the complete solution. It is only one piece of the puzzle, and only one of the things that I am suggesting. But when we have an energy shortage in this country, we should not be sending the oil in this country somewhere else. 
   This is oil that is on public lands--and that is transported along a federal right-of-way. Taxpayers own this product. In this time of an energy shortage, it is time to put American consumers and industry first.

   Mrs. BOXER. I will take 60 seconds at this time, and then I will yield to Senator DASCHLE, who will speak on his leader time. I am so proud he has come over to the floor. 
   I wish to say in this minute, before my friend from Rhode Island leaves, what an amazing addition he is to this Senate. I say that from the bottom of my heart. I served with him in the House and he was a great House Member. I predict he has an unbelievable future in the Senate. Why do I say that? Because he has courage, because he has conviction. He is not afraid to take the floor on issues that are difficult; to take on, perhaps, some of the special interests that, believe me, do not take kindly when you stand up and speak from your heart about issues that impact on their bottom line. In this case, it is the bottom line of groups out there that want us to take no action against gun violence. 
   We have a plan. We have a great plan that passed the Senate. It is endorsed by so many law enforcement groups and the vast majority of the American people. I can think of no more appropriate speaker than our Democratic leader to tie the pieces together and to talk about why the time is ripe. 
   I did offer a similar resolution to that of Senator REED. I am proud to cosponsor his. It got 49 votes--49-49. We didn't know that or Vice President Gore would have broken the tie. Next time we will be ready. 
   I yield the floor, and I will reclaim it when my leader is finished.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I thank my Democratic leader for his comments and his continual leadership on  the gun issues that impact the people of our Nation. 
   I want to set into the RECORD a series of facts, a series of statistics, a series of numbers. I know sometimes when you lay down a series of numbers such as this, people's eyes glaze over and they lose track of what you are talking about. 
   I urge everyone listening to this to think not about the numbers so much as the people behind the numbers. 
   In the year 1997, which is the last year for which we have statistics, 32,436 people died from gunshots in America--more than 32,000 people. I want everyone to think about what it would mean to you if any of these 32,000 people were from one of your families, what it would mean to you if it was your dad, if it was your mom, if it was your child, if it was your grandma, if it was your grandpa. 
   Twelve children die every single day from gunfire. Actually, if you average it out, it is between 12 and 13 children under the age of 18--each and every day. 
   Our children are dying. And what are we doing? We are dithering around doing nothing about it. 
   I understand that this week we are going to take up a flag desecration amendment. There are those who believe we need to protect the flag by authoring an amendment changing the Bill of Rights for the first time in our history to specifically spell out an antidesecration flag amendment. I will be supporting a statute, a bill, to protect the flag. I do not think we need to go to such a step as amending the Bill of Rights. But be that as it may, flag desecration is an issue. 
   In over 200 years, there has been an average of one flag desecration a year, and we are acting again. Mr. President, 32,436 people died in 1997--in 1 year--and we are doing nothing. Why can't we protect the flag and take care of protecting the people? Why can't we protect the desecration of the flag by a statute that is easy to do and then bring up the juvenile justice bill and protect the thousands of people who are dying each and every year? What about the desecration of the children, of the families? 
   In the 11 years of the Vietnam war--one of the most tragic periods in our history--58,168 fine, wonderful, glorious Americans died in combat. There is a number, a number that is enshrined on the wall on that beautiful memorial down here that we all go to often--and we should go to often--to pay our respects. It was a war that destroyed so many families; and so many veterans who came back then committed suicide because of that war. It was a time in our history when our country came to its knees; 58,168 Americans died in Vietnam over an 11-year period. Let me tell you how many Americans have died over an 11-year period from gunshots not related to any war: 395,441 Americans. 
   Mr. President, 58,168 Americans died in the Vietnam war; 395,441 Americans died from gunshots in an 11-year period. What are we doing about it? Nothing. That is the equivalent of almost seven Vietnam wars over an 11-year period. What are we doing about it? Nothing. 
   We hear the NRA President say: We should do nothing. His answer is give more guns to people. 
   For every American who dies from gunfire, another three are injured. 
   Over that 11-year period, we have almost a million people injured from gunfire. They could be paralyzed. These could be very serious injuries, and sometimes they are. Fifty people killed or injured in school shootings in America in the last year. Thirty-one percent of children age 12 to 17 know of someone their age who is carrying a gun--gun-packing children. We are to blame. They are not to blame. We are the grown-ups. We set the rules. This is a society of law and order. What are we doing about it in the Senate? Nothing. 
   Fifty percent of children age 9 to 17 are worried about dying young. What kind of America do we have now? When I was growing up, I didn't think I was going to die young. I thought I was going to go to school, get an education, have a family, work, have a life of fulfillment. I never thought for one minute that that could all be ended by a gunshot from a friend, a classmate on the street, in a McDonald's, in a drive-by shooting, road rage. 
   We had better face our problems. We have the greatest country in the world, but we have problems. We need to face them. We are not here to ignore problems. We are not here to say everything is great. We need to act on our problems. This is a problem. 
   Listen to the law enforcement groups that back us on this when we say bring out the juvenile justice bill. 
   The juvenile justice bill; that is the one bright spot. We passed it in a bipartisan fashion about a month after Columbine, with Al Gore casting a tie-breaking vote on one of the most important amendments. This is what we passed. 
   We closed the gun show loophole--Senator LAUTENBERG's amendment--that allowed criminals to walk into a gun show and simply get it. He could be crazy. He could be a felon. He could be intending to kill people on the street, to kill people in a school, to harm himself. He could walk into a gun show without having a background check. But if he went into a gun store, he would have to have a background check. All we did was close that loophole. What is the Senate doing about it now? Nothing. It is languishing in the committee. 
   We banned the importation of high-capacity clips which are used in semiautomatic assault weapons. That was Senator FEINSTEIN's amendment, a very important amendment. 
   We prohibit the domestic manufacture of those clips, but the importation continues. These clips are coming in. We simply say: End that importation. We passed that. 
   We passed the Kohl amendment requiring that child safety locks be sold with every handgun. 
   We passed the Boxer amendment which required the Federal Trade Commission and the Attorney General to study the extent to which the gun industry markets its products to juveniles. These companies are manufacturing guns that resemble toys, that are sold to youngsters and get them interested. 
   We made it illegal with the Ashcroft amendment to sell or give a semiautomatic assault weapon to anyone under the age of 18. 
   Five amendments, we passed them in a bipartisan way. They went off to conference, and they have been languishing for now 9 or 10 months. It is the same with Senator REED's amendment. 
   It is time to stop the dithering. It is time to stop bowing to the National Rifle Association and bowing to the gun lobby. It is time to stand up and be courageous, bring those amendments forward, protect our children, and stop the carnage 
   that is happening in our country. 
   Who supports these five sensible gun control amendments? Senator LEAHY, in his wonderful opening remarks today, put them forward: The International Association of Chiefs of Police, International Brotherhood of Police Officers, Hispanic American Police Command Officers Association, Police Executive Research Forum, Police Foundation, Major Cities Chiefs, Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association, the National Sheriffs Association, the National Association of School Resource Officers, the National Organization of Black Law Enforcement Executives. 
   We cannot have a more diverse group of law enforcement. 
   We have five important, sensible gun control laws that passed the Senate, that went into a conference committee. 
   If one reads how a bill becomes law, they know how it is done: A bill has to pass the House; a bill has to pass the Senate. The juvenile justice bills passed both bodies. You then go to the conference committee. Both sides sit across from each other and talk about what belongs in the bill. They bring the bill forward, and we vote up or down. This bill has languished for 10 months. 
   Now, what is some good news? Senator DASCHLE alluded to the Smith & Wesson agreement. Smith & Wesson is the largest manufacturer, if not one of the largest, of handguns. They have made an agreement as part of a lawsuit because gun manufacturers are now being sued for these deaths. They have agreed that all their handguns and pistols will now be shipped with child safety devices. Within 2 years, the handguns will be manufactured with internal locks. If a child picks up a gun and they don't know the combination, they will not be able to turn and hurt anyone--sensible.  
   Within 1 year, all pistols will be designed so they can't be readily operated by a child under the age of 6. Handguns must pass a performance test. That gets to a bill I have about banning junk guns. They will drop these guns down. They will see if they go off. A lot of these handguns are so cheaply made, they fire when you don't want them to, and when you need them to, they jam up. They are not good products. They are junk guns. Smith & Wesson is going to put forward a test. 
   Every handgun will be designed with a second hidden serial number so they can be traced in a crime--another very important point. The company will sell only to authorized distributors and authorized dealers who adhere to a strict code of conduct. That means they will perform the background check. They will make sure the person coming in is not inebriated, is not high on drugs, doesn't have a criminal record, isn't under age. They will not sell any gun at any gun show unless every seller at the gun show conducts a background check. They will not sell their guns until that background check is completed, and they say it may well take 3 days. 
   They will not sell any high-capacity magazines or semiautomatic assault weapons. They will not sell products to anyone who has not taken a certified firearms safety course. And Smith & Wesson dealers will only allow purchasers to take one gun with them at a time. 
   They will have to wait a couple of weeks before they get their other gun. The company will devote 2 percent of its revenues to development of smart guns and within 3 years the smart gun technology, which allows only the authorized person to shoot it, will be in place. All new models will not be able to accept magazines with a capacity of over 10 rounds. There will be an oversight commission to enforce this, which will include representatives from the city and State governments, and one from the gun industry. 
   So what I have laid out in this presentation, first of all, is the facts on violence in America--irrefutable facts. I give these facts out and my colleagues come up and say: Could this be true? Could it be true that in 11 years more than 300,000 Americans have been killed by gun violence? Could it be true that every day 12 or 13 children are killed? 
   They can't believe it. And we send the facts to the Centers for Disease Control. We send them to the people who keep these terrible statistics, and they come back to me and say: Senator, you are right. We doubted you. We are sorry. We can't believe this is happening in America today. But it is. 
   So we have laid out the data, the facts on gun violence in America. We have laid out the five gun provisions languishing in the conference. Commonsense gun control that passed this Senate in a bipartisan way is suddenly being smothered over there in the conference committee, and we can't get it to the floor of the Senate and the House. 
   Day after day we read about 6-year-olds shooting 6-year-olds, 10-year-olds shooting 10-year-olds, 12-year-olds shooting 12-year-olds. 
   We don't deserve to be here if we don't do this. We don't deserve to be here, let alone be reelected, if we don't do this. The Vietnam war brought the country to its knees. We lost 58,000 people-plus in that war. It was a most tragic period of time. I remember that time. But we now have 300,000 people-plus dying from guns in an 11-year period compared to 58,000, and we sit here dithering around doing nothing while law enforcement tells us to please act. ``We are outgunned,'' they tell us. ``We are losing people. We are losing this war.'' We have a war in our streets. I laid out the organizations that are backing these five sensible amendments. 
   Finally, I laid out the good news of the Smith & Wesson agreement. I call on every single gun company that wants to stay in business to go ahead and duplicate what Smith & Wesson has done. I thank them for acting. They are taking the heat for acting. I think Senator DASCHLE is right. Maybe they acted only because they had a lawsuit. Maybe they acted only because they thought they would go bankrupt if they didn't act and people would continue to sue them. The fact is, they acted; they acted on each and every point we have made on this Senate floor. 
   So, yes, we are going to see flag desecration brought up. We know over the last 200 years there has been one flag desecration a year on average, while every day 12 children are killed by guns; and over the past 11 years 300,000-plus Americans have been killed, and we do nothing. The juvenile justice bill is languishing--languishing--in the committee. I call on the Senators who are in charge of that conference--and they are my friends--to break the logjam and bring this legislation to the Senate floor. It passed with a bipartisan vote. Overwhelmingly, people want us to do it. 
   The Smith & Wesson agreement proves the point that the time is ripe for these measures. I say if we do it, we will be proud; we will have done something to protect our children, protect our people, protect our communities, and turn around a blight on our country at a time of great prosperity and great hope. 
   I see the Senator who has done such an amazing job in the Presidential race. I welcome him back. I thought the issues he raised were vital. I am glad to see him back, and as a result of his appearance on this floor, I am happy to yield at this time.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, thank you very much. I just arrived on the floor. I listened to some of the extensive remarks made by my friend from New Hampshire, Senator SMITH. I really came over to refute some of those remarks and some of those comments. 
   I have been through this fight over the judicial nominations once before. When Margaret Morrow was nominated and kept on the hook, people came to the floor of the Senate and said she was an activist, a liberal--the same buzzwords we are hearing. These buzzwords are: ``Out of control,'' ``liberal''--all of these words. 
   That was a great speech. But, unfortunately, it doesn't have anything to do with Margaret Morrow, who is as mainstream and as apple pie as you can get. 
   I say to my friend from New Hampshire, because I know people have varied opinions of this President, President Clinton, that I happen to think he has brought us out of the deepest, darkest economic nightmare we ever faced and I think will go down in history for that. But that is up to the historians. There is one thing about this President that I don't think anyone would refute. He is a pragmatist. He knows what he can get through this Senate. He certainly knows that if he puts someone before the Senate who is not in the mainstream, they are not going to get confirmed. He is not going to go through the exercise. It is very  painful for people to be nominated if they have no chance of being approved by the Senate. This President doesn't do that. In all my recommendations to him, and in all of Senator FEINSTEIN's recommendations to him, we have been very careful to make sure we refute things. 
   I hope the Senator from New Hampshire will appreciate this. 
   If I believe a judicial nominee is not going to pass the mainstream test, I don't even bother with it. If I don't believe a judicial nominee has Republican support, I will not even bother with it. 
   I have had several conversations with Chairman HATCH. He has been very clear. He says: BARBARA, you are not going to get people through who are not in the mainstream. You are not going to get people through who do not have bipartisan support. You will not get people through who do not have law enforcement support. 
   Yesterday, as Senator SESSIONS was speaking--believe me, I respect both of my colleagues' right to vote against these two nominations, if they so choose--I pointed out this wonderful record of support these two candidates have from Republicans and Democrats alike in law enforcement. My goodness, Sheldon Sloan, the head of Governor Pete Wilson's Judicial Advisory Committee, is the one who is backing Judge Paez. 
   Listen to this. I will repeat it. The head of Governor Pete Wilson's Judicial Advisory Committee is backing Richard Paez.

   Mrs. BOXER. I guess we have a conflict between the Washington Times and the New York Times. The New York Times writes today: ``Ending a Judicial Blockade.''  
   The Senate is scheduled to hold confirmation votes today that would finally end the egregious stalling by Republicans that has blocked consideration of two worthy nominees for the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, on the West Coast. Richard Paez, a respected federal district judge in Los Angeles, has been waiting four years for the full Senate to act on his nomination. Marsha Berzon, a prominent appellate litigator in San Francisco, has been waiting two years.  
   They recite the history, then state the Senate should approve the Paez and Berzon nominations. 
   The Los Angeles Times, editorial board, which is now dominated by Republicans, says: ``Judge Deserves Rousing Approval.'' It says:  
   On the bench and before that as an attorney, Paez, a 52-year-old Latino, has earned a reputation for being thoughtful, fair and committed to civil rights. He would be an asset to the circuit court.  
   The Washington Post says:  
   Judge Paez has waited four years for the Senate to consider his nomination, and Ms. Berzon has waited two. Both nominees to the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals are well qualified. It is time both were confirmed.  
   We hear the word ``activist'' mentioned. If I were to name an activist on the Republican side of the aisle, it would be my friend BOB SMITH. He is the best activist that the antichoice people have. He is an activist. He is the best activist the Humane Society has. When it comes to Judge Paez, when it comes to Marsha Berzon, I dispute the ``activist'' tag. Some have made the term ``activist'' a bad name. I don't think it is. 
   These two nominees have temperaments that fit the court. They are well reasoned. When Judge Paez was reviewed by 15 experts in the law profession, they said his opinions will stand the test of time; that he is well reasoned. The lawyers have refuted everything that has been said on this floor by people who don't know Judge Paez. 
   I will read statements from lawyers, the people who appear before him day after day, and anonymous quotes they gave to the Judicial Almanac when talking about Judge Paez and his temperament. 
   We are turning the word ``activist'' into something different. Margaret Morrow had to struggle to be confirmed. I think some of my friends on the other side of the aisle think you are an activist if you have a heartbeat or a pulse, if you are alive. Nominees have to have some opinions; that is what a judge does. 
   Accusing Judge Paez of being soft on crime is an incredible statement, because, as I understand it, a criminal sentence by Judge Paez has never, ever been overturned. 
   To hear people talk about letting rapists and other criminals free, some might have done it but not Judge Paez. He has never been overturned on a criminal sentence in his entire career, and he has been on the bench for 18 years. 
   Sometimes people come to the floor making an argument about the Ninth Circuit. How about putting two people on the Ninth Circuit who will make it better? That is the opportunity we 
   have today. 
   I will read some comments made by the lawyers who appear before Judge Paez all the time. These are people who take all sides of the issue: He is a wonderful judge. He is outstanding. He is highly competent. He is smart. He is thoughtful. He is reflective. 
   ``I don't know anyone,'' one lawyer said, ``who hasn't been exceedingly impressed by him. He does a great job.'' 
   ``He is very well prepared,'' says another. 
   ``He knows more about a case than the lawyers.'' 
   Here is another: ``I think he has a great temperament. He never says or does anything that is off. He has a good demeanor. He is professional. He doesn't have any quirks.'' 
   I listened to my friend, Senator SMITH, who is eloquent, but he is not talking about the man these lawyers know. He certainly is not talking about the man whom all the law enforcement people who have endorsed him know. 
   We hear Judge Paez is soft on crime. Why, then, does the National Association of Police Organizations endorse him? Also endorsing him is the Los Angeles Police Protective League, the Los Angeles County Police Chief Association, the Association of Los Angeles Deputy Sheriffs, the Department of California Highway Control Commissioner. Why would he have bipartisan support from California State judges and justices, such as California Court of Appeals Justice Walter Croskey, bar leaders, business leaders, community leaders, the whole Hispanic community? 
   There is a lot of discussion about what party deserves to get the votes of the Hispanics. I hope we can rise above this, but I do hope we can listen to the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce which strongly support Judge Paez. 
   I will read from their letter:  
   To the Senate majority leader from the United States Hispanic Chamber of Commerce: 
   I urge you to consider the views of the U.S. Hispanic Chamber and of the Hispanic small business community as we await a decision from the Senate on the nomination of Judge Paez. Judge Paez would be a great asset to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.  
   They conclude:  
   I therefore urge you to listen to the voice of the Hispanic community and confirm Judge Paez to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.  
   Here is a joint statement from the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce--the businesspeople--and the Hispanic National Bar:  
   The Hispanic community is justifiably proud of Judge Paez's achievement. He is a jurist of integrity and decency, a role model for Hispanics everywhere. Yet he has been kept waiting for more than 49 months for a Senate vote. We applaud Senator LOTT's decision to give Judge Paez a vote and urge the Senate to give him full and fair consideration.  
   They conclude:  
   If Judge Paez's record is reviewed fairly, he will be confirmed on a bipartisan basis.  
   I know there is some thought as we get ready for an up-or-down vote on these two nominees that there might be a motion made to indefinitely postpone this vote. I have had discussions with the Parliamentarian who believes that motion would be in order. I say it would be precedent setting. We have these candidates. They have gone through a very difficult confirmation process, being nominated a few times, getting through the committee a few times, being asked extensive questions, surviving an important cloture vote, which, frankly, they won overwhelmingly. Eighty-some Senators said they have a right to have a vote. I admire those Senators who voted for that, even though they won't vote finally for either Marsha or Richard. 
   I make an appeal: If we vote to indefinitely postpone a vote on these two nominees or one of these two nominees, that is denying them an up-or-down vote. 
   That would be such a twisting of what cloture really means in these cases. It has never been done before for a judge, as far as we know--ever. Again, it would undermine what Senator LOTT said when he said these people deserve an up-or-down vote. 
   So I make a plea to my friend, Senator SMITH. He and I go at it on many issues, but we are good friends and we like each other. Consider what you would do if you were to make such a motion, or another Senator would do so. You would be saying these two people do not deserve an up-or-down vote. I think that would be an undermining of the spirit of what we did yesterday. 
   I hope we will not go that route. What goes around comes around. Then, when you have a President who sends down a nominee, you are setting your party's President up for this kind of twisting in the wind that I do not think any nominee ought to go through. 
   I thank my friends for their indulgence. I believe very deeply we have two mainstream, strong candidates, supported by Democrats and Republicans alike, both inside the Senate and outside the Senate. We have two people who have proven their mettle. I thank them for hanging in there. I know there were times when they wondered whether it was worth it; that they had  to look at their families one more time and say, ``We don't know yet. We don't know yet. We don't know when we are getting a vote.'' That is why I brought their pictures to the floor the last couple of days, to put a face on these nominees. They have children. They have spouses. They have community friends. They work hard. Their lives have essentially been in limbo--for Marsha for a couple of years. 
   It is tough when you are in a law firm and you have been nominated. The partners don't know what to do. Do they give you more cases? Do they not? If you start a case, will you be pulled? It is a very difficult thing for an attorney in that situation. 
   For Judge Paez, it has been tough for him to hear some of the things that have been said when he is a man who has such broad-based support in the community. 
   Colleagues on both sides of the aisle, this is a big and important day. If there should be a motion made to indefinitely postpone this nomination, please do not support it. That would undermine what we promised these nominees way back several months ago when we told them they would have a vote. If we have that vote, please turn against it. And then, please vote for these nominees. They deserve your vote.

   Mrs. BOXER. I thank my friend very much.  
   I want to ask him if he read what Senator SPECTER said regarding the two cases we raised, the Maria Hsia case and the Huang case. I ask the Senator to react to this because I think it is important. 
   When asked if this vote ought to be put off, he said:  
   These matters are now ripe for decision by the Senate. There has been some suggestion of a further investigation on this matter, but when Judge Paez's nomination has been pending since 1996, and all of the factors on the record demonstrate it was the Government's failure, the failure of the Department of Justice to bring these matters to the attention of Judge Paez and on the record, he has qualifications to be confirmed.  
   In other words, what Senator SPECTER is saying is that Judge Paez was following the recommendation of the prosecutor. 
   I ask my friend: When the prosecutors say this is what we think is the best for the case, is it really that unusual for a judge to say let the prosecution stand? If we want to accuse Judge Paez of something, it ought to be that he was soft on the case, No. 1. I say to my friend: It was randomly selected; he got these two cases; he didn't ask for these cases. No. 2, he followed the prosecution's request, and he is being condemned for it. 
   My last point is--I know my friend will comment on all of this--my friend was interested in the sentencing issue surrounding Judge Paez. We have the facts on that, and he does as well. 
   I think it is important to note that if you look at U.S. district court as a whole--

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, as one of the two California Senators, this is a very big day for two Californians who have been nominated for the Ninth Circuit Court: In the case of Richard Paez, more than 4 years ago, the longest time anyone has had to wait for a vote in a 100-year history; and Marsha Berzon, nominated a couple of years ago. 
   I am grateful we have gotten to this day. I am very hopeful. In fairness, our colleagues from both sides of the aisle will make a statement on this cloture vote, if we have to have a cloture vote, that they do deserve an up-or-down vote. 
   I will attempt in the next few minutes to put a face on the nominations. I had about 5 minutes to speak yesterday and will take a little bit longer today. 
   I will introduce Marsha Berzon, who is a stellar attorney. She is shown with her husband and her two children. This is a wonderful woman. The whole family has been so excited about her nomination, but every time we think we will have a vote, we don't seem to get there. 
   I say to Marsha and her family: We will have a vote and I am optimistic you are going to be seated on this bench. 
   Marsha Berzon is exquisitely qualified, as is Richard Paez. She is a native of Ohio. She was raised in New York. She now lives in California, is married to Stephen Berzon, shown here. She practices law with her husband and is a mom of two youngsters. 
   She was first nominated to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in January of 1998, and she testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee in July of 1998. There was no action on her nomination in the 105th Congress, so her nomination was sent back and she testified on June 16, 1999. Then she was favorably reported out of the committee. 
   We are very hopeful since the committee considered her to be very well qualified that the Senate will agree. 
   Let me give a few of her qualifications. She is a nationally known and extremely well-regarded appellate litigator. She is a graduate of Harvard/Radcliffe College and Boalt Hall University of Law. She served as a law clerk for the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, Judge James Browning, and for U.S. Supreme Court Justice William Brennan. She has argued four cases in the Supreme Court of the United States and filed dozens of briefs in the Court in a wide variety of cases. She is praised broadly not only by those whom she had as clients, but more telling, I think, she is praised by the people she opposed, people on the other side of the case. People of both political parties have praised Marsha.

   Mrs. BOXER. In there you will see deans of law schools. You will see many attorneys who have come to appreciate Marsha. Again, this is a woman who has tremendous support in the community, Republican and Democrat; a fine family member. She will be an asset to this court and I am very hopeful Marsha will receive the overwhelming vote of this body. 
   Did my friend have a question? I would say to my friend, he is, I know, waiting to speak. I also had to wait quite a while. I am going to be about another 15 minutes. 
   So today we have this wonderful opportunity, yes, on Marsha, and we have an opportunity to say yes to another wonderful nominee, Richard Paez. Again, to put a face on it, here is Richard's face. This is a wonderful human being. He is a wonderful judge with many years of experience on the bench. He is a wonderful family man, married to his wife Dianne for quite a while, with two terrific kids. He is very involved with his children's lives, involved in their sports and academic achievements. He is someone most deserving of this honor I hope we are about to bestow upon him. 
   Yes, Richard has waited for 4 years. This has been very difficult for him. It has been very difficult for his family. But I can only say I am not going to look back. I want to look ahead. We are going to have a vote, and I am very hopeful we will see the tide turn in his favor. Everything I see now leads me to believe that. 
   Richard has the support of Senators HATCH and SPECTER and he just got the public support of Senator DOMENICI. We have a statement from him, which will take me just a moment to find. I am very pleased about it. 
   Yesterday, Senator DOMENICI has a statement in the RECORD. He says:  
   I rise today to announce I intend to vote to confirm Judge Richard Paez to the Ninth Circuit. He has waited 4 years. I believe the time has come.  
   He says:  
   I have reviewed Judge Paez' record, including some of the issues which appear controversial. I am satisfied he has adequately responded to the concerns.  
   I will paraphrase. He talks about those concerns. Then he goes on and says:  
   Mr. President, Judge Paez has earned bipartisan support from a variety of sources.  
   He goes through those. 
   I called Senator DOMENICI this morning--I didn't have a chance to speak to him because he was at a hearing--to thank him profusely for his support. This is a deserving man. I am proud to see Senators from the other side stepping up to the plate and supporting him. I think it is so important. 
   Richard Anthony Paez was born in Salt Lake City, UT, which happens to be the hometown of our distinguished chairman of the Judiciary Committee. He graduated in 1969 from Brigham Young University and received his law degree from Boalt Hall at the University of California at Berkeley in 1972. 
   For 13 years, he served as municipal court judge. Then he was nominated to the district court. He has been in that capacity now for about 5 1/2 years. As the first Mexican American on that district bench, he has proven himself to be a role model and a real leader. 
   He has won the respect of law enforcement and attorneys who practice in his court. They have analyzed his rulings. We have

   These are two excellent people, wonderful human beings, wonderful family members.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today is International Women's Day. To all you women out there, and men who care about women, happy International Women's Day. 
   I think it is very fitting on International Women's Day to discuss a treaty this Senate should ratify, but has not ratified in over 20 years. This treaty, signed by President Carter, almost made it to the Senate floor some 6 years ago when it was voted favorably out of the Foreign Relations Committee. Unfortunately, it was never brought up. The treaty is called CEDAW. It stands for the Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination Against Women. 
   This is a treaty that has been nicknamed the Magna Carta for women because it essentially gives basic human rights to women all over the world. That is why 165 nations, all of our allies and friends in the world, have in fact ratified it. But we haven't ratified it. One might say, well, who hasn't ratified it? I am sorry to say, we are standing with such stalwarts of democracy as Iran, North Korea, Sudan, and Somalia. We don't belong in that company. This country is, in fact, a leader of human rights. It is really an embarrassment that we have not brought that treaty to the Senate floor. 
   I wrote a resolution that calls on the Senate to ask the Foreign Relations Committee to hold a hearing on CEDAW. It now has 25 cosponsors, including Republicans. It is very simple. It expresses the sense of the Senate that the U.S. Senate Committee on Foreign Relations--that is a committee on which I serve--should hold hearings, and the Senate should act on CEDAW, should take action on this convention to eliminate all forms of discrimination against women. The resolution goes through why this treaty is so important. It talks about how important it is that CEDAW be enacted: because it would help give women equal rights, equal opportunity, equal education; it would help them get protection against violence. We know that happens all over the world where women don't have equal rights. And it would give us the clout, if you will, the portfolio to be stronger as a world leader. 
   The bottom line of this is that today I asked the Democratic leadership to ask unanimous consent to bring this resolution that I wrote to the floor. The resolution doesn't say ratify this convention. It simply says to the Foreign Relations Committee, please hold hearings. 
   It was objected to by the other side of the aisle because they don't want to have this hearing. I will discuss that because it is with great respect that I bring up these differences between the two sides of the aisle. The chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, with whom I have a wonderful relationship, a very good working relationship, took to the floor of the Senate today. He unequivocally stated--and when he wants to be unequivocal, he can--that he will not hold hearings on the Convention to Eliminate all Forms of Discrimination Against Women. And he explained why. I totally respect his right to have this  view, but I will paraphrase the reasons he gave as to why he doesn't want to hold hearings on this. I will offer another view. 
   First, he said he wasn't going to hold hearings because there are radical groups behind this treaty. 
   I ask unanimous consent to print in the RECORD a list of the organizations that have endorsed the women's convention.

   Mrs. BOXER. With the Chair's indulgence, I will read to the Senate just a few of these organizations. I want the Senate to decide if these organizations are radical or in any way not in the mainstream of thought. These are just some of the organizations that say, yes, the United States should ratify this treaty to end all forms of discrimination against women: the American Association of Retired Persons; the American Association of University Women; the American Jewish Committee; Amnesty International USA; the Bahais of the United States; the Black Women's Agenda; the B'nai B'rith International; Business and Professional Women USA; Chicago Catholic Women; Church of the Brethren, Washington Office; Church Women United; Episcopal Church; the Evangelical Lutheran Church of America; Hadassah; Human Rights Watch; The Humane Society; Lawyers Committee for Human Rights; Leadership Conference of Women Religious; National Association of Commission for Women; National Coalition Against Domestic Violence; the National Coalition of American Nuns; the National Council of Churches of Christ in the USA; the National Council of Women's Organizations; the Presbyterian Church, Washington Office; the Soroptimist International of the Americas; the Union of American Hebrew Congregations; the Unitarian Universalist Association, Washington Office; the United Methodist Church; the Women's Legal Defense Fund; and the YWCA of the United States of America. 
   I don't mind debating an issue on its merits, its demerits, its flaws, its problems. But to come to the Senate floor and say the people behind this convention to eliminate all forms of discrimination against women are radicals is simply not a fact in evidence, unless you think Hadassah is radical or the nuns are radical or all these churches and organizations are radical. They are far from radical. They are mainstream America. Mainstream America supports this, and we can't get a hearing because our chairman believes these groups are radical. 
   I understand some tactics have been used to get the chairman's attention to hold this hearing that he does not appreciate. And that is his right. But I beg my chairman to look past that and understand that these groups are in the mainstream of America. America should be in the leadership and out front on this issue. So the first point he made, I do not agree with, that radicals are behind this treaty. 
   Secondly, his other argument was that signing this international treaty would interfere with our sovereignty; in other words, it would interfere with us as lawmakers to do our job, would interfere with our laws. Nothing could be further from the truth. We have thousands of international treaties of which we are a part. They are all in this book. I won't put this in the RECORD because it would cost too much to print, but it is page after page with almost every civilized country. We  have treaties with them on all kinds of things--on science, on military aid, on human rights. 
   I will give you a couple that we signed on human rights. We are a party to a number of human rights treaties. One in particular is the U.N. Convention Against Torture, and other cruel, inhumane, and degrading treatment or punishment. We ratified that in 1990. The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights was ratified in 1992. The Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, ratified in 1994. 
   So to say that these treaties will interfere with us just doesn't make any sense. Again, it is just not a fact in evidence. 
   The third reason my chairman says he doesn't want to hold a hearing is that he believes the whole purpose of this convention is to grant women the right to choose. In other words, in his opinion, this whole thing is about abortion rights. I want to say again how off the mark I think that suggestion is. When the committee voted this convention out for ratification 6 years ago, there was a big debate on this matter. What the committee did--by the way, I will support it overwhelmingly--it said this treaty and this convention is abortion neutral. It specifically said it ``does not create or reflect an international right to abortion or sanction abortion as a means of family planning.'' It goes on, ``We don't endorse it as a means of family planning,'' et cetera. The understanding states that ``nothing in the convention reflects or creates a right to abortion'' and that ``in no case should abortion be promoted as a method of family planning.'' 
   So these issues that the chairman of the committee has raised, in my opinion, are straw men, or straw people, or straw women. They are not fact. The fact is, when we voted out this convention 6 years ago, we specifically stated it had nothing to do with abortion. The fact is that 165 nations have passed this, and we are standing with the most retrograde, rogue states in our opposition to it. There are thousands and thousands of treaties that do not interfere with our rights of sovereignty. The fact is that it has nothing to do with abortion. The most mainstream groups--and I have read some of them to you, and they are all that way--are behind this treaty and are working very hard to get it done. 
   Now, 21 years ago, the U.N. General Assembly adopted a treaty. Twenty years ago, President Carter signed the treaty. So it is really long overdue. I don't want to stand with Iran, Sudan, Somalia, and North Korea, as the rare nations who have not ratified this. I think it is a disgrace that we are not a party to this treaty. We know since 1981, when it entered into force, it has had a positive impact on the countries that have signed it. One such example is constitutional reform in Brazil, which brought significant guarantees of women's human rights, and CEDAW provides the framework for articulating these rights. 
   There are many other wonderful things that have happened worldwide as a result of this treaty. Other nations have copied word for word from the treaty the kinds of rights they are going to give women in their nations. We have an important book, ``Bringing Equality Home,'' which shows how many good things have happened because of that. 
   You might say, Senator BOXER, why does America have to act if these good things are happening? The fact is, we have to act because we should be proud that all of the things in this treaty we already do in our country. So we should be a leader, not a follower, on this. And we need that portfolio because when there is a case of a country that is not doing right by its women--and let me give you a case in point. There was a case in Kuwait where women were struggling to get the right to vote. It was a big brouhaha, and everybody thought, my goodness, we came to their assistance in the gulf war, they are going to follow suit and women will get the right to vote. Guess what happened. They did not. We were pressing them so hard, but I bet they turned to our negotiator and said, ``Wait a minute, why should we listen to you, 
   you aren't even a party to the CEDAW treaty.'' It takes away our ability to lead for equal rights for women because we have not yet ratified. 
   I am very hopeful that Senator HELMS will have a change of heart on this, although I believe he does hold strong views. But today I learned that Congressman Gilman, who is the Republican chair of the committee called the House International Relations Committee, has agreed to hold hearings on this treaty. 
   The fact is, it is our business, our work, our job. We are the ones who should be doing it. Although I am very pleased that the House is going to have the hearing--and I hope I can get over there and testify. But I think we should have our own hearings. After all, we have 25 Members of the Senate who were on this. I will read you the list of Senators who have gone on this, asking for hearings on this: Senators MURRAY, MIKULSKI, COLLINS, SNOWE, ROBB, WELLSTONE, BIDEN, LAUTENBERG, KENNEDY, SARBANES, CLELAND, Bob GRAHAM, Jack REED, LINCOLN, FEINSTEIN, LANDRIEU, FEINGOLD, DURBIN, DASCHLE, LEAHY, DODD, BINGAMAN, TORRICELLI, KERRY, and SPECTER. 
   We have many Republicans and many Democrats. I honestly think that if everyone knows about this resolution--and I will work hard on that--we will get some more. We now have a quarter of the Senate on record asking for hearings on CEDAW. My view is, since it was voted out favorably 6 years ago by the committee on a bipartisan vote of 13-5, we ought to do it again and get it moving and bring it down here for debate. 
   Women deserve equal rights, voting rights, human rights. They deserve to be protected from violence, either in their own homes or walking down the street. They should be protected against institutional violence. We have seen things that go on in Africa with operations that are forced upon women. It is very important that for us to lead in the world, we must be a leader on this treaty. 
   Again, I say to my friends on the other side who oppose this, I respect your right to oppose it. But, my goodness, what about having a hearing on it so we can listen to both sides? I think women in this country are waking up to this fact. There are so many issues we deal with every day. The women in my State are dealing with making it home in time to greet their children coming home from school or who are in day care. Their husbands are also working and putting dinner on the table and planning all the things they plan for their families. They are balancing their lives with their jobs. Do you know what? They care about this. 
   I have had meetings with many women who care about this because we are on this Earth right now and we have to try to make it a better world. We can't stop every evil, that is for sure; we know that. But we can stand for equal rights and human rights for people all over the world. We can stand up and say in certain countries women are treated like second-class citizens and, in some cases, not even third-, fourth-, or fifth-class citizens; they are treated like property. They have no respect. I just believe this great Nation of ours has come a long way to have the equality we have. Sometimes I look at the young women here and I think: Do you really know what it was like before women had equality? 
   Do you know what it was like when I went to get a job on Wall Street after graduating from college and was told: Women don't work here? The most shocking thing about it was that I said OK. And I packed up my bag and left. I didn't even argue with them. It was a given. There were only certain jobs for women. 
   I had to study to pass my test as a stockbroker on my own without the benefit of anyone. Once I got my licensing back, I said: Now, can I please be a stockbroker, and bring commission to this brokerage house, by the way? Well, all right, but just do it quietly. We want to make it look like you are a secretary. Those were tough days. It wasn't that long ago. I know I am old, but I am not that old. We faced that kind of discrimination. 
   Women could not vote until 1920. People look around here and say: Why aren't there more women? Believe me. I say that every day. But the bottom line is we didn't get to vote until 1920. We weren't used to power--not even the power to vote until the 1920s. We are learning how to deal with it now. But it takes time. Why shouldn't the world learn from our experience? What  we know to be a fact and evident is that women are equal. By the way, it doesn't mean we are better. We are equal. We are equally good in some cases and equally bad in some cases--not better. But we know that and we respect that in this country, although I would still like to see the equal rights amendment be part of the Constitution. But basically we know that. We should take that knowledge and that commitment, and make sure the women of the world have a chance at life. I think we can do it through this treaty. I would think we would be proud to do it across the party line. 
   I think this is going to become an issue in this election because there is no reason why we shouldn't at least hold a hearing and debate these issues. 
   The chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee was down here today. He was eloquent in his opposition. Now I am on the floor and he is not here. I hope I have been a little eloquent on why we should pass the treaty. Why not bring that debate inside the Foreign Relations Committee where it belongs? Why not hear from Senators on both sides who care about this one way or the other? Why not vote it out? Why not come to the floor and have a good debate on these issues, and perhaps elevate the Senate? We get into our petty quarrels. Sometimes we take up issues that are, frankly, not as important as others. This one would be one that I think would make us all proud, wherever we come out on this matter and on this question. But in terms of the arguments against it, I hope I have put the other side out on the table. 
   Good people are behind this treaty--good, mainstream American groups. The treaty is a Magna Carta for women. We ought to be proud of it. We ought to stand with the countries in the world that are civilized, that give their women equal rights and fair rights. We ought to stand with them. It is time we do it. 
   It is International Women's Day. I will end where I started with happy International Women's Day. I hope when we think about this perhaps in the next few days and weeks and months, we will factor in a very important treaty--the Convention to Eliminate All Forms of Discrimination Against Women--on the floor of the Senate for a high-level debate and a vote. 
   Thank you very much Mr. President. 
   I yield the floor. 
   Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mrs. BOXER. Reserving the right to object, and I will not object, I say, first, to the majority leader that I appreciate very much his effort to bring the nominations forward, and voting for cloture, because without that we would not be where we are. I want that understood. 
   I state on the RECORD today that this Senator believes if there is going to be a motion made--which there very well may be because that is the rumor that I hear--to indefinitely postpone a vote on one of these nominees, then I believe that kind of a motion is denying that nominee an up-or-down vote. You can argue that it is really like an up-or-down vote, but after we have gotten over 80 votes, with the help of the majority leader and Senator HATCH, in a bipartisan way--and Senator LEAHY worked on that--you would think we could vote up or down. There is no precedent that I have gotten from the Parliamentarian up to this point where he has been able to show me this was done with a judicial nomination after cloture was invoked. I wish to make that point because I don't like to ever blindside my colleagues on anything. 
   I think that if we go this route, it will be interpreted as a way to deny a vote on the nominee, and I hope this will not be the 
   case. Surely, I hope, if it is offered, we will defeat it. But it seems to me a bad precedent. I hope we won't see this go in that fashion. I thank the Chair. I shall not object.

   Mrs. BOXER. First, I thank Senator LEAHY for his extraordinary leadership. I was so taken aback by this. I made some comments to our Presiding Officer. It seems to me there is a letter of the law and a spirit of the law, there is a letter of cloture and there is a spirit of cloture. 
   We go through a situation where we say it is unprecedented to even have these cloture motions. We don't do it often. It is not unprecedented--I think seven or eight times in decades. Now we have a new way to go where we essentially would deny that individual an up-or-down vote. 
   I want to say to my friend how articulate he is on this point. I hope Senators are listening in their offices. I hope they will view this as a violation of the spirit of cloture and certainly will not go down this road. 
   That is all I can say. My colleague is right on this point.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, will you let me know when I have used seven minutes? The rest of the time will be yielded to Senator KENNEDY. 
   Mr. President, I am very pleased to be here. 
   Finally, we are debating the nominations of Richard Paez and Marsha Berzon, two eminently qualified people for the Ninth Circuit. We have heard a lot of complaining about the Ninth Circuit. I think it is important to note that many of the opinions cited on the other side of the aisle as being overturned were written by Reagan appointees. 
   This isn't about politics. This is about allowing a court to function for the justices, whether they are appointed by Ronald Reagan, or George Bush, or Bill Clinton, to give it their best judgment. We have nominated two people who would add a tremendous amount to the Ninth Circuit. 
   Instead of the negativity we have heard today, I want to put a human face on these two nominees who have waited so long for this day. 
   The first one I want to talk about is Marsha Berzon. I have a photo. Here is Marsha with her husband and children. 
   There is a reason I have done this. I think it is important when we hear about the candidates; they have kind of become statistics. People talk about how many years it has taken. 
   Here is Marsha. Here is her family. I want to talk a little bit about this eminently qualified woman. She is an outstanding woman. She has displayed in her career a strong sense of integrity, dedication, and compassion, the very characteristics we should expect any Federal judge to have. 
   She has built a distinguished career as an attorney, and beyond that she has shown through her activities in the community a real caring and concern. She is an impassioned teacher and a published author. She is a wife and mom. She is an extraordinary person who deserves confirmation. 
   I am not going to go through all of her incredible accolades through college and law school because I have a feeling we will be talking about these nominees at length at another time. 
   I will talk a little bit about her experience with Federal court issues. She specializes in U.S. Supreme Court representation. She has argued four cases before the Supreme Court and has submitted over 100 briefs to the Court on behalf of a broad spectrum of cases. In the past 5 years, she has acted as chief counsel on five Supreme Court cases, as well as cocounsel before the Court on numerous other occasions.  
   This is the kind of support that Marsha Berzon has. Let me read what Senator HATCH wrote in her favor.  
   I am impressed by Miss Berzon's intellect, accomplishments and the respect she has earned from labor lawyers representing both management and the unions.  
   I do appreciate Senator HATCH's kind words and his decisive action in behalf of Marsha Berzon. 
   Former Republican Senator James McClure of Idaho, in support of Marsha, stated:  
   What becomes clear is that Miss Berzon's intellect, experience, and unquestioned integrity have led to strong and bipartisan support for her appointment.  
   Mr. President, the gentleman who ran against me the first time I ran for Congress in 1982, Dennis McQuaid, a Republican attorney, said:  
   Unlike some advocates, Ms. Berzon enjoys a representation devoid of any remotely partisan agenda.  
   He goes on to say:  
   Frankly, her presence will enhance the reputation of the ninth circuit.  
   We can go on and on with quotes from her opposing counsel. She has support from the Los Angeles County Professional Peace Officers Association. They wrote that she is analytical, fair and thorough. 
   When it comes to Marsha Berzon, I hope we will have a tremendous vote for her. She deserves that vote. She has waited 2 years. I hope she will get it. 
   Equally important and equally wonderful in terms of a nomination that stands on its own merit is Judge Richard Paez. Look at this man. He has been on the bench for many years. Behind him are photographs of his children. He has been married for many years, another wonderful family man and a wonderful jurist. 
   This Senate has already confirmed Richard Paez to a seat on the district court, and he has shown himself to be an incredible jurist. I don't have time to go through all the accolades. He was the first Mexican American on that particular bench in Los Angeles. He has won the respect of law enforcement, attorneys practicing in his courtrooms, and local scholars. 
   When Members poke holes in Richard's record, we will have time in the next 2 days to respond to every single example because there has been tremendous misstatement. 
   In the remaining short time I have, I will quote lawyers who have appeared before him. These are anonymous quotations that appeared in a review.  
   He is a wonderful judge. He is outstanding. He rates a 12 or 13 on a scale of 10.  
   Another:  
   He is highly competent, one of the smartest people on the bench; thoughtful and reflective.  
   Another:  
   I don't know anyone here who hasn't been exceedingly impressed by him. He does a great job.  
   Another:  
   He is very well represented. He knows more about a case than the lawyers will.  
   And another:  
   He has a great temperament. He never says or does anything that is off. He has a very good demeanor. He is professional. He doesn't have any quirks. He is very fair. He has a sense of justice.  
   It goes on.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, this is a very simple amendment. It is a commonsense amendment. It is an opportunity for the Senate to be heard on the issue of gun violence. 
   I thought we were making progress after Littleton when we passed--a month after Littleton--a number of very important, commonsense gun control measures. We have yet to see those measures come back to us for final passage. We have yet to see those measures come back to us from conference. We have yet to see an interest on the part of the majority to move these important, commonsense gun control measures. 
   I am hopeful that this sense of the Senate, which calls on the Congress to act by the year anniversary of Littleton, will have some meaning to people. I trust this will pass 100-0. 
   Children in schools have a right to be safe. It is very fundamental that they be safe, almost as fundamental as their right to a free public education. 
   A safe school is essential to ensuring an environment where children can learn. We can stand here, from morning until night, with great ideas on education. Governors can come up with their own proposals on education. Local school districts can do the same. But if there is a shooting in a school, no one learns. The only thing they learn is tragedy, at an age way too young to deal with it. 
   We have an unacceptable situation in our country. If children sit in a classroom wondering if they are going to hear gunshots in the schoolyard or in the hallway, they cannot concentrate on a math problem in their classroom. 
   Again, I know the Senator from Georgia believes very strongly in his education savings account legislation. I know that we all have issues we want to put forward: smaller class sizes, rebuilding our broken-down schools. We all have a tremendous interest in improving education. But it means nothing when violence invades our schools and children are hurt or they die--schools are closed; education is disrupted. None of it means much if we cannot at least ensure safety. 
   As we said in the resolution, in the last 12 months, at least 50 people have been killed or injured in school shootings. This week it was a little 6-year-old girl who was killed in an elementary school in Michigan. My God, what is it going to take for this Senate to act? A 6-year-old child gets a gun and kills a classmate. He got the gun because an adult left it lying around. There was no trigger lock. 
   We have a bill dealing with that; it has been tied up. I do not think that is a very radical proposal. I do not think it is a dangerous proposal to put a child safety lock on a gun. That child would have brought the gun to school, it would not have gone off, and a child would not be dead. We would not have to see these children, at a tender age--a tender, tender age--I have a 4 1/2 -year-old grandchild, and I just think about the horror of a child at that age, 5 1/2 or 6 or 7 dealing with this kind of violence. It is wrong. It is unacceptable. 
   Last December, it was four middle school students who were injured by gunfire in a middle school in Oklahoma. 
   Last November, it was a 13-year-old girl who was shot in the head in a New Mexico school. 
   Last May, six students were injured at a high school in Georgia. 
   Of course, last April, 15 people died and 23 more were injured in Columbine High School in Littleton, CO. Anyone who has watched the followup stories in that community knows that the injuries done then are not fading. They have torn that community apart. 
   What are we waiting for? Sensible gun control legislation was passed by this Senate. The Vice President, AL GORE, cast a tie-breaking vote on closing the gun show loophole so people who should not have a gun would not be able to get a gun. I do not know what it will take for this Senate to act. 
   I see a couple of my friends who have come to the floor to discuss this issue with me. 
   Yesterday, there was a multiple shooting outside Pittsburgh. 
   There was a shooting in September in a Baptist church in Texas. 
   Last September, there was a shooting in the West Anaheim Medical Center in California. 
   Last August, there was a shooting at the North Valley Jewish Community Center's day-care center in Los Angeles. Will we ever forget those children, holding the hands of the police officers --babies trying to cope with what was going on. 
   Last April, there was a shooting at the Mormon Family History Library in Salt Lake City. 
   These bullets are randomly shot. It does not matter how old you are. If you are there, you are in trouble. 
   This is chaos, my friends. What did we do after Littleton? We came together. We passed gun control measures that are very sound. They are reasonable, they are moderate, and they will keep guns out of the hands of children. They will keep guns out of the hands of criminals. They will keep guns out of the hands of people who are mentally ill. They will not take guns out of the hands of people who need to have a gun to protect themselves, who are upstanding citizens. 
   So what are we waiting for? More and more of these deaths? 
   I ask my friends from California, Illinois, and Michigan how much time they would like to take on this? I am delighted to yield to them. Why don't they give me that information, and then we will set up an order.

   Mrs. BOXER. I just want to share with the Senator two numbers because he had a lot of important statistics. This is from Time magazine: Fifty percent of children ages 9 to 17 are worried about dying young, and 31 percent of children ages 12 to 17 know someone their age who carries a gun. I ask my friend to respond to that, and take as much time as he needs, and then we will yield 10 minutes to Senator FEINSTEIN.

   Mrs. BOXER. Thank you, Mr. President. 
   I say to my friend from California how proud I am to have her support. She brought to the floor of the Senate today the voices of the children. How can we possibly have a bill dealing with education that doesn't address these voices begging us to act? 
   I am so pleased she took the time because I know she has another amendment which she has to get ready for. I appreciate the Senator coming over to the floor. 
   Thirteen children every single day are killed by gun violence--13 innocent lives. There is not one Senator who doesn't agree with the statement that our children are our future. How many times do we put that in our speeches? 
   I am saddened that I don't see Members from the other side of the aisle on the floor. I don't understand why we don't have unanimity in this. In April, it is going to be a year since the tragedy of Columbine. The vision of that tragedy is on everyone's mind--the young man, not even 18 years old, trying to get out of the window of a school library with his limbs dangling from the injuries he received, the faces of the parents, and the tearing apart of that community, which has been happening ever since that tragedy. If we don't act by that date, we don't deserve to be here. 
   I agree with Senator FEINSTEIN. This is harsh talk, yes. But what are we  here for if we are not protecting our citizens and our children? What could be more important? An education savings account that gives people $7 a year? That is lovely. Great. But what does it mean if they lose the child for whom they are saving this money? 
   This is in many ways, yes, an emotional issue. It is frustrating for so many of us. 
   Senator FEINSTEIN told you about the four commonsense gun control measures that were voted out of the Judiciary Committee and that passed on this floor. There was one more that requires the Federal Trade Commission and the Attorney General to study the gun industry's marketing practices for children. I think the American people would be stunned to know these manufacturers are now producing shocking pink guns and green guns and guns that look like camouflage. They are making real guns now look like toy guns. We used to have a problem with toy guns looking like real guns. Now they are making real guns look like toy guns. That needs to be studied, too. 
   This is an amazing place. I offered the simplest amendment to an appropriations bill that passed unanimously. All it said was, if you are obviously inebriated--in other words, drunk--you cannot walk into a gun store and buy a weapon. Talk about a no-brainer. 
   We already have a law that says if the vendor thinks you are high on drugs, you can't buy a gun. So we said: Gee, this must have been an oversight. And after a little bit of debate, the other side said: Oh, OK. That is fine. They asked if I thought there ought to be a breathalyzer test. No. Of course not; this is just common sense. If you walk in and you are, obviously, inebriated such that it is obvious to the vendor, he or she cannot sell you a gun. It passed unanimously. But something happened on the way out of the conference. When the bill came back--the appropriations bill for Commerce-State-Justice--guess what was missing? This amendment. A simple amendment such as that was dropped because the NRA didn't like it. 
   Let us not be vague about this. This is what it was. 
   We have to start thinking about the welfare of the people of this country, the welfare of the children of this country, the well-being of the families of this country, and the well-being of the students of this country ahead of some special interest group that has it in its head that because you would enact a few sensible gun control measures you are threatening the country. No one is threatening the country. 
   Our European friends look at us; they cannot believe it. Our Japanese friends look at us; they cannot believe it because of these rates of death. 
   To me it is not even common sense to argue with them that we are right and they are wrong. This is from 1996: New Zealand, 2 people were murdered by guns; in Australia, 13; in Japan, 15; in Great Britain, 30; Canada, 106 in that year; Germany, 213; and, in the United States, in that same year, 9,390 of us died by gunshot wounds. 
   What are we doing? Nothing is the answer. We are doing nothing because of a special interest that gives a lot of money. 
   This is a war that is going on in this country. In 11 years of the Vietnam war, which was a tragedy, 58,168 of our citizens were killed. Their families will never be the same and they have never been the same. 
   Mr. President, 58,168 of our brave men and women were killed in 11 years of the Vietnam war where this country came to its knees. Do you know how many gun deaths there were in America in 11 years? 396,572. Let me say that again: In 11 years of the Vietnam war, roughly 58,000 deaths; in 11 years of gun violence rampant in our country, 396,000-plus deaths. 
   Does it make any sense that our country would come to its knees over the Vietnam war--as we all did, whatever side one was on--and have the biggest debate we have ever had in the history of our country over a war--many Members got into politics because of that situation--and yet with 396,572 gun deaths in America over the same period of time we cannot get out of the conference committee five commonsense gun control measures? 
   It is not to be believed. 
   In 49 days it will be the 1-year anniversary of Columbine. In this sensible measure before the Senate, we are calling for the President, the Senate, and the House to work together and get these commonsense proposals into law. That must be the finish line. Mr. President, 49 days; that is a long time. It is enough time to do this job. After all, these proposals have gone through rigorous debate and they have passed.  
   It is the sense of the Senate that before April 20, 2000, Congress shall make schools safe for learning by implementing policies that will reduce the threat of gun violence in the schools.  
   Pretty simple.

   Mrs. BOXER. I am very proud that Senators came to the floor, with their  very busy schedules, on behalf of this amendment. 
   Again, I don't know whether the Republican side of the aisle will support this amendment. I hope they will. I cannot imagine why they would fail to support it. I want to have a vote on this. I want everyone to be on record. If they vote for this, they are saying that by April 20 we should have these proposals back before the Senate on the way to the President's desk. 
   How many more shootings is it going to take? How many more people have to write condolence notes or call parents and families? I trust, my friends, that we will not take any more time. We have done the heavy lifting. We have had the debate. We have had the Vice President in the Chair. He has cast the tie-breaking vote so that we can close the gun show loophole. God bless him for that. Without him in that Chair, that would not have happened. Closing that gun show loophole means people who are mentally imbalanced, people with a criminal record, people who are underage, will not get guns. 
   I could spend a long time on this floor reading more into the record about these instances that have occurred in our Nation, but I think I have said what I have to say. I trust the other side will not offer a second-degree amendment to this. I trust the other side will reach over and take the hand of those on this side of the aisle who believe it is important to work on this in a bipartisan fashion. 
   How much time remains of the 45 minutes?

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I commend my friend from Illinois. A long time ago, he and I talked about the importance of having a school safety fund where if schools felt they needed assistance, whether it was to purchase equipment--a metal detector--whether it was to teach the children about how to resolve their differences without violence, that we should set this up in a way that local schools could put together their own programs. 
   I want to ask my friend this: There is a lot of talk around here of local control. Isn't this what my friend is doing, he is designing a grant program so if school districts decide they want to partake, if they have this problem, they have an opportunity to do so?

   Mrs. BOXER. I ask my friend another question. As I read these hair-raising accounts of what happened in Michigan with this little baby of 6 years old bringing a gun to school, shooting a child, and then actually after it was done, coloring something, drawing some pictures, having no concept he committed this murder, if you will, I think this points out to us that kids do not understand what gun violence can really do. 
   I commend my friend and ask him if he has read those accounts and how chilling it is and how appropriate it is  to have a vote on this. As my friend said, the underlying bill gives $7 a year. Now they want to give help to people even in higher incomes while our kids are losing their lives. I am very pleased my friend has offered this amendment, and I am proud to join him.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am very hopeful that this amendment, unlike the other one that I have pending, will get the support of my friends on the other side of the aisle. 
   For a long time I have been talking about the need for a children's environmental protection act. It is very important we understand that our children are not little adults; they are quite different from adults. They are growing; they are changing; and certain exposures are much more harmful to them than they would be for us. 
   My amendment does two things. It gives parents notification before toxic pesticides are applied in their children's schools. It also requires the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to distribute to schools its guide on the establishment of a least-toxic-pesticide policy. In other words, we have already got the work done. Here it is. It talks about how we can lessen the bad impact on our children by using the kinds of products that will harm them the least. Right now, the EPA does send this out, but it is a spotty situation; they don't send it to all of the schools. 
   What we are asking for is a 48-hour notice so parents know that these substances are being sprayed, if they are, in fact, toxic, and if they are, in fact, a product that could harm the children. 
   Of course, what we really want to do is lower the use of toxic pesticides. That would be the very best thing we could do. That is our ultimate hope. That is why we are encouraging the Environmental Protection Agency to work with our schools. But, unfortunately, we have very toxic products being sprayed on our schools today. 
   Why is it important that parents know this is occurring? Because pesticides, by definition, are meant to kill living things. Exposure to pesticides has been linked to cancer, neurological disorders, and learning disabilities. A common insecticide schools currently spray on baseboards and floors to kill cockroaches and ants--it has an active ingredient called chlorpyrifos--is classified by the EPA as a nerve toxin. Since we know some of these common pesticides contain a nerve toxin, we have to ask what are the effects of our children's exposure to nerve toxin. 
   The acute effects of this type of toxin include headaches, dizziness, mental confusion, and vomiting. We know potential effects include decreased neurological performance. We know that because there have been some studies about which I will discuss. 
   These risks are much more prevalent in children than adults because, again, children are not little adults; they are different. A 1993 National Academy of Sciences report, 
   Pesticides in the Diets of Infants and Children, documented what has long been known by children's health professionals: Children are at greater risk to experience the harmful effects of pesticide exposure than adults. The National Academy explained that children face greater exposure to pesticides because, pound for pound of body weight, they eat more food and drink more water and breathe more air than adults. In other words, they are smaller and therefore their intake is greater as a proportion of their body weight. 
   Children are rapidly growing, and their developing systems are more vulnerable to harmful effects of pesticides. I referred to a study. A study conducted in Mexico had children exposed to these very harmful pesticides make a drawing of a stick figure. I have that in the cloakroom, if anyone is interested in looking. The children who were exposed to the pesticides could not put together a stick figure. The ones who had no exposure were able to do it as a normal child would. That study certainly helps demonstrate why we should encourage schools to adopt the least toxic pesticide program. 
   I will close with this: My amendment is not some new idea, because many schools in my home State go beyond what is provided for in this amendment. For example, in the San Francisco, Los Angeles, Mendocino, and Arcata school districts in California, they have all adopted policies to prohibit the use of these toxic pesticides. I am not even going that far. My amendment merely requires, if we are going to use them, let the families know in advance. 
   We should try to help schools get off of these products. My amendment takes the first step toward reducing the use of toxic pesticides in schools nationwide by encouraging schools to adopt similar policies to those I have cited in my home State. 
   I think it is important, since we look to parents to protect their children, that those parents have the information and can decide how to proceed. Maybe if they find out there is toxic spraying going on, they will get together and try to come forward with a different brand of pesticide. All in all, I think we are giving parents more tools to be able to control the lives of their children and what their children are exposed to. 
   I am very hopeful that the Republican side of the aisle will reach across the aisle and accept this amendment. If they do so, I will not require a recorded vote; a voice vote will do just fine. 
   I ask my friend from Georgia does he have any information as to whether this amendment will be able to be accepted and disposed of by a voice vote at this time?

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, that is fine with the Senator from California. I thank my friend from Georgia. We made a small change in my amendment. Essentially, what we are telling parents now is that if the schools their kids go to are going to be sprayed with dangerous pesticides that are known carcinogens, that could cause nerve damage, they will be notified 48 hours in advance of the spraying that will be taking place. 
   In addition, what we do is we instruct the Environmental Protection Agency to take the booklet they have already  produced on how to get away from using these very strong and toxic pesticides and send it to every school district in America. 
   I am very pleased this is being done. I have a larger bill, the Children's Environmental Protection Act, on which I invite everyone to join me. Children are not little adults. I am a little adult, but children are growing and changing. Their bodies are changing, their hormones are changing, and they are absolutely more adversely impacted by these toxins. 
   I thank my colleague very much. I hope we can have a voice vote.

   Mrs. BOXER. I thank my friend from Nevada. 
   I tell the Senator from Georgia, I have no problem voting on his amendment that deals with getting drugs out of the schools. But let's be clear, friends; this Coverdell amendment has nothing to do with the Boxer amendment. So don't think, if you vote for  Coverdell, it somehow is a version of the Boxer amendment. They are two different things. The Boxer amendment calls on the Senate to act responsibly to pass reasonable, sensible gun laws. 
   We call on the Congress to do so not on an arbitrary date but on the anniversary of the Columbine tragedy. The Boxer amendment is not about the incident in Michigan. It references it in a string of incidents of school violence. 
   This Senate should be commended for acting 8 months ago to pass five very reasonable, very responsible gun control amendments. But this Senate should be chastised for not doing anything about it at all since that time. What we do in this very simple sense of the Senate is call on the Congress to bring those amendments back here so we can send a bill to the President for his signature. 
   I want to tell you we are dealing with a harsh reality in America. 
   I am going to show you just two charts. The first one shows you how many of our men and women tragically perished in 11 years of the Vietnam war: 58,168 tragic losses for our Nation, and those families have been hurting and suffering ever since. No matter on what side of this conflict you find yourselves this is the tragic reality of Vietnam. 
   In the last 11 years, the same amount of time as the Vietnam war, we have seen over 396,000 deaths on our streets, in our schools. This is just handgun violence. 
   That is the tragic reality we are talking about in the Boxer amendment. 
   Here is another tragic reality: How about this for an ad in a gun magazine. It says: ``Start 'Em Young! There's no time like the present.'' Here is a young teenager with a handgun in his hand: ``Start `Em Young!'' We know about starting them young. All you have to do is look at what happened in Michigan. How young do they want them to start? 
   I could not understand why we could not walk, hand in hand, down the Senate aisle and vote for the Boxer amendment. 
   But when I got back to my office, I found out why because there waiting for me was a letter from the Gun Owners of America attacking my amendment, saying, essentially, that I was taking political advantage of a horrible tragedy in Michigan, when, in fact, my resolution isn't about that. It is about the tragic realities we face in this Nation and calling on the Congress to act. 
   The Gun Owners of America has every right to take this position. They have every right to do it. We should look at what their logo says: ``Gun Owners of America, 25 Years of No Compromise.'' That is their slogan. That is their logo: ``25 Years of No Compromise.'' 
   My friends, when we voted out those sensible gun control amendments 8 months ago, we did compromise. We compromised between the right of law-abiding citizens to have guns versus the right of children to have guns, mentally disturbed people, people with criminal records; and we found a balance there. We did it in a bipartisan way. 
   All this Boxer amendment is saying is it is time to bring those sensible gun control measures--those compromises that withstood the division in this body and passed this body--back for a vote. 
   We have a very harsh reality in this Nation. Fifty percent of children ages 9 through 17 are worried about dying young; 31 percent of children ages 12 through 17 know someone their age who carries a gun. I do not understand why on earth there would be opposition to simply saying, we are proud of what we did 8 months ago. Let's bring those sensible gun laws back here. Let's act before the Columbine tragedy anniversary is upon us. Let's do the right thing. 
   I support this amendment. I hope my colleagues will as well.

   Mrs. BOXER. First, I commend my friend because life in the Senate is about choices. I think what the Senator from Connecticut has done for this debate, in my opinion, is to have given us a very clear choice of how we want to proceed. We have known for, let's say, the last 20 years that there is not an endless cookie jar; we are going to have to make the tough choice. 
   What the Senator from Connecticut is suggesting is this: We have a program that is vital to perhaps the children in this country who need more help than almost any other group, children who have special ed needs. We have not met our commitment; we haven't fulfilled our promise. So I would appreciate it if the Senator from Connecticut can tell me if I am right in sort of summing up where he is coming from. He has taken the floor and has not said everything in the pending bill is bad, not at all. I know personally he agrees strongly with a couple of things.

   Mrs. BOXER. Those provisions would still stand. What the Senator is basically saying is that the billion-plus would go to people who essentially, for the most part, send their kids to private schools, K through 12, and rather than give them this tax writeoff, if you will, we should use the money to fulfill our commitment for special education. That is the bottom line. 
   I want to ask my friend two questions. I don't know if he spoke about the meeting with the Governors today, but if he has not, I think it would be an important point, since he spoke to many of us about this today--what the message of the Governors is vis-a-vis this special ed and what it would mean. He has already said what it means to my State to get more funding for special ed. We are in the hole now by several billion dollars. So this amendment is very important. 
   The second question, perhaps, is a more philosophical one but one to which I would be interested in hearing an answer. I think if we are honest with ourselves, we know the people who could afford to set aside $2,000 a year in our society each and every year are the ones who are living or earning more than, shall we say, most middle-class people because we know the figures. If we are honest with ourselves, to set aside $2,000--and that is after-tax money--in an account where, by the way, you don't get any real tax benefit, except the buildup is not taxed, so it comes out to roughly a few dollars a year--who are we really helping? Are we helping 95 percent of public school kids? Are we doing one thing or are we giving a nice, sweet tax benefit to people who already can set aside the money? I think there are two questions. One, if my friend can talk about the Governors and how they feel on this issue of reimbursing the States for special ed; and, two, philosophically, what is going to help more families?

   Mrs. BOXER. Then we have some disagreement. But we will check our chart. 
   I wanted to say on the issue of why this is different than the college account--I think Senator DODD very eloquently made the point--our side of the aisle has been pushing for a long time to help parents send their children to college, whether it is through Pell grants, loans, or education saving accounts for college. I remember way back during the days I was in the House I was supporting these education IRAs, but the point is that it is quite different now. 
   To go to a public college in California costs $5,000, $6,000, or $7,000 a year. Fortunately, we have free public schools. What we are looking at here is quite a different situation. 
   We know on the face of it that 95 percent of our children go to public schools. I know the Senator says this is going to help the public schools, but our research indicates this is disproportionate. We are talking about a couple of dollars in 
   benefits. It comes down to a choice. 
   If I had a menu of things, I am sure I would rank money higher on the menu of things, but it doesn't compare my money to the substitute, or to the amendment which keeps a lot of good in the Senator's bill. But it just says ``revenue lost'' instead of being dissipated in the $7 per family over a period of time--a year--and maybe adds up to $7. It would be much better to go to our States and help with special education, whereas Senator DODD says it means it is going to result in lower property taxes because our local school districts will benefit.

   Mrs. BOXER. Doesn't it sound great? I will give the Senator that. It is his idea. Come up with a Coverdell account, and they start it, say, when the child is first born. Then the child is 5. If this is for real, they start using it, but if it isn't for real, they will hold it. Who gets the tax benefit? Because they can afford to, they have another account for $2,000 for college. Now we are saying this is a family now setting aside $4,000 every year. I ask my friend.

   Mrs. BOXER. I don't understand. I am saying to my friend that it is a second bureaucracy, if you will--a new account that can be used for college in addition to the account we are looking at for college that we already have. I think it is getting confusing. I think if we want to let people set aside funds and get a tax break for college, this is crucial. 
   I think at this point to expand this idea to get to K through 12, as Senator DODD pointed out, if this is on the level and people start spending it when the child is 5, they essentially have 5 years to save, whereas what we are suggesting is that people can do much better. They can take that money and use it, say, long term for 18 years, have more of a buildup and have more of a fund. 
   What I am fearful of, if we start with all of these, is that only the wealthiest people will be able to do it. They will do it for both. Again, we start rewarding the people in our society--God bless them, and I have nothing but respect for people who manage to make it. We are rewarding them and we are not doing a thing to help the average person. 
   That gets me back to where Senator DODD started with his amendment. If this is not going to do much for most of our kids--it is confusing, I agree. I started wondering--if they can get a band outfit, if that is workable, yes. I argue that is part of the school. 
   Or a uniform? But, wait a minute, that is giving a benefit to one child. What about the kid who doesn't make the band? Then the IRS is going to have to confab and figure whether this is a discriminatory benefit. I think we are opening up a can of worms a little bit. I think Senator DODD offers us a cleaner way to spend this $1.2 billion, which is to ease the burden on the local districts. 
   I daresay it is only common sense. Our school boards have a certain amount of money. If they cannot meet their budgets, they are going to have to raise your taxes. Maybe this is going to help them. I assume it is going to help them. In California, we have a lid on our property tax, so this is a huge benefit for us because there is just so much we can raise in property taxes. 
   Since we have a finite amount of money, I think the Senator from Connecticut is offering us a chance to step back and say let's not create a new program, which now I understand you could roll into a college account, which really gets me confused, and keep it simple and use this money for special ed. 
   I thank my friend for being so generous in yielding to me. I thank my friend from Connecticut for, I think in many ways, bringing us back to what we have to do, and that is to make these hard choices. He is saying: Listen to what the Governors are saying. Let's take care of this problem first.

   Mrs. BOXER. If the Senator will yield, I want to say to my friend, his education was very good. I went to public schools from kindergarten all the way through college. Even in college it only cost, in those days, $12 a semester in the State of New York university system. What an amazing thing. 
   We had several people wind up going to Congress from that public education system. So in my heart I understand when my friend from Connecticut says we have an obligation to the 50 million children who walk into those public schools every day--5 million go to the parochial school, 55 million in all--but we have an obligation in the public school arena. 
   It gets down to yet another choice. The Senator from Connecticut has given us a choice between a tax break that is predominantly going to go to the wealthiest, that is going to be very minimal, and special education. That is the choice he has laid out. 
   My friend also will win my vote, frankly, if he took that $1.2 billion and put it into school construction or put it into more afterschool slots or early education, early childhood development, preschool, and child care in which my friend has been so involved. We are looking to bring home a very important choice. 
   The Governors said: Here is the choice, Senators; before you take care of any other new programs and new bureaucracies, take care of special ed. My friend from Connecticut is listening to them and doing that, and he is further saying that before we do any of these newfangled accounts, which will be interpreted and reinterpreted by IRS agents up and down the line and may be very confusing, let's take care of our public schools. 
   What I am saying is, not only will I support the amendment of the Senator from Connecticut, but I will also support amendments to come that will take this money and put it into lower class sizes, to do some new construction, to train our teachers better, to get technology in the schools, to make sure we have room for every child who wants afterschool care which we know is the best crimefighting program around. 
   I thank my friend for coming today. His voice on this issue is very important, but I think on this one, with his interest in education and his views of concern about it and his success in it, I hope the Senate will listen to the Senator from Connecticut and do first things first: Take care of our public school kids--that is 95 percent of our kids K through 12--before we set up some newfangled ideas on which there is even debate over the facts as to who it helps. 
   The Senator has a paper that says to me it is only going to help the very wealthy. Senator COVERDELL says it helps if one makes $75,000. Common sense tells me if we start setting aside $2,000 a year, it ``ain't'' going to be my working-class people who are going to do that, I can tell you right now. They tell me they can barely make ends meet. I know what this is about. 
   I thank my friend for bringing more clarity to the debate. I will be supporting him.

    Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, it is my pleasure today to inform my colleagues of the recent achievement of a friend and former member of this body, Senator Alan Cranston. On Tuesday March 14, 2000, in San Francisco, Senator Cranston will receive the prestigious W. Averell Harriman Award from the Lawyers Alliance for World Security for his tireless efforts to achieve a safer, more peaceful world. 
   Alan Cranston served the people of California in the United States Senate, in the seat I now occupy, for 24 years. During this time he distinguished himself as one of this institution's most passionate and effective voices for the rights of ordinary people. From protecting a woman's right to choose, to fighting for adequate and affordable housing, to making certain our veterans are treated with the respect they deserve, Senator Cranston devoted his career to making this nation a stronger, more decent place. 
   One of the most important ways he set about making his vision for a better America a reality was by not limiting his efforts to these shores alone.  Alan Cranston is very much a citizen of the world. Having witnessed the devastation of war in Europe and Japan, he has always acted on the belief that America's future cannot be guaranteed unless the world's is. And nothing threatens global security more than the continuing prevalence and proliferation of nuclear weapons. 
   There are few people who are more dedicated to the reduction and elimination of nuclear weapons than Alan Cranston. So deeply does he feel about this issue that he has made it his life's work. In 1995, with the guidance of President Mikhail Gorbachev and others, he launched the Nuclear Weapon Elimination Initiative. From this initial blueprint sprang the Global Security Institute. As its president, Senator Cranston and GSI are committed to educating the people of the world and their leaders about the enormous threats posed by nuclear weapons. 
   It is for his work with GSI, and indeed his literal lifetime of commitment to global peace, that Senator Cranston so richly deserves the W. Averell Harriman Award. Few men or women have done so much to secure a safe future for all the people of the world.

   Mrs. BOXER. I am so happy Senator DORGAN took the time to come over here to discuss this. I thought it would be interesting to talk with him about some facts that came out in recent studies because he has been on this issue before a lot of folks. He was talking about the cost of prescription drugs. I think he would be a very good person for me to direct a few questions to, if he would be willing to do that. 
   When he talked about a particular woman who came to him and told him that she essentially could not afford to take the correct number of pills for her condition and she was trying to figure it out--well, if I took a half a pill now and a quarter of a pill later--I wonder if the Senator is aware that this is a widespread situation. If the Senator could comment on it, one report found that one in eight seniors has to choose between buying food and buying medicine. 
   If my friend could comment on how it makes him feel as someone who has always been a fighter for the average person. Here we have senior citizens in our country, one out of eight, after they have worked all their lives, have saved their money, have taken care of their family, having to choose between buying food and buying medicine. I wonder if my friend would comment on that.

   Mrs. BOXER. If my friend will continue to yield, this is my next question. I am appreciative the Senator has gone in this direction. 
   The General Accounting Office found United States drug prices for specific drugs were, on average, one-third higher than in Canada and 60 percent higher than in the United Kingdom. When my friend shows charts, this has been borne out by studies of a Federal agency. 
   The Federal Trade Commission has reported that drug manufacturers use a two-tiered pricing structure under which they charge higher prices to those without insurance. In other words, if I go to a pharmacy where my insurance is not accepted, it costs an arm and a leg. However, if I have coverage, then the cost to my insurance company is way less. 
   I pivot to this question: Because the Federal Trade Commission has studied it, we know there is a two-tiered pricing insurance, for those who have insurance and those who do not, so does it not make sense, for all of our people whom we can possibly reach, particularly those in the older years where they need these drugs to survive, thrive, and live, that they get into some kind of system? 
   In other words, does my friend agree that even though we don't have to get into the details of what system it would be, in unity there is strength? If we can walk away from the high-tiered pricing and get into a system where citizens can avail themselves of the better price, this is something we should fight for. If we don't fight for it here, I don't know whom we are representing. 
   Would my friend comment?

   Mrs. BOXER. One last question. As with everything else, we have to make choices about what we will do to help people. There is a big debate across party lines about the surplus. We know it is reflected in the Presidential race, even within the parties. 
   I raise the subject of the marriage tax penalty. We know there is a penalty in our Tax Code for married couples, and everyone in this Chamber wants to fix it. If we fix it in the wrong way, where we help, instead of Mrs. Jones or Mrs. Smith, Mrs. Trump or Mrs. Helmsley, then we won't have enough money to take care of the one third of the Medicare beneficiaries who do not have prescription drug benefits, resulting in the story the Senator told in a very poignant way about a woman chopping up her prescription pill that she needs to stay alive, stay healthy, be vibrant, 
   and have those golden years, as we always say we promise our seniors. 
   We do not have a bottomless cookie jar. We learned that lesson in the 1980s. We have to make some tough choices. When we talk about a prescription drug benefit, we are not enacting it in a vacuum. We are not just coming down with a laundry list of everything we wanted to do with the surplus. We have thought it out. 
   As the Republican Party decides where it is going to go with the surplus, I hope they will consider, since they run this place right now, that if you give it all away to the wealthiest people with benefits they do not need because they are doing just fine, that they will be forgetting these senior citizens who are living 5 miles to the north of North Dakota and going to Canada to buy their drugs. That, as you say, is dicey right now. It is not even allowed, unless they have a particular note. 
   So my closing question is a global question. It is more of a larger issue. How do we make room for this and can we make room for this benefit?

    Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce the Genetically Engineered Food Right-to-Know Act. This legislation requires that all foods containing or produced with genetically engineered material bear a neutral label stating that: ``this product contains a genetically engineered material or was produced with a genetically engineered material.'' 
   The bill adds this labeling requirement to the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA), the Federal Meat Inspection Act, and the Poultry Products Inspection Act which contain the general standards for labeling foods. 
   Recent polls have demonstrated that Americans want to know if they are eating genetically engineered food. A January 1999 Time magazine poll revealed that 81% of respondents wanted genetically engineered food to be labeled. A January 2000 MSNBC poll showed identical results. 
   This pressure has already led some companies not to use genetically engineered materials in their foods. Gerber and Heinz have said they will no longer use genetically engineered material in their baby food. Whole Foods and Wild Oats Supermarkets also have said they will use no genetically engineered material in their own products. 
   Great Britain, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, Denmark, Sweden, Finland, Ireland, Spain, Austria, Italy, Portugal, Greece, New Zealand, and Japan already require genetically engineered food to be labeled.  
   If the U.S. wants to sell its genetically engineered food to these countries, it will have to label the food for foreign consumers. It is only fair that American consumers be given similar information. 
   Why do I feel it's important for consumers to know that their food is genetically engineered? 
   First, we don't know whether genetically engineered food is harmful or whether it is safe. However, scientists have raised concerns about genetically engineered food. These concerns include the risks of increased exposure to allergens, decreased nutritional value, increased toxicity and increased antibiotic resistance. 
   In addition, scientists have raised concerns about the ecological risks associated with genetically engineered food. Some of those risks include the destruction of species, cross pollination that breeds new weeds that are resistant to herbicides, and increases in pesticide use over the long-term. 
   Earlier this year, for example, researchers at Cornell University reported that Monarch butterflies were either killed or developed abnormally when eating milkweed dusted with the pollen of Bt-corn, a genetically engineered food. 
   Second, the Food and Drug Administration does not require pre-market health and safety testing of genetically engineered foods. Therefore, it is only fair that consumers know they are eating products that have not been tested. 
   Third, the Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of Agriculture do not require substantive environmental review of genetically engineered materials under their jurisdiction. 
   My Genetically Engineered Food Right-to-Know Act not only mandates labels, but does something even more important: it authorizes $5 million in grants to conduct studies into the health and environmental risks raised by genetically engineered food. 
   Specifically, it directs the Secretary of HHS to make grants to individuals, organizations and institutions to study risks like increased toxicity, increased allergenicity, negative effects on soil ecology and on the environment in general. 
   What is the extent of genetically engineered crops today? 
   Last year, 98.6 million acres in the U.S. were planted with genetically engineered crops. More than one-third of the U.S. soybean crop and one-quarter of corn were genetically engineered. This represents a 23-fold increase in genetically engineered crop production from just four years ago. 
   And waiting to come into the marketplace are more than 60 different genetically engineered crops--from apples and strawberries to potatoes and tomatoes. 
   Providing consumers with information about the foods they eat is hardly new. 
   For example, I was proud to be the author of the law to provide for the ``dolphin safe'' label on tuna. The label indicated that the tuna was harvested by methods that don't harm dolphins. 
   I was also proud to lead the fight in the Senate to make sure that chicken frozen as solid as a blowing ball could not be labeled fresh. At the time, USDA's position was that frozen chicken could be labeled ``fresh.'' 
   In 1996, I succeeded in amending the Safe Drinking Water Act to require that drinking water providers give their consumers annual reports concerning the quality of their water. 
   Others in Congress led the fight to tell consumers whether their products contain artificial colors or sweeteners, preservatives, additives, and whether they are from concentrate. I supported those labels as well. 
   Food manufacturers also label their products with information that is of little value to consumers. Certain brands of pretzels, for example, bear a label which states that the manufacturer is a ``Member of the Snack Food Association: An International Trade Association.'' 
   I don't think this is information consumers are clamoring for, yet the manufacturer is willing to go through the trouble of putting it on the bag. 
   My legislation builds on the existing food labeling system, and would be simple to implement. It would require that all foods containing or made with genetically engineered foods be labeled with this information: ``this product contains a genetically engineered material or was produced with a genetically engineered material.'' 
   For example, corn flakes made with genetically engineered corn would be a ``product that contains'' genetically engineered material. To take another example, milk from a cow treated with genetically engineered bovine growth hormone would be a product ``produced with'' genetically engineered material. 
   Specifically, my bill requires that food that contains or was produced with genetically engineered material be labeled at each stage of the food production process--from seed company to farmer to manufacturer to retailer. The labeling requirement in my bill, however, does not to apply to drugs or to food sold in restaurants, bakeries, and other similar establishments. 
   Genetically engineered material is defined under the bill as material that ``has been altered at the molecular or cellular level by means that are not possible under natural conditions or processes.'' Food developed through traditional processes such as crossbreeding is not considered to be genetically engineered, and the legislation's labeling requirement would not apply to foods produced in that way. 
   Under the bill, persons need not label food if they obtain a written guaranty from the party from whom they received the food that the food does not contain and was not produced with genetically engineered material. Persons who obtain a valid guaranty are not subject to penalties under the bill if they are later found to have failed to label food that contains genetically engineered material. 
   For example, a farmer who plants genetically engineered corn must label that corn. Each person who then buys and then sells that corn, or food derived from it, will also be required to label it as genetically engineered. 
   Conversely, farmers who obtain a guaranty that the corn they are planting is not genetically engineered may issue a guaranty to purchasers that their corn is not genetically engineered. The purchaser then would not have to label that corn or product made with that corn. 
   If the corn or food is later found to have contained or been produced with genetically engineered material but was not labeled accordingly, the purchaser would not be subject to penalties under the bill. 
   This guaranty system is used today to enforce provisions of existing law concerning the distribution of adulterated or mislabeled foods. The system is much less expensive than a system which would require food to be tested at every phase of the food production process. 
   Failure to label food that contains or was produced with genetically engineered material carries a civil penalty of up to $1,000 amount for each violation. 
   Importantly, the bill provides that if a party fraudulently warrants that a product is not genetically engineered, no party further down the chain of custody may be held liable for mislabeling. This provision is particularly meant to protect small farmers from the possibility that their suppliers would by contract provide that any liability for mislabeling be borne by the farmer regardless of the suppliers' own actions. 
   The bill also provides another protection for farmers. Under the bill, a farmer who plants a non-genetically engineered crop, but whose crop came to contain genetically engineered material from natural causes such as wind carrying pollen from a genetically engineered plant is not subject to penalties under the bill. This is the case so long as the farmer did not intend or did not negligently permit this to occur. 
   And, finally, the bill directs the Secretary of HHS to make grants to study the possible health and environmental risks associated with genetically engineered foods. The bill authorizes $5 million for this purpose. 
   In closing, Mr. President, during the recent negotiations on the Biosafety Protocol, it was the United States' negotiating position that international shipments of seeds, grains and plants that may contain genetically engineered material be labeled accordingly. 
   If the United States took the position that it is appropriate to provide this information to its trading partners, shouldn't we make similar information available to American consumers?  
   I am hopeful that my House and Senate colleagues can act quickly to ensure the passage of my legislation to give American families the right-to-know whether their food contains or was produced with genetically engineered material.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I strongly oppose S. 1287 and the substitute amendment being offered. This is bad policy and should be rejected by the Senate. 
   Protecting the health and safety of American citizens should be our highest priority in evaluating the disposal of our nuclear waste. In order to do this, all decisions must be made based on science, not politics. This legislation does not do that. Under the cover of a ``compromise'' bill, this legislation is the latest attempt to pre-empt science and legislate the scientific suitability of Yucca Mountain, Nevada, as a high-level nuclear waste dump. 
   Instead of finding a repository that meets our health and safety standards established in law, this legislation attempts to weaken our health and safety standards to meet the repository. I cannot and will not support such an action. 
   For many years we have debated the suitability of a high-level radioactive waste dump site at Yucca Mountain. And for years, I have been down on this Senate floor with my colleagues from Nevada fighting to protect the health and safety of the citizens of Nevada. But I know that Yucca Mountain is not just a Nevada issue, it is a national issue--and more important to me, it seriously and directly affects my State of California. 
   Yucca Mountain is only 17 miles from the California border and the Death Valley National Park. Development of this site has the potential to contaminate California's groundwater and poses unnecessary threats to the health and safety of Californians due to possible transportation accidents from shipping high-level nuclear waste through Inyo, San Bernardino and neighboring California counties. 
   Since its inception as a National Monument in 1933, the federal government has invested more than $600 million in the Death Valley National Park. The Park receives over 1.4 million visitors every year. Furthermore, the communities surrounding the park are economically dependent on tourism. The income generated by the presence of the Park exceeds $125 million per year. The Park has been the most significant element in the sustainable growth of the tourist industry in the Mojave Desert. The Park is committed to sustainable growth of jobs and infrastructure in contrast to the traditional boom-and-dust desert economy. 
   Scientific studies show that a significant part of the regional groundwater aquifer surrounding Yucca Mountain discharges in Death Valley because the valley is down-gradient of areas to the east. If the groundwater at Death Valley is contaminated, that will be the demise of the Park and the surrounding communities. The long-term viability of fish, wildlife and human populations in the area are largely dependent on water from this aquifer. The vast majority of the Park's visitors rely on services and facilities at the park headquarters near Furnace Creek. These facilities are all dependent upon the groundwater aquifer that flows under or near Yucca Mountain. And, unfortunately, there is no alternative water source that can support the visitor facilities and wildlife resources. 
   Water is life in the desert. Water quality must be preserved for the viability of Death Valley National Park and the dependent tourism industry. 
   I hope my colleagues agree that we should not threaten these visitors, this natural treasure, and our huge financial investment with incomplete science and unnecessary actions. The potential loss is just too great.

   Mrs. BOXER. I have been on budget committees for years, 6 years in the House and now, since I came to the Senate, it is a total of 13 years. This is a remarkable moment in history, as my friend has pointed out. I wanted to talk to him about why we are where we are. 
   It has been very difficult for quite a while, back to the days of the burgeoning deficits that started under President Reagan and escalated under President Bush and only were brought under control with the Clinton-Gore team. Finally, we now can do something for the American people, do something they need. Now we can do something they need in education. We talked about Senator MURRAY's push to reduce class size. We see in this budget the ability to do that. We see in this budget $1 billion for afterschool care, for which we have struggled mightily, which means millions of kids are going to have that. We see the targeted tax breaks. 
   So my question to my friend is, we are at this point and we are at this point for a reason. It was hard to get here. Fiscal responsibility does bring rewards. We tell that to our children: Save for the time you need to spend; be careful with your resources. We have done that. I wonder if my friend can recall the key vote, back in 1993, when, without one Republican vote, we were able to get through a budget which has led to these kinds of surpluses and the surpluses, in turn, are giving us the ability to pay down the debt, save Social Security, save Medicare, and make these targeted tax cuts and investments? Could he recall for us what it was like to get that through?

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I was informed that the vote on the Greenspan nomination would be at 6 p.m. on Wednesday, so I had rearranged my schedule to return to my State. As I am unable to be present for the 10:30 a.m. Thursday vote, I ask that the RECORD show that if I were present to vote, I would vote in favor of confirming Alan Greenspan for another term as Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors.

    Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, last month, the United States held the rotating presidency of the U.N. Security Council. And something historic happened. Under the leadership of Ambassador Holbrooke and Vice President Gore, the Security Council for the first time ever discussed an international health issue. 
   The issue was the spread of AIDS, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. In raising the profile of this issue--in putting it before the U.N. Security Council--there was a recognition that the AIDS crisis is a security threat--a threat to the peace, stability, and prosperity of nations around the world. 
   Nowhere is that more true than in sub-Saharan Africa, where the United Nations has said that AIDS is ``the worst infectious disease catastrophe since the bubonic plague.'' 
   Since the beginning of the HIV/AIDS epidemic, 13.7 million people in sub-Saharan Africa have died of AIDS. That is 84 percent of all the people in the world who have died of AIDS since the beginning of the epidemic. Last year, two-thirds of all new cases of HIV/AIDS were in sub-Saharan Africa. And of all the people in the world living with HIV/AIDS, 69 percent of them live in sub-Saharan Africa. 
   Mr. President, this is not just a matter of more deaths and more cases because there are more people. Of adults in sub-Saharan Africa who are aged 15-49, eight percent of them have HIV/AIDS. Percentages from specific countries are even more dramatic. In Zimbabwe, it is estimated that 26 percent of all adults aged 15-49 are living with the disease. In Botswana, it is 25 percent, and in Namibia, it is 20 percent. 
   Unlike any other area of the world, the HIV/AIDS epidemic in sub-Saharan Africa is predominately a woman's disease. A majority of infected adults--55 percent to be exact--are women. 
   This creates ripple effects. When women get the disease, they often pass it along to their unborn babies. As a result, about 10 percent of the HIV/AIDS cases in sub-Saharan Africa are children. More dramatically, when women die, their children often become orphans. By the end of this year, the HIV/AIDS epidemic will be the reason that over 10 million children in sub-Saharan Africa are orphans. 
   How many children is that? There are about 10 million people 18 years old and younger in California. Imagine if every single one of them was an orphan. That is what we are talking about in sub-Saharan Africa. Ten million children. Even worse, according to those who are working on this issue in Africa, the number of children orphaned there because of HIV/AIDS could double, triple, or even quadruple in the next decade. 
   I have mentioned, Mr. President, a lot of statistics, a lot of numbers. but behind each number there is a face. A face of a man living with HIV; a face of a woman dying of AIDS; a 
   face of an orphan with no family and no place to go. In Sub-Saharan Africa, there are faces upon faces upon faces. 
   This is a global tragedy, a global catastrophe, a global emergency. It requires a global response. And the United States must lead the way. 
   So today, I am introducing, along with my colleague on the Foreign Relations Committee, Senator GORDON SMITH, the Global AIDS Prevention Act--the GAP Act. It calls on the United States Agency for International Development--USAID--to make HIV/AIDS a priority in the foreign assistance program and to undertake a comprehensive, coordinated effort to combat HIV/AIDS. That effort must include primary prevention and education; voluntary testing and counseling; providing medications to prevent the transmission of HIV/AIDS from mother to child; and care for those living with HIV/AIDS.  
   To accomplish this, the GAP Act would increase funding for USAID's international HIV/AIDS effort. Over five years, the bill would authorize $2 billion for the fight against AIDS, and at least $1 billion of that is dedicated to the problem in sub-Saharan Africa. 
   I want to commend the work done so far by USAID. This year, the Agency will spend $200 million to fight HIV/AIDS abroad. Unfortunately, this is the first time in six years that there has been an increase in the funding for this important effort. And it is still far short of what is needed. It is time to close the gap. Passing the GAP Act would be a great step forward. 
   Now, Mr. President, I have talked about the problem in sub-Saharan Africa. That is where the problem is the worst and where the need is most urgent. It has also been the focus of most of the public attention in the last few months. 
   But, be warned. We must not fool ourselves into thinking that sub-Saharan Africa is the only place with a problem. In terms of raw numbers, India has more people living with HIV/AIDS than any other nation in the world. And experts tell us that in the near future, the problem may actually grow faster in Southeast Asia than in Africa. 
   The GAP Act recognizes the need to be flexible. As I mentioned, it dedicates at least 50 percent of the funding to sub-Saharan Africa. USAID is actually spending about 65 percent of its AIDS dollars in that region now. This bill will continue to allow USAID to spend that higher percentage, but it will also provide the Agency with the flexibility to address the problem elsewhere in the world. 
   As I mentioned, Mr. President, I am joined in this effort by Senator GORDON SMITH. He and I worked together last summer in introducing a bill to fight the international tuberculosis problem. I am pleased and honored to join with him again in introducing bipartisan legislation to address an urgent international health problem. 
   Mr. President, in the United States, When the epidemic first hit two decides ago, too many people in positions to make a difference ran inside, locked the doors, closed the curtains, and just hoped it would go away. The victims were blamed instead of helped. Those at risk were ridiculed instead of educated. Those who were dying were shunned instead of cared for. 
   We did not begin to make progress against HIV/AIDS in this country until we discussed the problem in the light of day and until we made a serious investment in education, prevention, treatment, care, and research. Progress will not be made in Africa or anywhere else in the world unless we do the same. Now is not the time to pretend the problem does not exist or that it does not matter to us. Now is the time to act. 
   The GAP Act would help to close the gap between what we need to fight this disease and what we are now spending. The GAP Act would help to close the GAP between the developed and the developing world in dealing with this epidemic. The GAP Act would help to close the gap between our words and our actions. I ask my colleagues to close these gaps by cosponsoring the GAP Act.

    Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President. I have spoken in this Chamber before about the exemplary life of Elizabeth Glaser and the work of the Pediatric AIDS Foundation, which bears her name. I rise today to again speak about Elizabeth and her remarkable work and life. 
   In 1986, Elizabeth and her husband, Paul, discovered that she and her two children were infected with HIV as a result of a blood transfusion following a difficult childbirth. In 1988, following the death of their daughter, Ariel, to AIDS she founded a foundation to raise money for scientific research for pediatric AIDS. At the time there was little coordinated research focused on the effect of this disease on children or pharmaceutical testing of protocols for pediatric AIDS. 
   In 1994, Elizabeth succumbed to this terrible disease after a long and courageous battle. 
   Today, eleven years after its founding, the Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation has raised more than $85 million in support of AIDS research. This has lead to a new and greater understanding of HIV/AIDS and its effects on children. 
   Among the more exciting and promising breakthroughs this research has provided is the drug Nevirapine. Last year, a study in Uganda showed that Nevirapine could prevent almost half of HIV transmissions from mothers to infants--and at a fraction of the cost of other, less effective, treatments. 
   Mr. President, some 1,800 children are infected with HIV each day. The United Nations reports that 33.6 million people are infected with HIV or have developed AIDS; more than two-thirds of these people live in Sub-Saharan Africa. As the nature and emographis of HIV/AIDS evolves, the work of groups like the Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation is a pioneer in its field, richly deserving of the support and attention it receives. 
   Elizabeth Glaser remans a source of strength and inspiration to all of us. And her good works continue to reap benefits for countless thousands of people.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today I am submitting a resolution on the Convention to Eliminate All Forms of Discrimination Against Women. 
   For those unfamiliar with this issue, the Treaty, known by its acronym CEDAW, is the most comprehensive and detailed international treaty to date that addresses the rights of women. 
   The United States was an active participant in drafting this treaty. It was approved by the General Assembly in 1979. President Carter signed the treaty on behalf of the United States. 
   To date, 165 nations have ratified or acceded to the treaty. The United States joins the likes of Afghanistan, North Korea and Iran as the few nations who have decided not to become state parties to this treaty. 
   The Convention requires that nations take measures to eliminate discrimination against women. Discrimination is defined as ``any distinction, exclusion or restriction made on the basis of sex which has the effect of impairing or nullifying the recognition, enjoyment, or exercise by women, irrespective of their marital status.'' 
   The treaty addresses ``human rights and fundamental freedoms in the political, economic, social, cultural, civil, or any other field.'' 
   Let me be clear, this treaty covers the most basic rights for women. For example, Article 5 recognizes the common responsibility of men and women for raising children. Article 6 requires measures to suppress all forms of traffic in women and exploitation of prostitution of women. 
   Articles 7 and 8 would ensure that women have the right to vote, run for office, and represent their countries in international activities. 
   Article 10 calls for the elimination of discrimination in the field of education. 
   Article 11 gives women the right to work and free choice of employment. 
   Article 12 eliminates discrimination in the delivery of health care services. 
   This treaty covers other areas of discrimination as well, but as you can tell by the few Articles I have described, this treaty is extremely important to the rights of women throughout the world. 
   And, ratification of this treaty will strengthen our capability to urge other nations to promote these rights. 
   In 1994 the Senate Foreign Relations overwhelmingly supported this treaty approving the resolution of ratification by a vote of 13 to 5. 
   Unfortunately, time ran out in the 103rd Congress before the full Senate had the opportunity to consider the treaty. 
   Today, I am offering amendment stating that it is the Sense of the Senate that the Foreign Relations Committee should once again hold hearings on CEDAW. 
   It also states the Senate should take action on the treaty prior to March 8, 2000--International Women's Day. 
   The United States needs to show that it is the world leader on promoting human rights and that includes the rights of women throughout the world. 
   I urge my colleagues to join us in cosponsoring this resolution.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I would like to speak about H.R. 3419, the Motor Carrier Safety Improvement Act, which the Senate approved today. I commend Senator MCCAIN, chairman of the Commerce Commitee, for holding hearings on this issue. These hearings, as well as reports from the Department of Transportation's Inspector General, have shown how critical it is for us all to pay closer attention to the safety problems on our highways. 
   In 1998, 5,374 people were killed in truck-related crashes and over 127,000 were injured. Although trucks account for only 3 percent of registered vehicles, they are involved in 9 percent of fatal crashes, and 12 percent of all highway-related deaths. This is simply unacceptable, and we must do all we can to reduce fatalities and injuries on our highways. 
   Recently, I met with one of my constituents, Cynthia Cozzolino, who lost her brother, sister-in-law, young nephew, and niece in a horrible truck-related crash last August. This terrible tragedy could have been prevented if we made safety a higher priority, particularly truck inspection. Worn straps may have contributed to a truck spilling its load of concrete piping instantaneously killing this young family riding in their van behind the truck. 
   Highway truck traffic is an increasing part of our economy. California highway trucks carry 57 billion tons per mile, second only to Texas. In Southern California, the growing goods movement from ports and airports will push the current regional truck volume up by 40 percent over the next 20 years. One section of Interstate 15 is likely to see almost 13,000 truck trips a day. That is why we must do all we can to strengthen our commitment to safety on our highways. 
   I am encouraged by certain key features of H.R. 3419. By establishing a separate Motor Carrier Safety Administration, at long last we are making safety a priority. The bill directs the Secretary of Transportation to develp a long term strategy for improving commercial motor vehicle, operator and carrier safety. It also directs the Secretary to implement safety improvement recommendations from the Inspector General, and it calls for the development of staffing standards for motor carrier safety inspectors at our international border areas, an important element for California. 
   In addition, strengthening the Commercial Driver License regulations by explicitly directing the disqualification of any commercial driver found to have caused a death because of negligent or criminal operation of a truck or bus and establishing stern penalties for foreign carriers who operate illegally beyond the current southern border commercial zone, are key improvements. Disqualifying these carriers on the spot will send a strong deterrent measure to any foreign trucking or bus companies who think that they can violate current motor carrier laws and regulations with impunity. 
   However, I am concerned that H.R. 3419 is not stronger in terms of potential conflict of interest in the research conducted for this new administration. According to testimony before the Surface Transportation Subcommittee, in  1996, the Office of Motor Carriers (OMC) awarded more than $8 million to the trucking industry and its consultants to perform research on various issues, including driver fatigue and graduated licensing. I understand that such research can form the basis for future rulemakings governing the trucking industry. 
   The new Motor Carrier Safety Administration must maintain a high degree of integrity and independence. I supported a provision that specifically forbids any research for rulemaking and other programs that is conducted by any entity with a vested economic interest in its outcome, and to forbid any individual who serves in a senior position within the new motor carrier agency from maintaining any affiliation with the trucking industry. H.R. 3419 includes a provision that directs the new motor carrier administrator to comply with the current Federal regulations regarding conflict of interest, and it also directs the administrator to conduct a study to determine whether compliance with these regulations is sufficient to avoid conflicts of interest. I look forward to the results of that study as well as any swift action by Congress to correct this problem if the study finds additional protection for conflicts of interest is warranted. 
   H.R. 3419 would establish a separate administration for Motor Carrier Safety. I would prefer to transfer the OMC from the Federal Highway Administration to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) and avoid the creation of a separate modal administration. NHTSA already issues regulations for newly manufactured trucks, and in truck-car crashes 98 percent of the deaths are suffered by the passenger vehicle occupants. 
   Nevertheless, today we have taken an important step toward building greater confidence in highway safety. The creation of a new administration dedicated to safety is a new direction that I hope will lead to improved safety for the traveling public.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, the two bills we passed today--the tax extenders bill and the Omnibus Appropriations Act--like this entire session of Congress, can be summarized by four words: the good, the bad, the missing, and the undone. 
   Let me begin with the good, because we have achieved victories on several important Democratic priorities. Funding for after-school programs was more than doubled. As a result, there will be spaces for 675,000 young people. 
   In another priority of mine, the days of the sweet deal for the big oil companies will be over next March 15. At that time, the Interior Department will finally be allowed to issue a regulation to ensure that oil companies pay their fair share of oil royalties to the federal government when they drill on federal land, ending the $66 million annual loss to the taxpayers. 
   I was also pleased to see a 42 percent increase in funding for the lands program, known as the Lands Legacy Initiative. Most of this money will be used to acquire lands and historical sites so that they can be preserved for future generations. 
   There are other good things as part of the budget agreement: funding to reduce elementary school class sizes; putting 6600 cops on the streets and in the schools; paying the arrears the United States owes to the United Nations; debt relief for developing countries; full funding for the Middle East Peace Agreement; a $2.3 billion increase in funding for the National Institutes of Health; correcting problems with Medicare funding that were part of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, so that we ensure seniors continue to have access to health care, particularly home health care and nursing home care; a $108 million increase in funding for nutrition assistance for pregnant women and infants; extension of some important tax credits, including the Research and Experimentation Tax Credit, employer-provided educational assistance, and trade adjustment assistance; and most of the anti-environmental riders were stripped out of the bill or were significantly weakened. 
   But, Mr. President, despite these good things, I am voting against the bill because of the bad things as well as the things that are missing. 
   First, let me comment on the process. If the Republican controlled Congress had done its work and passed the appropriations bills by October 1, which is what is supposed to happen, we would not have needed these protracted and secretive negotiations that gave undue power to just a handful of people. As my colleague from Nebraska said, this whole process turned government ``of the people, by the people, and for the people'' into ``government of and by four people''. 
   I want to mention three specific provisions of this bill that I oppose. First, the funding for international family planning is inadequate. We have had level funding for this program for four years now. And on top of that, the omnibus appropriations bill reinstates the so-called Mexico City policy that prevents organizations from using their own, privately-raised money to provide abortion services or to lobby against draconian abortion laws. Under the provisions of this bill, the President could waive this restriction, but if he does, the funding would be cut $12.5 billion, which could deny contraception to over 40,000 women for an entire year. 
   I was also extremely dismayed to find in this bill a provision that would allow pharmacists to deny women in federal health plans prescriptions for contraceptive drugs, if they claim a sort of ``conscientious objector'' status. This is an outrageous assault on the right of women to receive the full range of health benefits. 
   Also, this bill contains an absolutely unnecessary--and potentially dangerous--across the board spending cut. This cut will affect funding for education and health care and medical research and veterans. It is a silly way to do business, and it is unnecessary. Congress should have done its job and made the decisions about what is important and what is not. 
   There are also a lot of holes in this legislation, a lot of things missing. These are things that were in there at one point or on the table for discussion, but for some reason were taken out. I am talking about the lack of hate crimes legislation, which passed the Senate. I am talking about my amendment, which also passed the Senate unanimously, to ban the sale of guns to people who are intoxicated. There is once again no long-term, large-scale commitment to repair America's schools. There is no prescription drug benefit under Medicare, so that millions of senior citizens will not have to make a choice between medicine and food. There is not enough money for after-school programs. And the rural loan guarantee program for satellite TV--something that is crucial to rural communities around the country--was taken out of the bill at the request of one senator. 
   In the category of the undone, this Congress will go home for the year without having acted on several issues of enormous importance to all Americans--things that the people have said over and over again they want us to do. This includes: a real patients bill of rights, common sense gun control, campaign finance reform, and an increase in the minimum wage. 
   Some will say that we could not do these things because we did not have the money. Let me point out that if this Republican-controlled Congress had not insisted on increasing the defense budget by about $8 billion more than the President said we needed, then we would have had plenty of money to pay for both the well-deserved pay raise for our servicemen and women and the priorities I have just talked about. 
   So, Mr. President, I regret that this bill was not all it could have been and that this Congress did not accomplish all that it should have. But, I look forward to the next session in the hope  that we finally address the priorities of the American people.

    Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to honor one of the finest mayors to serve in California. My state, particularly my constituents in Sacramento lost a great Californian this fall with the passing of Sacramento Mayor Joe Serna. 
   My bill will name the new Federal Courthouse at 501 I Street the ``Joe Serna, Jr. United States Courthouse and Federal Building'' in honor of his contributions to Sacramento and the working men and women of California. Joe Serna was a man of great vision, courage, energy, warmth, and humor. 
   He was also a living embodiment of the American Dream: a first-generation American who helped to reshape the capital of our nation's largest state. 
   Mayor Serna was born in 1939, the son of Mexican immigrants. As the oldest of four children, Joe grew up in a bunkhouse and worked with his family in the beet fields around Lodi. 
   Mayor Serna never forgot his roots. After attending Sacramento City College and graduating from California State University, Sacramento, he served in the Peace Corps and went to work for the United Farm Workers, where Cesar Chavez became his mentor and role model. 
   After serving on the city's redevelopment agency in the 1970s, Mayor Serna was elected to the Council himself in 1981. He was elected mayor in 1992 and re-elected in 1996, winning both races by wide margins. Throughout his terms in office, he continued to work as a professor of government and ethnic studies at his alma mater, Cal State Sacramento. 
   Mayor Serna virtually rebuilt the city of Sacramento. He forged public-private partnerships to redevelop the downtown, revitalize the neighborhoods, and reform the public school system. He presided over an urban renaissance that transformed Sacramento into a dynamic modern metropolis. The new Sacramento Federal Building is a visible reminder of the redevelopment of Sacramento. Naming this building after Mayor Serna would be a fitting tribute. 
   Mayor Serna died as he lived: with great strength and dignity. Last month, as he publicly discussed his impending death from cancer, he said, ``I was supposed to live and die as a farm worker, not as a mayor and a college professor. I have everything to be thankful for. I have the people to thank for allowing me to be their mayor. I have society to thank for the opportunity it has given me.'' 
   Mr. President, it is we who are thankful today for having had such a man serve the people of California, and I ask my colleagues to support this legislation to honor the legacy of Joe Serna, Jr.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to correct a weakness in the Medicare law for those who develop a terminal illness. 
   Under current law, individuals under age 65 who are unable to work because of a disability can qualify for Medicare after a two-year waiting period. That is, two years after developing a disability, individuals can start to receive Medicare benefits to help pay for their health care. 
   There are reasons for this two-year waiting period, and this legislation would not change that. What I am concerned about, Mr. President, is the fact that thousands of individuals develop a disability that is terminal within two years. 
   I am talking about people with cancer, people with AIDS, people with Lou Gehrig's Disease, to name to just a few examples. In some cases, when these individuals are diagnosed and can no longer work, they have less than two years to live. That means they will die before the end of the waiting period, before they become eligible for Medicare, before they qualify to receive health care benefits. That is not right and not fair. 
   The Medicare for Individuals with Terminal Illness Act would change this. My bill would say that for people whose doctors expect them to live less than two years because of their disability or illness, there will be no waiting period. They would qualify for Medicare immediately and could get the health care they need. 
   Mr. President, to date, 10 individuals and 44 organizations--groups involved with AIDS, cerebral palsy, Alzheimer's Disease, hospice care, and diabetes, among others--have endorsed this legislation. 
   Mr. President, I encourage my colleagues to look at this list of supporters, look at the bill, and join me in correcting a problem that is denying health care benefits to thousands of Americans.

   Mrs. BOXER. I thank my colleague for yielding. I say to the Senator from Massachusetts how much I appreciate him pushing this forward and how important it is to all of our States. I bring out an article that ran in the paper yesterday and today about the status of children in my home State of California, by far the largest State. I want my friend to respond to these numbers because they really say it. 
   This is what it says:  
   Despite a booming economy that has seen a tide of prosperity wash over California in  recent years, nearly 1 in 4 children under 18 in the Golden State lives in poverty....... 
   Although the annual ``California Report Card 1999'' laments that so many children live in poverty, it paints an especially bleak portrait of a child's first four years of life.  
   Lois Salisbury, president of Children Now, says:  
   Among all of California's children, our littlest ones.......face the most stressful conditions of all....... 
   At a time when a child's sense of self and security is influenced most powerfully, California deals them a [terrible] hand.  
   I say to my friend, this issue he is raising is so critical. We all say how much we care about the children. Every one of us has made that speech. Today the rubber meets the road. If you care about children, you have to make sure their parents can support them. 
   My last point is, and I will yield for the answer, I wonder if my friend has seen the New York Times editorial that says:  
   The Senate will vote today on a Republican-sponsored amendment to raise the minimum wage and they say sadly the Republicans are not content to do this good deed and go home. They have loaded the amendment with tax cuts that are fiscally damaging and cynically focused on wealthy workers. Almost all of the Republican tax cuts go to the wealthy.  
   One of the economists who looked at this said:  
   It would encourage the reduction of contributions made by employers to the pensions of the lowest paid workers.  
   Can my friend comment on the importance of this proposal to children and also this cynical proposal that our colleagues on the other side are presenting?

   Mrs. BOXER. The Senator from New Mexico said he wasn't going to yell. He got a little close to it. But when I hear the yells on that side of the aisle, it is usually related to their passion for helping the wealthiest among us. 
   The Senator from New Mexico says that the Democrats are living in the past because we want to increase the minimum wage. Well, I have news for the Senator from New Mexico. Compassion for the poorest in our society, those at the bottom rung of the ladder, that is a timeless value; that is a moral value; that is a religious value; that is a value we ought to be proud to have around here. That is not living in the past. Come to Los Angeles, I say to my friend from New Mexico, or look around your big cities. What you will notice is that the people who are living on the minimum wage are adults. We know that to be the fact. A majority of minimum-wage workers are adults--70 percent of them. 
   In the Democratic proposal, out of those who will benefit from this modest increase, 60 percent of them are women. So if you want to say that we are living in the past, you can say it all you want. But it isn't true. 
   We saw in September a very chilling story in the L.A. Times about the working poor in Southern California. The National Low-Income Housing Coalition shows that given the high cost of a two-bedroom apartment in L.A., a minimum-wage earner must work 112 hours per week in order to make ends meet.  
   In San Francisco, it is even worse. A person would have to work 174 hours at minimum wage in order to pay their bills. According to a recent study of the Nation's food banks, 40 percent of all households seeking emergency food aid had at least one member who was working. That is up from 23 percent in 1994. 
   Low-paying jobs, I say to my friend from New Mexico, are the most frequently cited cause of hunger today, according to this well-documented L.A. Times story.

    Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, a great American died this past weekend: Mayor Joe Serna Jr. of Sacramento, California. Mayor Serna was much beloved by his constituents, family, and friends. We will all miss him terribly. 
   Joe Serna and I became friends while working closely together on gun control, education, and other issues of mutual concern. He was a man of great vision, courage, energy, warmth, and humor. 
   He was also a living embodiment of the American Dream: a first-generation American who helped to reshape the capital of our Nation's largest state. 
   Joe Serna Jr. was born in 1939, the son of Mexican immigrants. As the oldest of four children, Joe grew up in a bunkhouse and worked with his family in the beet fields around Lodi. 
   Joe never forgot his roots. After attending Sacramento City College and graduating from California State University, Sacramento, he served in the  Peace Corps and went to work for the United Farm Workers, where Cesar Chavez became his mentor and role model. 
   In 1969, Joe managed the successful campaign of Manuel Ferrales for the Sacramento City Council. After serving on the city's redevelopment agency in the 1970s, Joe was elected to the Council himself in 1981. He was elected mayor in 1992 and re-elected in 1996, winning both races by wide margins. Throughout his terms in office, he continued to work as a professor of government and ethnic studies at his alma mater, Cal State Sacramento. 
   Mayor Serna virtually rebuilt the city of Sacramento. He forged public-private partnerships to redevelop the downtown, revitalize the neighborhoods, and reform the public school system. He presided over an urban renaissance that transformed Sacramento into a dynamic modern metropolis. 
   Joe Serna died as he lived: with great strength and dignity. Last month, as he publicly discussed his impending death from cancer, he said, ``I was supposed to live and die as a farmworker, not as a mayor and a college professor. I have everything to be thankful for. I have the people to thank for allowing me to be their mayor. I have society to thank for the opportunity it has given me.'' 
   Mr. President, it is we who are thankful today for having had such a man serve the people of California.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, for several months, I have been working on a case with the South Korean government on behalf of a family in California. 
   The family, Mr. and Mrs. B.K. Cho, are concerned about actions taken against them in South Korea in 1984. At that time, the Cho family owned one of the largest construction companies in the country. The Cho family alleges that their holdings were illegally transferred to two other companies, Cho Hung Bank and Daelim Industries. They also accuse officials of the then Chun government of ordering this transfer. 
   Soon after their property was taken from them, the Cho family left for the United States. They have filed a lawsuit in California against Cho Hung Bank and Daelim Industries and their U.S. subsidiaries.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, although I am a longstanding supporter of financial services modernization, I will vote against S. 900--the Financial Services Modernization bill. I am concerned that this bill does far too little to ensure the privacy of individuals. 
   Over the past three or four years we have seen an explosion of mergers in the financial services industry. Citibank and the Travelers Group merged. And in my home state, BankAmerica--California's biggest bank--merged with NationsBank. All of these mergers, in my home state and elsewhere, will undoubtedly have a major impact on consumers. And while we do not know what that impact will ultimately be, I believe we do know it will impact our privacy. Why? 
   Although most Americans believe their financial data is private, they are wrong. In fact, current law allows banks to do basically whatever they want with the personal information they collect from their customers in the course of doing business. Banks can provide a consumer's name, address, account balance, payment history, even his account number and social security number to their affiliates. And they can sell that information to third parties without even notifying the customer whose information has been sold. 
   Given that banks already share and sell the personal information of their customers, why then do I oppose this bill? I oppose it because I believe the bill will heighten the existing problem. 
   Mr. President, S. 900 will heighten the problem because, as noted by Robert Scheer in a November 2 Los Angeles Times editorial, ``..... [the bill] allows banks, insurance and brokerage firms to merge not only their equity but also the vast accumulation of computerized records on consumers' buying habits, health treatments, investments and credit history.'' 
   The tearing down of walls that now exist between banks, insurance firms, and securities firms, in this highly technological and computerized era, means the information now being shared will expand exponentially. There will be more information to share, more comprehensive information to share, and more people with whom to share it and to whom to sell it. 
   Privacy rights are most vulnerable in the information age. And while I realize we cannot turn back the clock, I do believe we as policy makers can and should provide some parameters for the sharing and selling of personal information. Unfortunately, despite all of the talk of self regulation, financial institutions provide little if any privacy protections. The legislation before us does nothing to improve this situation. 
   Finally, I understand that many financial institutions have complained that stronger privacy protections in the context of financial services modernization are unworkable, too costly to implement, and will, in part, defeat the purpose of allowing banks, insurance companies, and brokerage firms to affiliate. I reject these arguments for two specific reasons. 
   First, at least one large U.S. financial institution offers its European customers the kinds of privacy protections it contends it cannot offer its U.S. customers. In 1995, that institution agreed to allow their German customers to ``opt-in'' to having their non-public financial information shared with other companies. 
   Second, it is the current policy of some U.S. financial institutions not share their customers' personal information without first getting the permission of those customers or allowing those customers to ``opt-out'' of such sharing. And those institutions, American Express and U.S. Bancorp among them, apparently have not found such policies overly burdensome or competitively disadvantageous. 
   In closing, proponents of this legislation suggest the privacy provisions included in the bill are sufficient. Indeed, some have suggested the privacy provisions contained in this bill are historic.  And although some small steps have been made, like the notice provision which requires financial institutions to tell customers about their policies for disclosing nonpublic personal data and the provision which prevents stronger state consumer privacy laws from being pre-empted, I believe the steps are far too small. 
   I wish I could support this bill. As I said at the outset, I am a longstanding supporter of financial services modernization. I do not believe, however, the privacy of consumers should be, or need be, sacrificed for such modernization. 
   Mr. BENNETT addressed the Chair.

    Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today, I am introducing legislation to pay tribute to a former colleague of mine and a fellow Californian, former Congressman Augustus F. Hawkins, by renaming the Federal building located at 10301 South Compton Avenue, in Los Angeles, California, currently known as the Watts Finance Office, as the Augustus F. Hawkins Post Office Building. 
   Gus Hawkins was born in Shreveport, Louisiana in 1907. His family moved to Los Angeles when he was 11 to escape the racial discrimination that was prevalent in the South at that time. This experience made him a passionate advocate of racial justice and social equality, and he committed his life to the service of others. 
   His efforts began in the California Assembly where he passed the state's first law against discrimination in housing and employment. Building on that success, he passed other important legislation concerning minimum wages for women, child care centers, workers' compensation for domestic employees, and the removal of racial designations on state documents. 
   In 1962, Gus was elected to the United States House of Representatives. During his 28 years in office, he served on the Committee on House Administration, and served as Chairman for both the Joint Committee on Printing and the Committee on Education and Labor. He authored more than 17 federal laws dealing with civil rights, educational improvements, job training and employment opportunities. He fought tirelessly for the rights of children, the poor, the disabled, the elderly, and minorities. 
   Throughout his distinguished career, Gus was recognized as a hardworking man of integrity who cared little for personal accolades while concentrating on the issues affecting his constituents. He has continually pursued fairness and opportunity for all. 
   Designating the Watts Finance Office Building as the Augustus F. Hawkins Post Office Building is an honor befitting his 56 years of service to his community and to the State of California.

    Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today, I am introducing legislation to pay tribute to a former colleague of mine and a fellow Californian, former Congressman Mervyn Malcolm Dymally, by renaming the post office located at 701 South Santa Fe Avenue in Compton, California, currently known as the Compton Main Post Office, as the Mervyn Dymally Post Office Building. 
   Mr. Dymally came to this country in 1945 from Cedros, Trinidad, British West Indies. In 1960, he began his political career by working as a field coordinator for John F. Kennedy during the Presidential campaign. Mr. Dymally's own service as an elected official began when he was elected to the California State Assembly in 1963 and then to the State Senate in 1967, where he served for eight years. Next, he was elected Lieutenant Governor of the State of California and was the State's highest ranking black elected official. 
   Building on a career of political success, Mervyn Dymally was elected to the United States House of Representatives in 1981. During his six terms in office, he served on several committees, including the Post Office and Civil Service Committee; the Committee on the District of Columbia, where he chaired its Subcommittee on Judiciary and Education; and the House Committee on Foreign Affairs, where he was the Chair of the Subcommittee on International Operations. 
   As the Chairman of the Subcommittee on Africa, Mr. Dymally's passion became immediately evident when he visited 20 African countries in his first year. He worked tirelessly to raise awareness of the plight of Africans and to monitor U.S. assistance levels to African and Caribbean nations. Throughout his distinguished career, he was recognized for his leadership in humanitarian efforts. 
   Since retirement from Congress in 1992, Mr. Dymally is busier than ever. He serves as President of the Grace Home for Waiting Children and as Chairman of the Caribbean Action Lobby. In addition, he is the President of a consulting firm and a Professor at the Central State University in Ohio. He still travels frequently, serving as Honorary Consul to the Republic of Benin, West Africa and Vice President of the Pacific Century Institute. 
   Designating the Compton Main Post Office as the Mervyn Dymally Post Office Building is an honor befitting his service to his community and to the State of California.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today I am introducing the California Indian Land Transfer Act, which would transfer to eight California tribes approximately 3,500 acres of Bureau of Land Management (BLM) land to be used for housing construction, grazing, resource protection, and non-gaming economic development. 
   The eight tribes are the Pit River Tribe (Modoc County), the Fort Bidwell Indian Community (Modoc County), the Pala Band of Mission Indians (San Diego County), the Cuyapaipe Band of Mission Indians (San Diego County), the Manzanita Band of Mission Indians (San Diego County), the Barona Band of Mission Indians (San Diego County), and the Morongo Band of Mission Indians (Riverside County). 
   All of the parcels of BLM land are contiguous to existing reservation trust lands and have been formally classified as suitable for disposal through the BLM land use planning process. 
   Many California Indian tribes now lack reservations of sufficient size to provide housing or an economic base adequate to meet the needs of their members and their families. Other California Indian reservations have such poor quality lands that the tribal options for economic development are extremely limited. This situation derives from the complex history of federal-tribal relations in California. Instead of the approximately 8.5 million acres of land promised in the treaties, the California tribes now reside on a little more than 400,000 acres. Approximately one-third of California's 107 federally recognized tribes have a land base of less than 50 acres; approximately two-thirds have a land base of less than 500 acres, leaving little opportunity for these tribes to develop viable communities and economies where their members can live and work. 
   The counties in which these lands are located support the tribes' efforts to acquire these lands and have participated in the federal land planning process through which these parcels were identified and made available for transfer to the tribes. This legislation also has the support of the Administration. A similar bill, H.R. 2742, passed the House of Representatives last Congress and was placed on the Senate's consent calendar but was never brought to a vote before adjournment. An earlier version of the bill suffered the same fate in the 104th Congress and I am informed that the negotiations between the Department of the Interior and the Tribes for transfer of these lands date back to 1994. 
   This legislation is the result of a multiyear cooperative effort by the tribes, the Secretary, the BLM and the Bureau of Indian Affairs, in consultation with local country governments. This effort allows me to present a model legislative blueprint for interagency transfer of federal lands as a means of enhancing the extremely limited land and resources base of California's small tribes. The bill also stands as an excellent example of federal, tribal, and local governmental consultation and collaboration within the planning process for disposition of federal lands that have been formally classified as suitable for disposal. It is time for Congress to do its part and conclude this successful intergovernmental collaboration.

    Mrs. BOXER. 
   Mr. President, last July, when the Senate considered the Commerce-Justice-State appropriations bill, I offered an amendment to prohibit the sale of guns to people who were intoxicated. 
   State and local laws prohibit intoxicated people from operating a car, a boat, a snowmobile, a plane, an all-terrain vehicle, or a bicycle. There is even one state law that prohibits an intoxicated person from getting a tattoo. In addition, federal law prohibits an intoxicated person from enlisting in the military. And, federal gun laws prohibit the sale of a gun to a drug user. 
   My amendment simply built on this record. All it said is that if you are intoxicated, you cannot buy a gun or ammunition. To me, it just makes common sense that someone who is drunk should not be able to buy a gun. And, the Senate agreed because my amendment was passed unanimously. 
   Unfortunately, Mr. President, the conference committee dropped this provision from the bill. I am extremely disappointed that such a common-sense proposal would be abandoned by the Senate leadership. 
   So, today, I am introducing--along with my colleague, Senator LAUTENBERG--this very reasonable proposal as a free-standing bill. 
   Mr. President, guns and alcohol do not mix. A 1997 study in the Journal of American Medical Association found that ``alcohol and illicit drug use appear to be associated with an increased risk of violent death.'' And as the two stories I want to share today illustrate, alcohol is also associated with an increased risk of serious injury. 
   The first story is about a woman by the name of Deborah Kitchen. She is a quadriplegic, and she got that way because her ex-boyfriend shot her. 
   On the day of the shooting, Deborah's boyfriend, Thomas Knapp, consumed--by his own estimate--a fifth of whiskey and a case of beer. He went to K-Mart in Florida to buy a .22-caliber rifle and a box of bullets. Mr. Knapp was so intoxicated that the clerk had to help him fill out the federal form required to purchase the gun. But he was still able to buy the rifle. 
   Mr. Knapp then took that rifle, shot his ex-girlfriend Deborah Kitchen, and left her a quadriplegic. 
   The second story is from Michigan. It involves an 18-year-old named Walter McKay, who had engaged in a day-long drinking spree and then went and bought ammunition for his shotgun. He was so intoxicated that he could not remember whether it was a man or woman who sold him the ammunition and could not identify what he purchased. 
   He took those shotgun shells, loaded his gun, and intended to shoot out the back window of an acquaintance's truck. He was intoxicated. The shot missed, ricocheted off the wheel of the truck, and hit Anthony Buczkowski. Mr. Buczkowski had to have a finger amputated and his left wrist surgically fused. 
   Mr. Knapp and Mr. McKay could buy a gun and ammunition because it is not--I repeat, not--against the law to sell a gun or ammunition to someone who is intoxicated. 
   Mr. President, as I mentioned earlier, states and localities have all sorts of laws prohibiting people who are intoxicated from doing certain things. But, I am unaware of a single state law that prohibits someone who is drunk from buying a gun or ammunition. 
   It would be nice if states would act. But, gun sales are largely regulated at the federal level and involve federal licenses and federal forms. This is a federal responsibility, and there should be a federal law that stops this outrage. 
   That is what my bill does. If you are intoxicated, you would not be able to buy a gun or ammunition. It is very reasonable, and it will save lives.

This isn't his favorite moment to come down to the floor and have to express his feelings of dismay and his anger, frankly. 
   My friend listed bills that are in the landfill, the graveyard. I want to ask the Senator about three other issues that I think are in danger of joining in that Republican graveyard: The 100,000 teachers, the 100,000 police, and decent, qualified judges who have been waiting for years to get a vote. 
   I wonder if my leader would comment on those three areas, as well.

   Mrs. BOXER. I think one of the reasons people are disillusioned today and do not participate in the greatest democracy in the world is that they believe their voice does not count. They believe money talks. And listening to the debate we had on this floor, with the Senator from Kentucky on their side of the aisle leading that fight, I am sure they have concluded they are right. The Senator equates money with speech. It was, to me, one of the saddest debates I have ever heard around here. 
   People do not vote, they do not participate, because they believe they do not count. Ordinary people, average people, they can't make the $1,000 contribution, or the $5,000, or the $10,000, or the $20,000 contribution, or, frankly, the $100,000 and $200,000 contributions of soft money that come into play here. 
   I think it was a very sad situation when the Republicans, defying a majority of this Senate--and we had a majority vote for campaign finance reform--took that piece of legislation and threw it into the graveyard, along with all the other things our Democratic leader and our assistant Democratic leader have talked about--all the important things: The HMO reforms, the teachers, the policemen, the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, and a number of 
   other issues that they have thrown into that graveyard, the last one being campaign finance reform.

<DOCNO>106-boxer-ca-5-19991028</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. BOXER. Absolutely. My friend is right. We held a number of press conferences before the last increase of the minimum wage--which now seems like history, it was so long ago--where we brought that point out that 60 percent of the people on minimum wage are adult women who are supporting their families. They work very hard. If they work full time at a minimum wage job, I say to my friend, they are way below the poverty line. They are earning about $11,000 a year. For a family of three or four, they can barely make it. They can't feed their kids, pay their rent, or buy many clothes at all. 
   So the bottom line is, my friend is right. When we talk about minimum wage, we should get behind what that means. What that means is, if we do not raise it, people in this country will be hungry, children in this country will be hungry. We already have many children living in poverty. That is the largest group of our citizenry living in poverty. 
   I want to ask my friend to comment on something here, if he would do me that favor. I am so proud of his leadership and that of Senator DASCHLE today in framing the issues. 
   When I heard the Senator from North Dakota go back and forth with my friend from Nevada on the Social Security issue, I was very glad they raised this issue on the floor. Because of the fact that we have a social safety net for seniors in this country, we have seen that the people in poverty no longer are the senior citizens. We should all be proud of that. But I want to read just a few lines from an editorial that ran in the San Diego Union Tribune. It was written by a man named Lionel Van Deerlin who, for many years, was in Congress.

   Mrs. BOXER. Correct, from the San Diego area. He is now a senior citizen himself and quite sharp, as you can tell from this. 
   I am going to read probably just 2 minutes' worth of his words, and I would love my friend to comment. It is called ``Trusting the GOP to `save' Social Security.''  
   For anyone who just fell off the turnip truck, Republicans in Congress have a new rallying cry--``We won't let them raid Social Security!''....... 
   [Tom] DeLay [who is the Republican whip in the House] asks us to believe that the Social Security trust fund is under assault by Democrats, and we must trust his party [the Republican Party] to protect it. 
   I'd sooner entrust a lettuce leaf to a rabbit. Credibility surely matters. In probing the violence at Grandmother's house in the woods, whom do we believe, Little Red Riding Hood or the wolf?  
   Here is one of those demonstrable facts of history:  
   And he goes on:  
   Had it been left to the Republicans in Congress, we'd never have had Social Security in the first place. Nor Medicare.

   Mrs. BOXER. I am so proud of the Senator's leadership today on this issue and so many others. I think these ads are going to backlash. In the end, the truth will come out. The American people are fair people. The American people are going to judge us, and they are going to judge us harshly on what we say and what we do. But they want the truth. 
   I do believe that with this kind of writing by Congressman Van Deerlin, who left the Congress a long time ago but still carries a tremendous amount of respect, his being, in his own conscience, unable to let this go and writing such strong words with a sense of humor--and editorials are popping up all over the country--I think the Republican Party is going to find a backlash across this Nation. I believe in my heart people will understand what they are doing. 
   It is fair to attack a candidate, a Senator, a Presidential candidate, a President on an issue. It is fair to do that. It is not fair to make up a story, make up a scenario because you have taken a poll and you know you are on the wrong side. 
   As I said today, the Republicans say they created a lockbox for Social Security. They forgot to tell us, they have the key. They already opened up that lockbox to give $18 billion to the programs they want. It is similar to the crab apple analogy before. They are taking out those apples, $18 billion, and then they hold the key. 
   The bottom line is, to say we are not protecting Social Security doesn't pass the smell test or the laugh test or the test of time or the test of history. 
   I am, again, proud of my friend for taking the floor.

They have been recounted on this floor, so I do not feel the need to go through all of his incredible accomplishments, particularly around environmental issues. I do hope we will not undo Senator Chafee's hard work on the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, Superfund, and so many of the landmark environmental bills on which he led us. 
   I wish to comment about Senator Chafee's kindness and his goodness as a human being and what a joy it was for me to work with him on the Environment and Public Works Committee, to attend the dinners he hosted, always in a bipartisan spirit, and how much we are going to need that kind of spirit right now. Senator Chafee was a champion of the environment. He was a champion of a woman's right to choose, and he was a champion of sensible gun laws. On those matters, it was my great privilege to work with him, and I will miss him deeply.

   Mrs. BOXER. Speaking about a bipartisan spirit, it was unnerving this morning to come to the floor and hear some of the partisan attacks I heard, mostly aimed at President Bill Clinton, in particular at his budget priorities, which Democrats share. At some point in the discussion this morning, it approached a near-hysterical level. 
   I will talk about what the differences are. I think we can 
   breach those differences and resolve our problems. 
   Putting 100,000 teachers in the classrooms to reduce class size, everyone in America wants us to do that, I believe. We have already put 30,000 of those teachers in the classrooms, and we are simply asking to continue the program. This Republican budget would mean sending pink slips to those teachers. That is wrong. We ought to sit down and resolve it. 
   Secondly, in continuing our efforts to put more police on the streets, we have seen a tremendous reduction in the crime rate. We know one of the reasons is putting more community police on the streets. Surely we can find a compromise with the Republicans on this point. 
   Then, paying our U.N. dues. How can we lead the world if we don't at least do that, while encouraging and demanding reforms at the United Nations? I thought it was resolved. It has not been resolved. Funding peace agreements, that has not been resolved. We can't be the world leader if we don't do that. 
   I think these differences are important. 
   There are also environmental riders, giveaways to big special interests. They are wrong. We should sit down and resolve them. 
   The one that really is extraordinary, with the partisanship that surrounds it, is the Social Security issue. Republicans say they have a lockbox and the Democrats want to go into Social Security and destroy it. In some ways, it is rather laughable. Going back to 1994, House majority leader DICK ARMEY said: I would never have created Social Security. 
   If we look back at the record, we will find the Republicans voted against a retirement benefit for the people of this country when Social Security was voted on. They voted against Medicare. Now they are going forward with TV commercials telling people they are the party that is going to protect a program they didn't even like and didn't even want. It doesn't even pass the laugh test. 
   Here is the deal. They have a lockbox. They say: We are never going to touch it. That is good. However, they forgot to tell you something--they have the key. They have opened it up, and they have taken $18 billion out of it already, according to their own Congressional Budget Office. 
   That is not BARBARA BOXER saying it. It is their own Congressional Budget Office that stated they have gone into Social Security for $18 billion. 
   So why don't we just sit down and talk--talk about the legislative graveyard that has been created in the Senate. What is in there? HMO reform. People can't get the health care they need and deserve. That is in the garbage heap. Sensible gun laws, the juvenile justice bill, that is in the graveyard. They put the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty in there; campaign finance reform; judicial appointments; long-term protection of Medicare and Social Security; minimum wage is in the legislative graveyard. As Senator MIKULSKI said, these were lost opportunities to us. So I feel very strongly that we have more work to do. We should sit down with the President and resolve these differences. 
   Lastly, I hope we can move forward on some of these judgeships. Judge Richard Paez and Marsha Berzon were nominated years ago, voted out of the committee on a bipartisan vote. Judge Paez has been waiting almost 4 years to get a vote. Marsha Berzon has been waiting almost 2 years. Later, when I get to talk about these nominees in detail, I will tell you the strong Republican support they have--Republican Congress people, Republican sheriffs, and Republican law enforcement officials in the State of California. These are good nominees. 
   I have put a hold on a particular nominee the majority leader wants for the TVA. I have no problem with that nominee. I voted him out of committee. He has been waiting 27 days for a vote, Marsha Berzon has been waiting 2 years, and Richard Paez has been waiting almost 4 years. 
   I see the majority leader on the floor, and I promised that when he arrived I would stop this talking in morning business. So I will do that. I urge everyone to come to the table in a bipartisan spirit, do the unfinished business, resolve the budget differences, and get moving with some of these appointments that have been waiting for years, simply for an up-or-down vote. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Chair. 
   I also want to say something about the prayer which I found to be quite beautiful. I think talking about making sure we have no hate in our heart is really important. It is so important to all of us as we debate this legislation, to understand that we have great differences but to try to reach for that part of ourselves that brings us all together. 
   I thank the guest Chaplain as well. 
   This morning I am very pleased to be here. I know that while Democratic Senators were attending a dinner last evening, the debate into the late hours was rather one-sided. So I really do appreciate the fact we have a little time this morning to set the record straight. 
   I am very pleased the Senator from Iowa, who is on his way here, was able to place his amendment before the Senate so we could bring back this debate on a woman's right to choose, the fundamental right women won in this country in 1973 when the Court decided that, in fact, a woman in the earlier stages of her pregnancy has a right to choose freely, with her doctor and her husband and her family, as to how to handle their situation. I think it was a very important, landmark decision. 
   The decision went on to say that in the later term, which we are talking about a great deal, the State has the  right to regulate it. So what Roe did was to balance the rights of the woman, if you will, with the child she is carrying. It says in the late term and in the midterm, the States can regulate the procedure, and that is very important, but the woman's life and the woman's health must always be paramount. This is important. 
   What we have in the underlying bill is just the opposite. The underlying bill makes no exception for a woman's health. Now, the Senator from Pennsylvania says there doesn't need to be that exception. I didn't know he had a medical degree. I would prefer to listen to the obstetricians and gynecologists. He cites 600 doctors. There are 40,000 strong. I prefer to listen to the nurses, to the women who have chosen to go into the health professions. All those letters were put into the RECORD. 
   And so I believe very strongly that we must always protect the life and health of a woman while we grapple with the obvious religious, moral, and ethical questions as to what type of restrictions ought to be placed on abortion in the later term. 
   I was very discouraged and saddened by the debate yesterday because I thought what came out on this floor were words that were full of hate. To call a doctor an executioner is wrong; to talk about killing babies is wrong; and I don't think it brings this Nation closer together on this issue. I do not think it sets an atmosphere in which we can try to work together. But this morning I think we are debating something different. 
   We are debating a very fundamental Court decision. The Harkin amendment simply says that Court decision should not be overturned. I look forward to an overwhelming vote, and I hope it will be overwhelming, not to overturn Roe. Because I think if we do that, and that amendment is attached to the underlying bill, it will give the President even more reason to veto the underlying bill because we will affirm that this Senate stands in favor of a woman's right to choose, and of Roe. Remember, Roe says that at every stage of a pregnancy the woman's health must be protected. The underlying bill makes no such exception. 
   When you talk about abortion, you are really talking about choice. Should the Government, this Government, this Senate, tell women and families what to do in an emergency tragic health situation? That is what we are talking about in the underlying bill. The Senator from Pennsylvania says, yes, the Government should tell families what to do. Unfortunately, in his argument, in my view--and it is shared by many--he demeans women; he demeans families; and he demeans doctors. Worse than that, far worse than that, he demonizes women, demonizes families who do not agree with him. He demonizes doctors, doctors who bring babies into this world, doctors who help save lives, who protect our health, who protect a woman's fertility. He does that only if these women and these families and these doctors do not agree with his views. 
   I guess perhaps the biggest insult and the biggest injury that was done yesterday on this floor was when the Senator from Pennsylvania dismissed heartfelt stories of women and their families who have struggled through the biggest tragedy, almost, that anyone can imagine--of having to terminate a pregnancy at the final stages because something has gone horribly wrong and the baby, if born, would suffer and the mother would suffer adverse health consequences, irreversible; he called those stories anecdotes. Don't be blinded, he says, by the anecdotes of women. I want to say to my colleague from Pennsylvania, with no hate in my heart whatsoever, you call these stories anecdotes. I say these stories are these families' lives. It is what they have experienced. It is what they will forever have to live with. I think it is shameful to dismiss them in that fashion. 
   Many of these women are here in the Capitol. They are here with their families; they are here with their children; they are telling their stories. To dismiss it and say don't be blinded by a few anecdotes is, to me, very cruel, indeed. 
   I say to the Senator from Pennsylvania, and the Senators who support him, that I support his right to view this issue in any way he chooses. I support the right of his family to handle these health care emergencies in any way they decide with their doctor, with each other, with their God, with their priest, with their rabbi, with their minister. It is their right. I would no sooner tell the Senator from Pennsylvania's family how to handle this matter than anything I can imagine. I would never do that. I do not want the Senator from Pennsylvania telling my family and my rabbi and my children how to handle a health emergency. I resent that. 
   I have enough respect for my family that we would do what is right. I have enough respect for every family in America that they would do what is right. If the families in America did not agree with me, I would say God bless you; you handle this in any way you want. 
   That is where the differences lie between the philosophy of the Senator from Pennsylvania and the 
   philosophy of those of us who consider ourselves pro-choice. We trust the women of America. We trust the families of America. We trust them to seek the appropriate counsel. We trust them to make this painful and difficult decision without Government telling them what to do. 
   When the women in this country have a health problem, they do not go to see their Senator. They don't go to see Dr. SANTORUM or Dr. BOXER or Dr. HELMS or Dr. MIKULSKI. They go to their physician. We should not play doctor. It is not appropriate, it is not right, and it is dangerous. It is very dangerous to the health of women. We will get into that when we talk about why the Roe v. Wade decision was so important. As long as the women in this country and the families in this country choose what is legal and available to them, we should respect that. The legalities have been settled since 1973. Make no mistake about it, the entire purpose of this underlying bill and other amendments that may come before us--I do not know what amendments they will be--are all about one thing: undermining this basic legal decision called Roe v. Wade. 
   At 11:30 this morning, the Senate will make an important vote as to whether or not they believe Roe v. Wade should be confirmed by this Senate. I want to read a quote that was put in the RECORD yesterday. I think it is very important to understand this statement is a statement of Supreme Court Justices O'Connor, Kennedy, and Souter. In a case called Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v. Casey, listen to what these three Justices, all Republicans appointed by Republican Presidents, said about the basic issue we are talking about:  
   At the heart of liberty is the right to define one's own concept of existence, of meaning, of the universe, and of the mystery of human life. Beliefs about these matters could not define the attributes of personhood were they formed under compulsion of the State.  
   ``Compulsion of the State.'' What these Justices said, all appointed by Republican Presidents, was that the state should stay out of this crucial decision. It is something that exists in our hearts, in our souls, in our beings. 
   The ``meaning of the universe and the mystery of human life'' should not be dictated by the state, by Senator SANTORUM, by Senator BOXER, by any Senator. It is up to each individual. 
   When Roe was decided and it was reaffirmed by the Court, and hopefully it will be reaffirmed today by this Senate, it basically gave that liberty to the people of this country. I think it is very important to note it has been stated on this floor over and over again, the underlying bill has nothing to do with Roe v. Wade. I ask you, colleagues, to look at the 19 Court decisions that have contradicted that statement. In each and every case, the Court said the Santorum bill, the approach he has taken, contradicts Roe, because in each and every case they found the definition of this partial-birth abortion--of which there is no medical meaning, there is no medical term--is so vague that it could, in fact, apply to any procedure and, therefore, it essentially stops all abortion. Indeed, if you look at some of the States, in some of the States, before the Court overturned these statutes, there was no abortion being performed at any stage because of the vaguely worded law, the words of the Santorum bill. 
   In Alaska, the vagaries of the law are obvious, and Alaska overturned the Santorum bill. 
   In Florida, this statute ``may endanger the health of women''--they overturned the Santorum bill. 
   In Idaho, the act bans the safest and most common methods of abortion and they overturned--this is Idaho--the Santorum bill. 
   In Louisiana, the judge said this is truly a conceptual theory that has no relation to fact, law, or medicine, and they overturned this bill. 
   In Michigan, they said physicians simply cannot know with any degree of confidence what conduct may give rise to criminal prosecution and license revocation, and they overturned the bill. 
   And it goes on--Missouri, Montana. They say the problem here is that the legislation goes way beyond banning the type of abortion depicted in the illustrations. 
   Court after court has stated this bill overturns Roe, and that is why the Senator from Iowa was so correct to bring his amendment to the floor to reaffirm Roe. 
   I see the Senator from Washington is here, and I ask her how many minutes she would like to use on this amendment.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I yield myself the remainder of the time. 
   I thank the Senator from Iowa for his insight in offering this important amendment. I am very hopeful the Senate will go on record as supporting Roe v. Wade. I think it may well do just that. That would send a wonderful signal to the families of America that we trust them to make the most personal, private decisions that perhaps they will ever be called on to make. 
   Once again, I have to say I think some of the language used on the other side of the aisle in this debate has been offensive. I think it has been wrong. I think it has been inflammatory. The Senator from Pennsylvania continues to say those of us who disagree with him, in essence, want to kill children. We are mothers. We have bore children. We are grandmothers. We love the children. So it is highly offensive to hear those words used on the Senate floor. 
   My colleague says he feels the pain of the families who went through this horrible experience; yet he demeans them. He basically says they don't know what they are talking about when they beg us not to pass this legislation, when they beg us to turn away from this legislation, which makes no exception for the health of a woman. 
   Again, we are not doctors. We are Senators. When the women of this country need help--and serious help--they don't turn to us. They turn to us for other things, but they don't turn to us to get the help they need. They turn to a physician they trust; they turn to their God, to their families, to their 
   closest friends, and they turn to their conscience. So I hope we will reaffirm Roe v. Wade because that is what Roe v. Wade says--trust the women, respect them, respect their privacy. 
   I want to put into the RECORD a statement sent to us by an award-winning actress, Polly Bergen, who came forward to talk about her illegal abortion in the 1940s. She said:  
   Someone gave me the phone number of a person who did abortions........I borrowed about $300 from my roommate and went alone to a dirty, run-down bungalow in a dangerous neighborhood in east L.A. A ..... man came to the floor and asked for the money........He told me to take off all of my clothes except for my blouse....... I got up on a cold metal kitchen table. He performed a procedure, using something sharp. He didn't give me anything for the pain--he just did it. He said ..... I would be fine.  
   Well, Polly Bergen was rendered infertile. 
   Vote for the Harkin amendment. Vote no on the underlying bill.

   Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Senator from Pennsylvania. 
   I don't know how this is all going to end, but my side has no problem with the Senator from Pennsylvania changing his legislation in any way he wants to change it. We on our side are not going to object at all. He can change it any way he wants to change it. 
   I will say something very important from our side, and that is, the change he is submitting does nothing at all to meet the health concerns of the mother. He is changing a definition, and he doesn't at all say, if a woman's health is at stake, this procedure can be used. So if the Senator is trying to meet the constitutional objection from the courts which have thrown out his bill across this country, he doesn't do it with his modification. He still doesn't make an exception for the health of a woman, and this bill remains a very dangerous bill. It makes no exception for health. 
   Secondly, as I understand it, he still keeps the criminal penalties for the doctors. This caused the American Medical Association to back off its support for the bill. That still is a defect because, as the Senator from Nebraska said, after speaking to an OB/GYN, who brings life into the world, when these dangerous situations present themselves to a physician, they have to make a quick-second judgment on what to do to preserve life, to preserve health, to make sure the woman is not paralyzed, deformed, made infertile, to make sure the fetus isn't injured. All these things come into play. We don't want to have doctors saying: Just a minute, I have to read Senator SANTORUM's law. 
   What we want is for the physicians to do what has to be 
   done, do the right thing, according to their oath they take when they become physicians. We take an oath of office when we become Senators. We are not physicians. We don't take the Hippocratic oath. When we take the oath, we swear to uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States of America. We do not get sworn in to be physicians. Physicians take their oath to do no harm. Our oath is to uphold the Constitution. And to uphold the Constitution, we should be upholding the landmark decision Roe v. Wade, which, by a very slim majority, this Senate says it upholds. 
   So this so-called fix the Senator from Pennsylvania will be submitting, which I have no objection to his submitting, still renders the bill unconstitutional because the health of the woman is not addressed. Roe says clearly, yes, the State can get involved in the right to choose after viability, but you always have to respect the health of the woman. No such exception. 
   Secondly, I only had a little time to send this new language, because we did not see it until literally less than an hour ago, to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. I want to ask them if they believe this new language Senator SANTORUM is going to place into his bill, in fact, makes the whole issue clearer, whether or not it is still vague, vaguely describes a procedure that is used in the earlier terms, which is the second reason the courts have struck it down. The way partial-birth abortion is described--and that is a political term, not a legal term--the courts say applies to all abortions, regardless of whether they are in the first month, second, third, fourth, fifth, or sixth. So the court struck it down. 
   This is what Ann Allen, general counsel of the American College of OB/GYNs--those 40,000 physicians who bring babies into the world and, yes, if things go tragically wrong, may have to resort to this procedure--says:  
   Upon review of the attached language ..... in my opinion the language does not correct the constitutional defects of S 1692. In particular, this language does not correct the issues addressed by many states and federal courts, including the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, which have held similar legislation to be unconstitutional.  
   The Senator from Pennsylvania says he is reacting to the Eighth Circuit Court. The doctors at the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, through their general counsel, say it does not cure that problem. 
   I ask unanimous consent to print this letter in the RECORD during the debate.

   To sum up my feeling on this and the feeling of those of us who actively oppose the Santorum bill, we have no objection to the Senator amending his bill in this fashion, but we still believe very strongly that it doesn't meet the  constitutional arguments. It still doesn't do anything to protect the health of a woman, and it doesn't do anything to remove criminal penalties on physicians. 
   I hope we will get this moving forward. We will amend the bill the way the Senator from Pennsylvania wants. I hope we can get to a vote at some point, although I know Senator SMITH is still talking about an amendment. Senator LANDRIEU has a very important amendment. I hope when we can get this wrapped up, all of those things can be done, perhaps in the next hour or two. 
   I suggest the absence of a quorum.

It is very important that we make a statement today that the children of America will be protected, and the Senator from Pennsylvania said he views this amendment as opening our arms to unborn children. To me, this is opening our arms to children regardless of where they come from, so the children born in this country will get help.

Is he critical that the general counsel trusted her law degree, her reading of his bill, her understanding of the law, to come back with an opinion? It is hard for me to believe that.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, we finally have reached a point where the Senator from Pennsylvania and I have a strong agreement; we are urging everybody to read the record of this debate. I do hope the American people will read the record of this debate, and they will find out who stands for the mainstream view on the issue of a woman's right to choose and who stands for the extreme view on a woman's right to choose. The extreme view is overturning Roe v. Wade, which, from 1973, has protected the right of a woman to make a personal, private, moral, spiritual decision with her family, her doctor, her God, her advisers. 
   That is the mainstream view in America. That is the law of the land. The Senator from Pennsylvania is right that it is the law of the land because the Supreme Court found a right of privacy in the Constitution and said that, yes, women count. We have a right to privacy. So, please, read the record. 
   We voted on the issue of Roe v. Wade and by a thin, small margin--the vote was 51-48--we said don't overturn Roe. That is a dangerous vote. Forty-eight Members of this body want to criminalize abortion, make it illegal, go back to the days when women died--5,000 women a year. This is the first time this Senate in history has ever voted on that landmark decision, and 48 Senators don't trust women; 48 Senators want to tell women what to do in  a personal, private, religious, moral decision. 
   So, yes, I do hope the people of this country will read the RECORD because the RECORD is complete on this issue. We heard from the other side that we don't care about Roe v. Wade; we are not going to overturn it. We don't want to do anything about it. We just want to talk about this one procedure. And many of us on this side of the aisle said it is a smokescreen, and we tested it today. What did we find out? The leaders of this ban, which has been called unconstitutional by 19 courts, also voted to overturn Roe v. Wade. 
   I hope the families of America read this Record. It is very clear about who stands where. Let me tell you the difference between the two sides. It is not so much about how we feel on the issue because that is a personal matter. I have given birth to children--the greatest joy in my life. I have a grandson--a new joy in my life. I have one view; the Senator from Pennsylvania has another. Let me tell you the difference. It is who decides. I respect the right of the Senator from Pennsylvania to make that decision by himself with his wife, with his family. 
   He does not respect my right, or your right, or the right of anyone in America to be trusted to make that decision. He wants to tell you what to do. I didn't think we were elected to play God or to play doctor. I thought we were elected to be Senators. I thought we were elected to uphold the Constitution and the laws of the land. 
   Yes, this Record is full. It is important. It ought to be reflected upon. Our votes ought to be scrutinized. I agree with the Senator from Pennsylvania. Every word that was spoken here ought to be looked at. Every single time we engage in a conversation ought to be reviewed. I think it is important. 
   I also think it is important to understand that this modification that was sent to the desk--we had no objection to the Senator from Pennsylvania rewriting his law. That is his right. I don't have a problem with it. It does not do what the Senator from Pennsylvania says it does. The Senator from Pennsylvania says his new language addresses the objection of the Eighth Circuit and of the other courts that have ruled on his law that has been enacted in many States as unconstitutional on its face. 
   In the short period of time we have had to send out his new language, we have heard from the Center for Reproductive Law and Policy. The letter is in the RECORD. It says:  
   The proposal continues to preclude any procedure at any gestational age of a pregnancy. Court after court--including the unanimous Eighth Circuit--has held that such an approach unduly burdens the right to abortion.  
   That is the Center for Reproductive Law and Policy. 
   The general counsel of the Association of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the very group that deals with bringing life into the world, the very group of doctors we go to when we are ready to have our families and to help us have our families, says about this new language, upon review of it, that the language does not address the issues addressed by many States and Federal courts, including the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. 
   The Senator may say he has met constitutional objections. But those who deal with this law, who deal with it every day, say it does not.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, this letter is from Northwestern University Medical School signed by Marilynn Frederiksen, M.D., Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, who says:  
   I have reviewed Senator Santorum's amendment. It would apply to all second trimester procedures. It does not narrow the definition ..... [and] would effectively ban the safest and most common form of second trimester abortions.  
   I say to my colleagues, if you were looking for a fix on the constitutionality, it isn't here. 
   Again, I repeat that if you believe in the Constitution, if you believe in the right of privacy, and if you believe in following court precedent, a woman's health must always be protected. Under this law, as modified, the woman's health isn't even mentioned. 
   It is possible she could be paralyzed. All kinds of horrible things could happen. She could be made infertile. And, yet, no exception.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, this letter is from Stanley Zinberg, vice president, clinical practices, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecology. This is a new letter:  
   ..... I would like to clarify that there are rare occasions when intact D&X is the most appropriate procedure. In these instances, it is medically necessary.  
   The very words that some Senators said were not present in this debate are suddenly present in this letter. The doctors are telling us that the procedure that many Senators are voting to ban without making a health exception is medically necessary on certain occasions. 
   I will conclude with these remarks in the next few minutes by addressing something that has been very upsetting to me as a human being. Forget that I am a Senator. We have heard from people who would have to go through this procedure a series of stories that could break your heart. They decided, because they believed it was in their best interests, in the best interests of the fetus they were carrying, and in the best interests of their families, they decided after consulting their spiritual counselors that it was the right thing to do for their families. 
   The Senator from Pennsylvania wants to outlaw this option, this choice. But, worse than that, he calls these stories anecdotes. He says: Do not listen to anecdotes. But yet he cites his own experience and doesn't call it an anecdote. He calls it a tragedy. I have to say I hope we would apply the same kind of language to all Americans as we do to our own families. 
   These are stories. Let me share some with you. 
   Tiffany Benjamin: Genetic tests revealed that her child had an extra chromosome. Doctors advised her that her condition was lethal. No one could offer hope. They determined the most merciful decision for their child and the family would be to terminate the pregnancy. She says, ``Although three years have passed for us, the depth of our loss is vivid in our minds.'' She says to every Senator who would outlaw this procedure, ``We are astounded that anyone could believe that this type of decision is made irresponsibly and without a great deal of soul searching and anguish. These choices were the most painful of our lives.'' 
   Is that an anecdote? That is a true life experience of a woman who says to us, please don't ban a procedure that is medically necessary. 
   Coreen Costello, a registered Republican, describes herself as very conservative. She made it clear that she is opposed to abortion. She was 7 months pregnant in 1995 with her third child. She was rushed to the emergency  room, and an ultrasound showed something seriously wrong. The baby had a deadly neurological disorder, had been unable to move inside her womb for 2 months. She goes on. The doctors told Coreen and her husband that the baby was not going to survive, and they recommended terminating the pregnancy. The Costellos say this isn't an option for us: ``I want to go into labor.'' She said: ``I want my baby to be born on God's time. I did not want to interfere.'' 
   They went from expert to expert. And the experts told her labor was not an option. They considered a cesarean section. But the doctors said the health risks were too great. In the end, they followed the doctor's recommendation and Coreen had an abortion. She says now they have three happy, healthy children, and she since then has had a fourth. 
   She writes to us: ``This would not have been possible without the procedure.'' She says please give other women and their families this chance. Let us deal with our tragedies without any unnecessary interference from the Government. Leave us with our God. Leave us with our families. Leave us with our trusted medical experts. 
   I could go on and on with these stories, these real-life tragedies. They are not anecdotes. They are not stories that are made up. They are not rumors. They are real people who have gone through this. I daresay we ought to listen because they are people who count. They are telling us to stay out of their private lives. 
   Stay out. If anyone wants to make a decision about their family, please, that is their right. I would do anything in my power to fight for anybody's right not to have an abortion if that is their choice. I am as strongly for that. 
   However, I think it is an insult, an indignity, a slap in the face of the women and the families of this Nation for government to tell them what to do in these tragic moments.

   Mrs. BOXER. Yes, and I want to say in my State we have a law. A procedure done in the late term must be done inside a hospital. 
   We have received a letter from the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists who work in hospitals all over this country and have said this procedure that the Senator from Pennsylvania wants to ban is, in certain instances, medically necessary. 
   We have the most prestigious group of doctors from the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists saying banning this procedure is dangerous. That, in fact, even with the changes that the Senator from Pennsylvania made, it is so broadly worded it allows most abortions. There is still no health exception. 
   My friend is absolutely right. These procedures, and abortions in general, are done by physicians.

   Mrs. BOXER. Anyone who believes in the basic right to choose and the basic decision in Roe, which protected a woman's health, is opposed to this Santorum bill. 
   Let me read into the record a few groups, and I will not even name women's groups; I will name other groups: The American Public Health Association opposes this bill; the American Medical Women's Association opposes this bill; the American Nurses Association opposes this bill; the Society for Physicians for Reproductive 
   Choice and Health opposes this bill; the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists opposes this bill; and the Religious Coalition for Reproductive Choice opposes this bill. 
   I say to my friend, women's groups who support a woman's right to choose see this as chipping away at the right of a woman to make a decision with her God and her doctor and her conscience. They oppose it as well as the medical and religious groups.

   Mrs. BOXER. My friend is right. There is not one obstetrician or gynecologist in this Senate, yet we see the pictures used, the cartoon figures of a woman's body--which I find rather offensive. The bottom line is, we were not elected to be doctors, but we were elected, it seems to me, to be tough on crime and to stop crime and to do what it takes to protect our citizens. 
   My friend from New Jersey has been a leading voice in that whole area. I do not know how many months it has been since the Vice President broke the tie there, when my friend had a very important amendment up to close the gun show loophole so people who are mentally unbalanced and people who are criminals can no longer get guns at a gun show to shoot up kids and shoot up a school.

It goes against the basic right of privacy and the basic dignity of women and their families in their to make a personal decision. We see a lot of emotion to end those rights. But we do not see the same intensity of emotion--we do not even get the votes of those people--to make sure our children who are living beings, who are going to school, have the protection they deserve to have.

There are very few cosponsors, I might add, from the other side of the aisle. But it is a good law and would protect our children from hazardous waste and toxic waste and make sure our standards are elevated, because, when a child breathes in dirty air and soot and smog, et cetera, it has a much worse impact than it does on a full-grown adult.

I believe while I fight for them, I am fighting for their families, for the people who love them, their fathers, their mothers, their grandfathers, their grandmothers, and their children. 
   I think underlying all this debate is that basic difference between myself and the Senator from Pennsylvania; between the Senator from New Jersey and the other Senators on the other  side of the aisle. I think it is about basic respect of the women and the families of this Nation. 
   In concluding my remarks, because I know the Senator from Illinois has been waiting very patiently, I will conclude with a quote from three Justices. I ask my friend from New Jersey to once more listen to their words.

   Mrs. BOXER. I heard them yesterday. He said to me how touched he was by them. I think it would be suitable to quote them again, reminding everyone these are three Republican Justices of the Supreme Court. 
   In their decision upholding Roe v. Wade, this is what they said:  
   At the heart of liberty is the right to define one's own concept of existence, of meaning, of the universe, and of the mystery of human life. Beliefs about these matters could not define the attributes of personhood were they formed under compulsion of the State.  
   The Senator from New Jersey and I and those of us in this body who voted today to uphold Roe, and many of us who will vote against the Santorum bill, believe the State must not, should not be able to tell people in this country how to think, what to believe, and especially what to do for themselves and their families when it comes to a medical procedure. 
   I thank the Chair.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, we are going to vote shortly on the Smith amendment. 
   I tried very hard to work with my colleague. There is one very serious flaw in his legislation which I fear could escalate the violence at health care clinics all over this country. Now it is illegal in any way to sell fetal tissue. We all support that ban. We have voted on that ban. You cannot sell fetal tissue. 
   The Senator is concerned that this sale, nonetheless, is taking place. He wants certain disclosure as it relates to this issue. In the course of that, he has amended his legislation to deal with some of my problems by making sure that we can identify the woman who agreed to donate that tissue for research. It won't identify physicians. For that I am grateful. 
   The one area we couldn't reach agreement on had to do with the identity of the health care facility in which the woman had her legal and safe abortion. That will be subject to disclosure. Anyone could find out through a Freedom of Information request where that clinic is. 
   There have been 33 instances of violence against health care facilities since 1987. 
   I really am sad that the Senator from New Hampshire was unable to protect the confidentiality of these clinics. 
   I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, please protect the identity of these clinics. We don't want to have anyone calling up and finding out where they are. I am very fearful it could escalate the violence. We certainly don't want to do that unwittingly. 
   Thank you very much. I will be urging a ``no'' vote.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I will be brief. 
   The courts in twenty States have said the Santorum law that has basically been adopted in those States is unconstitutional. Senator SANTORUM, in an effort to fix his bill, sent up a modification to the desk which he believes has narrowed the definition of what he means by the term ``partial-birth abortion,'' which is not a medical term. 
   I have letters I have put in the RECORD from the obstetricians and gynecologists organization saying that, in fact, the new language doesn't do anything to narrow the definition; the same problem still holds. 
   This ban is so vague, it could impact all abortions. That is why the courts say it is wrong. There is no exception for the health of a woman. That also goes against Roe. And 51 of us voted in favor of Roe. I hope we will vote no. I believe at least 35 of us or so will do that. That will be enough to sustain the veto. I hope more of my colleagues will consider standing with the life and health of a woman and voting no on this legislation.

   Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, as my colleagues know, I have been urging the Majority Leader to schedule Senate debate and votes on two nominees for the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals --Marsha Berzon and Richard Paez. Judge Paez was first nominated 45 months ago. Ms. Berzon's nomination has been pending for almost 2 years. 
   I know that the Majority Leader supports the nomination of Glenn McCullough to the Board of Directors of the Tennessee Valley Authority. 
   I have no objection to voting on Mr. McCullough. I voted him favorably out of the Environment and Public Works Committee this week. 
   What I do object to is keeping the nominations of Judge Paez and Marsha Berzon from the Senate floor long after they have been voted out of committee. 
   So I have no problem with Senator LOTT's nominee, who has been waiting  for a Senate vote for two days--as long as Senator LOTT and the Republican majority also consider those who have been waiting years for a vote.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, for those who have followed this debate since it opened about an hour ago, you have heard that those of us who will fight on the floor of the Senate for moms, for our daughters, for their health, for their lives, are somehow evil and bad people. You have heard in this debate, in some of the most inflammatory language, which I think is, in essence, very dangerous for this country, that those of us who stand up to fight to make sure that every child is a wanted child, that every child who comes into this world is wanted and loved, that every woman has a right to be respected--you have heard that somehow we want to bring violence to children. You have heard the word ``executioners'' relating to doctors who take an oath ``to do no harm,'' who save lives, who bring babies into the world. Executioners. I am stunned by the tenor of the debate. I am troubled by the tenor of the debate. 
   The majority leader was sent a letter by a number of groups asking him to please not bring this issue up this week, could he wait a week. They noted that on Saturday, we will have the 1-year anniversary of the assassination of a doctor, Dr. Barnett Slepian, who was murdered in his home, through a window, by a coward who took this man from his family. The majority leader was told there have been five sniper attacks on U.S. and Canadian physicians who performed abortions since 1994. All of those victims were shot in their homes by a hidden sniper who used a long-range rifle. Dr. Slepian was killed, and three other physicians were seriously wounded in these attacks--for making sure that women had their legal rights protected and their health protected. 
   I think it is sad that we would have this debate, with the most inflammatory language I have ever heard on the Senate floor to date. I know the FBI and the Attorney General are going to be ever more vigilant because of this debate. I know that and I am glad about that. It is very hard for me to imagine that we could not have put this off a week. Here we are. And instead of having a debate that should be based on the merits of the discussion, it has been inflamed. 
   Yesterday, I said if 100 doctors walked into the Senate and sat down in our chairs to practice being Senators, they would be arrested and dragged out of here. Yet here we are in the Senate --100 of us, and not one of us an obstetrician, not one of us a gynecologist--deciding what procedures should or should not be used, and under what circumstances, in a matter that should be left to the medical profession, left to the families of this country, left to loving moms and dads. So here we are practicing medicine in the Senate and not even doing a very good job of it, I might say, if you listen to the physicians who have written to us on this matter. 
   I am going to place into the RECORD several letters from organizations consisting of physicians. Here is one from the Society of Physicians for Reproductive Choice and Health--the people my colleague has called ``executioners.'' 
   Ladies and gentlemen of the Senate and of this country, these are the people who bring our children into the world. These are the people who save their lives when they are hurt. These are the people we run to when they have to go to an emergency room. 
   This is the statement:  
   In what it claims as a tribute to mothers, the United States Senate today will vote on a bill criminalizing a procedure ..... 
   ..... legislators supporting this ban are not celebrating mothers--but, in fact, are dishonoring and condemning motherhood by placing pregnant women at greater risk for infertility and death.  
   These are the people to whom we turn when we are sick, and they are telling us not to pass the SANTORUM bill. They bring back the days before 1973:  
   Prior to abortion's legalization in 1973, the leading cause of maternal death in this nation was illegal abortion. As Congress attempts to ban abortion, procedure by procedure, more and more pregnant women will die. As physicians concerned about the health and lives of our women patients, we believe this is a shameful celebration of motherhood.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, we have a letter from the executive vice president of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. These are the men and women who bring life into the world. These are the men and women who deliver our babies. I find it interesting when the Senator from Pennsylvania talks about breach births--I had a breach birth; I don't think he ever did, and I know what it is. I know what the risks are. I am a mother of two beautiful children. I am a grandmother of one beautiful grandson, and I tuck him in and I read him stories and I love him. I want him to  grow up in a world where families are respected, where physicians are respected, where no one stands up on the floor of the Senate and calls a physician an executioner. I don't think that is a good country. I don't think that is respect. I don't think that brings healing to this issue. 
   The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists said:  
   [This bill] is vague and broad. ..... It fails to use recognized medical terminology and fails to define explicitly the prohibited medical techniques it criminalizes.  
   That is an important point. Bills just like this one have been ruled unconstitutional 20 times. One of those decisions was in the State of Arkansas, and I am going to share those decisions with you because I think it is important. So many of us say: local control, let the States decide. 
   The States have passed these laws, and not one of them yet has been proven constitutional or declared constitutional. But they have been declared unconstitutional because of what the doctors are saying--the language in this bill is so vague. And the language in all those bills is that they would, in fact, outlaw all abortion at any particular time during the pregnancy. 
   So when my colleague from Pennsylvania says, well, we don't want to overturn Roe v. Wade--and perhaps we will have a chance to vote on that as well--but when he says that, that is not what the courts are saying. The courts are saying his law does, in fact, make all abortions illegal and would criminalize abortion.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, there is a letter from the American Medical Women's Association. 
   Are these executioners, too? They work in the medical field. They say they are gravely concerned with governmental attempts to legislate medical decisionmaking through measures that do not protect a woman's physical and mental health, including future fertility, or fail to consider other pertinent issues such as fetal abnormality. And they strongly oppose governmental efforts to interfere with physician-patient autonomy.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, if someone wants to stand up here on the Senate floor and attack a whole part of our America, and if they want to use cartoons on the floor of the Senate to depict a woman's body, that is up to them. But I ask the American people to be the judge both of the substance of what is happening here, the techniques that have been used, and the inflammatory level of the debate. 
   I want you to meet a real person. I want to picture a real face--not a cartoon, but a real face--on the floor of this Senate. I want to tell a little bit about her story. 
   This is Tiffany Benjamin:  
   My husband and I waited until we established in our careers and could provide the best possible environment for a child. In 1994, we were thrilled with the news that we were expecting a baby. My first five months were joyous months of pregnancy. During a routine checkup my physician performed a standard AFT test. The results were abnormal. So my doctor ordered another test. Unfortunately, this test was also irregular. In my 20th week of pregnancy we discovered that our child had trisomy 13.  
   In plain English, each cell of her body carried an additional 13th chromosome. Doctors advised that her condition was lethal.  
   No one could offer us hope. Sadly we determined that the most merciful decision for our child--  
   Our child in our family--  
   would be to terminate my pregnancy. Although the years have passed, for us the depth of our loss is vivid in our mind. We are astounded that anyone could believe that this type of decision is made irresponsibly and without a great deal of soul searching and anxiousness. These choices were undoubtedly the most painful decisions of our lives. Please don't compound the pain of other families like ours by taking away our ability to make the difficult choices that only we can make in consultation with our physician. Please reject S. 1692 and protect our families from this dangerous legislation.  
   I ask you to look at Tiffany with her child. Does she look like an executioner to you? Does she look like someone who didn't want to have this child and suddenly woke up and said: I have changed my mind? No. This is a loving woman, a loving family member. She had to have this procedure, and this legislation would stop her from having it. 
   I want to tell you about another woman, Cindy, a 30-year-old mother of five living in Kansas City who said very proudly that she is a Catholic. 
   In June of 1998, Cindy noticed a lump on her neck and called her doctor. Within weeks, she found that she had thyroid cancer and, after surgery, began iodine radiation treatment. Contrary to medical protocol, she was not given a pregnancy test prior to the radiation treatment. Cindy's body did not respond to the radiation, and blood results indicated her body still contained the deadly disease. After returning to the hospital for another treatment, her blood was drawn for a pregnancy test, but the staff did not wait for the results; they gave her another iodine radiation pill. 
   Due to the radioactive iodine in her body, she was placed in an isolation room. No one could enter--not her husband, or her nurses, or her physician. 
   Two hours later, she received a phone call from her physician telling her they had made a terrible mistake. Her 
   pregnancy test came back positive. She immediately started drinking water because the doctors told her all she could do in an attempt to shield her baby from the radiation was to drink a lot of water. 
   The next day, a second pregnancy test confirmed the first and a sonogram was ordered. That is when Cindy and her husband learned that not only was she 13 weeks pregnant but she was expecting twins, the twins they had always hoped for. 
   Imagine the feeling of that family. Within hours, the family learned that their babies would not survive, not grow, not develop. The radiation her babies received was equivalent to the bomb dropped on Hiroshima. 
   Cindy says:  
   We decided that termination would be best for our family and our babies. Through our research, our insurance company told us, however, that we were on our own.  
   And she adds:  
   You see, as a Federal employee my insurance will not pay for elective abortions.  
   She says because this abortion was meant to preserve her health, because of the votes in this Congress, she could not get help. She says:  
   I have five little ones at home who depend on their mommy ever day. I didn't want to have an abortion but I needed one. And the abortion that I had would have clearly been banned by this bill, and I thank God that this bill didn't tie my doctor's hands.  
   Let me just say that again. This is a woman who is religious. This is a woman who says to us thank God that bill wasn't law, the bill that the Senator from Pennsylvania is fighting so hard to become law. She says thank God it wasn't the law. She says this is clearly an intensely private, torturous decision. 
   Are proponents willing to tie the hands of both parents and physicians and say to a woman: You must carry your child to term despite the fact that it has been determined the child won't live and your health will be affected? 
   I have to say that these women who are proud to come forward to help us in a very difficult issue deserve our thanks because here they are being called the worst names in the book, being essentially told that they don't love children, that they don't care about children, when in fact these are loving moms and, in many cases, quite religious. 
   This is the third time the Republican leadership has brought this bill before the Senate. Again, it is playing doctor without one obstetrician or one gynecologist among us. The obstetricians and the gynecologists say we shouldn't do this. The women who have had this procedure say we shouldn't do it. 
   We are going to have a lot more debate. I know my colleague from Illinois is here, and he has a very important piece of legislation to offer. But before I give up the floor this time, I want to talk about what has happened in the courts because my colleague from Pennsylvania has made a statement I think that is fairly dismissive of what has actually happened. 
   He says some of the courts have upheld this procedure and some have not. 
   I will discuss what the courts have done not because I am telling my colleagues to vote against their conscience; if they want to vote for something unconstitutional, that is their right. They ought to hear the arguments made in the 20 States in which this particular procedure has been called unconstitutional. 
   This chart shows which States have enjoined these bans. I put ``partial-birth abortion bans'' in quotes because there is no such thing. This is the political terminology. Nearly every court to rule on the merits of an abortion ban since the Senate last voted on the issue has ruled this abortion ban is unconstitutional. These are the States that have so far enjoined this Santorum-like legislation from going into effect: Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, Florida, Idaho, Illinois, Iowa, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Jersey, Ohio, Rhode Island, West Virginia, Wisconsin, and in Georgia and Alabama there has been limited enforcement. 
   We have a string of decisions. I will read quotes of judges from these States--and as so many of my colleagues have said, as our President has said, we ought to listen to the States. Let's hear what the State judges are saying when they have overturned these types of bans. 
   First, from a Federal judge in Arizona:  
   The term ``partial-birth abortion'' is not a term found in the medical literature.  
   Let me repeat that. The judge writes:  
   The term ``partial-birth abortion'' is not a term found in the medical literature. The testimony of witnesses at trial indicates that this term is ambiguous and susceptible to different interpretations.  
   The important point is, when my colleague from Pennsylvania says he only means it to be a handful of procedures, this particular judge, Judge Bilby in Arizona says no, the term is so vaguely worded it could apply to many other abortions, and that essentially would overturn a woman's right to choose. 
   In Arkansas, Judge Richard Arnold says:  
   As we shall explain, ``partial'' delivery occurs as part of other recognized abortion procedures, methods that are concededly constitutionally protected. Under precedents laid out by the Supreme Court, which is our  duty to follow, such a prohibition is overbroad and places an undue burden on the right of women to decide whether to have an abortion.  
   This is a judge in Arkansas saying the Santorum-type language is so broad and the procedure is so broadly explained it could, in fact, apply to any type of abortion. He ruled it unconstitutional. 
   In Illinois, U.S. District Court Judge Charles Kocoras, said:  
   First, the statute, as written, has the potential effect of banning the most common and safest abortion procedures.  
   He looked at the Santorum-like bill and said it also was unconstitutional. 
   U.S. District Court Judge Heyburn in Kentucky says:  
   By choosing words having a broader scope, the legislature moved from arguably firm constitutional ground--banning a very limited procedure use for late-term abortions--to a quagmire of constitutional infirmity.  
   There is a common thread among the judges--by the way, from very conservative areas of our country--who are saying the Santorum-type of ban is so broadly worded it would take away a woman's right to choose even at the early stages of pregnancy. 
   In Nebraska, Judge Richard Arnold says:  
   The law refers to ``partial-birth abortion'' but this term, though widely used by lawmakers and in the popular press, has no fixed medical or legal content. 
   It would also prohibit in many circumstances the most common method of second trimester abortions ..... under the controlling precedents laid down by court, such a prohibition places an undue burden on the right of women to choose whether to have an abortion.  
   For colleagues who say vote for Santorum; it doesn't take away a woman's right to choose, we have 20 court decisions that say it does. In certain States, they have stopped performing abortions because the doctor was afraid he would be arrested for performing an early-stage abortion. 
   In summing up, we were elected to be Senators. We have a lot of work to do. We weren't elected to be the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. They have their own organization. We should vote down this unconstitutional bill. If we do not--because I know this is political--why else would it be before the Senate? This is politics at its worst. This is the third time the President will veto this bill. We all know we will have the votes to sustain that veto. Why go through this if not for politics? 
   This is a debate we should not be having right now. It has been, unfortunately, in my view, very divisive so far. I hope we can get back on solid ground. Let Members not call people executioners; let Members not call families unimportant; let Members not demean women, and say the other side says the health of the woman is important. Yes, the health of women, the health of men, the health of families, that should be our paramount concern. We are not physicians. Within the context of the law, Roe v. Wade, which was decided in 1973, let Members make the decision as to what is best for our women, our families, and our children. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mrs. BOXER. I would make this statement. That this Constitution as it currently is--some want to amend it to say life begins at conception. I think when you bring your baby home, when your baby is born--and there is no such thing as partial-birth--the baby belongs to your family and has the rights. But I am not willing to amend the Constitution to say that a fetus is a person, which I know you would. But we will get to that later. I know my colleague is engaging me in a colloquy on his time. I appreciate it. I will answer these questions. 
   I think what my friend is doing, by asking me these questions, is off point. My friend wants to tell the doctors in this country what to do. My friend from Pennsylvania says they are rogue doctors. The AMA will tell you they no longer support the bill. The American Nurses don't support the bill. The obstetricians and gynecologists don't support the bill. So my friend can ask me my philosophy all day; on my own time I will talk about it.

   Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Chair.  
   Let me say, the Senator from Arkansas said the charge of government is to protect innocent life. We all want to protect every life. But when it comes to pregnancy, we do have a law that prevails in this country, which my friend may not agree with --I have a hunch he doesn't--called Roe v. Wade. It was decided in 1973. In that decision, the Court said when it comes to abortion, in the first trimester a woman has the right to choose, without any interference by the Government; and after that time, the States can regulate and restrict, but always the life of the woman and the health of the woman must be protected. That is Roe. That is, it seems to me, a very sound decision. 
   What we have in the Santorum bill is an out-and-out attack on that philosophy because there is no exception for health. 
   My friend from Illinois, Senator DURBIN, is trying to deal with that issue. I say to him, my compliments for working on his bill. 
   The bottom line for this Senator: I want to make sure if my daughter or anybody else's daughter is in an emergency situation, that the doctor or doctors do not have to open up the law books and decide whether or not they can do what is necessary to save the health and life of my daughter. 
   When one talks about innocent life, one must look at the faces involved. Here is a face of a beautiful young woman who wanted desperately to have children. I will tell her story later. She is an innocent person. Roe protects her; the Santorum bill leaves her out in the cold. 
   So the Senator from Pennsylvania can engage me in debates all he wants as to when I believe life begins and when I think a baby is born. To me, it is very obvious when a baby is born. 
   When it leaves the mother, it is born. That is pretty straightforward. 
   I would prefer to leave the medical emergencies to the physicians. I think they know. This isn't a Roe procedure we are talking about. This is a procedure that the American College of Gynecologists and Obstetricians supports. They say they need it in their arsenal when they work to protect a woman's life and her health. The American Nurses Association--I could go on and on. 
   At this time, I yield the floor and will come back to this as often as we have to until this debate concludes. 
   I know Senator WELLSTONE has something to offer to the debate.

   Mrs. BOXER. So the Roe v. Wade decision, as my friend has pointed out, in his words, was an ``elegant decision.'' And why does he say that? Because it did balance the mother's rights with the rights of the fetus. Because it said, previability, the woman had the unfettered right to choose and in the late-term the State could regulate. 
   Roe v. Wade was a ``Solomon-like'' decision in that sense. I again want to say to my friend, I greatly appreciate him offering this second-degree amendment to my amendment. I think it is important for us to support Roe v. Wade in this Congress. I think if we do, it will be a relief to many women and families in this country who are concerned that that basic right might be taken away because there are many people running for the highest office in the land who do not support Roe, who want to see it overturned, who might well appoint Judges to the Court who would take away this right to choose, which is hanging by a thread in Court as it is. So I, most of all, thank my friend for offering this amendment.

   I say to my friend that I thank him for sharing the story on the floor of the Senate. He has the photo of Kim and her husband up there. He read the story into the RECORD. I think it is very appropriate that the Senator from Iowa do so because this is a couple whom he knows. 
   I am, in a way, happy that my friend was not on the floor when the Senator from Pennsylvania used some very tough words in talking about this procedure and calling doctors who perform it executioners. 
   I say to my friend, in light of the poignant story he read to us, when he thinks of the doctor who helped this couple through a traumatic, horrific experience twice, what are his feelings about the doctor who performed that particular procedure?

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask my friend a final question. Will my friend be willing to read one more time, if he can find it, the statement that was made by Justices O'Connor, Kennedy, and Souter, all Justices appointed under a Republican President, when they made their statement on Casey because I really hope colleagues will listen to this. I think if they listen to it, they will vote for my friend's amendment to reaffirm Roe v. Wade and will also be against the Santorum underlying bill. 
   If my friend would repeat that, I would greatly appreciate it.

   Mrs. Boxer. Absolutely not.  
   So she said if the toe or foot is inside the baby, you can't kill the baby. But if the head is, you can. No slippery slope there, is there? No problems with a bright line there, is there? 
   We are headed down a very dangerous path if we start differentiating between what body part is outside the mother and what is inside the mother, as to whether an abortion is legal or not. The reason we have trouble differentiating is because this is not about abortion. This is about killing a baby. It is in the process of being born that under Roe v. Wade was protected. The Texas law was not stricken under Roe v. Wade that said you couldn't kill a baby in the process of being born. 
   Under Roe v. Wade, the seminal decision of the right of privacy, even that Court understood that once the baby is in the process of being born you should not be able to kill it. That is what we are saying. We are not restricting the right of Roe v. Wade. Roe v. Wade ruled on this by not striking that law down. 
   So fine, we are going to have a vote on Roe v. Wade. Fine, have a vote on Roe v. Wade. But this is not about Roe v. Wade. This is about infanticide. A lot of folks want to try to change the subject. They want to talk about these difficult cases. 
   Again, there is no one in this Chamber who sympathizes as much with these men and women, mothers and fathers, who dealt with a pregnancy gone awry. It is incredibly painful to have that hit your family. I hesitate to talk about it because I know how painful it is to revisit them. But they have brought their situation into the public square to prove a point. The problem is, it does not prove the point. 
   Again and again there is no medical reason. It is never medically necessary to do this procedure. So I hope we can get to the facts, that we can stay away from anecdotes that are inapplicable or not relevant; and we can get to, hopefully, from the other side, a factual discussion as to when this is medically necessary. Once I would like to see a peer-reviewed document where everyone examined the case and someone will say: You know what, there is a situation where this is medically necessary, where no other option is as safe or safer. 
   To date, that has not occurred. Let me underline that. To date, no such evidence has ever been put before the Senate. 
   Yet there are people who will stand here and say, ``We need it, we need it to protect the health of the mother,'' when there is not a shred of evidence, not a shred of evidence before the Senate, these stories aside. There is not a shred of evidence that suggests these stories, or all the other instances that have been brought up, were the most safe or there were not things as safe that could be used in place of a procedure that is infanticide. What we are hoping is we can get to that discussion. 
   I understand the process now; we want to play some games on Roe v. Wade. But that is not the issue before us. I cannot reiterate that enough. The issue before us is should this procedure remain legal. And it should be overturned. It should not remain legal. 
   It does not surprise me we are seeing smokescreens. 
   This is the Roe v. Wade smokescreen. We have the anecdote smokescreen. We can get the charts up about the previous attempts by supporters of this procedure. They have tried case after case to misinform the Senate. The advocates of this legislation, the abortion rights groups, have deliberately--and this is according to their own people now who have come clean--deliberately misled the Congress, deliberately lied, as Ron Fitzsimmons, who is a lobbyist for a great number, if not all, of the abortion clinics in America, said that he lied through his teeth and that the industry lied through their teeth. 
   Now after lie after lie--and I will go through all the lies--after lie after lie, they now are going to come up with new stories and say: Well, no, believe us now; OK, yes, we may have lied to you before, but believe us, health is really an issue. 
   There is not one shred of substantive evidence to support that claim--not one shred of substantive evidence. And yet, a group of people that has come to the Congress in opposition to this bill, they have lied in at least six cases, and, after those, we are now supposed to believe them when they have no evidence to support what they are asserting. 
   What are they? The National Abortion Federation called illustrations of the partial-birth abortion procedure ``highly imaginative and artistically designed, but with little relationship to the truth or to medicine.'' 
   You heard the Senator from California talk about the cartoons that showed how a partial-birth abortion is done, and proponents of the procedure argued early on: These are cartoons; they are not factual; they have nothing to do with how the procedure actually works, until Dr. Haskell publicly described this procedure at the National Abortion Federation meeting on September 1992. Dr. Haskell told the AMA News the drawings depicting partial-birth abortion were accurate ``from a technical point of view.'' Strike 1. 
   Argument 1: This does not occur; this thing is not factually correct; this is  not how partial-birth abortions are done; you are wrong. Strike 1. 
   By the way, they went even farther than that. Many of them argued this did not exist. First they said this is just a cartoon, these things do not happen at all, much less the drawings, but Dr. Haskell straightened them out. 
   Believe it or not, people actually came to committee meetings in the Capitol and suggested the anesthesia that is given to the woman during this procedure ensures the fetus feels no pain; in other words, it passes through and assures us the fetus does not feel any pain during this procedure. 
   Again, this is Dr. James McMahon, who is one of the originators of this procedure:  
   The fetus feels no pain through the entire series of the procedures. This is because the mother is given narcotic analgesia at a dose based upon her weight. The narcotic is passed, via the placenta, directly into the fetal bloodstream. Due to the enormous weight difference, a medical coma is induced in the fetus. There is a neurological fetal demise. There is never a live birth.  
   That was testimony before Congress under oath. When this happened, the American Society of Anesthesiologists went bananas. Why? Again, having gone through six births, one of the options available to women during childbirth is to receive a 
   narcotic to help with the pain. Women were justifiably very nervous about receiving a narcotic for pain that would kill their baby. One of the pain management procedures during childbirth is, in fact, the giving of a pain killer, a narcotic. 
   Immediately we got response from them and this letter later on:  
   In my medical judgment, it would be necessary in order to achieve neurological demise of the fetus in a partial-birth abortion to anesthetize the mother to such a degree as to place her own health in serious jeopardy.  
   The community of experts responded saying this is not true; you would have to give so much in the way of narcotics, you could jeopardize the life of the mother, which is certainly something I am sure no one on either side would like to do. 
   Lie No. 2: The baby does not feel any pain. The fact is that after 20 weeks, babies have developed nervous systems; they feel pain. In fact, some have suggested because their nervous system is, in fact, not in a full developmental state, they feel increased pain as a result of this procedure. As described by Nurse Brenda Shafer when she witnessed a partial-birth abortion, when that scissor was plunged into the base of the skull, when those scissors were rammed into the base of that skull, the baby's arms and legs shot out, similar to if you held a little baby and the baby thought it was going to fall; it would spasm out, and then the baby's arms fell limp and legs fell limp. 
   Again, in October of 1995, during this period of time after McMahon's testimony, ``the fetus dies of an overdose of anesthesia given to the mother intravenously.'' 
   Again we have Dr. Haskell, who is another one of these abortion providers--Dr. McMahon is one and Dr. Haskell; they are the two who do the most in the country--who says: Let's talk about whether or not the fetus is dead beforehand. 
   Haskell says: No, it's not. No, it's really not. 
   That is pretty clear. Again, people fighting this bill are putting information out that is not true. Why? To try to get support for this position. 
   Fourth: Partial-birth abortion is a rare procedure. 
   We had this debate the first time. We are in a very difficult situation because we have to rely upon the information of the abortion industry. When Senator SMITH, who is here, argued this debate 4 years ago, he had to deal with a deck that was stacked against him. He did not have the information we have today. 
   The organizations out there were saying--there were just a couple hundred of these--it was very rare, only done on babies who were sick and mothers whose health was in jeopardy or life was in jeopardy, but this was a very rare procedure. 
   This is the Alan Guttmacher Institute, Planned Parenthood, National Organization of Women, Zero Population Growth, Population Action International, National Abortion Federation, and a whole list of other organizations that wrote to Congress saying:  
   This surgical procedure is used only in rare cases, fewer than 500 per year. It is most often performed in the cases of wanted pregnancies gone tragically wrong, when a family learns late in the pregnancy of severe fetal anomalies or a medical condition that threatens the pregnant woman's life or health.  
   Lie. What is the truth? We have two sources outside of 
   the industry. By the way, we still do not know the truth. We do not know the truth because the folks who provide us with the statistics on partial-birth abortions are the very organizations that oppose the bill. How would you like to go into a courtroom and argue with a set of facts that is given to you by your opponents? That is what we have to do here right now. 
   Most of what we have to deal with certainly on this issue--the numbers--we have to take from people who vehemently oppose this bill. 
   We have one source of independent judgment. Our crack news staff on the Hill of which--let me look up in the news gallery: Gee, nobody is up there. Our crack news staff on the Hill, whom we have challenged time and time again to get the facts, why don't you ask a few abortion clinics how many of these they do. A couple of people have. I know a reporter for the Baltimore Sun did. Do you know what the abortion clinics said in Baltimore? ``None of your business; none of your business. We don't have to tell you.'' 
   Maybe some other crack staff, who really, I am sure, in their heart of hearts, want to get down to the bottom of this because I know they care deeply about this issue, will call around some of their communities and find out what the Bergen County Record did in New Jersey. 
   What did they find out? That at least 1,500 partial-birth abortions are performed each year, three times the national rate at one clinic in northern New Jersey.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I urge Senators to read the text. It was the Senator from Pennsylvania who talked about the feet. I talked about a baby and when a baby is born. 
   The Santorum amendment, just as his bill, is a direct overturning of Roe v. Wade, which gave women the right to choose in 1973. Before Roe, 5,000 women a year died because of illegal abortion. Now abortion is safe, and it is legal. Why don't we keep it that way? It is working. It is working for women and their families. It balances the rights of the woman with the rights of the fetus. That is why it says in Roe, in the beginning of a pregnancy, a woman has an unfettered right to choose, and later there can be restrictions. But this is where the Santorum bill steps over  the line. It makes no exception for the health of the woman. Senator DURBIN reaches to that issue. I commend him for his effort. 
   The fact is, if you make no exception for the health of the woman, you are overturning Roe; there is no question about it. And by using the term ``partial-birth abortion,'' which has never been in any medical directory in the history of medicine--it is a political term--it is so ill-defined that the courts have ruled it would in fact make most abortion illegal. 
   Listen to what some of the judges have said. In the State of Alaska: It would restrict abortion in general; in the State of Florida: This statute may endanger the health of women who might seek abortion; in Idaho: The act bans the safest and most common method of abortion used in Idaho and, therefore, imposes an undue burden on a woman. It goes on and on. 
   Nineteen States have said this Santorum language goes against Roe, endangers the life, the health--in particular, the health--of a woman. 
   I hope we will table the Santorum amendment.

   I am grateful we have been able to extend the debate on campaign finance reform at least a little bit because of this motion that has been made. On the other hand, it was our understanding we were going to be on campaign finance reform for 5 days. Sadly, we didn't have the expectation met that we would be 5 days on this particular matter. 
   I know the Senator from Michigan is here. I ask unanimous consent upon completing my remarks the Senator from Michigan be recognized.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, it is hard for me to understand why my friend objects, but that is his right to do so. 
   I wanted the Senator from Michigan to be heard because he is feeling very strongly this particular vote we are going to have is as important as the other two votes we took on the procedural matter of cloture. If Senators believe we should have campaign finance reform, they should vote against the motion to proceed to an abortion issue that truly should not be coming before this Senate. I will have more to say on why I believe that to be the case. The Senator from Michigan, Mr. LEVIN, I am sure, will get the time on his own accord at the appropriate moment. 
   As Members know, the Democratic side of the aisle was not going to object to going to the abortion issue--although many do not believe it is the right time to do so--we would not object to that and we would have been willing to go to that. It would have meant as soon as the debate was finished on that abortion issue, we would have gone back to campaign finance reform. Because of the parliamentary maneuver of the majority leader, Senator LOTT, we will not be able to go back automatically to campaign finance reform if we vote to proceed to the abortion question. 
   I make a case for voting against that. I think the best case to make is the issue we have been trying to debate for the last few days, the issue of campaign finance reform. 
   I stood on this floor last week and admitted, with all eyes upon me, I was a user of the campaign finance system, I was good at it, I was better at it than my opponents. I know how to use the system. I have been in Congress since 1983. I learned very well by making mistakes early in my career that Members need the resources in order to answer the charges that are thrown against them. 
   I say the system is broken for three reasons. One, the average person doesn't believe in this system. They have tuned out. They don't vote because they believe, rightly or wrongly, that it is the people with the money who are the people with the access who essentially control this agenda. They feel very left out of the system. 
   Second, there is an appearance of corruption. Everyone who partakes in this system plays the game that to many Americans appears to be corrupt. We all play it well. The system has the potential to corrupt, and the system, at a minimum, has the appearance of corruption. 
   Third, this system takes too much of our time away from our work, away from our jobs. 
   I see the Senator from New York. I am proud of the kind of campaign he ran. I know it was as hard for him as it was for me to raise the kind of money we raised. We are good at it. We know how to do it. It is not necessarily to our benefit to change the system, but we know how bad it is. 
   My friend from Minnesota, Senator WELLSTONE, and I were talking about dialing for dollars, when we are up and we are hoping no one is on the other end, hoping it is an answering machine so we can leave our message because it is so demeaning to have to call 
   total strangers we have never heard of --had 100,000 donors to my campaign; I didn't know the majority of those donors--to have to ask them for money. This is not why a Senator is elected. 
   The system is broken and needs to be fixed. People are not voting because they don't believe in the system. 
   What does the majority leader do after a couple of days of debate? He wants to take campaign finance reform out of here. He wants to take it off the Senate floor. I think I see a pattern emerging in the Senate Chamber which I don't think is particularly good for the American people. 
   Campaign finance reform, wheel it out the door tomorrow. 
   The test ban treaty, we had a majority vote for that. Wheel it off the floor. 
   Minimum wage, block it from ever coming. Lock the doors. We don't want to hear about minimum wage, even though we are in an economic recovery and the bottom economic class is not benefiting from it. The least we can do is raise the minimum wage a few cents an hour. We can't even get that through the door. 
   He doesn't want sensible gun control. We passed it over his objection. The majority party doesn't want it here. It was wheeled out the door, into a conference committee, never to be heard from again. How many more of our children have to die before we bring that back and vote in those sensible gun control measures? 
   The majority doesn't want real health reform. We passed a sham bill. The House passed a good one. How about going to conference, strengthening health reform so people can see the doctor they need to see, when they need to, that they can get the tests they need when they need the tests and they can live a good quality of life. No, that is shut out, wheeled out of here, never to be heard from again. 
   School construction, nowhere in the majority's bills; 100,000 cops on the beat, nowhere in the majority's bills; school construction to begin to fix up the school classrooms, nowhere here, out the door. 
   This is becoming a killer Congress--kill everything the people want, including campaign finance reform.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I find these articles interesting because they are editorials from two Republican newspapers in my State, the San Diego Union Tribune and the Bakersfield Californian. Normally I would not be reading their editorials into the RECORD because I usually do not agree with them, but I agree with them on this. Because I do not want to mention the name of any Senator, I will leave it out. The article from the San Diego Union Tribune says:  
   For all the fulminations about protecting the sanctity of free speech [this particular Senator] knows that special-interest money rules. In fact, he's altogether comfortable with a system under which the National Rifle Association shoots down gun-control bills, the oil lobby secures lower royalty payments, and the telecommunications industry benefits from legislation that lawmakers passed largely on faith.  
   This is pretty extraordinary for the San Diego Union Tribune. Of course Senator FEINGOLD has been on this floor daily, reading us this list of contributions and showing how it lines up with the legislation that is taken up on this floor. I assure you, the people who need an increase in the minimum wage are not making contributions to any of us, OK? I assure you they are not. They cannot. They can barely put food on the table. No wonder they cannot even get their bill heard. 
   Then the Bakersfield Californian says:  
   Opponents of the McCain-Feingold soft-money limit piously say the law would limit the ability to buy advertising, and hence limit politicians' freedom of speech.  
   And they say:  
   This from a minority of senators who are muzzling free speech on the bill?  
   That is interesting, by taking off the floor this bill for which a majority voted, they are muzzling us. That is why this vote tomorrow is so important. 
   I want to make a couple of points about the bill waiting in the wings to come back on this floor for the third time. It is called the partial-birth abortion bill. There is no such thing as a partial-birth abortion. Ask any doctor. This is a made-up term. It is either a birth or it is an abortion. But it is fiery language. It makes people think that a woman is waking up at the end of her pregnancy and saying: I have changed my mind. Nothing could be further from the truth. 
   What this bill is about is banning a procedure doctors say they need to save the life and health of the mother. The Senators want to come in here and play doctor and say what procedure can and cannot be used on my daughter and on everybody's daughter in the country. They are going to do it again, even though they do not have the votes to pass it over the President's veto, and even though across this country that ban has been ruled unconstitutional in 20 different states. 
   So we are going to throw out campaign finance reform to go to a bill that does not even belong here. This subject belongs at the medical schools and in the hospitals and clinics across the country. They are the folks who have to decide how to deal with a medical emergency in the late term of a pregnancy. 
   There is not one Senator in this Senate who favors abortion in the late term--not one. We have all voted for various bills to say no. What we do say is this: If it is an emergency to save the life of the woman, to spare her health, to keep her fertility so she can have other children, then it is up to a physician to decide. 
   We are going back to that bill. I will be debating it along with my colleagues. There will be various alternatives. But let's be clear, let's not pull any punches here; it is all about politics. They think it is an issue that gets them some votes out there. 
   I hope people will listen to the debate because I don't think people elected us to come here and be doctors. They go to the hospital to see a doctor, not a Senator, and they come to the Senate to hear Senators, not doctors. It is ridiculous. If 100 physicians walked in with their coats on and tried to evict us from our chairs, they would be arrested. But we come and we pass legislation telling doctors they are going to go to jail if they do something to save a woman's life or her health. Something is wrong. This does not belong here. 
   But we are going to go to this bill for the third time. The President will veto it for the third time. We will uphold his veto for the third time. We will talk about it for the third time, and we will protect the life and the health of the women in this country for the third time. 
   In the meantime, we are throwing off the Senate floor issues that can get through this Senate and can get a signature from this President: the minimum wage, 100,000 teachers, school construction, campaign finance reform. We can do it. We have a majority who believe in it. We can clean up the system. 
   I wish to say a special word about the Senator from Michigan. He has shown tremendous leadership on this issue over the years. He has seen this as a moment where we can stand our ground and keep this bill on the floor of the Senate. I look forward to his remarks as well as to those of the Senator from New York. I am proud to have voted for every campaign finance reform measure that ever came down when I was in the House. Even when I was on the board of supervisors in Marin County many years ago this subject came up. So it has been many, many years. Maybe now, with this vote tomorrow, maybe now we can get 51 people to say: Keep campaign finance on the floor.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, this is a letter signed by the National Abortion Federation, Planned Parenthood Federation, American Medical Women's Association, Medical Students for Choice, and the Executive Director of Physicians for Reproductive Choice and Wayne Shields, President and CEO, Association of Reproductive Health Professionals. 
   This is a serious letter. This letter points out this is the very worst time to go to this abortion bill. This letter points out that ``Saturday *.*.* will mark the one-year anniversary of the assassination of Dr. Barnett Slepian, who was murdered at his home *.*.*'' while he stood in his living room; ``*.*.* five sniper attacks on U.S. and Canadian physicians *.*.* since 1994.'' 
   I have to say this group is very concerned; this is not the time to bring up this bill. What is the rush to bring up this bill this week? Unfortunately--they sent this letter to Senator LOTT--from what I understand, they did not get an answer. They are saying:  
   Senator LOTT, on behalf of our physician members, and in the interests of the public safety of the citizens of the U.S. and Canada we urge you to reconsider the scheduling of a floor debate on S..1692.  
   That is the bill we are going to go to.  
   As you are aware, each time this legislation has been considered, extremely explicit emotional and impassioned debate has been aroused.  
   They write, and I think this is very serious, I say to my friends:  
   We have grave fears that the movement of this bill during this particularly dangerous period has the potential to inflame anti-abortion violence that might result in tragic consequences.  
   This is a simple request. Wait a week or two before bringing this bill to the floor. So I think it would be good if we didn't go to this bill right now. I am very willing to debate it any time, any day of the year, for hours. I will stand on my feet. I will talk about the women who had this procedure who might have lost their lives or their health had they not had it. It is not a problem for me. We are going to be able to sustain a veto with this President. But at least we should put it off for a week if we are being asked to do that. 
   For so many reasons, I hope we will not proceed to this abortion bill. If we do, we will be on the floor, we will talk about it, but I hope we will not go to it. I hope we will continue our work on campaign finance reform. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

    Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize Congregation B'nai Israel in Sacramento, California, and to celebrate its 150th year of vitality and service to the Sacramento community. 
   Congregation B'nai Israel was founded in 1849 by Moses Hyman and Albert Priest. At the time, Gold rush-era optimism was everywhere in northern California, attracting opportunity seekers from as far as eastern Europe, the home to millions of Jews desperate to escape violent pogroms and rampant anti-Semitism. With his profound ability to organize people and his unrelenting desire to help the destitute, Moses Hyman began his congregation in his home, and soon became known as a pioneer of California Judaism and father of Temple B'nai Israel. 
   Moses Hyman, a major community philanthropist, also founded the Hebrew Benevolent Society, which assisted the sick and poor, especially during the Sacramento flood of 1850. Following that devastating disaster, Hyman purchased burial land and a nearby house of worship from a Methodist Episcopal church. Moses Hyman and Albert Priest named their new congregation B'nai Israel, which translated into English, means ``Children of Israel.'' The rebuilt temple officially opened on September 2, 1852 as the first member-owned synagogue west of the Mississippi. 
   Congregation B'nai Israel has suffered through many hardships. After only a decade in existence, its synagogue was destroyed by fire, and only a year later, winter floods severely damaged cemetery grounds. The congregation was tested repeatedly. They mourned but then regrouped and rebuilt, emerging stronger than before. 
   By the mid-1900s, the congregation outgrew its existing facilities and launched a major effort to build a new synagogue. Thanks to the generosity of congregants, its capital campaign was a huge success. In addition to a new synagogue, the congregation added an education wing, later named after Buddy Kandel, in the early 1960s.  
   Congregation B'nai Israel continued to grow. The year 1986 marked additional milestones for what had become a community institution. In that year, the congregation began construction of the Harry M. Tonkin Memorial Chapel and the Sosnick Library. The much-needed addition not only led to a change in place of worship, but also an ideological change for the B'nai Israel. Tikkun Olam, the Jewish belief in repairing the world through good deeds and social action became a new found interest of the congregation, pushing further their desire to help others in the Sacramento area. 
   Members of Congregation B'nai Israel had suffered through tremendous hardship in their history, but nothing could prepare them for the events of June 18, 1999, when a fire bomber motivated by anti-Semitic hatred destroyed their library and severely damaged the sanctuary and administration building. In an inspiring gesture of solidarity, the entire Sacramento community joined with the congregation and collectively vowed not to let violence tear Sacramento apart. 
   In a historic event less than three days after the bombing, more than 4,000 Sacramento residents joined congregation leaders at a unity rally to protest religious and ethnic violence. Former president of the Interfaith Service Bureau, Rabbi Bloom, called for the creation of a museum of tolerance to battle against the tide of hatred. 
   Mr. President, despite all kinds of adversity, Congregation B'nai Israel has survived for 150 years and has grown into a vital and beloved community institution. I send my congratulations and personal thanks for all it has done to help a diverse community find common ground in the Sacramento area.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I support the conference agreement on appropriations for fiscal year 2000 for the departments of Veterans Affairs, Housing and Urban Development, and other independent agencies. 
   I thank Senator MIKULSKI and Senator BOND for their hard work and commitment to providing adequate health care for our veterans and housing for our citizens. 
   The conference agreement provides $19 billion for veterans health care, $1.7 billion more than the President requested. I am pleased that Congress has made a commitment to take care of our veterans. I do wish that we had agreed to Senator WELLSTONE's amendment to provide $20.3 billion, but I believe that our nation's veterans will be cared for under this legislation. 
   Mr. President, I am very pleased that housing needs will also be addressed with this legislation. First, the agreement provides a much needed 60,000 additional Section 8 vouchers. A far greater need for vouchers exists in California, let alone across the nation. But this is a much acknowledged vital step in the right direction towards addressing the housing needs for the poorest of Americans. Second, public housing, Housing for Persons With AIDS (HOPWA), and homeless assistance programs will all experience an increase in funding. Third, the agreement also provides additional tools for preserving existing affordable housing. Specifically, HUD will be provided with significant new legal authority to address the Section 8 ``opt-out'' crisis--including longer contract renewal terms. Last, the agreement exhibits strong support for HUD's Community Builder program. This program has been a key component of HUD's reinvention efforts and is working. I received numerous letters from elected officials and nonprofit organizations throughout California expressing support for the Community Builder program and am grateful that the conference committee agreed to reinstate earlier cuts to the program. 
   The conference agreement also addresses other key areas, such as the environment and space exploration and research. The Environmental Protection Agency will receive $7.59 billion to carry out its important functions. The National Aeronautical and Space Administration is funded at $13.65 billion. I am pleased that the conferees agreed to restore the drastic cuts in NASA programs that were in the House version of the bill.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I oppose the large increase in defense spending called for under the fiscal year 2000 Department of Defense Appropriations bill. The final conference report increases defense spending by $17.3 billion over last year's bill--$7.2 billion of  which is declared as emergency spending and will come straight out of the surplus. At a time when Congress is slashing many important domestic programs, I cannot support an increase of this magnitude. 
   I do, however, want to express my strong support for the many good provisions that were included in this legislation. This bill includes funding for a needed pay raise of 4.8 percent for our military men and women and targeted bonuses to enhance recruitment and retention efforts. I was also pleased to see that the bill restores full retirement benefits for our personnel. 
   Nevertheless, I think it would have been possible to include these important provisions without substantially increasing the defense budget. The Department of Defense need only to look within to find these savings. 
   In January, the General Accounting Office found that auditors could not match about $22 billion in signed checks with corresponding obligations; $9 billion in known military materials and supplies were unaccounted for; and contractors received $19 million in overpayments. In April, a GAO study found that the Navy does not effectively control its in-transit inventory and has placed enormous amounts of inventory at risk of undetected theft or misplacement. For fiscal years 1996-98, the Navy reported that it had lost over $3 billion in in-transit inventory, including some classified and sensitive items such as aircraft guided missile launchers, night-vision devices, and communications equipment. 
   This bill also includes many unneeded items. In an effort to provide some fiscal responsibility to the defense budget, I offered an amendment to this bill that would have denied the Air Force the ability to lease six leather-seated Gulfstream executive jets for the regional commanders in chief (CINCs). Even though the military has hundreds of operational support aircraft, the main argument against my amendment was that leasing the Gulfstream jets would be cheaper than purchasing the jet favored by the CINC's--the more expensive Boeing 737s. 
   However, the final conference report not only includes the authority to lease Gulfstream jets, it also includes a $63 million Boeing 737 for the CINC of the Central Command. A recent article in Defense Week provides the details on how this unrequested jet was added to the bill.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, our men and women in the armed forces do a great job. From Kosovo to Korea, they prove that they are the best fighting force in the world. They deserve the pay raise and other important benefits that they have earned. 
   However, I cannot support the irresponsible spending that is included in this legislation and it is with regret that I must vote against it.

   Mrs. BOXER. I appreciate that, and I am sure my friend will find added comments after he listens to mine.  
   Mr. President, I want to start off by thanking Senators MCCAIN and FEINGOLD for their leadership on this issue. It is nice to see this cooperation across the aisle. I like it. It is healthy for the system, it is good for the system, and we gain more respect as an institution when we work together as opposed to constantly being on opposite sides. People get suspicious; they say: Why is it they always are fighting each other? This is good, and the subject is so important and gets right to the heart and soul of who we are as a people. 
   I also point out that it is very difficult around here to challenge the status quo. Some of us saw Senator MCCAIN getting fairly well grilled this morning. It is every Senator's right to grill another Senator. But it is very lonely sometimes to take on the status quo. 
   I have noticed in all my years in politics--and it has been a long time--what a legislature likes to do most is 
   nothing, because it is easy, because if you keep it the same, you do not make waves, you do not disturb anybody, and it is comfortable. Certainly campaign finance reform is comfortable for many of us who have been in this for a long time. 
   Ever since I have been in politics, I have been supporting reforms in campaign finance. I have been in politics, in elected office, for 23 years. That is most of my adult working life. I started in local politics. It was an issue then. Then I went to the House in 1983. It was an issue then, and it has been an issue in the Senate during the 7 years I have served. 
   It is fair to ask: Why is Senator BOXER in favor of the most far-reaching campaign finance reform we can get? I can sum it up with three main reasons. Maybe there are 10 or 12, but I want to give the Senate the three main reasons. 
   First of all, the system is bad for ordinary people; and I will expand on that. Secondly, the system has the appearance of corruption; and I will expand on that. And thirdly, the system is stealing precious time from public officials who are elected to do a job; and I will expand on that. 
   First, the system is bad for ordinary people. Let me tell you why. Ordinary people feel disenfranchised. Ordinary people who cannot afford to make contributions to campaigns feel left out. Even if they were wrong on that--and I would tell people in my State, regardless of whether they make a campaign contribution or not, they are important to me. We all say that, and we mean that. They do have the vote. They are important to us. They do not believe it. They do not believe they count. They believe the people who count are the people who give $100, $500, $1,000--soft money contributions. 
   How do we know they feel this way? They have shut us out. They do not believe us when we talk. They believe we are motivated by people who give us the big dollars, and, sad to say, they are not voting. I look at the turnout of voters, and it is sad when we see in many elections 25 percent of the electorate votes, 40 percent of the electorate votes, and there are people all over the world literally dying to stand in line to vote in countries that are struggling to get the franchise. Ordinary people feel left out. That is a danger. 
   Secondly, the system has the appearance of corruption. Let me talk about the fight I waged on oil royalties. I do not know anyone who stood up in that debate who did not believe big oil companies were not paying their fair share of royalties. 
   Everyone agreed; even the key opponent of my perspective that we ought to do something about it said it is true, they are not paying their royalties. I know it to be the case when the person who stands up on this floor, whoever that might be--and in another case it could be me; in this case it was another Senator--and fights for the status quo for one particular industry and the newspapers write a story that that individual got more money from that industry than anyone else; even if the motives were as pure as the driven snow--and I have no reason to believe otherwise--people lose faith. They do not want to believe us if we stand up and fight for an industry and we are the biggest recipient of the industry's funds. 
   We are not talking about a thousand bucks; we are talking about big bucks. The appearance of corruption, if I may use the word, is out there. 
   I don't care what Senator, on either side of the aisle, stands up and stamps his or her foot and says: That's a terrible word. Don't use it; the appearance of corruption is out there. Maybe you don't think so, but ordinary people think so. We know it. It is another reason they are turned off. It is another reason they do not vote. 
   And the third reason: The system is stealing precious time from elected officials. Look, let's be honest. A person who comes from California, who takes the oath of office, would have to raise $10,000 a day, 7 days a week, for 6 years, in order to have the resources to run for reelection. 
   Let me repeat that--for 6 years, $10,000 a day, 7 days a week, in order to have the assets that are needed to run for reelection in California, where there are 33 million people and the highest TV rates in the country. 
   How do you think that happens? Do you think that individual in the Senate can possibly do all that and still do the best job that she can do? It is impossible. 
   Let me make a confession on the floor of the Senate. Having run for the Senate twice from that great State, I did every single thing I could to raise as much money as I could within the law. I don't want anyone to think I am holier than thou because I am not. If I was, I would have said: I'm not going to take the PAC money. I'm not going to ask people for soft money. I'm going to demand they take the issues ads off when they help me. 
   I am not holier than thou. I am a user of the system, and the system is wrong. I think the Senators from California who know what it is like to do this in some ways have more credibility than Senators from small States to talk about the evils of this system. The system is broken, and we have to clean up our act. It is very simple. 
   I am willing to do it in a baby step, which is what I consider this stripped-down bill to be, or I am willing to do a much larger step, which I think Shays-Meehan is in the House. I like it better. I will do what it takes to get something out of this Senate that speaks to reform. 
   Soft money, unlimited dollars, it does not matter what it is. It could be any amount going to the parties. Did it help me? Oh, yes. It helped me a lot. In some ways, I was in a better position than my opponent. He spent a fortune. I was able to raise more. 
   Why am I standing here? I know how to work the system. I have been at it a long time. It is in my benefit to keep it the way it is. Even a well-heeled opponent that I had and I faced, with all the support of the Republican Party, could not go toe to toe with me because I know how to work the system. But the system is broken, and we have to clean up our act. We have a chance to do it. 
   I hope people in this Senate who know this system inside out will do what they can to change it. Doing away with soft money is a step in the right direction. Do we need other steps? You bet we do. 
   We need to expand disclosure requirements, and I am going to read Senator MCCAIN's amendment with great interest. It seems to me we can do that in this bill because many times the special interests will wait until the last minute to dump big money into their candidate's campaign, hoping it will not be found out until after election day. With the computers the way we have them today, we ought to 
   be able to know it pretty much on a real-time basis. 
   We need to ensure that these issue ads become a thing of the past. What a phony deal that is. That is as much an ad as the ad I put on for myself. How is this for an issue ad? ``Senator X has just cast a vote against a particular bill. It is a disaster for our country. Call Senator X and tell her she is wrong.'' That is an issue ad? No. That is a personal attack. 
   ``Senator Y has supported a bill that is going to hurt our country's economy. Call Senator Y. Here are the three reasons he is wrong on that,'' and you mention the Senator's name over and over. By the way, you can even show the Senator's face. 
   That is not an issue ad. That is a direct attack ad. Was it done against my opponent? Yes, it was. Was it done against me? Yes, it was. It is uncontrolled. It brings in other issues that  the two candidates themselves do not even want to talk about. It unbalances the whole debate in the campaign. It has to be a thing of the past. 
   ``Free speech,'' my colleagues say on the other side. I will tell you, I never heard anyone more eloquent on the point than the Senator from Kentucky. The Supreme Court was divided 5 to 4 on the issue of free speech. I tell you, they are wrong because when you say money equals speech, you are demeaning the Constitution; you are demeaning this democracy. 
   How is it free speech if candidate A is a billionaire and can buy up every inch of time on the TV and the radio and the other candidate, candidate Y, is a poor candidate and has to go raise money? By the time he gets the money, he goes to the TV stations and the radio stations, and they say: Oh, sorry, candidate Y. There is no time left for you to buy. That is an infringement on his speech. 
   I had an interesting situation at the end of my last campaign. A lot of money came in toward the end of my campaign. I sent it over to the TV stations. I just got it back with a big refund. By the time we got it over there, there was no more time. 
   So how do you say that money equals speech if one candidate has it; the other one has a harder time getting it, and they cannot get the prime time? This speech argument is a debasement of everything that I believe in. I believe that our Founders would roll over in their graves if they knew that when they fought and died for free speech, it now means money, and you cannot tell a wealthy candidate you can only put X into your campaign, because it is a violation of free speech. But what about the poor candidate? He does not have the money. What about his speech? 
   So this argument on speech, to me, is nonsensical. I am one of these people who believe the Supreme Court ought to take another look at that Buckley v. Valeo because I think it is off the wall. 
   So here I am standing in front of my colleagues admitting that I have used this system to the ultimate, that I have benefited from it because I understand it, that I am good at it. I have had, in the course of my campaigns, thousands and thousands and thousands of contributors. There is not a day that goes by that I do not thank them for their support because I would not be here; I could not have gotten my message out. But they understand, in their heart of hearts, and one of the reasons they wanted me to be here, I will stand up and fight against this system. 
   So I am doing it again in the hopes that maybe this time, with this stripped-down bill, we can pick up enough votes from the other side of the aisle to ensure that we will have some reform. 
   I beg my colleagues--we have had some bitter debates, very partisan debates, and it has not been a pretty thing to watch--maybe we can make this a pretty thing to watch. So far it has been kind of contentious. 
   In the end, if we can get the 60 bipartisan votes to shut off debate, maybe we will get a bill, maybe we can be proud of something we did in this Congress. They did it in the House. 
   I urge my colleagues, let us follow the lead of Senators MCCAIN and FEINGOLD. Let us reach across the aisle, do something right for the people, restore their faith in this system. Maybe they will start voting again and feel good about who we are and, frankly, about this country, if they think we are moving toward a truer democracy. We have a chance to do it. I hope we will. 
   I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, as a Member of the Foreign Relations Committee I sat through the day of hearings. And even in that short time--and I know you and I were there together--I was thoroughly convinced that our country will be more secure if we sign on and we ratify this treaty than if we do not. 
   I think we have a very stark choice. We can continue to lead the world in stopping the spread of nuclear weapons by supporting this treaty or we can start a nuclear chain reaction by opposing it. I pray that we will support this treaty. 
   As I said in the committee, when I was a child in grammar school--and I think a lot of you might remember this--America faced a real threat of nuclear war. In my public school we had emergency drills. We were taught that if we hid underneath our desks and we covered our eyes and we turned away from the windows, we would survive a nuclear strike. We were taught that the wood from our desks would save us from the massive destruction caused by a nuclear weapon. We also were made to wear dog tags around our necks. We were so proud of that. We thought we were being just like the people in the Army. We didn't realize the true purpose of the dog tag was so that someone could identify our body after a nuclear strike. 
   The kids in my generation really didn't know that much. But the kids in later generations certainly did. When I was in the House, Congressman George Miller set up a Select Committee on Children, Youth, and Families. One of our first hearings was on the impact of the nuclear disaster that was looming ahead of our children. So we had testimony from children that they feared for their lives. I do not want to go back to those days when the children of the 1980s feared a nuclear strike, or my days, when we feared a nuclear strike. 
   I have heard the concerns raised about the treaty. And, as I see it, the two main arguments against the treaty are verifiability and the condition of our stockpile stewardship program. 
   So like most Members of the Senate, I look at what the experts say on these two issues. Last week, the Secretary of Defense testified on the verification issue. He said, ``I am confident that the United States will be able to detect a level of testing and the yield and the number of tests by which a state could undermine our U.S. nuclear deterrent.'' 
   The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, General Henry Shelton testified, ``The CTBT will help limit the development of more advanced and destructive weapons and inhibit the ability of more countries to acquire nuclear weapons. In short, the world would be a safer place with the treaty than without it, and it is in our national security interests to ratify the CTBT treaty.'' In fact, four former Chairmen of the Joint Chiefs who served under the Carter, Reagan, Bush, and Clinton administrations have come out in favor of the treaty. 
   On the condition of our nuclear stockpile, I turned to the directors of our three national laboratories. They all support ratification of the CTBT saying ``we are confident that the Stockpile Stewardship program will enable us to maintain America's nuclear deterrent without nuclear testing.'' 
   I've also received a letter from 32 physics Nobel Laureates in support of the CTBT. In discussing the stockpile issue, they write,  
   Fully informed technical studies have concluded that continued nuclear testing is not required to retain confidence in the safety, reliability and performance of nuclear weapons in the United States' stockpile, provided science and technology programs necessary for stockpile stewardship are maintained.  
   Let me also point out that the Senate has passed an amendment to the resolution of ratification stating that if ``the President determines that nuclear testing is necessary to assure, with a high degree of confidence, the safety and reliability of the United States nuclear weapons stockpile, the President shall consult promptly with the Senate and withdraw from the Treaty.......in order to conduct whatever testing might be required.'' 
   If our stockpile is not safe and reliable, the President will withdraw from the treaty. There doesn't have to be a Senate vote. It's not going to get bogged down in rules of the Senate. If there is a supreme national interest in withdrawing from the treaty, we will withdraw. 
   I also think it is important to look at the risks of not going forward with this treaty. How can the United States tell Pakistan, India, and China not to test their nuclear weapons if we don't ratify this treaty? How can we go to our friends and say, don't give Iran the technology to produce weapons of mass destruction? I fear that our failure to ratify this treaty will set off a nuclear ``chain reaction'' throughout the world that the United States will long regret. 
   An editorial in the San Francisco Chronicle puts it best in saying ``A global treaty that invites every country to step forward or face condemnation is the only way to corral nuclear danger. If the world feels hostile and uncertain now, wait five years without the ban.'' 
   We can turn it around today if we vote for this treaty. I think there are many protections in it which allow the President, any President, to say: We should go back to testing.  
   I yield the floor.

    Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, on the occasion of his retirement as executive director of the Los Angeles World Airports, LAWA, I would like to recognize the important contribution Jack Driscoll has made to the City of Los Angeles and to the economy of Southern California over the past seven years. 
   Jack Driscoll was appointed executive director in December of 1992. His record of accomplishment can best be shown in the outstanding quality of management and development at the city's four airports: Los Angeles International, LAX, Ontario International, Palmdale Regional, and Van Nuys. 
   Under Mr. Driscoll's financial management, LAWA has increased its operating income by an overwhelming 329 percent through the combination of reorganization, streamlining measures, and renegotiating contracts with airport tenants. Revenues from non-aviation sources, including updated concessions and new vendor contracts, have nearly equaled revenues from aviation sources. In fact, leading investment rating agencies have rewarded LAX with their highest ratings for a stand-alone airport. 
   Even in adversity, Mr. Driscoll worked to maintain quality in service and operations. He was at the reins of LAWA during a major dispute between the City of Los Angeles and the airlines over landing fees. During litigation at LAX, he revived the dormant, 12-year-old plans to build new terminals at Ontario International Airport. With Mr. Driscoll's direction, this $270-million project was completed four months ahead of schedule and $26 million under budget. These new terminals put ONT in position to bring regional solutions to meet Southern California's ever-growing air transport needs and made it the only airport in the region with new facilities to do so. 
   In addition, Mr. Driscoll initiated the LAX Master Plan, a long-term process to guide development of LAX to meet air passenger and cargo demands for the next 20 years. Since 1992, LAX has become the third busiest passenger airport in the world and the second busiest air cargo airport in the world. 
   To offset this growth, Mr. Driscoll committed LAWA to undertake major noise reduction and management programs, including nearly $500 million in programs for residential soundproofing  and compatible land-use; recycle water programs; and a variety of clean air programs, including alternative-fuel vehicles and traffic mitigation. All of these programs have received awards from environmental organizations and regulatory agencies for outstanding achievement. 
   I wish Jack Driscoll well and thank him for his contribution towards improving Southern California's aviation gateway.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I know my colleague from Missouri is going to speak, as will others. But I did want to follow the great Senator from Vermont, Mr. PAT LEAHY, who has done such an admirable job as the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee in fighting for fairness. If you listen to his remarks carefully, what he is basically saying is: Bring to the floor of the Senate the nominees who have been voted out of the committee; let's debate them; let's talk about them; let's talk about their merits. If you have a problem with them, put it out there. But let's vote. That is the least we can do for these good people. 
   Every single one of these people who have gone through the committee, has a current job. When they were nominated, and especially when they were voted out of the committee, they assumed they would be going to a new job, to be a judge. They had every reason to assume that because a good vote out of that committee--getting the support of Senator HATCH and usually one or two or three more on the Republican side, and all the Democrats--means you had the votes to get to the floor of the Senate. 
   As my friend has pointed out, it is very sad. We have had some bad situations develop. I was very hopeful, in this new round of approvals we have gone through--and I am grateful for the fact we have moved a few judges through--I was hopeful we would break the logjam with Judge Richard Paez and with Marsha Berzon, for several reasons. 
   One, they are terrific people. They would make great judges. They were voted out of the committee several times. They deserve a vote. They have loving family members. I have had the wonderful opportunity to meet their families: In the case of Richard Paez, his wife and children; in the case of Marsha, her husband and children. They are waiting for something to happen. This is not fair. 
   So while I am glad we are moving some court nominees--I am pleased we are doing that--I think we need to do more in the interests of the country. We need to do more. In the interests of fairness to these people, we need to do more. 
   Let me go into a few details about Richard Paez. Currently, he serves on the Federal bench as a district court judge in the Central District of California. He was first nominated by President Clinton to the court of appeals on January 25, 1996. Seven months later, on July 31, 1996, the Judiciary Committee finally held a hearing on Judge Paez' nomination. 
   Let me point out something. This is the same Judge Paez who came right through this Senate when we supported him for district court. So he is not a stranger to the Judiciary Committee. He is not a stranger to the Senate. We already approved him when he was nominated and took his seat on the district court. So here we have a situation where it took him 7 months to get his first hearing and then the Senate adjourned for the year without having reported the nomination. That was 1996. 
   Now we get to 1997. The President nominates Judge Paez for the second time. On February 25, the Judiciary Committee held a second hearing on the nomination. That was 1997. 
   On March 19, 1998, 1 year and 2 months later, Judge Paez' nomination was finally reported by the Judiciary Committee to the full Senate. But in the 7 months following, the Senate failed to act on the nomination, and it adjourned with that nomination still on the Executive Calendar. 
   Again, this year, for the third time, the President nominates Richard Paez to the Ninth Circuit Court. May I say, there are several vacancies on that court, more than half a dozen. So we are looking at a court that is not running at full speed. When there are 28 members is when they are completely full. Now they have all these vacancies. So the nomination is reported favorably by the Judiciary Committee on July 29 of this year, but again the full Senate has failed to act. 
   So it brings us to this day, where we have a little bit of a breakthrough. We are going to move forward five judges. I am glad we are doing it. But we have to be fair and look at this terrific judge, Judge Richard Paez. 
   I think we have an obligation to him and his family, and frankly, to the President, who is the President who has nominated this gentleman several times. 
   Sure, if the shoe was on the other foot and we had a Republican President, I do believe my colleagues would be saying: Give us an up-or-down vote. I do not think that Richard Paez, the wonderful human being that he is, deserves to be strung out by the Senate--3 1/2 years strung out. I cannot understand why. I looked back through the record, and there is no one else who has been treated like this. 
   I say to my Republican friends, we do not know who has put a hold----

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I thank my colleague. I will try to finish in 5. I have not gotten to Marsha Berzon yet. 
   We are setting a record of which we should not be proud. This man has been strung out for 3 1/2 years. He is a good man. He has a solid record, and we have an obligation to him and his family, the members of the legal and law enforcement communities, to the judicial system itself, and to the Latino community that is so very proud of him. Again, the Senate approved him to the district court. He has served with distinction there. 
   Judge Paez not only served in the district court, but he also served 13 years as a judge on the L.A. Municipal Court, one of the largest municipal courts in the country. He is such a leader that his colleagues elected him to serve as both supervising judge and presiding judge. 
   His support in the law enforcement community is pretty overwhelming. The late Sheriff Sherman Block of Los Angeles, a Republican, supported him. He is supported by Sheldon Sloan, the  former chairman of the judicial selection committees for both Senators Pete Wilson and John Seymour. 
   He is supported by Representative JAMES ROGAN, who was his colleague on the municipal court. Those who know me and JAMES ROGAN know we do not agree on a lot of things. We agree on Judge Paez. 
   He is supported by Gil Garcetti, district attorney for Los Angeles. 
   All these people have written wonderful things about him. 
   James Hahn, the Los Angeles city attorney, says ``his ethical standards are of the highest caliber.......'' 
   Peter Brodie, president of the Association of L.A. Deputy Sheriffs, a 6,000-member organization, wrote to Chairman HATCH in support of Judge Paez's nomination. 
   The commissioner of the Department of California Highway Patrol says that ``Judge Paez ..... [is very] well qualified,'' and ``his character and integrity are impeccable.'' 
   We have a good man here. Let's vote him up or down. I know the Senate will vote him in. I know that. I have not only spoken, I say to my friend from Vermont, to Democrats, but I have spoken to Republicans who intend to support him. So he will win that vote. 
   The second nominee, Marsha Berzon, is another example of a longstanding nominee who is being denied a vote by the full Senate. 
   In 1998--Senator LEAHY laid it out--she received an extensive two-part confirmation hearing, written questions, written answers, and she extensively answered every question of the committee. In 1999, she was favorably reported out of the committee. 
   Again, she is so well qualified. Marsha Berzon graduated cum laude from Radcliffe College in 1966, and in 1973, she received her Juris Doctor from UC Berkeley, Boalt Hall Law School, one of the greatest law schools in the country. 
   She has written dozens of U.S. Supreme Court briefs and has argued four court cases before the U.S. Supreme Court. She has had extensive experience appearing in Federal appeals courts, and it goes on and on. 
   She has received significant Republican support. Former Republican Senator James McClure of Idaho says:  
   What becomes clear is that Ms. Berzon's intellect, experience and unquestioned integrity have led to strong and bipartisan support for her appointment.  
   J. Dennis McQuaid, an attorney from Marin County, my opponent when I first ran for the House of Representatives in 1982, says of Marsha:  
   Unlike some advocates, she enjoys a reputation that is devoid of any remotely partisan agenda.  
   W.I. Usery, a former Republican Secretary of Labor under President Ford, has said that Marsha Berzon has all the qualifications needed, and he goes on. 
   Senator SPECTER has said very flattering things about Marsha Berzon. She has strong support from both sides of the aisle. 
   We have lots of vacancies on this court, and we have two fine people who are just waiting for the chance to serve. These people do not come along every day. 
   I want to address myself to the question raised by my friend from Vermont who has shared with me that there have been some independent studies that show, sadly, that if you are a minority, or if you are a woman, you do not seem to get looked at by the Senate; you do not seem to get acted on. You hang around; you wait around for a vote. 
   This is not a reputation the Senate wants. We want to give everyone a chance, and these are two candidates, a woman and a minority, who are so qualified that they were voted out in a bipartisan vote of the committee. I call on my friends on the other side of the aisle who may be holding up these nominees--I do not know who they are. I thought we said you have to come out and identify yourself, but so far I do not know who is holding these up. 
   I beg of you, in the name of fairness and justice and all things that are good in our country, give people a chance. If you do not think they are good, if you have a problem with 
   something they said or did, bring it down to the floor. We can debate it. But please do not hold up these nominees. It is wrong. You would not do it to a friend. You would not do it to someone of whom you thought highly, so do not do it to these good people. They have families. They have jobs. They have careers. They are good people. 
   All we are asking for is a vote. I do not want to see people throughout the country coming to see us in our offices and claiming that women and minorities are not getting fair treatment. That is not what we should be about, and I do not think that is what we are about. But that is the kind of reputation this Senate is getting across this land. 
   We can fix it. We should follow the leadership of Senator LEAHY from Vermont because he has said very clearly for many months now: Bring these good people forward. 
   I want to say a kind word about Senator HATCH. Senator HATCH has said to me from day 1: Senator BOXER, when you bring me a nominee, I want you to make sure that not only are they well qualified, but that they have bipartisan support. 
   He looked me in the eye, even though he is a foot taller, and said: You promise me that. 
   I said: Senator HATCH, I will do that. 
   I have done that in these cases. These are two Ninth Circuit nominees who were nominated by the President, but I have supported them and Senator FEINSTEIN has supported them. They got the vote of Senator HATCH because he knows we have been very careful to nominate people who have mainstream support in the community. I promised him that. I have done that. He has been fair to me. I hope all of the Senate will be fair to these two nominees. 
   Mr. President, I thank Senator BENNETT for his kindness in giving me the additional time. I look forward to moving forward with these nominees we have before us and certainly, at a minimum, on Marsha Berzon, Richard Paez, and the others who are waiting in the wings for their day. I yield the floor.

   Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Chair. 
   I am going to make some very brief remarks and then yield 7 minutes to the Senator from Massachusetts, who is such a leader on education. I will begin just by setting the stage for his remarks. 
   The amendment we have at the desk--and it is cosponsored by many on my side of the aisle--would allow 370,000 children the opportunity to get into afterschool programs. This is a program that works. I understand both sides agree that it works. The difference is that we on this side want to be a little more bold. We want to really say that if education is a priority, and if our children are a priority, we ought to go up to the President's requested level of $600 million for this program. 
   The bill goes up to $400 million. That leaves out 370,000 children. 
   Think of the impact for those children. It doesn't only impact them where they are safe after school. It impacts their parents, their grandparents, their communities, and their neighborhoods. 
   It is a very simple amendment. We use a technique used all through the bill, which is forward funding. We don't touch Social Security or anything else. We simply forward fund it because the school year starts later, and that kind of funding would work. 
   I want to share with my colleagues before you hear from Senator KENNEDY that last night the National Association of Police Athletic Leagues was so delighted to hear we had this amendment pending that they got on the phone and called everyone they could in the Senate. I am going to read a little bit from their letter:

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I think my friend makes a very important point about the priorities when he talks about the overall size of this budget of the United States of America. Comparing that with the $200 million we are asking for in this program would add 370,000 children who are awaiting in line. 
   I ask my friend another question. Our friend from Pennsylvania is not supporting our amendment and alludes to the fact that, well, we just can't keep spending more. But yet every Republican, as I remember, voted for an enormous tax cut of billions and billions of dollars. 
   Now that is off the table. 
   I say to my friend, it seems ironic there would be complaints about spending more on education than the bill already provides, when every single one of my Republican friends voted for this huge tax cut to benefit the wealthiest. All we want is to take a relatively small amount of that and put it into afterschool.

   Mrs. BOXER. I want to give my friend some information. I know he fought this tax battle and a lot of the numbers have perhaps slipped away. The number of dollars that would have been lost in the school year 1999-2000 as a result of the Republican tax cut was $5.273 billion in the first year, this year that we are talking about. 
   They were willing to give to the wealthiest people in this country $5.273 billion in the school year 1999-2000. All we are asking is to take the latter part of that figure--the $5 billion we are not touching--the $273 million. 
   When it comes to priorities, I think this vote is very important.

   Mrs. BOXER. Thank you very much, Mr. President. 
   I thank the Senator from Washington, Mrs. MURRAY, for her very strong leadership on this important issue. 
   We just heard the Senator from Alabama, Mr. SESSIONS, talk about 779 different programs. My friends in the Senate, we are not talking about 779 different programs. We are talking right now about a very important issue. It is one issue. It is one program. It is a program that has placed 29,000 teachers across this country in schools. 
   We have a bill before us that would end that program. That is what the Senator from Washington State is doing. It is bad. It is bad on the merits. It is bad in terms of the whole issue that has been raised here about us moving forward and then turning our back on a program we just began. It is bad for the children. It is bad for these teachers. 
   If I were the Senator from Alabama, I wouldn't feel so good about having a vote that is going to result in teachers getting their pink slips in his State and in every State in the Union. In my particular State, we are talking about 4,000 teachers being given pink slips. 
   A lot of us like surprises. We like nice surprises. We don't like bad surprises. This Republican bill has a surprise for the children of this country. Surprise: Many of you are going back into large classes after you have spent a year getting the attention you deserve, because that is the impact of the Gorton amendment, and everybody on the other side tries to cover it up by saying: Oh, no; Senator GORTON is merely trying to make this thing a block grant package. It doesn't matter. 
   The Murray amendment is a fight with Senator GORTON about whether or not we are going to live up to our promise. The Senator from Washington, Mrs. MURRAY, said it is a very simple form to fill out. I have the form here. You have seen it before. It is a one-page form. 
   I hope no one on the other side of the aisle gets up and says what bureaucracy this is. They talk about 779 programs. But this is one program, one sheet of paper, a program that was praised by Republican DICK ARMEY, the Majority Leader over in the House. It was praised by the Republican chairman of that committee. They took all kinds of credit for it. We said: Great; take credit for it. Now they are going to end it right here in the Senate. I have a problem with that. 
   I also have a problem with the way the bill was put together. I have a chart. I am going to try to explain what has happened with this bill. 
   The Republicans promised to have their appropriations bills ready in time. Wrong. What do they do? They left Health and Human Services, which includes education, for the last appropriations bill. I find that interesting since they often say education is the highest priority. When they wrote this bill, they were short $11 billion for education. 
   We had been saying on the floor we need to make education a priority. Desperately, they looked around and came up with the all-time gimmick of the year. They said: Let's take two issues which we can argue later are emergency issues. 
   One is the census. I find it interesting to declare that an emergency since we have known it was coming since the founding of the Constitution. Be that as it may, they called it an emergency. Then they said: We can say the defense budget is an emergency even though we have already funded it as a nonemergency. 
   So they took the $11 billion from defense and they put it over to education. Now they had a bit of a problem. They were short $11 billion on this side of the chart. How would they replace it? Guess what, folks. Social Security--Social Security had that $11 billion. They decided to declare defense and the census emergencies; they took the money, by declaring them an emergency, out of Social Security and put it in defense. Then, something they promised they would never do because this was supposed to be locked up, we have an $11 billion IOU in the Social Security trust fund. 
   This was quite a maneuver, going against what the Republicans said they would not do. In order to get this money, they steal from here; in order to get this money, they steal from there; and Social Security, which they were not going to touch, will now be owed $11 billion because that is where the emergency spending comes from. I think it is time we used a little fiscal discipline and paid for things as we go. I think that is the right way to go. 
   Some Members say one good thing about this, they do have $11 billion for education. I say right, but even within that, they zero out the teachers in the school program. They have the money now, but they take it away, and in their appropriations bill they set up a whole new program that no one has ever heard of called teachers assistance. We don't know what it is or what form it will take. We don't know if it will be authorized. 
   The Senator from Washington says if it isn't authorized, we will figure a way to give the schools a block grant. This is an important issue. The Senator from Alabama gets up and says: I don't understand how we in the Federal Government know what people want. 
   Maybe he doesn't know what his people want, but I know what my people want. I ran two tough elections for the Senate. One of the biggest issues was education; within that, putting more teachers in the schools, afterschool programs, and school construction. My Republican opponent was against me on every single issue. My election was based on issues. 
   I say to my friend from Alabama, yes, I know what the people in my State want. I am proud to know that. I didn't come here to give my responsibility to someone else. 
   Today, in the Public Works Committee we honored a great President, Dwight Eisenhower. We named a building after him. I was thrilled to vote for it. Dwight Eisenhower, a Republican President, the first President to say there is a function and a role for the Federal Government in public education. He 
   outlined it in the National Defense Education Act. It amazes me when Republicans stand up and say this is some radical idea. It came from one of their leaders whom I greatly admire. We are doing too little for the schools, not too much. 
   I don't want to be a party to children in school being told they have to leave a class of 15 or 20 and return to a class of 35 or 40. That is what will happen with the Gorton amendment. Senator MURRAY is right on target in her fight. It stuns me that we are dealing with this situation. As Senator KENNEDY said, all the Republicans, a year ago when we funded this program, not only praised it but took credit for it. 
   I ask, is anyone writing to complain about this program? No. The local districts want this program to continue. They want the certainty of this program to continue. They want the smaller class sizes to continue. Even with this $11 billion that they will eventually take out of Social Security and place in here, they ignore teachers in the classroom. They underfund afterschool programs by $200 million under the President's proposal. That will leave a lot of children out in the cold, tens and tens of thousands. I will have an amendment on that. 
   The crumbling schools initiative is as if every school is beautiful. I have been to schools where the tiles are falling off the ceilings. Yes, they put in the $11 billion, but they are not spending it in ways that the people in our country want Congress to spend it. Education is a priority. We all say it; we ought to mean it. 
   In conclusion, my friends talk as if the schools are forced to apply for this program. Nothing could be further from the truth. This is not a mandate to put teachers in the school. This is Congress responding to a request to help put more teachers in the school. It is a one-page form. With one vote, we can do away with a great program. I hope we will follow the leadership of Senator MURRAY and Senator KENNEDY. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I assure my friends I do not intend to take the full time I have allotted to me. That will make the Senator from Pennsylvania very happy. Maybe he might even vote for this amendment if I keep it very brief. 
   I do thank my friend from Pennsylvania, Senator SPECTER. I may disagree, we did not get enough for after school, but I have to acknowledge, we did get an increase in after school. For that, I am very pleased. But I really do think we need to do more. 
   I think this chart explains it all. You could not find a simpler chart. All it says is ``370,000.'' I say to my friend, Senator SPECTER from Pennsylvania, and my friends on the other side of the aisle, this represents the number of children who would be served if my amendment were to pass, an additional $200 million which we forward fund in the bill. 
   I think this is a very important number when you stop and think about what it would mean if 370,000 additional children had the opportunities we are giving at this point to about 1 million--an additional 370,000. That is 370,000 kids who are going to get help with their homework. That is 370,000 kids who will stay out of trouble. That is 370,000 children who may just get really excited about something such as computers because they have them in this afterschool program. That is 370,000 kids who may get excited about becoming a policeman, a fireman, or doctor because the community comes into these programs. 
   I know the Senator from Pennsylvania agrees that these programs are very laudable. I just hope at the end of the day, tomorrow at least, by 10, we could agree to add this $200 million, forward fund it, and it would bring it up to the level President 
   Clinton requested for this program.

   Mrs. BOXER. I have strongly supported, for a very long time, the President's request--$600 million--I say to my friend. Not only that, he did join me in an amendment I offered earlier on that point. Six hundred million dollars is where we ought to be now. To answer my friend, this is not a frivolous amendment by any stretch. The $600 million is the amount we believe we need. There is a backlog existing. These are real children waiting in lines to come in. 
   Let me assure my friend, I do appreciate the fact that we have gone up to $400 million for after school. Believe me, I am very pleased about that. But I do believe, since we all know this is a proven program, and my friend shares enthusiasm for it, since we know 92 percent of the people in the community support it, since we know the crime rate goes up exponentially at 3 o'clock--and the Police Athletic League has told us how important this is; this is just a list of some of the law enforcement organizations that support this--we ought to go to the $600 million level. 
   That is the reason I am offering this amendment. It is not to be difficult. It is not to be ungrateful. 
   I want to make a point to my friend. The committee worked very hard. The Senator from Pennsylvania and the Senator from Iowa did. They added $700 million, is my understanding, for IDEA. That is the additional for IDEA--$700 million additional. 
   Senator GREGG is just putting another $200 million in. It may pass. That would be an additional $900 million for IDEA. I am for it. I am for it. It is important to take care of kids with disabilities who need the help. We promised the local districts. I am for it. We are also for this. 
   I think it is not out of the question, when we support the money for IDEA, we also support the funding for afterschool programs.

   Mrs. BOXER. If I can make my point. I am happy to yield to my friend, noting I am using my valuable time which I promised I would not use up. The fact is, the President, in his budget request, studied the number of applications that were coming in from the districts all across this Nation and looked at the backlog. 
   It is amazing what we have done. Since my friend has been chairman--I need to compliment him--we went from $40 million for afterschool programs under his leadership and the leadership of the Senator from Iowa and the President to $200 million. Together we went from $40 million to $200 million, and now my friend is suggesting we go to $400 million. 
   What I am suggesting to my friend is there are culled applications sitting at the Department of Education--Senator KENNEDY pointed them out in his remarks; I refer my friend to his remarks--so we know what the backlog is. 
   We know that 184 afterschool applications were funded and 2,000 applied. I am not suggesting that every one of those 2,000 is meritorious, but I say to my friend, out of the 2,000 that applied and only 184 were funded, we know there are a lot of good schools in Pennsylvania and California and Iowa and all over the country. What we are saying is, we could probably fund far more than the $600 million, but we believe to ratchet up the program in the right fashion, to get it done right that $600 million would be appropriate. It is supported by Secretary Riley; it is supported by the Clinton administration, in addition to the President himself. I say to my friend, 370,000 more children would have the opportunity to participate in afterschool programs. 
   Let me one more time show a chart which I showed previously. We see what happens after school. We see exactly what happens after school when kids have no place to go: The crime rate goes through the roof. It is only as the children return home that the crime rate dissipates. That is why the Police Athletic League is one of the strongest supporters of this amendment. We have a letter from them. It is very clear. They say they are working on behalf of the Police Athletic League to endorse and express our support for the afterschool education and anticrime amendment. This one was written when we offered it to the Ed-Flex bill. 
   I do not need to prolong this debate. Members want to either come to the floor and talk about something else or conclude tonight. I want to close by saying this: I appreciate the fact that the committee, with all the demands on it, did increase this program. I am very pleased to see it at $400 million. However, I truly believe if we are to do right by our children, funding 184 afterschool programs, when 2,000 applied, is not meeting a need. 
   My friends on the other side of the aisle are continually making the point that we do not want to force this on our local communities. Believe me, we are not forcing this on them at all. What we are essentially saying is it is here for you, and they have overwhelmingly applied for these funds. 
   When I make my closing argument--I will have 60 seconds tomorrow morning--I am going to show one of my favorite charts, and that is a picture of children, an actual photograph of children in an afterschool situation--the look on their faces, the excitement. 
   What an incredible thing for them rather than, A, going into 
   an empty house and being alone, not being safe; and, B, going out on the corner to find out who else is standing on the corner. In the old days, kids stood on the corner, and it was not that bad. Today, unfortunately, they get into worse trouble. In the old days, the trouble they got into was not as bad as today. 
   We do not want our children to have nothing to do after school. We know when they are idle, bad things can happen, such as getting into alcohol problems, getting into drug problems, joining a gang, just because they are lonely. 
   I look at some of our pages who work so hard and what a good job they do.  They sit here, and sometimes it is hard. They are occupied, and they are learning. They listen when we speak. They are picking up things. They are kept busy. Their minds are working. 
   Every child deserves a chance to get that mind going and keep that mind going in a positive way. Our children are our future. Every one of us gets up and says that day after day. If you mean it, I am giving you an opportunity to vote for an amendment that will allow 370,000 kids--and let's hold that number up one more time--370,000 kids, and I put that number up because it is a huge number--370,000 more kids under the Boxer amendment, under the Clinton administration request, will be taken care of. Think about the range of that number. Think about how many moms and dads will be relieved to know their children were being taken care of. 
   My hat is off to the ranking member, Senator HARKIN, and the chairman, Senator SPECTER, but I still believe in my heart of hearts that we should move up to the President's request. It is the right thing to do. If Senator JUDD GREGG can find another $200 million for IDEA--terrific--using the same forward-funding approach we are using, then Senator GREGG ought to also support this afterschool amendment. We did a good thing. We want to make it even better. 
   Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time and allow the Senator from Pennsylvania, without interruption, to wind up his argument, and I will see him back on the floor tomorrow morning at 10 o'clock.

   Mrs. BOXER. What I said was I felt the program should be ratcheted up in a logical fashion, and that we are at the point where the Department of Education, Secretary Riley, has stated that $600 million is what he needs and what he can now handle to ratchet up the program. 
   Eventually, I hope my friend shares the view that this ought to be a much bigger program than it is now. But we cannot go 1 day from $200 million to $2 billion. No, I do not support that, and I think my friend's attempt to make it look as if I do is simply not correct.

    Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise in honor of Norma Sullivan, a great Californian who died on September 22 in San Diego. 
   Norma Sullivan was a woman of many talents: a champion skier, an accomplished poet, a prolific essayist, a loving mother, and an inspirational teacher. But she was best known to her many friends and admirers as a tireless fighter for the environment. As a writer, activist, and spokesperson for the San Diego Audubon Society, Norma was one of Southern California's most dedicated and effective defenders of the natural world. 
   San Diego County contains some of the nation's most beautiful landscapes and diverse habitat. The County is home to more endangered species per square mile than any other region in the continental United States. Thanks largely to Norma's prodigious efforts, many of these lands and their inhabitants have been preserved for future generations. 
   She was instrumental in generating support for parks, establishing habitat conservation programs, and blocking projects that would harm the environment--including the proposal to build Pamo Dam near Ramona, which was withdrawn after Norma alerted the community to its dangers. 
   One of Norma's greatest achievements was her role in creating a major wildlife refuge in southern San Diego Bay. For ten years she worked tirelessly to build support for the refuge among conservationists, landowners, local governments, community members, and federal wildlife agencies. She never shied away from confrontation, but she was always ready to cooperate. Finally, this spring, her long efforts bore fruit when the South San Diego Bay National Wildlife Refuge was established and dedicated. 
   This magnificent refuge--and many other pristine tracts of San Diego County--live on as part of Norma Sullivan's legacy. She has also left us a model of what it means to be an engaged citizen: a person who works for the public good with intelligence, humor, and love.

   Mrs. BOXER. First, I thank the Senator from Illinois for setting the stage for this conversation, and I thank him for yielding such time as she needed to the Senator from Washington because, as he has stated, she has been a leader in this whole area of education. 
   Education, in my view, is the No. 1 issue in this country today. Why? Because we know that if we do not give our children a good education, a series of bad things happen: They will not be productive, they will drop out, they will get into trouble, and all the rest. 
   We are now in the global marketplace. We all know this. I daresay everyone on both sides of the aisle says that education is important. I want to probe my friend a little bit because she sits on that all-important appropriations subcommittee on education. I want to make sure I understand exactly what she has told the Senate. 
   My understanding is that the Senate, on paper, is spending more than the House and even exceeds the President's number on paper; is that correct?

And is it not true that $1.2 billion is supposed to replace the lower classroom size initiative that my friend has been pushing in the Senate?

   Mrs. BOXER. It seems as if there is a shell game being played with money that is not behind the piece of paper, and they have completely zeroed out this important class-size reduction plan which we began. 
   Is my friend saying to me that unless we can change that, school districts are going to have to fire teachers? Can my friend elaborate on that? How many teachers is it, and is it 
   all around the country?

   Mrs. BOXER. If we do not make changes and if the President does not prevail with the Republicans and this bill passes as it is, we will not only lose 29,000 teachers out of the classrooms, but next year a lot of those kids who were in classroom sizes of 15 will now find themselves in classroom sizes of 30, and we are back to where we were and we have wiped out this advantage we have given some of our children. 
   I have two more other questions. 
</TEXT>
</DOC>

<DOC>
<DOCNO>106-boxer-ca-7-19990928</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. BOXER. I think it gets back to what our colleague from Illinois said: There is a lot of chaos. Imagine the chaos. Last year we passed this school reduction effort, and then we turn around--the Republicans do--and walk away from it. Talk about chaos--chaos on Capitol Hill because we do not know what we are doing, chaos in the classrooms--a terrible message. 
   I have two other areas I want to ask the Senator about. One that she mentioned is very near and dear to my heart, which is afterschool care. We know it works. We know that juvenile crime peaks at 3 o'clock and starts to go down at 6 or 7 in the evening when the kids go home. We know if they do not have a place to go after school, they get in trouble. 
   All of these things are so obvious. The smaller class sizes--it does not take a degree in sociology or education or psychology to understand if a teacher can give you one-on-one help, you are going to do better. If you have a safe place to go after school, you are not going to get in trouble. Again, we can track academic performance. 
   In this bill, the Republicans did put more money into afterschool care, but they underfunded it by $200 million less than the President's request. The President requested $600 million; they came in with $400 million. That $200 million affects thousands and thousands and thousands of children. 
   I know my friend taught in the classroom. I know how she supports afterschool care. Is it not a fact, I say to my friend, that she was unable to offer an amendment on afterschool care or school construction or smaller class sizes, that she was prohibited by the Republicans under the rules of their markup?

   Mrs. BOXER. The last question I have for my friend is in regard to school construction. I read in the paper today that the President was in a school in Louisiana. It was a school that was built before the turn of the century. The school is falling down. The tiles are falling down from the ceiling. When it rains, the rain comes into the classrooms. 
   It reminded me of a school I visited in Sacramento where the same thing was happening. I could not believe it. We were in the gym, I say to my friend from Washington, and I looked at 
   the ceiling. Tiles were gone. I said to a construction worker: What has happened to the tiles on the ceiling? He said: They fell down. I said: Do they ever hit a student? He said: Yes. 
   I have to ask my friend, what kind of message are we sending to our kids when, on the one hand, we say to them as parents that education is crucial to them in this incredibly important global marketplace where they are in competition with students from Europe and Asia and all over the world, and then we send them to a school where the tiles are falling on their heads? Can my friend tell me again, how much do the Republicans have in their education bill for this important and worthy project of school construction and fixing up our schools? How much do they put in?

<DOCNO>106-boxer-ca-10-19990928</DOCNO>

   Mrs. BOXER. So in my sum up, from what I get from the Senator from Washington, there is no money for school construction, there is no money for class size reduction, and there is $200 million less for afterschool care. 
   I say to my friend, please, when you are in that committee this afternoon, do what you did on the floor; lay out the situation. I hope all of America is going to learn that despite the moving of the numbers and the smoke and mirrors and all the rest of it, the things that need to be done are not done in this bill. 
   I thank my colleague for yielding.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I think we have reached a moment on the floor of the Senate that ought to be marked. Very sadly, it is a moment of failure for this Republican Congress, a moment of failure after promising a moment of success. 
   Why do I say that? There were three promises made by the Republican leader to the people of the United States of America. The first promise was that the spending bills, all 13 of them, would pass on time and within the context of the balanced budget; the second promise was that the Republicans would not touch the Social Security trust fund to pay for their programs; the third promise was that they would stay under the spending caps that were approved before. 
   In my opinion and in the opinion of many others, all three of those promises are being broken. In the lead story in the New York Times today, we read about the shenanigans going on in trying to get this budget accomplished. 
   I have proudly served on the Budget Committee in the Senate for 7 years; in the House, I served on the Budget Committee for a total of 6 years. I know there have been times when neither side has performed as it should. However, I never, ever remember it being this bad. I never, ever remember it being this chaotic. 
   It is very sad because the rest of the country is doing great fiscally. This is the best economic recovery we have had. In my lifetime, these are the best statistics I can remember for low unemployment, low inflation, high home ownership. Things are going really well. Yet in that context, when things are going really well, we cannot get our act together around here. I have to say it is a failure of Republican leadership. 
   What is before us today is a bill that will continue the functions of Government for the next 3 weeks because, out of the 13 spending bills, only 1--only 1--has received a signature from this President. Therefore, we have to have a continuing resolution or the Government will shut down. I understand that. But let me simply say this. I think the reason my Republican friends are in so much trouble--and I hope some of them will come to the floor because this is their continuing resolution; I assume they are on their way so we can have a little bit of a debate here--I think the reason the Republicans are in so much trouble is, they have locked out the President, they have locked out the Democrats, and they are coming up with plans that are out of touch with reality and with what the American people want. 
   Let me give an example. Everyone around here says children are a priority and education is a priority. Yet the last bill my Senate friends have looked at in the Appropriations Committee, the one they saved until last, is education. HHS--Health and Human Services--includes education. 
   Why do I say the Republicans are out of step with the American people? I say it based on three simple facts.  
   There is nothing in that bill, not one penny, to continue to put teachers in the schools and to lower class sizes--nothing, not a penny, not even to continue what we started last year when Senator MURRAY and the President of the United States of America put before us a very important program to place 100,000 teachers in the schools. 
   Last year, as a result of our getting together, we compromised at 30,000 teachers. To be exact, 29,000 teachers have been hired under this program. There is not one penny in this education bill to continue that program. We were hoping we would have funding to continue the 29,000 and go forward with the rest of the 100,000. We know that when there are smaller class sizes, kids do much better. We know that. It is a fact. It is indisputable. Yet in their Republican budget, not only do they not expand this program but they do not put one penny in to pay for the 29,000 teachers all over the country who are already in the classroom. This Republican budget is a pink slip for 29,000 teachers. How does that comport with what the American people want? How does that comport with the reality the American people expect from us? It does not. 
   Another thing the American people say they want from us is to rebuild our crumbling schools. You do not have to have a degree in education or sociology to understand our schools are falling down. What kind of message is it to our children when we say how important education is in this global marketplace and their parents are telling them how important it is, and they walk into school, and what happens? The ceiling tiles are falling down on their heads. I saw it in Sacramento, CA. I saw it in Los Angeles County. Yesterday, the President was in a Louisiana school. He saw the same thing. We need to make sure we rebuild our crumbling schools. That is another issue the American people want resolved. 
   Third, after school; I have brought the issue of after school to the Senate for many years. I am very pleased to say we are moving forward. But we have thousands and hundreds of thousands of children on waiting lists for afterschool programs. 
   Why are they important? Because we know in many cases parents work and kids get in trouble after school. We know when they have good afterschool programs, they learn, they get mentoring, the business community comes in, the police community comes in, they learn about the dangers of drugs, they can get help with their homework, and they do important things. I have been to some fantastic afterschool programs, and I have seen the look on the kids' faces. I tell you, they are doing well. Studies show they improve their academic performance--by 80 percent in one particular program in Sacramento--if they have afterschool. 
   What does the Republican education budget do for after school? It comes in $200 million below the President's request. What that means is that 387,000 children will be denied after school. 
   What I am saying is, we have a budget situation that is out of touch with what the American people want. I am just giving three examples--teachers in the schools, school construction, afterschool programs. Those are just examples. Guess how they pay for it. As I understand it--and it keeps changing every day--essentially they tap into the Social Security trust fund. They do it in a dance, and a bob and a weave that is impressive, but I understand it. 
   What I understand they are going to do is take $11 billion in authorizing funds out of the defense budget--OK?--and put it into education. Follow me on this. And then, as soon as they have done that, they declare that $11 billion of defense spending is an emergency. That is the way they get around the caps. 
   There is only one problem: It comes out of the Social Security trust fund. All emergency spending comes out of the Social Security trust fund. So, yesterday what was not an emergency in the military budget today will become an emergency, and the Social Security fund will be raided. I have to say, this is gamesmanship. 
   I think what we ought to do is pay as you go around here. If we want to spend more, we ought to pay for it. That is why the President's budget had well over $30 billion of offsets to handle the new requirements. It doesn't dip into the Social Security trust fund, and it doesn't play shell games between defense and domestic priorities. 
   So here we are going to have a continuing resolution to get us through these next 3 weeks. I truly have not decided whether I am going to vote for it or not because, on the one hand, I understand we are coming down to the end of the fiscal year and we have to continue the Government; on the other hand, I believe, as the Senator from the largest State in the Union, the way they are doing this budget around here is something I do not want my fingerprints on. I really do not. I do not approve of it. I think it is wrong. I do not think it is honest. I do not think it is direct with the people. I do not think it is fiscally responsible. I think it takes us down the road we do not want to go down. I don't want more smoke and mirrors. We have had enough of that on both sides of the aisle. We are finally getting on our fiscal feet. We ought to stay on our fiscal feet. 
   I just want to say to my friends, I have a solution to their problem--because they are having problems on this. If they will open the door to this President and work with him on some compromises here, we can finish our work and be proud and go home. Will everyone get what he or she wants? No. That is what compromise is. But we will each get maybe halfway there, and we can feel good about ourselves, that we have reached across the party lines. This President has his strong priorities. The Republican Congress has its strong priorities. I think if they add to that the Democratic leadership here, Senators DASCHLE and REID, and then on the House side Congressman GEPHARDT, Congressman BONIOR, and the other leaders, of both sides, I think we will find we can do business together. 
   One of the reasons I hesitate to vote for this continuing resolution is, as I said, I am not sure I want my fingerprints on what has happened so far. On the other hand, it is not too late. In the next 3 weeks, we could open up the doors. We could have a summit. We could bring everyone to it. We could all lay out what we want to have happen, show the American people we are willing to put them in front of politics, and come out with something we can be proud of, a true education plan that is going to meet their needs, a budget that is in balance, both in its actual numbers and in its priorities. 
   I think we can go home and be very proud of ourselves. 
   I was on my feet for many hours last week over an issue called oil royalties. It is very interesting, in this continuing resolution, that moratorium on fixing the oil royalty problem is nonexistent. It is possible that the Interior Department could issue rules and stop the thievery that is going on. I hope they will do it. I really hope they will do it. 
   Talk about needing money. We estimate that $66 million a year is being lost out of the coffers because the oil companies are not paying their fair share in oil royalties. We had a vote on this, a very close vote. Senator HUTCHISON was able to defeat me by 1 vote on the cloture vote, and I think the final vote was 51-47. I was unable to defeat her on the substance of her amendment. But JOHN MCCAIN wrote in and said he would have voted with me, which would have made it 51-48. 
   I hope Bruce Babbitt is watching this and he will take advantage of this 3-week hiatus we have in front of us where he is now able to fix this problem. I hope he will do it. I really appreciate the editorials across the country saying we have exposed a real scam and it ought to be fixed. I hope, again, if Secretary Babbitt is listening, perhaps he will do something good in these 3 weeks and move forward to resolve that issue. 
   Be that as it may, that is a relatively small issue compared to keeping this Government going. I know we will keep this Government going with or without my vote. We will move it forward. I once more appeal to my colleagues: You made three promises, you have not kept them. Why not open the door and see if we can help you out because you cannot obviously come to this decision on your own. You have not done the bills on time, you are dipping into Social Security, and, in essence, you are bypassing the caps by calling things emergency spending today that did not warrant emergency spending yesterday. Why don't we stop the smoke and mirrors and shell games? Why don't we  pass a budget that reflects all of us to a certain degree. 
   In the House of Representatives, there are only 11 votes that separate Republicans and Democrats. I have been over there. I was over there when we were in the majority. We probably had a 50-, 60-seat majority. The Republicans have an 11-seat majority in the House and a 10-seat majority in the Senate. They run the place. That is the way it is. Even if they had a 1-vote majority, they would run the place. I accept that. That is how the voters wanted it. But it is kind of tough when it is that close to do the right thing unless we all sit down together. 
   We have good people on both sides of the aisle. I have so many friends on the other side of the aisle whom I respect very much, including the Presiding Officer with whom I have worked on many issues. There is no reason why we cannot sit down in these next 3 weeks and find the answers and make the compromises. But we are never going to do it if we put politics ahead of bipartisanship. That is my plea before we have a vote. 
   I thank the Chair very much for his patience. I know it is sometimes hard to sit there and listen, and he has done that in a very fine way. 
   I yield the floor and, of course, retain the remainder of the leader's time on this side. I suggest the absence of a quorum, and I ask unanimous consent that it be charged equally to both sides.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I wish to express my support for the amendment offered last Friday by Senator KERRY to fund 50,000 new Section 8 vouchers. Had the Senate voted on this amendment, I would have voted in favor of it. I am pleased that Senator MIKULSKI and others have committed to work on this issue in conference. 
   The Kerry amendment is particularly important to my home state in light of the current affordable housing crisis in California. Eleven of the twenty-five least affordable metropolitan areas are located in California. The homeownership rate is 47th among the 50 states. More than one-third of homeowners and one-half of renters pay more than thirty percent of their income for housing in California. On average, it takes more than three years to receive a Section 8 voucher in California. In Los Angeles, approximately 8,000 families are currently on the Section 8 waiting list and it can take as long as eight years to get a voucher. That is just too long for a family to wait for affordable housing. 
   It is clear that in California, and indeed throughout the country, there is a definite need for further housing assistance. 
   Section 8 housing assistance serves the poorest of the poor, persons with incomes averaging approximately $7,500 per year. Last year, Congress made available almost 100,000 new Section 8 vouchers. No new vouchers had been made available in the past five years. That was an important first step--but it is time to do more. In my own state of California, almost 13,000 families would receive Section 8 assistance under the Kerry amendment. 
   Our economy is booming: unemployment is at historically low levels, nearly 18 million jobs have been created since 1993, and the inflation rate has averaged just 2.5 percent since 1993--the lowest rate since the Kennedy Administration. 
   In these economic good times, however, the gap between rich and poor continues to grow. We must continue to assure that everyone in this country has affordable housing. 
   I urge my colleagues on the conference committee to provide additional Section 8 vouchers to America's families in need of housing assistance. 
   Mr. President, I also want to talk about the provision in this bill that would eliminate HUD's Community Builder program. 
   Community Builders act as liaison between HUD and local governments and non-profit organizations. They help local authorities identify the programs in HUD that best serve the needs of their neighborhoods. 
   Many experts have affirmed that HUD is becoming the model of reinvention. I believe that HUD's Community Builder program has been a key component of HUD's reinvention efforts. 
   The Community Builder program is working. Ernst & Young's initial audit found that the Builders are knowledgeable about HUD programs, are making customer service more efficient, assisting communities, and using their expertise to make government work better. A similar survey by Andersen Consulting found that ``Community Builders have had a positive effect on the ability of [HUD] customers ..... to conduct business.''--and recommended an expansion of the Community Builder program to cover more communities. In addition, I have received numerous letters from elected officials and nonprofit organizations throughout California expressing support for the Community Builder program. 
   Approximately twenty HUD offices would be forced to close if the Community Builder program were eliminated--including one in Fresno, California. 
   I ask that my colleagues on the conference committee work together to find funding for this important program.

   Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Chair. 
   Once more, I tell the Senate, the reason I have taken the Senate's time on this is twofold. First, it seems to me an amendment such as this does not belong in the Interior bill. In essence, it is a very major policy change. Oil companies sign an agreement with the Federal Government that, when they have the privilege of drilling on Federal lands, be it onshore or offshore, they pay a percentage of the fair market value of the production to the Federal Government. This is very important because in the Federal Government we use that for the Land and Water Conservation Fund, which is so important for our environment, historic preservation, national parks, et cetera. The States use their share to put the funds right into the classroom. 
   If this amendment is approved, if cloture is invoked and the amendment is approved, the Land and Water Conservation Fund will lose $66 million. Because of this rider, which the Senator from Texas has put on these bills on three prior occasions, the Treasury has already lost $88 million. Mr. President, we badly need those funds for  those important purposes of the environment and education. 
   What the Senator's amendment does is stop the Interior Department from collecting the appropriate amount of royalties. How do we know we are not getting the appropriate amount of royalties? We have whistleblowers who have come forward and have told of a scheme to defraud the United States of America of the due amount of royalties. 
   Just last month, a few weeks ago, Chevron agreed to settle a case on royalties, $95 million. This is a headline from the Wall Street Journal: Chevron to Pay $95 Million to End Claim It Shortchanged U.S. on Royalties. 
   The companies are settling these claims at an unbelievable rate--$5 billion has already been settled by seven States. Twenty-five percent of these companies are cheating us, and they don't have a leg to stand on. They don't want to go to court. Therefore, they are settling. 
   What we know, for example, is that in one of the recent suits that was filed, the United States of America has joined two whistleblowers--and this is the first time this has ever been made public--outlining seven schemes by the oil companies to cheat Uncle Sam, cheat the taxpayers out of the money. We have heard of the seven wonders of the world, and we have heard of the 7 years war and the seven seas and seventh heaven and the 7-year itch and 007 and many 7s, but we have never heard of the seven schemes of the oil companies until now. In essence, all seven schemes have one goal; that is, to show that the value of the oil is less than what it really is. 
   I think it is time to put an end to this. The USA Today headline says it all: It is Time to Clean Up Big Oil's Slick Deal with Congress. 
   Reading directly from the article:  
   Imagine being able to compute your own rent payments and grocery bills, giving yourself a 3 percent to 10 percent discount off the market price. Over time, that would add up to really big bucks. And imagine having the political clout to make sure nothing threatened to change that cozy arrangement.  
   This amendment offered by my friend from Texas allows the oil companies to continue this cozy arrangement whereby they decide, these 25 percent of the oil companies, what they are going to pay the Federal Government. In every case, it is below 
   the fair market value. 
   This $66 million, as I said before, could do a lot of things. We could hire 1,000 teachers with it, or put 44,000 new computers into the classroom, or buy textbooks for 1.2 million students, or provide 53 million hot lunches for schoolchildren. 
   So let us not think, when we have this vote, it is a free vote. This cloture vote is very important. The Senator from Texas just about mustered enough votes. She doesn't have one vote to spare. If just one of my colleagues would hear my plea, stand up and say no to this cloture, we could stop this thievery in its tracks. That is what it is--out-and-out thievery. We need the funds for the functions of government. We need the funds for the people of the United States of America. 
   I urge a ``no'' vote on cloture.

   Mrs. BOXER. I am so pleased the Senator is taking us back to the basics of this amendment which, as he pointed out, has essentially been offered to the Interior appropriations bill on three previous occasions in the committee on which he serves, the Appropriations Committee. We have tried to fight it in that committee only to be outvoted basically on a party-line vote. 
   This is the first time, I know my friend is aware, we have had a vote on this in the Senate. I underscore and ask a question of my friend. 
   My friend points out there is a problem with some of the oil companies, that they are not paying their fair share of royalties, and the Secretary of the Interior, Bruce Babbitt, wants to make sure everyone pays their fair share. 
   Is my colleague aware that 95 percent of the oil companies are doing the right thing? I want to make sure he understands the problem lies with 5 percent of the oil companies that are ripping off the people. I hope he responds to that, and I have an additional question.

   Mrs. BOXER. My friend hits again on an issue that I think we should explore because under the rules of the Senate we have up to 30 hours for debate on this Hutchison amendment. I do not know if it will take 30 hours, but it will take some time because it is important that the light of day shine on this. 
   My friend from Illinois has hit on a really important point that, in essence, the scandal is the nature of this. I wonder if my friend could comment on the perception people in this country have that if you are big, if you are powerful, if you give millions of dollars in contributions, you can get your way in something as obvious as this. 
   Why do I say obvious? The New York Times did a story on this just 2 days ago. 
   I thought the opening lines were very important. I wonder if my friend read them. I think he did. It said:  
   Oil companies drilling on Federal land have been accused of habitually underpaying royalties they owe the government. Challenged in court, they have settled lawsuits, agreeing to pay $5 billion. The Interior Department wants to rectify the situation by making the companies pay royalties based on the market price of oil, instead of a lower price set by the oil companies.  
   The author asks:  
   A simple issue? Not in the United States Senate.  
   We have a simple, straightforward issue. If the Senator or I or any of the people watching this debate around the country didn't pay their fair share of taxes, believe me, they would have a knock on their door from the IRS. Here they have a knock on the door from the Senate. They say: It's OK; we will defend it. 
   I ask my friend whether he feels the power of this special interest is playing a role in this? Not just to pick on them--I know my friend has taken on the tobacco companies time and time again--but I want my friend to comment on the perception of people in this country that this Senate and this Congress does the bidding of the special interests over the bidding of the people we are supposed to fight for and represent. He can tie it into any issue he wants, but I think it is an important part of this debate.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I thank my colleague very much, the Senator from Illinois, for his comments. He has proven, once again, a very important point around here; that is, that he speaks for the people, all the people. 
   I think the primary issue in this amendment is, for whom do we stand up and fight? The oil companies, the tobacco companies, the special interests, they are strong. I know Senator FEINGOLD, who has spoken before, has been very eloquent on the point of the power of the special interests in this country. They have the ability to really make things come out the way they want. On the other hand, this is supposed to be a government of, by, and for the people, which sometimes gets shut out. There isn't an occasion I can recall in all the years I have served with my dear friend from Illinois, Senator DURBIN, not an occasion when he didn't stand on the side of what was right. That is a pretty strong statement. 
   But I know when he gets up and speaks against the Hutchison amendment, it is because he is as outraged as I am that the people are being forgotten by the Senator from Texas, and the very powerful are being represented. 
   Why did I take so much of the Senate's time on this? Because I feel so deeply that when you see people being hurt, you have to stand up on their side. Now, a newspaper in California said, well, it is only $600,000 a year to California. First of all, that is incorrect. It is $600,000 a year as their share of the royalties; but when more money gets put into the Land and Water Conservation Fund, the State of California gets back 10 percent of that. So it is really millions of dollars. 
   Mr. President, I would like to ask my friend, Senator FEINGOLD, at approximately what time he would like to be heard on this.

   I want to make a point in support of Senator FEINGOLD's amendment to campaign contributions, but I want to do it in a way that I think is very objective. 
   If you look at the New York Times article--he should make sure he looks at this New York Times article as well--I say to all of my friends, the title of this article is ``Battle Waged in the Senate Over Oil Royalties by Oil Firms.'' The essence of the article goes to the heart of what my friend is saying. It goes to the heart of the issue of campaign contributions. 
   So I surely believe the Senator from Wisconsin is in full order to connect this amendment to the number of contributions that oil companies give, and I think his comments are on point and in order.

   Mrs. BOXER. The Hutchison rider has been agreed to many times in the dead of night in the committee. But the Senate has never had time to explore all that it means. It is a tough debate going on here. I think it is good because, again, it shows, in many ways, the difference between the two parties, who stands for whom, where we come out. 
   I thought comments of the Senator from Wisconsin about the role of campaign contributions to the political parties, as he pointed it out, was germane. We may have a vote about that later. He is simply pointing out a fact that has been noted in the USA Today, the Los Angeles Times, the New York Times, which is that, in fact, campaign contributions taint this debate. Even if everybody is pure of heart and pure of soul in this Senate--and I pray that is the case--there is an appearance here. It doesn't look right when you realize that 5 percent of the oil companies--mostly big oil--are not paying their fair share of royalties. 
   We show it right here on the chart. The cost of the Hutchison amendment would represent $66 million that would otherwise go to the taxpayers, to the Land and Water Conservation Fund, the national parks, historic monuments, and to the States to go into the classrooms. So it is very important that when these decisions are made, they are being made by the pure of heart because you have a situation where the oil companies are not paying their fair share--5 percent of the oil companies--and the people are therefore not getting their fair share to go into the classrooms and the national parks. Therefore, we want to make sure the decision is based on the facts, not on campaign contributions. 
   I thought the Senator from Wisconsin was absolutely brilliant in his discussion and laying down the facts that show these campaign contributions. I hope if we do have a vote on whether that is germane, we will, in fact, find that the Senator from Wisconsin can continue his remarks because I think it goes to the heart of the matter. So just to show why I have taken the time of the Senate on this, I want to look again at this chart, which I call ``Big Oil's Big Rip Off.'' Because of this rider, we have lost $66 million from the Treasury--excuse me, we have already lost $88 million from the Treasury. Under this amendment, we lose another $66 million. That would mean if this amendment passes, the total cost of the oil rider will be $154 million to the taxpayers. 
   I find it really interesting--a couple of things that the Senator from Texas now says--that if we collect the fair share of royalties, we will see an increase in gasoline at the pump. Let me tell you why I find that really interesting. We have debated this issue for many years now, and we have heard every argument being used. It always changes. 
   The first argument as to why we should not allow Bruce Babbitt and the Interior Department to collect a fair  amount of royalties from the oil companies was that oil companies are being fair. Why, we are not cheating; we are paying the fair share. They argue that. That didn't fly. The newspapers didn't buy it. Nobody really bought it. So the next argument is, well, maybe there needs to be a clarification. Maybe what we are paying isn't exactly right. We don't admit that, but let's have a clarification. But we need more time. So let's not allow the Interior Department to decide this matter now; let's buy some time. 
   OK. Then they went to the third issue because that didn't fly very well anymore. The third excuse was that we haven't had enough public comment period on the rule. But go ahead and again open up public comment, and we will be glad to pay our fair share. Well, there were 17 meetings held, and then they opened up the public comment period again. We have heard every excuse in the world, bar none, as to why we should not be collecting the $154 million that is due taxpayers. The latest one is: Oh, oh, you better not allow Bruce Babbitt to go after those royalties because your prices will go up at the pump. Well, we know for a fact--if you look at the amount of money this means to the oil companies--it is a tiny percentage.

   Mrs. BOXER. The list that is going into the RECORD shows all of the big oil companies and what this really means for them. It is so small that these royalty payments, in some cases, can't even be measured. They are so minuscule, they can't even be measured. The largest one is .07 percent of their revenues. So to stand up here and say your oil prices are going to go up is ludicrous. It is completely a new argument that absolutely holds no weight. Even if they were to pass this on, it would not even be a penny a gallon. It would not even be a mill. 
   Let's face it; this isn't anything about higher gas prices because it doesn't even impact these companies. This isn't about any of that. It is about fairness; it is about justice. How do we know that it is about fairness and justice? The whistleblowers who work for big oil have testified. Let me tell you about something I have not even mentioned before in this debate. Recently, there was a lawsuit filed on behalf of two whistleblowers from big oil, and the lawsuit is quite compelling. It is so compelling that the Justice Department actually joined in as a party to the lawsuit. 
   I know we have heard many seven schemes. We have heard of the Seven Wonders of the World; the Seven Years' War; Seven Brides for Seven Brothers; the Seven Seas; Seventh Heaven; Seven Days of the Week; Seventh Inning Stretch--which is what we could probably use right now--Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs; Lucky Number Seven; Dance of the Seven Veils; the Seven Year Itch. How about even this biblical one: Forgive your enemies 70 times 7; Seven Hills of Rome; the Magnificent Seven; Seven Days in May; the Seven Percent Solution. There is even a book called ``The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People''; Seven-Up. We have heard of 7-Eleven stores; Seven Samurai; Double-O Seven; there is even Seven Sleepers of Ephesus. 
   So we have heard a lot about sevens in history, and today on this floor of the Senate I am going to talk about another seven. This isn't a pretty one. This isn't a movie. This isn't a song. This isn't a saying. This is a lawsuit, a lawsuit that outlined the seven schemes of the oil companies--the seven schemes of the oil companies to defraud the taxpayers. I am going to speak to you from this lawsuit. I am going to read to you right from this lawsuit. Before you fall asleep and think it is boring, it is not boring. These are two whistleblowers, former ARCO executives, big boys in the echelon, who cleansed their souls. This is what they said in a lawsuit under penalty of perjury:  
   Causes of action alleged herein arise from a nationwide conspiracy by some of the world's largest oil companies to shortchange the United States of America of hundreds of millions of dollars in revenues known as royalties.  
   Let me repeat that because this is the crux of what is before us today. Two whistleblowers from the highest echelons of the big oil companies stated under penalty of perjury that there is a ``nationwide conspiracy by some of the world's largest oil companies to shortchange the United States of America of hundreds of millions of dollars in revenues known as royalties.'' 
   What does this amendment do? Why am I taking the Senate's time? I want to shine the light of truth on this issue. 
   The Department of the Interior knows this scam is going on, and they want to fix it. What we have before us is an amendment to stop the Interior  Department. You can see from the poster by my good friend from Texas. Now the argument is: Turn your sights on the Interior Department; they are corrupt. This is a new argument about trial lawyers. I haven't heard that one before. I guess they keep taking a poll to see who is popular, and then they try to argue with us because they cannot argue with us on the merits. 
   I think it is also very interesting because the Senator from Texas and the Senator from Wyoming tried to stop Senator FEINGOLD from talking about the oil company contributions. They are coming up with the trial lawyers. I find it is interesting. That is fine. I don't mind that. I wouldn't gag any of my colleagues. They can say whatever they want because the issue here is clear. It is stated in a lawsuit:  
   There is a nationwide conspiracy by some of the world's largest oil companies to shortchange the United States of America of hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue known as royalties.  
   That is not a statement by trial lawyers; that is a statement under penalty of perjury by two former employees of big oil. 
   Let's see what else they say. 
   They say:  
   There is a pattern and a practice of carefully developed and coordinated schemes targeted to defraud the United States of America of its lawful share of royalties owed by the defendants, the oil companies, for crude oil produced in United States owned or controlled land.  
   In English language, it means that when these oil companies drill on lands that belong to the people of the United States of America, land of the United States, either onshore or offshore, they are not paying their royalties. 
   To continue:  
   The oil companies' unlawful conduct is continuing in nature and these major oil companies operating in the United States have underpaid oil royalties to the United States by calculating the royalties based on prices less than the total consideration actually received by the oil companies.  
   In English language, these royalties are not being based on the fair market price, which is what they have to be, according to the lease they sign. Let's take a look at that lease they signed because I think that is pretty telling. 
   The Senator from Texas keeps referring to a royalty as a tax. A royalty is not a tax. A royalty is paid subject to an agreement. When oil companies drill on lands that belong to ``we, the people,'' they have to pay something for it. It is a privilege, and they have to pay something for it. The ``something'' that they pay for is the subject of this debate. 
   The Department of the Interior says--and these whistleblowers say--that 5 percent of the oil companies are cheating and 95 percent are doing the right thing. They are paying the fair market value--their royalty is based on a fair market value--but 5 percent of the companies that are cheating us are not. We know that to be the case. 
   So let's look at the agreement that the oil companies signed. They signed an agreement that says the value of production for purposes of computing royalty on production shall never be less than the fair market value of the production. It further says gas of all kinds, except helium, is subject to royalties and that, for purposes of computing, the royalty from this lease shall never be less than the fair market value of production. 
   That is the subject of this debate. Five percent of the oil companies are not paying the fair market value. 
   Let's look at some of the companies and the posted prices. 
   Whistleblowers have told us that these oil company executives sit around and plan to defraud the people. It is all in this lawsuit, and it is reflected in this chart. If you track the market price of oil--right here we have done that-- from July 1997 to June 1998, just to give you an example, this blue line is the market price. 
   How do we know the market price? It is listed in oil publications every day. We know what it is. It is really definable. If you track that market price compared with this red line, which is the ARCO posted price--in other words, that is the price ARCO decided to pay royalties on--what do you see? You see a differential of about $4 per barrel. Sometimes it is less--$2. But it can go up to $4 or $5 in difference. What does that mean? It means that the taxpayers are being defrauded by this amount in the middle, in between the two. 
   Do we have another oil company? It just doesn't happen in ARCO. I don't want to say it just happens in ARCO. 
   Here we have another oil company. We track the market prices and the posted prices. Isn't it amazing? Why is it this way? Because these companies are cheating the Government. They are not paying the royalties based on the blue line, which is the market price, which they have to, according to the agreement they signed. This isn't about taxes, my friends. This is a royalty agreement. They are paying the royalty based on the red line, and the taxpayers are getting ripped off. 
   You may say, well, what is $4 a barrel with $2 to $4 on a regular basis? It is a lot. Let me tell you what it is. We are not talking about peanuts; we are talking about real dollars. Let's talk about that. 
   This amendment that is before us today, on which the Senator from Texas, Mrs. HUTCHISON, got 60 votes--just the amount she needed, and not 1 vote to spare to bring this amendment to the floor--is about real dollars, $66 million. What can you do with $66 million? 
   By the way, that is only 1 year. 
   If this continues, we are looking at $1/2 billion pretty soon, and $1 billion after that. 
   Let's take 1 year for this particular amendment, $66 million. We could have hired 1,000 teachers with that. We know we need more teachers in the classroom. These royalty payments, when they go to the States, are used in the classroom. Anyone who talks about how we need more money for education, we could hire 1,000 teachers with the $66 million. 
   Maybe you don't want to hire teachers. Maybe you want to improve the schools. We can put 44,000 new computers in the classroom with $66 million. That is just this year. Or we can buy textbooks for 1.2 million students. 
   Have you ever looked at some of the textbooks in our public schools? When I was a kid and I got a textbook--it was a long time ago; I plead guilty to that--when we opened up a textbook in those happy days, it smelled clean and fresh. It was clean and fresh. It was ours. Today, some of the textbooks have writing; they are old; they are falling apart. What kind of message is that? 
   I could be challenged: Why is the Senator from California talking about schools, textbooks, and teachers? Easy. The money we would get if we defeat the Hutchison amendment could buy 1.2 million students new textbooks. 
   If you want to do something for the safety net with that $66 million, we could provide 53 million hot lunches for schoolchildren, lunches that have more than ketchup, I might say; lunches with nourishment, nutrition. We know a lot of our kids need that. 
   When these oil companies sit around and plot to defraud the government--and we have it here, under penalty of perjury, that that is what they do with seven schemes. We have the schemes outlined. Later in the debate I will get into exactly what are the seven schemes. Essentially, all seven are schemes to lower the value of the oil that is pumped from Federal lands. They have intricate ways of doing that. It is spelled out right here. I will read a little more from this complaint. 
   These whistleblowers, who were former executives high up in the chain of big oil, say:  
   .....they have knowledge of the unlawful conduct, including the schemes and the practices alleged herein, which include the oil company's misrepresentation and underpayment of oil royalty payments to the United States.  
   They go through the schemes. Does anyone want to challenge the authenticity of these charges from these whistleblowers, former oil executives, who say they have ``direct knowledge that this is going on.'' They call it ``conspiratorial activities'' to cheat the United States out of its royalty income by deflating the base price of oil upon which royalties are to be paid. 
   This is thievery. People say: Why are you taking the time of the Senate, Senator BOXER? It is because I love this place too much to see us put our imprimatur on this scheme. 
   Let's read directly from the Platt's Oil article that shows exactly what one of these executives said under penalty of perjury. This is an article that appeared over the summer of this year in an oil company report. This isn't from  the New York Times. We have gotten a good article from the New York Times. We have gotten good articles from USA Today and the Los Angeles Times. We have gotten good articles in South Dakota; we have gotten good articles in Michigan. All of those editorials are saying Senator BOXER is right. 
   This is from an oil company newspaper, so it should have total credibility with all who take the oil company's side. I will read this article entitled ``Retired ARCO Employee Says Company Underpaid Oil Royalties.''  
   A retired Atlantic Richfield employee has admitted in court that while he was the secretary of ARCO's crude pricing committee, the major's posted prices were far below the fair market value.  
   Let me repeat that. An oil company executive who worked in this area said that the ``posted prices''--that is, the price that the oil company paid the royalty on--was ``far below the fair market value.'' 
   Let's look at the chart again. He is saying the amount they paid their royalties on--remember, the royalty is a percentage, about 12 percent if it is onshore, 12 percent of the fair market value. They did 12 percent of their made-up posted price. 
   He is not anonymous. This man has a name. He has put his good name out there. He has said under penalty of perjury in court that what he says is true. Harry Anderson is his name. He testified this month in an ongoing suit, and he said he was a witness to the inner workings of ARCO. According to court documents, Anderson testified that the primary purpose of the crude pricing committee was to set the posted prices for the mid-continent, Alaskan and California crudes. In other words, it was his job to decide what was the posted price. On that posted price, they would pay their royalties. Whatever Mr. Anderson and his friends decided was that fair market value called the posted price, that is on what they would pay the royalties. 
   This chart shows consistently these prices were below the market price listed in the paper. Could this be an accident? No, because he said ARCO's postings were within 15 to 30 cents per barrel of the others, and at least $4 to $5 below what was accepted as fair market value for crude. 
   What he said was all of the majors were doing this. This 5 percent that we say are doing the wrong thing were within a few cents of each other, and all of them, according to him, were $4 to $5 below the fair market price. That is even more than we said, $2 to $4. He says in a certain period of time they were $4 to $5 below market price. 
   Under penalty of perjury, a man with the inside knowledge of what was going on, said that ARCO and the other ``posters''--meaning the posted price people--never raised the posted price to the market value. We see that is true. We plotted the market price during that period and here is the posted price. He says all of our calculations, all the public information on refined values relating to California crudes say the fair market value was well in excess of the posting. 
   That is another way of putting it: The fair market value was well in excess; it was more than the posted prices that they put down. 
   He said, and this is really interesting, he was:  
   ..... not being truthful 5 years ago when he testified in a deposition that ARCO's posted prices represented fair market value.  
   So the man admits that he wasn't truthful before in court. He is cleansing his soul and he is now telling the truth. He goes on to say, and this is chilling, in explanation for why he lied about the fair market value:  
   I was an ARCO employee. Some of the issues being discussed were still being litigated.  
   Listen to this. He says:  
   My plan was to get to retirement. We had seen numerous occasions where the nail that stood up got beaten down.  
   What does that mean? Someone who had the courage to stand up in the face of the higher-ups and tell the truth that they were cheating taxpayers got beaten down. Harry Anderson said that. It is pretty chilling. He goes on. He said:  
   The senior executives of ARCO had the judgment that they would take the money, accrue for the day of judgment, and that's what we did.  
   What does he mean by that, ``take the money'' and wait ``for the day of judgment?'' 
   What he means is they would lie about the value of the oil, not give the true market value, pay less of a royalty, pocket the money, and wait for the judgment day. 
   Maybe the judgment day is here, I say to my friends. Maybe if this Senate has some courage, we can stop this fraud today. We will not be stopping it if we approve the Hutchison amendment, I will say that. Mr. Anderson said he was afraid he would lose his retirement if he didn't go along with the game. Mr. Anderson said the other executives said: What the heck, we'll just lie about this and we'll wait for the judgment day. That is a translation of what he said. He goes on to say even more chilling things. He goes on to say:  
   I would not have been there in any capacity had I continued to exercise the right they had given me to dissent to the process during the discussion stage.  
   Let me repeat that:  
   I would not have been there in any capacity had I continued to exercise the right they had given me to dissent to the process during the discussion stage.  
   In other words, Mr. Anderson is saying if I blew the whistle, I would be gone. If I did not go along with this scheme--and we now know seven schemes--that he would be gone. He says further:  
   Once we made our decisions, the ranks closed.  
   So they sat around, decided to wait for the judgment day, and people like Harry Anderson who were afraid for their retirement went along with the scheme. Then he says: Once we made our decision we closed ranks. That was the deal. 
   He says further:  
   I did not get to be a manager and remain a manager being oblivious and blind to signals.  
   What an ethic. What an ethic. Where is the corporate responsibility, when they have someone who is honest in their ranks and he is afraid to talk because he will get fired, he won't get his retirement? When he talks up about how the company underpaid oil royalties, he is finished. So he doesn't talk up. And he is feeling guilty and he is carrying this on his back. He comes clean in a lawsuit where he just says: I 
   was afraid of losing my job if I told the truth. 
   We are going to protect that kind of behavior by the oil companies by voting for this amendment? I pray not. I pray not. I really hope some of the folks who voted for cloture to bring this debate to a close will join me on the substance of this thing. I have never in all my years in politics--and I have been in politics so long I am embarrassed to tell you that I was elected the first time in 1976. I have seen a lot of things. I have seen issues that were cloudy. I have seen issues where the line between right and wrong was fudged. They say every issue has two sides. This one does. The oil companies versus the people. That is the two sides. 
   The Interior Department wants to make sure the oil companies pay their fair share so the people get their fair share. We will show you the money again; the money, what is at stake here. If we do not vote down the Hutchison amendment, the people of America will have lost $154 million. 
   Let's suppose you do not even like to spend it on national parks; you don't want to spend it in classrooms. How about paying down the debt? I will bet a lot of folks think that is a good idea. But, no, if we vote for the Hutchison amendment, we lose a cumulative $154 million. 
   I want to read into the RECORD a letter I just received from the Consumer Federation of America. First, I want to say a word about the groups that have really worked hard to defeat this Hutchison amendment. I just told you before there are two sides on this amendment: the oil companies versus the people of the United States of America. I believe that in my heart. We have over 50 groups that are helping us defeat this amendment. Every one of them is worthy of mention, but I do not have time at this point to mention them all, so I will mention some of them: 
   The American Association of Educational Service Agencies--they know they are being robbed of education funds by this amendment. They oppose it. The American Association of School Administrators, the American Federation of Government Employees, the  American Federation of Teachers--they have to be in the classrooms with the books that don't measure up, without computers. They want to fight for this. They are against the Hutchison amendment. 
   American Rivers, Americans for Clean Energy, the Arkansas State Lands Commission, the California State Superintendent of Public Instruction, the Clean Fuels Foundation, Common Cause. Common Cause understands what is at stake here. They agree with Senator FEINGOLD when he stood up--and they tried to gag him when he said there is a tie-in between this amendment and the campaign finances where big special interests like the tobacco companies, the oil companies, you name it, have an incredible amount of influence. Again, even if everyone was pure of heart it looks terrible to see the special interests win on these. 
   The Better Government Association is with us, the Colorado State Board of Land Commissioners, the Consumer Project on Technology--they know they need technology in schools--Defenders of Wildlife. It is an incredible list. The Friends of the Earth, the Gray Panthers--they are the elderly. They understand we need to support our parks and our kids and our schools; the Montana Department of Natural Resources and Conservation. 
   I am just on the M's, and this goes all the way to the W's. 
   I want to comment on one of the organizations that has worked so hard with me and others on this, U.S. Public Interest Research Group, U.S. PIRG. They have worked very diligently talking with colleagues, and we have kept this fight alive because of these people. We have kept this fight on the front pages of some of the newspapers because of these people. Hopefully, tonight we will see it on TV. 
   The Washington State Lands Commissioner; the Wilderness Society; the Wisconsin Secretary of State and Chair, Board of Commissioners of Public Lands--this is an incredible list. I left out the N's and the P's, and I will have to get back to them later. 
   Today, I have a new letter from the Consumer Federation of America. Let me read it. This is one of the foremost consumer groups in the country. I have to say it is now headed by a beloved colleague, Howard Metzenbaum, who served here as the voice of the consumers for so long, the voice for the people who do not have a voice, the voice for the people who have to get up in the morning and go to work, 
   the people who cannot afford to send their lobbyists here and the people who cannot afford campaign contributions. 
   What does he say in this letter?  
   The Consumer Federation of America joins you in opposing the Hutchison-Domenici rider to [this bill]. [The organization] is concerned about the decline in accountability of many corporations to the needs and concerns of consumers, communities, and national interests. This rider is a case study in this lack of accountability, not to mention an unjustified subsidy by the taxpayers to the [big] oil companies. 
   According to the Department of Interior, eighteen oil companies have consistently undervalued the cost of oil drilled on federal land to avoid paying [their royalty payments] of about $66 million a year.  
   He goes on to say we have already lost $88 million and that this amendment of Senator HUTCHISON will, in fact, delay the Department of the Interior--even a better word--``prohibit the Department of Interior from finalizing their regulations'' to require the oil companies to pay their royalties based on the fair market price of the oil, not on a lower price established by the oil companies themselves. 
   Howard Metzenbaum said it as straight as one can. They are paying royalties on their made-up price rather than on the market price. 
   He goes on to say that the Consumer Federation of America opposes this rider for two reasons. 
   One:  
   The undervaluation of oil drilled on Federal land amounts to nothing more than corporate welfare. The practice represents an unjustified subsidy, especially to the larger oil companies that are in a position to reap huge returns from oil drilled on Federal land.  
   Second:  
   Taxpayers must pick up the tab for this subsidy, to the tune of tens of millions of dollars a year.  
   He goes on to say:  
   The Consumer Federation of America applauds you for your efforts to insure that taxpayers receive a fair return from federal oil sales.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, we are in quite a situation here, and I am going to go through some of the charts I have not gone through up to this time. 
   When we talk about the money we will lose because of the Hutchison amendment--and I find it ironic we are doing an appropriations bill to appropriate money for the various functions therein, including national parks, including very important functions, such as preserving historic monuments--we realize we are losing $66 million, and I told you that money can go pretty far. It will affect many States. 
   My staff has been extraordinary in terms of all the research and all the work they have put into this issue. I thank Jodi Linker, Matthew Baumgart, and the rest of my staff, and Liz Tankersley and Dave Sandretti who helped us. When you are hit with an issue such as this and you know you have an uphill battle, it takes a good staff to keep on keeping on, to keep on keeping up with the issues, and they do. I am so grateful to them. 
   Today I have a new chart. It shows the 11 most endangered historic sites in America. What is very interesting about this is that these buildings qualify for Federal funds to preserve them. As we go into the next millennium, we start thinking about our heritage, our great Nation. One of the things we have to do is restore these incredible monuments to our history. There are 11 of them. They desperately are seeking, not Susan, but funding. They must have funding because they are old and they will otherwise fall apart. 
   I was at one such monument. It is not 1 of the 11 great ones. It is a small one. But it is in a little town north of my home, Sonoma County. It is a round barn. I never really knew what a round barn was, but it is famous. In the 1800s, they used to take the horses and run them around in this barn. We only have a couple left in California. This one is falling apart. It needs a few dollars. So when people say $66 million, let's look at these 11. 
   The Senator from Illinois is here, and I point out to him that one of these endangered landmarks, as I remember, is in Illinois. I wonder if he realizes--and I know he does--that some of this funding that would otherwise go to the Interior Department and we are not going to see if the Hutchison amendment is adopted could go to help one of the monuments in his State, which is the Pullman Administration Building and factory complex, in Pullman, IL, which dates back to 1890. 
   All of these are very endangered. We see one in Rochester, NY, the Monroe Theater. We see one in Louisville, KY, a beautiful place called Robinswood. We see one in Cleveland, MT, Lancaster, PA, barn shadow, ``Lost Barn.'' We see the Allen Auditorium in Alaska and, in my own State, the incredible Angel Island Immigration Station through which many of our ancestors came. In New York State, there are four national historic landmark hospitals. There is one in Hudson Valley. It is a beautiful one. One is in Baltimore, west side of downtown Baltimore, Chinatown. It is endangered. 
   I say to my colleagues, when we are fighting against this amendment, we are, in fact, saying it is not fair for 5 percent of the oil companies to do the wrong thing, to defraud the people of the United States of America of their money; it is wrong to do that. 
   There are other uses for this money. We believe even if all those uses did not have support, paying down the debt would be better than allowing this big ripoff to continue. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor and retain my time. 
   Mr. DURBIN addressed the Chair.

   Mrs. BOXER. I appreciate the Senator's outrage on this. 
   It is incredible. Some of our colleagues have come up and said things privately such as: I can't believe you're attacking these oil companies. 
   I want to make a point and make sure my friend saw this. I read from a complaint that was filed by two whistleblowers from big oil--ARCO, as it happens. In their words--these are not words from the Senator from Illinois or words from the Senator from California, who has been told she doesn't know what she is talking about. If I don't, I believe people who have worked in the oil companies for many years. I want to make sure my friend has heard this. I am going to read to him a little piece of the introduction to this complaint and ask him if he has read it before, and even though he might not have, if he could comment on it. 
   This is an introduction to a lawsuit being filed by two whistleblowers. These are two people who worked for ARCO, big executives in ARCO, who had in their heart, I think--these are my words, not theirs--the need to tell the truth about what went on inside those corporate walls. This is what they say. They say:  
   [There was] a nationwide conspiracy by some of the world's largest oil companies to shortchange the United States of America of hundreds of millions of dollars in revenues--known as royalties--derived from the production of crude oil .....  
   They go on to say:  
   [There was] a pattern and practice of carefully developed and coordinated schemes--  
   They outline seven schemes--  
   targeted to defraud the United States of its lawful share of oil royalties .....  
   They go on to say: ``This is an ongoing conspiracy.'' 
   So I ask my friend this direct question: about his outrage he exhibits on this floor. Isn't there a reason for anyone with a set of eyes and a brain to match to be outraged when not just one whistleblower but two and three and four and more people who got high-paid salaries admit that they sat around and defrauded the taxpayers, and that this amendment would allow that outrage to continue--does that not reflect my friend's views?

There is a chart up there on the Long Beach jury verdict where Harry Anderson, one of the most important whistleblowers, was quoted. That isn't even a case about Federal royalties. This debate, I want to point it out, is about Federal royalties. The one case they ever won was based on State royalties. You don't have to pay your State royalties based on fair market value. 
   I thank my friend.

   Mrs. BOXER. Because I think it dovetails with the Senator's question about the States. 
   I say to my friends from Massachusetts and Nevada, maybe some Senators on this floor do not care about this, but the States do care about this. The States have sued the oil companies because of this continuous undervaluation of these oil royalty payments. I say to my friend, it is outrageous that we do not fix this problem today. The States have sued to the tune of $5 billion because they need this money. 
   What we will do, if this amendment is agreed to, I say to both of my friends, is continue this undervaluation, continue these lawsuits where the States have to sue, rather than allow Secretary Babbitt and the Interior Department to fix this problem.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, understanding the Senator from Michigan now has about 9 minutes remaining, I want to ask him a couple of questions. 
   First, I thank him very much for his contributions to this debate. I know my friend from Michigan is very meticulous. He was interested in finding a specific case to point to where oil was drilled on very similar lands very close to each other where the oil companies listed different market prices. He asked the Interior Department for that. It was a struggle to get it, and he got it. 
   I say to my friend, if he can hold up the ARCO chart, I want to try to translate what he has taught us in the specifics to the more general, which is this: Does my friend from Michigan not conclude, after his presentation, there is convincing evidence that a small percentage of the oil companies--namely, those that are integrated and wind up having the first point of sale essentially with themselves--have been consistently undervaluing the price of the oil on which they pay their royalties, and that, in fact, what happens then is that the taxpayers who, as my friend has pointed out, own this land, it belongs to the people of the United States of America, thereby get cheated by that differential? And that is explained on the chart. In other words, the market price is continuously higher than the oil company's posted price, the price on which these 5 percent of the companies pay the royalties. Is that not a fair summary of what is happening?

   Mrs. BOXER. I thank my friend, again, as he runs off to a very important meeting, and say he is so right. A royalty is not a tax; it is an agreement. It is a payment made by oil companies that have the privilege of drilling on the property which belongs to the United States of America. Those funds go to the Federal Treasury. Part of them go to the State treasury, and they are used for environmental purposes and for purposes of education. 
   I would like to complete my time that remains at this point--reserving the remainder that I have. I have a long time left. I do not intend to use all of that time. I hope soon we will have a chance to make an agreement when this would come to an end, this whole debate. We are not there yet. We are finding out how many colleagues want to come over. 
   But there was a comment made on the floor about the Senator from California by a few of my colleagues. I do not mind them saying whatever they wish. I do not have any desire to stop them because I can take care of myself. But I want to respond to the statements that were made. 
   The point we have been making consistently on our side is that when the oil companies do not pay their fair share of royalties, the Treasury is robbed of funds that are necessary for the environment and for education. My colleagues said--particularly Senator CRAIG said; and he did not give me the chance to respond, so I want to respond now--that Senator BOXER here is complaining that the oil companies aren't paying their fair share of royalties, and yet she leads the fight against offshore oil drilling in her State--which, by the way, I am extremely proud he mentioned--and she does not want to cut down our trees--which I am very happy to mention because I think that is our heritage. 
   The point is, that is not what this is about because this Senator from California wants a strong California economy. What that means is, you preserve the forest, you preserve the beautiful redwood trees, you preserve the beautiful environment. Because if you allow indiscriminate and additional offshore oil drilling--we have plenty going on right now. How many leases? Forty leases are being drilled. If we allow more, it destroys our economy. 
   Tourism is our No. 1 important economic resource, so if we destroy that, we are done for. So by my fighting to limit offshore oil drilling, by my fighting not to allow indiscriminate cutting down of beautiful old-growth trees, I am, in fact, preserving the economy and increasing the revenues that go to my State. 
   What are we left with? We are left with what the oil companies have to pay for the offshore oil tracts that they are drilling and the onshore oil tracts that they are drilling currently. This isn't an argument about new drilling. This isn't an argument about new cutting down of trees. This is an argument about the status quo. We have many leases in California that are being drilled. 
   We expect the oil companies to be good public citizens. We expect the oil companies to pay their fair share. The good news is that 95 percent of them are paying their fair share. Good for them. They are good corporate citizens. They are doing the right thing. There are about 777 oil companies that are doing the right thing, that are paying the fair market value. Unfortunately, there are about 44 companies that are not. 
   The Hutchison amendment, which is supported by the Senator from New Mexico, and many others, allows those 44 companies to continue to underpay this royalty payment. It is time to put a stop to this, my friends. I hope we will do that. I am not very hopeful, in essence, that this will happen, but maybe some people listening to this debate will have a change of heart, and maybe in the vote we will get into the 40s today. Maybe that will send a signal that this is a tough call. 
   I see my friend from New Mexico has come to the floor, and under the unanimous consent agreement, my friend from Texas now has full right to give her time to anyone she wants at 4:15. So I yield the floor and get it back at 5:15. 
   I thank my colleagues for their patience. 
   Mrs. HUTCHISON addressed the Chair.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I have seen so many tears on behalf of the mom-and-pop oil companies that will be impacted if the Department of the Interior can do their job and collect the fair royalties. I looked at my chart again to make sure I was not misunderstanding. I will talk about the top seven companies that will be impacted by this rule: 
   Shell: Their total revenues are $29 billion. I cannot remember when they were mom and pop. Maybe someday way back they were. 
   Exxon: The real mom and pop, $134 billion in revenues. 
   Chevron: $43 billion in revenues. 
   Texaco: $45 billion in revenues. 
   Marathon: $16 billion in revenues. 
   Mobil Exploration and Production, U.S.: $81 billion. 
   Conoco: $20 billion. 
   And it goes on. 
   The good news is that the small oil companies my friend from Kansas talked about are doing the right thing. Ninety-five percent of the oil companies are doing the right thing and paying their fair share of royalties. It is 5 percent of the companies, the largest companies, the vertically integrated companies, that are failing to pay their fair share. 
   When we see these tears for the oil companies, I assure my friends, the small companies are doing the right thing; they are paying their fair share. It is the big ones that are not. We know they are involved in a deliberate scheme. We have that in testimony. All we are trying to do is stop them from continuing to rip off the taxpayers. 
   The Hutchison amendment so far has lost taxpayers $88 million. This one will lose them $66 million. That is $154 million, and there is no end in sight. If you think this one will not be back next year--I don't know. We know the Senator originally had a much longer period of time on her amendment. She cut it back to about a year, but this thing has no end. This is the fourth time it has come up. There is no effort to resolve this situation. 
   I want to talk about some of the comments made by some of my colleagues, and I ask that the RECORD show Democrats lodged no objection when the Senator from Oklahoma started to talk about the Presidential pardon of a few weeks ago. What does that have to do with this? We did not object. He made his point. It was fine. We know when you start talking about  something off the topic, it is because you really are using the debate time. We are happy. You can talk about what you want. 
   But five times the Senator from Wisconsin was interrupted when he tried to tie this amendment to oil company contributions. He did not do that; the New York Times did it. USA Today, which I would like to show, did it. The Los Angeles Times tied oil contributions to this amendment. And then, oh, they were shocked and Republican colleagues tried to stop Senator FEINGOLD from talking about it. 
   I will read what USA Today says. They say:  
   Big oil has contributed more than $35 million to national political committees and congressional candidates ..... a modest investment in protecting the royalty-pricing arrangement that's enabled the industry to pocket an extra $2 billion.  
   Senator FEINGOLD was simply talking about what USA Today talked about and what the New York Times on September 20 talked about. I will read what they say. New York Times:  
   Battle Waged in the Senate Over Royalties by Oil Firms 
   Oil companies drilling on Federal land have been accused of habitually underpaying royalties they owe the Government. Challenged in court, they have settled lawsuits, agreeing to pay $5 billion. 
   The Interior Department wants to rectify the situation by making the companies pay royalties based on the market price of the oil, instead of on a lower price set by the oil companies themselves.  
   They say:  
   A simple issue? Not in the United States Senate.  
   And they track oil company contributions. 
   All I can say is, it is a legitimate thing to talk about, but five times the Senator from Wisconsin was interrupted making the point. 
   I also want to respond to the fact that royalties are not a tax. If they were a tax, they would be in the Finance Committee. Royalties are an agreement the oil companies sign voluntarily for the privilege of drilling on land that belongs to the people of the United States of America. 
   And for that privilege, they pay a small portion over to us, the taxpayers, to be used for parks and recreation, historical preservation, and in the States for education. Royalties are not a tax. If they were a tax, it would be in the Finance Committee. 
   Let me also thank my colleagues on the other side of the aisle for bringing up the States. They argue for States rights day in and day out. You know what. I agree with them on this one. Let's hear what the States are saying.

   Mrs. BOXER. This letter is signed by the State Lands Commissioners from these States: California, South Dakota, New Mexico, Arkansas, Montana, Washington State, Colorado, and Wisconsin. That is a sample. That is just this letter. 
   What do they want? They want the Interior Department to be able to correct this problem. They oppose the Hutchison amendment, these people from these States. 
   We also have comments by the Commissioner of the Alaska Department of Natural Resources, who says:  
   The approach taken by MMS [Department of Interior's Minerals Management Service] ..... will better protect Alaska's interests.  
   They oppose the Hutchison amendment. 
   We heard from the Arkansas Commissioner of State Lands in a letter to Senators LOTT and DASCHLE:  
   The Department's comprehensive proposal is the logical alternative to posted prices.  
   They oppose the Hutchison amendment. 
   California, the city of Long Beach:  
   I urge you ..... to support [MMS] regulations .....  
   They oppose the Hutchison amendment. 
   Colorado, Mark Davis, Minerals Director:  
   This delay is costing taxpayers $5 million per month.  
   He opposes the Hutchison amendment. 
   Louisiana:  
   To sum up, [the department in Louisiana] is supportive of MMS' attempt to value ..... production in a more certain, timely, and accurate manner .......  
   Montana, a letter from the Supervisor of the Federal Royalty Program:  
   ..... Montana believes that the rule is ready and should be finalized.  
   That was in 1998. 
   New Mexico:  
   It is our fervent hope that Congress will act so as not to extend the current moratorium prohibiting the Department of Interior from issuing a final rulemaking.  
   North Dakota: This is from Robert Olheiser, North Dakota Commissioner of University and School Lands, in a letter to Senators LOTT and DASCHLE:  
   The Department's Minerals Management Service has been eminently fair in proposing [these] regulations.   
   It goes on. 
   We have a letter from Texas. We have a letter from South Dakota, Washington, Wisconsin. 
   I see that my friend from Florida is on the floor. I will stop when he is prepared to begin his remarks. 
   Let me just say at this time--and then I will make concluding arguments when the Senator from Florida has completed in the remainder of the time--that we have a problem on our hands with 5 percent of the oil companies. 
   We have to do justice. We have to do what is right. We have to listen to the whistleblowers who are risking themselves to come out and tell us there are schemes going on to deprive taxpayers of these royalty payments. We have to do the right thing. We have to listen to the States, the Consumer Federation of America--and how many groups? more than 50 groups--that stand in the public interest and say no to the Hutchison amendment. 
   Now I yield the remainder of the time until a quarter of to 
   the good Senator from Florida, Mr. BOB GRAHAM.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I thank my colleague, Senator HUTCHISON, for working so well with me so we can, in an orderly way, get this vote. 
   I want to say to my friend from Florida before he leaves the floor that I know he has more to say on this, and that he has raised issues that are so important to this debate. 
   First, he raised the issue of process. He raises the point that this amendment doesn't belong here. It certainly does not. 
   As a matter of fact, originally it was stripped from the bill, and it came back in a rather clever way. 
   I give my colleague credit for passing the test. But it is making appropriations on a bill. My colleague makes that point. 
   Second, he makes a very important point on the substance. This issue about whether a royalty is a tax, he knows. He is on the Finance Committee. If this was a tax, he would be dealing with it. 
   He himself raises a crucial issue that was given short shrift by my friend from Texas, and that is, why are we here? Who do we fight for? And shouldn't it be for our children, our grandchildren, and their children? I  think he says it in very sweeping terms. 
   He also points out very clearly the specific problems that we face in the shortfall of our national parks, and the fact that these funds, when collected from the oil companies, go into the Land and Water Conservation Fund. 
   I thank the Senator. 
   I also want to thank Senators DURBIN, FEINGOLD, REID, WELLSTONE, DORGAN, LEVIN, HARKIN, KENNEDY, DASCHLE, BYRD, AKAKA, CLELAND, and CONRAD for yielding me time. This has meant a lot to me personally. 
   But it also is telling that Senators would take their time and come to the floor to speak from their heart. And they did. 
   I believe at the end of the day we have shown that the facts are on our side. I believe we have the arguments on our side that have been made by the consumer groups. I think the people who care about the environment are on our side. The legal precedents and settlements are on our side. Most of the States that are affected by this are on our side. I have read them into the RECORD. So if it is about States rights, we have the RECORD. The former oil executives under penalty of perjury and putting themselves on the line testified that we are right, and that there has been not one scheme but seven schemes to defraud the people of their money from royalties. 
   I think we have proven that we have the arguments on our side. 
   I am happy that we had this debate. To me, this is what the Senate should be about, and one of our colleagues from Oklahoma denigrated this debate. He said it didn't fit the Senate. He said that, in a way. I think this debate is important for the Senate. 
   But I want to wind up by picking up on a statement made by the Senator from Montana. He is a good debater. And he ``gets with you.'' I like to hear him. What he said in the debate was basically, to me and the people on my side, ``Get a life.'' He said, ``Get a life.'' 
   I want to talk about my life for a minute. I want to talk about what my professional life is about. I want to assure the Senator from Montana that I have a life. As a Senator, what I try to do with my life is to find purpose in it by fighting for the people of my State and the people of this country by taking 
   their side against the special interests when I believe the special interests are wrong. 
   If I believe the special interests are right, I will fight for them, if they are on the side of the people. I said earlier, and I will repeat now, there are two sides to this debate on this amendment. There are. The oil company has one side and the people have the other. I stand on the side of the people. 
   So I have a life. I try to make my life about justice. 
   My colleagues could have a different view of justice. I respect them tremendously if they do. But, to me, this is a matter of justice. 
   Why do I say it? I say it because we know something bad is going on when two former oil executives filed a lawsuit and described very clearly the seven schemes by the oil companies to defraud the taxpayers. 
   Quoting from them, they say:  
   There is a nationwide conspiracy by some of the world's largest oil companies to short change the United States of America of hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue.  
   That is not the Senator from California. It is not the Senator from Massachusetts. It is not the Senator from Florida. It is two former oil executives who spell out the seven schemes of the oil companies. 
   We know that there have been settlements all over the country--$5 billion worth of settlements by seven States. 
   Why would these oil companies be settling all over this country? In Alaska, for $3.7 billion; in California, for $345 million. It goes on--in Texas, for $30 million. The State of Texas brought suit. The State of Texas sued the oil companies. And guess what happened. The oil company didn't want to go to court. They settled for $30 million; New Mexico, for $6 million. It goes on. 
   Now these oil companies are settling because they know they don't have a leg to stand on in court because they signed an agreement to pay royalties at fair market value. The Mineral Management Service at the Department of the Interior caught them. They want to fix the problem. 
   This is the fourth time this Senate is interfering in that. I love this Senate too much to see that happen. It is the oil companies versus the people. I want to be on the side of the people. 
   I think this has been a very good debate. We have covered all the issues very well. I want to thank the media for getting involved. We have seen some very strong stories in the last few days on this. I think the original editorial written by USA Today is still the best. USA Today said: ``Time to clean up Big Oil's slick deal with Congress.'' Those are tough words. Those are ugly words. I am sad to say, I agree. We can clean it up today. We can vote against this amendment and clean it up and have a good editorial. Wouldn't Members love to see an editorial tomorrow, ``Congress cleans up its act, tells the oil companies to pay their fair share of royalties.'' I would be excited to see that headline. I don't think we will see it. 
   This issue will not go away as long as my colleagues and I are here. I think it is clear. The editorial says the taxpayers have been getting the unfair end of this deal for far too long. Congress should protect the public interest. 
   That is what this is about. We have heard every argument in the book: The Interior Department is terrible, Mineral Management is terrible, people in the Interior Department are terrible. Everybody is terrible. Everybody is terrible. 
   The people who are causing the trouble, the 5 percent of the oil companies that are not paying their fair share, are robbing this Federal Treasury of almost $6 million per month. That is a lot of money. Ask any constituent what they would do with $6 million a month, and they would have a pretty good list. 
   Sad to say, this money that is not going into the Treasury because of this amendment could have gone to the classrooms of the States, could have gone into the Land and Water Conservation Fund, and been spent on the kinds of things Senator GRAHAM, Senator DURBIN, and many of our colleagues have pointed out need attention. 
   We are coming to the end of this debate. I urge my colleagues, in the name of fairness and justice, to vote against the Hutchison amendment. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I voted against cloture on the Stewart nomination because the process that brought us to this vote has, to date, prevented the Senate from even considering the nominations of several other judicial nominees who have been waiting far longer than has Mr. Stewart. 
   Richard Paez and Marsha Berzon, two nominees for the 9th Circuit, have both been reported by the Judiciary Committee and have been on the Senate Executive Calendar since July. But, more important, their nominations have been pending in the Senate for years--2 years in the case of Ms. Berzon and three years for Judge Paez! 
   It is patently unfair to ignore these fine nominations while moving forward on the Stewart nomination. I have no problem with Mr. Stewart, as far as I know. But this is an important process question, and I simply had no choice but to vote no on cloture on Stewart until we are assured of also moving ahead with those nominations which have been pending far longer.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I seek recognition because my comments follow on the same topic as the Senator from Utah, who I know wants very much to have a juvenile justice bill. But as I listened to his comments, I fear that perhaps we are not headed in the right direction with that legislation. 
   Yesterday, I know that all of us were shocked, as all Americans were, to hear about a gunman walking into the back of a church in Ft. Worth, TX, killing six people, wounding seven, and then killing himself. 
   I have a very simple message for my colleagues. If you can't feel safe from gun violence in the sanctuary of your church, where can you feel safe? 
   On Tuesday, in a story in my home State, not even widely reported, a man walked into the West Anaheim Medical Center and killed three hospital workers because he was grief stricken that his mother died in that hospital. He went on the hunt for particular nurses. If you can't feel safe from gun violence in a hospital in America, where can you feel safe? 
   What seems like yesterday is actually a couple of months now when in the Los Angeles region of California a crazed man walked into a Jewish center where there was a child care operation and shot his weapon. I will never forget the picture of the police holding the hands of that tiny little toddler as they tried to escape from the situation. 
   These are memories that are imprinted in our minds. If we don't do anything about it in this Senate, we do not deserve to 
   call ourselves the Senate, let alone the greatest deliberative body in the world. 
   I feared, as I listened to the comments of the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, he seems to be saying that if we insist on modest gun control measures that are already in the Senate version, somehow we are playing politics. 
   I want to say right here in the most straightforward way I can that it is not playing politics to say we should keep guns out of the hands of criminals and people who are mentally disturbed and out of the hands of children. That is not playing politics. That is doing what needs to be done in America in 1999 going into the next century. 
   The modest gun control measures that we passed on this floor of the Senate--those modest measures that the Vice President cast the tie breaking vote for--are common sense and close the gun show loophole that allows criminals and mentally unbalanced people to walk into a gun show and immediately get a weapon. It is common sense to stop that. 
   Senator LAUTENBERG's amendment would do so. 
   Senator FEINSTEIN's amendment on banning the importation of high-capacity ammunition clips which are used in semiautomatic weapons--common sense. 
   Senator KOHL's amendment requiring that child safety devices be sold with every handgun--common sense. 
   My own amendment asking the FTC and the Attorney General to study the extent to which the gun industry markets to children--common sense. 
   The Ashcroft amendment making it illegal to sell or give a semiautomatic weapon to anyone under the age of 18--that is all we did in that bill. 
   Yet we have the chairman of the Judiciary Committee out here talking as if, my goodness, those measures were political. 
   Listen. I don't think the American people can stand this anymore. 
   In closing my remarks, I am going to mention some of the shootings that took place in 1999. 
   January 14, office building, Salt Lake City, Utah, one dead, one injured; 
   March 18, law office, Johnson City, Tennessee, two dead; 
   April 15, Mormon Family History Library, Salt Lake City, Utah, three dead, including gunman (who was shot by police), four injured; 
   April 20, Columbine High School, Littleton, Colorado, 15 dead, including the two teenage gunmen, 23 injured; 
   May 20, Heritage High School, Conyers, Georgia, six injured; 
   June 3, grocery story, Las Vegas, Nevada, four dead; 
   June 11, psychiatrist's clinic, Southfield, Michigan, three dead, including the gunman, four injured; 
   July 12, private home, Atlanta, Georgia, seven dead, including the gunman; 
   July 29, two brokerage firms, Atlanta, Georgia, 10 dead, including the gunman, 13 injured; 
   August 5, two office buildings, Pelham, Alabama, three dead; 
   August 10, North Valley Jewish Community Center, Los Angeles, California, five injured (Postal worker killed later); 
   September 14, West Anaheim Medical Center, Anaheim, California, three dead; and, just last night, 
   September 15, Wedgwood Baptist Church, Fort Worth, Texas, seven dead, including gunman, seven injured. 
   That is a partial list. 
   We have to do something. We have the opportunity. What are we waiting for? I have to say that if we cannot vote out these modest gun control proposals which are common sense, and if we cannot pick up some votes from the other side of the aisle, including the President who is sitting in the Chair, if we can't do that, we should be ashamed to go home and say we did the people's business. 
   Thank you very much.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I will vote in favor of S.J. Res. 33, a resolution which disapproves of the President's decision to grant conditional  clemency for certain individuals who were convicted of crimes related to the activities of the Armed Forces for National Liberation and a splinter group called the Macheteros. 
   However, I am disappointed that this issue was turned into a partisan, political attack on the President. The original language was inflammatory and too broad, accusing the President of sweeping charges that were misleading and inappropriate. Some of the worst rhetoric has been removed in this version, but in my view it is still too political. 
   In the future, I hope that Congress will prove to more responsible and bipartisan when discussing U.S. counterterrorism policy.

   Mrs. BOXER. I hate to break into the flow of thought, but in listening to my friend from Illinois I am wondering if he is aware that the first President to call attention to the needs of education in modern American history happened to be a Republican named Dwight Eisenhower. Is my friend familiar with his National Defense of Education Act?

   Mrs. BOXER. I think it is an important point. 
   We have a Republican Party today in this Senate that is blocking the Senate from taking action, as my friend has stated, on the 100,000 teachers, on school construction, on afterschool, which they say they support in one vote, and when it comes to putting money down, they are not there. 
   My friend says they call it ``radical.'' President Eisenhower, when I was a youngster in the 1950s, said we could have all the missiles in the world on our side, we could have all the bombs and all the military people, but if we didn't have an educated workforce that understood how to use the equipment, if we didn't have an educated workforce to be productive, America wouldn't be what she must be, the leader of the free world. 
   I merely interrupted my friend to ask him if he recalled that interesting fact, when Dwight Eisenhower said we had to do something as a Federal Government. Some people said, wait a minute, education is a State matter. He made a couple of points: A, you can't be a strong leader if you don't have educated kids; B, the States can't do everything; they need Congress to come in when there is a national problem. We can't come in for every little thing, but if we don't have enough teachers, that is a national problem. Afterschool is a national problem; early education, a national problem. 
   The States are saying they need our help. 
   I yield back to my friend. I would love to hear his comments on the irony of this modern-day Republican Party and this Senate essentially turning against what a wonderful Republican President of the United States, Dwight Eisenhower, said about education.

   The stateside program has, once again (since fiscal year 1995) been zeroed-out. Our amendment provides $20 million for this popular program. 
   As the 21st century approaches, we must renew our commitment to our natural heritage. That commitment must go beyond a piecemeal approach. It must be a comprehensive, long-term strategy to ensure that when our children's children enter the 22d century, they can herald our actions today, as we revere those of President Roosevelt. 
   And preservation in the 21st century goes beyond protection of such wonders as Yosemite and Yellowstone. It must include an urban park in East Los Angeles where children can play basketball, a farm in Tulare County that can continue to grow oranges or a historic building in Orange County that can be restored. 
   Today, our natural heritage is disappearing at an alarming rate. Each year, nearly 3 million acres of farmland and more than 170,000 acres of wetlands disappear. Each day, over 7,000 acres of open space are lost forever. 
   Across America, parks are closing, recreational facilities deteriorating, open spaces vanishing, historic structures crumbling. 
   Why is this happening? Because there is no dedicated funding source for all these noble purposes--a source which can be used only for these noble purposes. 
   I have offered a comprehensive bill--Resources 2000--that provides the most sweeping commitment to protecting America's natural heritage in more than 30 years. It will establish a dedicated funding source for resource protection. 
   But until such legislation is enacted, we must do what we can to fund these important programs now. This amendment does just that. 
   This amendment will provide $20 million for the stateside portion of the Land and Water Conservation Fund. 
   This is an important amendment for the future of our local communities, our quality of life, the recreational opportunities of our families and the preservation of our important lands. 
   The Land and Water Conservation Fund is a fund that was developed out of a bargain between the development of the offshore oil and the preservation of nonrenewable assets in our communities and throughout our Nation. 
   Since 1965, we have appropriated some $3 billion to local governments, States and local governments, to help them protect and conserve these assets. States and local governments have matched that with an additional $3 billion. That match tells us the kind of 
   priority that our local communities place upon this program. 
   Unfortunately, in 1995 it all stopped and Congress failed to appropriate money for the program. One of the most successful programs that we have at the Federal level stopped. Since that time, if had provided the money that this program was truly entitled to, there would have been an additional $2.5 billion that would have then been matched by another $2.5 billion in non-federal dollars. That would be $5 billion going toward improving quality of life and protecting and conserving natural resources based upon the priorities of those local communities. 
   Mr. President, every state across the Nation benefits from this program. I have here a book put together by the National Recreation and Park Association listing hundreds of projects in every state that are in dire need of this funding. 
   In my State of California, we have used stateside funding to team up with local sponsors to purchase areas of  Redwoods State Park, the Santa Monica Mountains, Lake Tahoe and San Deguito Park. But there is still more that needs to be done. 
   One project that I requested funding for this year is the Urban Nature Center and Sanctuary in Ernest Debs Park in Los Angeles. This Park would provide nature experiences for some of the city's most underserved children and their families. 
   The National Audubon Society in cooperation with the City of Los Angeles, is developing a model Urban Nature Center in Ernest Debs Regional Park in Northeast Los Angeles. This surprisingly natural, 195-acre site, run by the City's Recreation and Parks Department, is five miles northeast of downtown Los Angeles. It rises above some of the city's densest urban neighborhoods, yet is home to more than 80 species of birds and other wildlife. Within two miles of the park, there are more than 30,000 children, mostly Latino, attending school for whom the park and the nature center could be a giant outdoor classroom. 
   The Nature Center is an exciting opportunity to bring together Audubon's traditional sources of support for conservation education with city, state and federal funds for parks, trails and habitat restoration. For its part in this innovative public/private partnership, the City of Los Angeles will dedicate $1 million in existing County bond funds for habitat enhancement. The Audubon Society is dedicated to raising $4 million in private contributions. I requested $1 million for the federal contribution for this project, but nothing was provided. 
   Mr. President, this is the kind-of thing we are always pushing for--federal/non-federal, public/private collaboration on important projects. And while others are contributing their share, the federal government is doing nothing. This must change. 
   Mr. President, this amendment is a small step toward fulfilling our commitment to the Land and Water Conservation Fund. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.

   Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I have taken the Senate's time on this matter. Here is why: I simply care about the Senate too much to see it be a party to a deliberate scheme by just 5 percent of the oil companies to underpay their royalty payments to our constituents. The Hutchison amendment allows the situation to continue by stopping the Interior Department from fixing it. 
   How do we know taxpayers are being cheated? First, there are many whistleblowers, former oil executives, who say under oath they undervalued the oil from Federal lands in order to pay less. 
   Second, settlements are occurring all over the country whereby these oil companies are paying billions of dollars in back royalties to keep their cases out of court. 
   Senator HUTCHISON has said the Interior Department wants to raise taxes on the oil companies. Royalties are not taxes; they are legal agreements just as your mortgage or rent is. As USA Today says:  
   Imagine if one day you decided to lower your rent by 10 percent. No individual could do that. And yet the oil companies are.  
   You may hear all we need is more time, but this is the fourth rider this Senate has passed, although we have never had a vote on it before. This is the first vote. We have already lost $88 million from the Department of the Interior because of it. These companies should do what 95 percent of them are already doing, base their royalty payments on fair market value. 
   Senator HUTCHISON has said the oil companies are suffering now and it is bad timing to fix this. I voted, and most of us did, for a bill to help the oil companies. That is fine. But royalty payments must be collected and because they are based on fair market value, they do go down when oil prices are depressed. That is a better deal than most Americans get on their mortgages or their rent. 
   You may hear about a court case in California that the oil companies won. But that had nothing to do with Federal oil royalties; it was about State royalties. 
   Finally, the Hutchison amendment is not in the House bill because this is an appropriations bill, and the Hutchison amendment will strip another $66 million out of the Land and Water Conservation Fund. We need those funds very much. Senator HUTCHISON says it is just $10 million. Interior and OMB say $66 million. Regardless, it is a bad rider. I hope you will not vote for cloture.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, thank you very much. 
   I would just like to comment upon the vote the Senate has just taken on whether to shut down debate on the Hutchison amendment. I thank very much those colleagues who voted against that cloture motion. I think it is very important that the light and the truth be shone upon this matter. I think the way to do it is to have more discussion. 
   I just want to say to the Senate that when I made my 2 1/2 -minute presentation, it is always very difficult to say everything in your heart in 2 1/2 minutes. But I said the reason I am doing this--there is no other reason in the world for me to be delaying a vote on an amendment--is that I love the Senate too much to see it be a party to such a scheme by just 5 percent of the oil companies to essentially rob this Treasury of millions and millions of dollars. 
   This is the fourth time that Senator Hutchison has attempted to pass this rider. It never had a Senate vote before. This is the first vote in any way about the Hutchison amendment. 
   By the way, I know that some people who voted aye on the cloture motion will vote with me on the substance. I am looking forward to that. 
   But the bottom line is, when we look at this closely, we see a number of things--that most of the oil companies are doing the right thing on their royalty payments. Ninety-five percent of  them are doing the right thing. They pay the appropriate royalty when they drill on Federal lands, onshore or offshore, and they send that check over to the taxpayers. You know where the funds go--right into the Land and Water Conservation Fund and Historic Preservation Fund to be used for environmental purposes for the upkeep of our parks and for the upkeep of our historical monuments. We all know from both sides of the aisle that we need to do more for our parks and open space. 
   As a matter of fact, there are bipartisan proposals to pass legislation to do that. Yet at the same time, too many people seem willing to shut their eyes to a raid on the Treasury that would lower the revenues to the Land and Water Conservation Fund. 
   You have to ask yourself why the oil companies are so interested in this. I think the answer is in the Record. There have been several whistleblowers who have come forward who have stated in the most eloquent of terms that when they were working for the oil companies, the companies purposely undervalued the oil so that they could pay fewer dollars of royalty payments. 
   As USA Today says, what if we all woke up one day and said: You know, I don't think I am paying a fair amount of rent. Forget about the contract I signed with my landlord. I am just going to cut it back. 
   It wouldn't be too long before that tenant was out on the street, and rightly so. If he or she signed an agreement, they have to pay it. 
   What if one of us decided not to pay our mortgage and just say, let's take 10 or 20 percent off the top? The answer is, if we did that on a continual basis, the banker would take over our home, and rightly so, because we signed an agreement. 
   The oil companies have signed an agreement. They have signed an agreement with the Federal Government, and 95 percent of them are doing the right thing, but 5 percent of them are not. 
   The Interior Department wants to make sure that those 5 percent do the right thing by clarifying the rules that govern these royalty payments. The Hutchison amendment would stop the Interior Department in its tracks from trying to collect the fair royalties. 
   I have used another analogy in this debate before. If somebody came running through the Senate Chamber with a big sack of money that he had just stolen from the Treasury, every one of us on both sides of the aisle would stop that individual. Frankly, this 
   is no different. 
   How do I know that? 
   The whistleblowers have told us so under penalty of perjury that they sat around and said: Let's undervalue this oil and ``wait for the day of judgment.'' That is what one of the whistleblowers actually said. 
   How else do we know there is cheating going on? 
   Look at all the settlements that the oil companies are agreeing to with the various States all throughout our country on this matter. They don't want to go to court. They are afraid they are going to lose because the whistleblowers will get out there--because the facts are there. So they are settling for millions of dollars. 
   Ironically, Mr. President, I think I even sent it to your office on Friday, two more big oil companies are settling this week for over $100 million rather than take their weak case to the court. 
   We know that the posted prices they are paying their royalty on are just made up and they are far less than the market price. 
   All Interior wants to do is fix the situation. 
   You will hear the argument: It is a bureaucracy run amok. Let me say this: You could say that about anything. But the facts belie that statement because the Interior Department has held many meetings. By the way, they have opened up their rule for further comment. 
   All I want to say to my colleagues by way of thanking them for this is that because of your standing with me against this cloture amendment, it means we are going to continue to have the American people focus in on this scam. When they do, they are going to want to know who stood with them 
   or who stood with the vertically integrated oil companies that had been getting away with this robbery. 
   That is all I want. I don't gain anything out of this. There are lots of oil companies in my State. They are not thrilled. This is not something I do to be popular. But if in your heart you know you are right, and if in your heart you don't want to see the Senate associated with this kind of scam, then you have to stand up and be counted. Many of my colleagues, including Senator DURBIN, Senator FEINGOLD, Senator WELLSTONE, and Senator MURRAY, stood with me and entered statements in the RECORD or stood by my side on the floor of the Senate. 
   I say to my friend, Senator HUTCHISON, she was the one who wanted a vote on Monday originally. The vote was supposed to be held on Tuesday. I did not object to an earlier vote. A lot of people came back for the vote. Therefore, of course, I insisted we have a vote. We are going to have another vote. This could be from my perspective a very short-lived victory. It is true, they could come up with the 60 votes. But I feel good tonight. We have courage on this floor. This was not an easy vote. 
   Senator FEINGOLD has taken to the floor. He has shown the biggest contributions have come from oil companies. I understand the power of that. I understand that. It is hard to stand up when these 5 percent--and they are the big ones, the billion-dollar companies--call you on the phone and say: Come on, this is just a procedural matter, stick with us. 
   What will we have in the end? More delay and a $66 million loss to the Treasury on top of the $88 million we have already lost from the Land and Water Conservation Fund. I think if the American people will focus on this, they will thank those colleagues who stood with me today. They are all consumers. They all understand this. 
   There has been a lot of talk on the floor that oil companies are suffering. I was very strongly in support of helping the oil companies and the steel companies that were in trouble. I am the first one to say we need to give them help. But don't allow 5 percent to cheat the taxpayers. That is a different issue. The interesting thing about royalty payments is they go down when there is a depression in all prices. 
   Wouldn't it be nice if our rent went down if there was a depression or we lost our job? Wouldn't it be wonderful if our mortgage automatically went down if there was a recession? That is what happens with these royalty payments. They are very fair. They are based on the fair market value of the oil. There is no set price because we want to be fair to the oil companies. 
   It is a privilege to drill on the people's land. It is a privilege, whether it is offshore or onshore. If it is Federal land, the taxpayers, the American people own that land. We want to make sure we work in a cooperative spirit with those who would like to exploit our resources. Make sure, at the same time, that they are good corporate citizens. What stuns me about this debate is that 95 percent of them are and 5 percent of the oil companies are not. 
   All the Department of the Interior is saying is: Please, let us straighten this mess out with these 5 percent. It is a lot of money to the Treasury, money that is necessary to keep our parks up, preserve our remaining open space, invest in our historical monuments that this great Nation so cherishes. It is a shame to see these 5 percent of the oil companies--and this is the fourth time this rider is before the Senate--walking off with millions of dollars that belong to the American taxpayers. 
   Senator HUTCHISON says the Office of Management and Budget is wrong when they say it is a $66 million loss. The Interior Department says it is a $66 million loss. The CBO tells Senator HUTCHISON it is about $11 million. I say it doesn't matter if it is $11 million or $66 million. Maybe it is somewhere in between. It is the principle here of millions of dollars that belong to the 
   taxpayers not winding up in the Land and Water Conservation Fund to take care of our natural resources. 
   Whether this is a victory for those who believe in fairness and justice and truth, if it is a victory that lasts 24 hours, so be it. To me it is an important point. We have made our point. This is not a trivial debate. This is not a trivial argument. As a matter of fact, I think the Senator from Idaho, Mr. CRAIG, was on the floor and said it is a baseless debate. It is far from baseless.  We see that tonight with this vote, however it winds up. This is a divided Senate. 
   Again, I thank the people who stood for fairness, who stood with the taxpayers, who stood with the environment, who stood with those who say you have to be a good corporate citizen. That is all we are saying. We expect our citizens to be good. Boy, if they don't pay their taxes, we are after them. And don't have the lawyers that the oil companies have on their side to drag out these arguments in court, month after month--ordinary citizens don't have that. If they don't pay their taxes, they have to explain why. If they don't pay their rent, they better explain why. If they don't pay their mortgage, they better tell the bank why. 
   We shouldn't have a double standard just because an oil company is powerful, just because an oil company can give millions of dollars of contributions, just because an oil company is influential. This day we stood up for the average person. I hope we do it again. For me, it was all worth it. 
   I yield the floor.

We are very open about our disagreement on this amendment and whether it is the right or the wrong thing. That will come out in our debate. We have a couple of people who wanted to talk and weren't able to get over here last night. Senator WELLSTONE has been waiting. We would be very happy to agree to quite a limited time, a few minutes, if that would be possible, before my friend makes his motion to table. 
   Perhaps we can have a unanimous consent agreement that includes sufficient time, not exceeding 10 or 15 minutes total, before he moves to table. And, by the way, we are all going to vote not to table. I don't exactly know why we are going to do 
   this. We think this deserves more discussion.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Oklahoma for being generous. We know that under the rules he can move to table immediately, and we would not be able to have time for debate. I want to tell my friends from Illinois and Minnesota that I intend to yield to them under this unanimous consent request. 
   Let me set the stage, before I do that, by encapsulating in a very few minutes why I think the Hutchison amendment is not a good idea, why I think it is dangerous for the Senate to put its imprimatur on the Hutchison amendment, and why I think it is wrong for the taxpayers to continue to be cheated out of millions and millions of dollars. 
   Mr. President, if rushing through this center door here in this beautiful Senate Chamber we saw someone with a bag full of cash that he or she had stolen, we would call the police. Yet what is going on today on behalf of 5 percent of the oil companies is out and out thievery. Those are strong words, but they are backed up. 
   Listen to the words of USA Today. They say:  
   Imagine being able to compute your own rent payments and grocery bills, giving yourself a 3 to 10 percent discount off the marketplace. Over time, that would add up to really big bucks. And imagine having the political clout to make sure nothing threatened to change that cozy arrangement.  
   They say:  
   It is time for Congress to clean up this mess.  
   Yet the amendment we have before us continues this mess. We have already lost, because of these amendments in the past, $88 million from this Treasury. This amendment will continue that loss--another $66 million. 
   It is wrong. How do we know it is wrong? First of all, a royalty payment is not a tax. May I say that again. A royalty payment is not a tax. The Senator from Texas calls it a tax. It is not a tax. It is an agreement that is freely signed by the oil companies. It says they will pay royalty payments when they drill on Federal lands belonging to the people of the United States of America, and that payment will be based on the fair market value of the production. As a matter of fact, it is even stronger language:  
   It shall never be less than the fair market value of the production.  
   Yet 5 percent of the oil companies that are vertically integrated are continuing to underpay. How do we know this? We know this because there is proof of this. 
   We know this because already the oil companies have settled with seven different States for $5 billion. In other words, rather than face the trial, they settled for $5 billion--I don't think any of us could imagine how much that is--because they didn't want to face the truth. They settled because they admitted it in essence, although technically they didn't. But by settling, the basic message is, we were wrong. How else do we know there is cheating going on? 
   How about the retired ARCO employee who said that the company underpaid oil royalties. Where do you think this ran? It didn't run in some liberal publication. It ran in Platt's Oilgram News. It is big news. It is big news--since the last time this rider went into effect. 
   Here he is, a retired Atlantic Richfield employee, admitting in court that while he was secretary of ARCO's crude price committee, the posted prices were far below market value. He basically says that he admitted he was not being truthful 5 years ago when he testified in a deposition that ARCO posted prices representing fair market value. What did he say while he was an ARCO employee? Some of the issues being discussed were still being litigated. He says: My plan was to get to retirement. 
   So you have a former employee from ARCO who raises his hand on the Bible and tells the truth about the scam that is going on. What does the amendment do? It continues the very scam that he has rebuked. 
   Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?

Now it is back before us in a little bit of a changed technical fashion. But doesn't the Senator agree with me that the Senator from Texas is legislating on an appropriations bill?

   Before I do, I wanted to call to my colleagues' attention a Los Angeles Times editorial, ``The Great American Oil Ripoff.'' ``America's big oil companies have been ripping off Federal and 
   State Governments for decades by underpaying royalties for oil drilled on public lands.''  
   It goes on. It says that Congress should not buckle to the pressure of the oil lobby, and that the Hutchison bill should be defeated. 
   Let me say I don't think you need a degree in economics; I don't think you need a degree in political science to know cheating when you see it. We know cheating when we see it. We know these companies are settling for billions because they do not want to face the courts. Yet this Senate, if it votes for the Hutchison amendment--I feel so strongly about it--is putting its approval on organized cheating. How do we know that it is organized? Because we have had former ARCO executives and others admit that it was, in fact, planned and organized. 
   I yield the remaining time to Senator DURBIN.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am pleased to cosponsor the amendment offered by Senator TORRICELLI to the Interior Appropriations Act concerning leghold traps. This is a sensible and narrowly tailored amendment that will address the misuse of tax dollars to promote cruel, commercial trapping programs on the National Wildlife Refuge System. 
   This amendment will prohibit the use of taxpayer funds to administer or promote the use of steel-jawed leghold traps or neck snares for commerce in fur or recreation on National Wildlife Refuges. Our amendment would not limit the ability of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to manage our National Wildlife Refuges. 
   I am proud to say that my State of California banned the use of steel-jawed leghold traps last year when voters overwhelmingly approved a ballot initiative related to trapping. Californians recognized not only that these traps are inhumane, but also non-selective. In other words, these traps often result in the death of many animals that are not the targets of the traps. 
   In its 1998 Environmental Document on trapping, the California Department of Fish and Game cited several state studies showing a high number of non-target species being caught. In Colusa County, 26 target muskrats and 19 non-target animals; in Tehema County, seven target coyotes and 85 non-target animals; in San Diego County, 42 target bobcats and 91 non-target species. 
   Mr. President, these numbers are astonishing, and they demonstrate to us beyond a shadow of a doubt that these traps are abhorrent devices. Whether they are hunting dogs, family pets, bald eagles, deer, or other animals, there are countless untold victims of these traps. They have rightly been likened to ``land mines'' for wildlife, catching any animal that triggers them. 
   It is shocking that these traps are allowed in our country at all, especially given that 88 nations throughout the world bar their use. But it is even more horrifying to think that American tax dollars go to administer trapping programs on our nation's wildlife refuges. 
   I looked up the word ``refuge'' in the American College Dictionary. It defines refuge as (1) ``a place of shelter, protection, or safety,'', or (2) ``anything to which one has recourse for aid, relief or escape.'' 
   It is plainly contradictory to allow the commercial killing of wildlife on places called wildlife refuges. It is worse to allow the use of barbaric traps on refuges. And it is shocking to Americans to have their hard-earned dollars finance this hoax. The Torricelli amendment goes very far to be reasonable and accommodating. 
   It does not bar trapping on refuges. It does not even bar steel traps or neck snares on refuges, since the amendment specifically allows these traps to be used for research, conservation, subsistence trapping, or facilities protection. It simply bars these devices for commerce or recreation. 
   This amendment should be adopted overwhelmingly. It makes sense. The policy of allowing the financing of such programs is contradictory and wrong-headed. It should be no surprise that fully 83 percent of Americans oppose using steel traps on refuges. Just last month, the House passed an identical amendment by an overwhelming margin. The Department of the Interior has no problem with this amendment. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the Torricelli amendment.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise today, first of all, to say it is good to be back in the Senate because I am very hopeful we can do something, in the remaining days and weeks we have, to make life better for the people we represent. I also have had some wonderful interaction with the people of my State. They have some very strong opinions on many of the issues facing us. 
   I think the message I got more than anything was, can't you get together on both sides of the aisle and address the issues that impact our daily lives? I certainly think that is an appropriate sentiment. 
   That is not to say that the Congress shouldn't be doing its oversight investigations, be it the Waco incident or what has occurred in Russia. I am not against any of that. I am for that. But we have to do everything around here. We have to do the oversight, but we also have to pay attention to business. 
   There is an article in today's Washington Post written by Elizabeth Drew, who wrote a book called ``The Corruption of American Politics: What Went Wrong and Why.'' She has a very interesting article called ``Try Governing for a Change.'' She says to Congress: Welcome back. We hope you had a nice vacation. We hope you will use the few weeks that remain to govern, rather than to position yourselves politically. 
   That is my message today. We have unfinished business. I will go through some specifics. I am not going to just stand up and talk in generalities. I want to be specific. 
   One of the first things we have to deal with is school safety. Our children are back at school. We have provisions in the juvenile justice bill that are now in conference that can 
   make schools safer. We also have provisions in the commerce bill that will make schools safer. What are some of these? 
   The Gregg-Boxer amendment that is in the Commerce bill, which would provide $200 million for school safety activities, including security equipment, hiring more police officers, and violence prevention programs for our children, is a bipartisan provision. It passed overwhelmingly. It ought to move forward. We ought to have that help for our schools. 
   The gun control provisions in juvenile justice that are so very important and, might I add, are not radical--they are very moderate--I want to see us pass. 
   We closed the gun show loophole that allowed criminals to get guns at gun shows without going through background checks. We banned the importation of high-capacity ammunition clips which are used in semiautomatic assault weapons. We required child safety devices be sold with every handgun. We required the Federal Trade Commission and the Attorney General to study the extent to which the gun industry is marketing its products to our students, our children. We made it illegal to sell or give a semiautomatic weapon to anyone under the age of 18. That is an assault weapon. 
   These are very simple. They are very straightforward. We passed them in the Senate, and they are in conference. I have yet to see that conference committee meet. I certainly hope it will. I look forward to the opportunity for getting the people's business of protecting our children done. That is school safety. 
   We have a lot of other unfinished business. There are not that many things but they are all very important. We have the issue of saving Medicare--a very important part of the President's proposal, saving Medicare. We have to get down to it. We have to do it. We have the issue of paying down the debt. We have a huge debt. We have an opportunity with the surplus to pay it down and save all those interest payments on the debt that we continue to pay out every single day, $1 billion a day just to pay the interest payment on the debt that has accumulated since the 1980s. We ought to pay that down. 
   On the minimum wage, I was amazed to see a report in the Los Angeles Times about the condition of people who live in Los Angeles County. I know my friend, the Chaplain, is from that area. More than 20 percent of Los Angeles County residents live below the official poverty line. That is $16,450 a year for a family of four. This is reflective of a lot of people in our Nation. It is not just Los Angeles. When most people think of Los Angeles, they think of Hollywood. They think of millionaires. They have to understand what is happening to real people. 
   Twenty percent are living in poverty. One out of every three children in Los Angeles lives in poverty. If you go to Los Angeles and see little children, one out of three of them is living in poverty. That is up from one out of four in 1990. 
   You might say: Well, maybe it is just minority kids. No, it is a lot of children, across the board. It is 21 percent of Anglo children living in poverty; 21 percent of Asian American children are living in poverty in Los Angeles; 33 percent of African American children are living in poverty in Los Angeles; 43 percent of Latino children are living in poverty in Los Angeles; 12 percent of elderly people are living in poverty in Los Angeles, an increase from 9 percent in 1990; 2.7 million residents of Los Angeles County have no health insurance. 
   What I am saying is, when we talk about the minimum wage, this is real. Most of these people are working very  hard. What is happening in our society today is people are working hard at the very bottom levels. I think the least we can do in this incredible economic climate that so many of us are benefiting from is to raise that minimum wage, save Medicare, help our seniors, pay down the debt, help the future, pass these safety provisions so our kids are safe in school, and pass a Patients' Bill of Rights. We have a watered down bill in the Senate but they are going to pass a good one in the House. Get them into conference and pass it, bring it out. 
   Finally, campaign finance reform is so important. Of all these issues I have mentioned, I am sad to say our majority leader has only put one on the agenda for his must-do list. That is campaign finance reform. I am glad it is there. It is there because there was a threat to shut down this place if it wasn't on there, but I am glad it is on the list. All of these other things are not there. 
   What is worse, when you look at the most important thing the Republican majority wants to do, it is going to hurt all these other things, because it is a huge tax cut of $800 billion that is going to help the people at the upper echelons and hurt everyone else. There won't be any money for Medicare. There won't be any money to save that program. There won't be any money to pay down the debt so we can be good to our grandchildren and their children. There won't be anything for education. There won't be anything for the environment. 
   I say to my friends, let's do what the people want us to do. Let us take care of business. 
   There was an extraordinary field poll done in California. I think it is very instructive, and it is amazing in the scope 
   of what it said. 
   It said that more than 80 percent of the people of California agreed with the President's approach to the budget, which, as we know, is to take that surplus and use a third of it for tax cuts for the middle class, a third of it for Medicare, and a third of it for education, the environment, health research. Now, this means the majority of Republicans agree with the President on this point. 
   I think we have a golden opportunity to come together on issues that mean a lot to the people: school safety, a Patients' Bill of Rights, campaign finance reform, raising the minimum wage, saving Medicare, paying down the debt, targeted tax relief to the middle class, not to those at the very top who are doing very well. 
   And the reason I shared the survey with you on the poverty in Los Angeles is that while the economy is terrific and is going very well in California, the gap between the rich and the poor is growing mightily. Those of us who care about our fellow human beings cannot turn our backs on this, regardless of our party, because it is a recipe for problems in the future. 
   Mr. President, I thank you for your indulgence. I know my colleague, Senator DORGAN, has a lot to say on these and other matters. Again, I compliment my friends who are taking the lead on the East Timor situation. We have unfinished business to do. Let's get it done and do it across the party aisle and go home proud of our accomplishments. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Virginia for his very important comments. I rise in very strong opposition to the Hutchison amendment that was laid aside and about which, as I understand it, probably we will have to vote on a cloture motion. I await the word of the chairman on that. 
   I want to tell my colleagues that this is a very serious matter. I hope they will listen very carefully as to why the arguments against the Hutchison amendment are so important. I am going to say some very strong things on the floor. But everything I say will be backed up by fact, backed up by quotes, backed up by court cases, backed up by recent history on oil royalty payments. 
   What the Hutchison amendment will do for the fourth time is to stop American taxpayers from receiving the  amount of oil royalties they are owed by the oil companies. Let me repeat that. The Hutchison amendment will stop the American taxpayers from receiving the fair share of oil royalties that they deserve. If it does pass, and I hope it does not, it will sanction that. It will say to the oil companies: It's OK, you continue, big oil companies, underpaying your oil royalties. We know they have a plan to underpay. We know that. We have heard it from people who have blown the whistle on the oil companies. 
   If we go with the Hutchison amendment, our fingerprints are on this defrauding of the taxpayers. This is very serious business. I ask my colleagues to pay attention, because when this issue was last before us, we did not have a whistleblower who worked for the oil companies in court, saying that the oil companies, in essence, defrauded the taxpayers and they planned to do so. We have that 
   information. I will lay it before the Senate. 
   What is an oil royalty payment? Right here you see what a royalty payment is. The oil companies sign an agreement with the Federal Government that when they drill on Federal lands in any State of the Union, be it onshore or offshore, they must pay a fair percentage, 12.5 percent, of the value of that oil over to the Federal Government. It is like paying rent. It is not a tax; it is a royalty payment. 
   If you do not own the place in which you live, you pay rent. Imagine if you decided on a daily basis what that rent ought to be. No, no, no--you would go to jail or you would be evicted because you have signed a contract to pay a certain amount of rent. The oil companies have signed a contract to pay a certain amount of rent based on the oil they extract from Federal lands. Here it is. It ``shall never be less than the fair market value of the production.'' Keep that in mind, ``fair market value of the production.'' They have to base their royalty payment on the fair market value of the oil. 
   Senator DOMENICI was on the floor and he said beware of colleagues who start talking about Congress' slick deal with the oil companies. He said beware. 
   I am not saying it; USA Today said it. USA Today said it is ``time to clean up Big Oil's slick deal with Congress.'' They say, in their view, ``industry's effort to avoid paying full fees hurts taxpayers [and] others.'' 
   Here is what USA Today says on the subject in this article. They knew the Hutchison amendment was coming and this is what they said.  
   Imagine being able to compute your own rent payments and grocery bills, giving yourself a 3 percent to 10 percent discount off the marketplace. Over time, that would add up to really big bucks. And imagine having the political clout to make sure nothing threatened to change that cozy arrangement.  
   They go on to say the fact that ``big oil has contributed more than $35 million to national political committees and congressional candidates.'' They say that is ``a modest investment in protecting the royalty-pricing arrangement which has enabled the industry to pocket an extra $2 billion.'' 
   This is a very bad situation. If you vote for the Hutchison amendment, you are aligning yourselves with a planned effort to defraud taxpayers. I do not know how many of my friends want to go home and face their constituents and make that argument. This is what USA Today continues saying:  
   That's millions of dollars missing in action from the battle to reduce the Federal deficit and from accounts for land and water conservation, historic preservation, and several Native American tribes. In addition, public schools in 24 States have been shortchanged: States use their share of Federal royalties for education funding.  
   They conclude by saying:  
   ..... the taxpayers have been getting the unfair end of this deal for far too long.  
   We have a chance to stand up for the consumer, for the taxpayers, against cheaters, against people who would knowingly defraud taxpayers, if we do not support the Hutchison amendment, if we oppose it.  
   We heard the Senator from Texas say: Oh, my God, things are terrible for oil. We are suffering in the oil industry. 
   What she does not tell you is something very important: 
   95 percent of the oil companies are not affected by the rule the Interior Department wants to put into place which will fix this problem. The Hutchison amendment stops them in their tracks and prohibits them from fixing this perpetual underpayment of royalties. That is what the Hutchison amendment does. 
   She says big oil and oil across the board is hurting. Ninety-five percent of the oil companies are not affected. They are decent. They are paying their fair share of royalties. It is the 5 percent that are doing this slick thing that are, instead of paying their royalty based on a market price, they are paying it based on a posted price which they post. They decide what the price is, and we know they are cheating us. How do we know that? That is a tough thing for a Senator to say, but I want to prove it to you. 
   First of all, we know this for sure: Seven States have already won battles in court against oil companies. The seven States have said that the oil companies are underpaying their royalty payments to the Federal Government and the States' share of those royalty payments, therefore, are lower. The oil companies have settled with these States. 
   If they were doing the right thing, do you think they would be settling for $5 billion so far? I doubt it. If they were so innocent, do you think they would be shelling out--``shelling'' is a good word--$5 billion to seven States? By the way, the Federal Government is suing as well. We do not want to have to keep these battles in court. The Interior Department wants to fix these problems so nobody will have to sue anymore. There will be a fair payment. So one reason we know they are cheating us is they are settling these cases all over the country. 
   There is another reason we know. This one is very direct and this one is new. I urge my colleagues at their peril to pay attention to this matter, please:  
   A retired Atlantic Richfield employee has admitted in court that while he was Secretary of ARCO's crude pricing committee, the major's posted prices were far below fair market value.  
   He goes on to say--Anderson is his name:  
   He admitted he was not being fully truthful 5 years ago when he testified in a deposition that ARCO's posted prices represented fair market value. He said: ``I was an ARCO employee. Some of the issues being discussed were still being litigated. My plan was to get to retirement. We had seen numerous occasions, the nail that stood up getting beat down.'' Said Anderson, ``The senior executives of ARCO had the judgment that they would take the money, accrue for the day of judgment, and that's what we did.''  
   Here is a retired former employee of one of the oil companies that has been ripping off the taxpayers admitting it in a court of law--he could go to jail if he lies--swearing on a Bible, an oil company man, that they sat around and agreed to understate the value so they could get away with it and wait for the day of judgment. Talk about a smoking gun, here it is. This is new information, and yet Senator HUTCHISON is asking you to stand with those people, one of whom admitted they actually had a plan to defraud the taxpayers. 
   This is a very serious issue. It is not politics. It involves a plan to understate the market price. It is wrong.

   Mrs. BOXER. What the Hutchison amendment does is it puts off for the fourth time any move by the Interior Department to fix the problem we are facing with this underpayment of the royalties that are due the taxpayers. 
   The Interior Department has held a series of 17 meetings across the country. They have met with the oil companies, they have met with Members of Congress, they have done everything, and they are ready to finalize a rule. Every time they are ready to promulgate a rule to fix this problem, up comes one of the Senators from the oil States who says: Oh, wait, wait, wait, it is too complicated; it isn't a good idea. 
   It isn't a good idea from the oil companies' perspective because as we just heard this one whistleblower say, they want to put off the day of judgment and use this float to make more and more money. But my friend is right in his questions.

That is a lot of millions of dollars. Taxpayers already have lost $88 million, and they are about to lose another $66 million unless we can stop this. The Interior Department is with us 100 percent.

   Mrs. BOXER. Absolutely. In other words, if there is oil being drilled in Texas, it is on Federal lands, but the Federal lands are within Texas. Texas gets 50 percent of the royalty payment. I know in California, it is 50 percent if it is onshore and about 25 percent if it is offshore. In many of the States, including California, these funds go directly into the classroom and to the schools.

   Mrs. BOXER. My friend is correct. To be very specific, I will tell the Senator, the oil companies that are being so defended here have agreed in court to pay up not $1 billion, not $2 billion, but $5 billion to these States; in essence,  agreeing that they undervalued. Alaska got $3.7 billion, for example; California, $345 million. By the way, private owners are also complaining, and they have resolved some of the disputes for $194 million.

   Mrs. BOXER. My colleague is right. But it is even worse than that because a royalty payment is a contract. The oil companies have signed a contract. It says very clearly ``fair market value.'' It is not that the Interior Department wants to increase the percent, for example, that is paid; they just want to make sure the contract is carried out. 
   It says: The value of production for purposes of computing royalty on production from this lease ``shall never be less than the fair market value of the production.'' So all they are trying to do is correct a serious problem. And we know, because I can show my colleague another chart on posted prices versus the market prices of ARCO, I will show him what has happened. Right now the oil companies, these 5 percent of them that are cheating us, they base their royalty payment on what they call posted prices. They create the price. If we could show this to the Senator, look at the difference between the market price and the posted price. This is one oil company, but I could show my friend, every single one of these oil companies, by some kind of magic action, they have the same spread. And if you heard what the ARCO executive said, the former executive, they did this on purpose. They made the posted prices below the market price.

   Mrs. BOXER. First, let me say there are 777 companies that are not impacted at all by this Interior rule, but there are 44 companies that are impacted. Let me say to my colleague, I voted to help the small oil companies. I was proud to support the Domenici amendment. We took it up recently when we helped the steel companies. If we want to help the oil companies because they are having tough times, I will be right there. If there are reasons to help smaller companies, I am right there. And I have always been right there. 
   But it seems to me we can't stand on the floor of the Senate and help the largest oil companies--most of these are the largest; not all, but most--5 percent of the oil companies that are out-and-out cheating the taxpayers. We know it because it has been testified to in a court of law, and we know it because they have been settling these cases all over the country. My friend should feel very comfortable when he opposes the Hutchison amendment case 
   that he is impacting only 5 percent.

She knows if she does--and we are very open about this--we are going to be on our feet a long time. So we are going to have a cloture vote to see where this all comes out.

   Mrs. BOXER. I do mind yielding at this point. I don't want to lose my train of thought. 
   My friend is so right in his understanding of what this means. This is an example of legislating on an appropriations bill. This Hutchison amendment was put into the committee and stripped out because of the way it was put into the committee. It was stripped out. It has been defined and technically changed, and now it is being offered. But it is still the same thing. You know, you can put a dress on a hippopotamus and it still looks like a hippopotamus. That is what this is. This is a very ugly amendment. 
   I want to mention one thing in answering the question. I was very pleased that my friend read the Los Angeles Times editorial. It is a newspaper that now has Republican ownership. I think that is very important. I want to read a couple of other statements from it. I see my friend from  Wisconsin is here. Is he going to ask me a question as well?

   Mrs. BOXER. This Los Angeles Times article says, ``The Great American Oil Ripoff.'' 
   It says:  
   America's big oil companies have been ripping off Federal and State governments for decades by underpaying royalties for oil drilled on public lands. The Interior Department tried to stop the practice with new rules, but Congress has succeeded in blocking their implementation, and will again if the Senate bill calling for a moratorium on the new rules proposed by Senators Hutchison and Domenici comes up before the Senate.  
   It has and here we are.  
   The large integrated oil companies, not the small independent producers, have been cheating the State and Federal Treasuries by computing their royalties on the so-called ``posted rights'' rather than the fair market price.  
   That is what we are talking about, computing royalties on posted rights, rather than fair market price.  
   It could be as much as $4 or $5 a barrel lower. The Interior Department estimates this practice costs the taxpayers up to $66 million a year.  
   Senator HUTCHISON says it is $11 million, and that is a lot; but we think it is $66 million, and so does the OMB.  
   Two years ago, Interior drew up rules that would stop the underpayment but Congress has blocked implementation.  
   They go on to explain:  
   The bottom line is, Congress should not buckle to the pressure of the oil companies, and the Hutchison amendment should be defeated.

   Mrs. BOXER. This is the fourth time this amendment has come before the body. I have to say to my friend, I don't think it has ever gotten the attention it needs. To come in and say it is a baseless debate, when we are talking about as much as $66 million on top of the $88 million we have already lost from the three other times this amendment came before us, is unbelievable to me. It is unbelievable that we close our eyes to this kind of purposeful rip off, and to call it a baseless debate, I find that amazing.

   Mrs. BOXER. That is absolutely correct. Let me reiterate what I said. In cases all across this country, there have been settlements in seven different States, and $5 billion has been collected from the oil companies in these settlements. Now, if the oil companies had such clean hands and they were paying their fair amount of royalties, I assure my friend they would not part with $5 billion--I didn't say million, I said $5 billion. I don't even know what $5 billion looks like in a room. All I can say to my friend is, it is more than we spend on Head Start in a year.

   Mrs. BOXER. I am very glad the Senator put out some of the names of the big oil companies that would be impacted by this Interior rule that Senator HUTCHISON is trying to get. Fully 95 percent of the oil companies are not impacted. Only 5 percent are impacted. The 95 percent of the others are paying their fair share of royalty payments. That is something to be happy about. They are good corporate citizens paying their fair share of royalty payments based on fair market value just as they signed in their lease agreements with the United States of America. But it is the 5 percent of most of the large ones that are getting away with it. 
   I say to my friend that he is a champion of campaign finance reform. I am so proud to be associated with him on that issue. 
   I can only say to my friend that this issue was mentioned in the USA Today editorial, dated Wednesday, August 26, 1998, that big oil has contributed more than $35 million to national political committees and congressional candidates. They make the point. These are their words, not my words. They say that is a modest investment for protecting royalty pricing arrangements which enables the industry to pocket an extra $2 billion. 
   My friend is on a certain track. I think it is important.

   Mrs. BOXER. I say to my friend that I was not aware of those specific figures. It is very rare that I feel that if Congress goes along with something it is really part of an ugly situation. I feel that way here. I feel that we have enough information now to take a stand with the Interior Department, with the consumers, and with over 70 groups that stand with us against the Hutchison amendment. 
   I hope my friend will listen to some of these groups because my colleague, my friend from Texas, listed groups that were with her. I think it is important that we compare these groups, who they stand for, and who they speak for. They are with us on our 
   side trying to stop this oil company rip off, stop the Hutchison amendment: American Association of Educational Services Agencies, American Association of School Administrators, the American Lands Alliance, the Americans Ocean Campaign, the Better Government Association, Common Cause, Consumer Project on Technology, Council of State School Officers, Friends of Earth, Funds for Constitutional Government, Government Accountability Project, Green Peace, the Mineral Policy Standard, National Environmental Trust, National Parks and Conservation Association, the National Rural Education Association, the National Resources Defense Fund, the Navajo Nation, Ozone Action, Public Citizens, Congress Watch, Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility, Safe Energy Communication Council, the Surface Employees International Union, and the Taxpayers for Common Sense. 
   They are with us on this. 
   The United Electrical-Radio Machine Workers of America. 
   These are just some of the groups that are opposed to the Hutchison amendment, for one basic reason: They believe the big oil companies, the 5 percent of them, are cheating the taxpayers. 
   These are all public interest groups.

   Mrs. BOXER. I thank my friend and commend my friend from Illinois. I think their questions and their caring are very important to this debate. We have to take a stand on the floor of the Senate once in a while for average people--people who are faceless in this institution. They think it is dominated by the special interests. My friend from Wisconsin who works so hard every day to get the special interest money out of this Senate has made a very important point--that the very companies that are going to benefit from the Hutchison amendment have given huge contributions to Federal candidates and to Federal committees. 
   If you put that together, as my friend points out, with the retired ARCO employee testimony under oath that he lied 5 years ago--he admitted he was not truthful when he testified in the deposition that ARCO-posted prices represented fair market value. He goes on to honestly say he was afraid he would lose his retirement. He was afraid he would be fired. You put together the contributions from big oil with the testimony of this former ARCO employee, who sat in the room when the decision was made to stop taxpayers from getting their fair share--when you put that together with the recent settlements by many States with the oil companies, the oil companies saying to the States: Take your lawsuit out of here. We will pay you billions of dollars to go away. We will not go to court to try to make the case that oil royalty payments are fair. You put all of that together, and it adds up to a bad situation. 
   I would be so proud of this Senate if we stood together on behalf of the people and on behalf of the consumers against the bad actors in the oil industry, who according to this employee, said we will put off judgment day. We will go take our chances.  
   The senior executives of ARCO had the judgment that they would take the money, accrue for the day judgment, and that's what we did.  
   That is what he said. 
   He said this:  
   I would not have been there in any capacity had I continued to exercise the right they had given me to dissent to the process during the suggestions stage.  
   I know colleagues are here on other matters. I just felt it was very important to lay out the case against the Hutchison amendment. I will lay it out again and again and again if I have to. I hope I don't have to. I really could. I hope we can vote against cloture and hopefully rid this bill of this special interest rider that helps the 5 percent of the oil companies that are bad actors. 
   The 95 percent who are paying their fair share are doing fine; they will not be impacted by the Interior Department. It is just that 5 percent. 
   This is an important debate. It is not a baseless debate. It is debate on behalf of the hard-working taxpayers. It is a debate on behalf of everyone who pays rent or a mortgage payment every month. Imagine one day waking up and saying to the bank: Guess what. I don't like my mortgage payment. I'm paying less because it is no longer the fair market value as the day I signed up. 
   I think the bank would say: Renegotiating the interest rate is fine; but if you don't pay your fair share, we are taking you to court and we will repossess your house. 
   We cannot allow the top 5 percent of oil companies to act in an irresponsible fashion. I hope my colleagues will join with me, Senator DURBIN, Senator FEINGOLD, Senator WELLSTONE, Senator MURRAY, and many other Senators who feel very strongly about this and vote down the Hutchison amendment.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask my colleagues on the Committee on Environment and Public Works, and Senator VOINOVICH, Chairman of the Subcommittee on Transportation and Infrastructure, and my ranking member, Senator BAUCUS, a question on the Water Resources Development Act of 1999 as we prepare to give approval to the conference report.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I first thank the leadership of this distinguished committee and its members for their perseverance in working to finally pass the Water Resources Development Act, WRDA, an effort that has taken about a year. I also want to say how I appreciate Senator VOINOVICH's leadership as our new chairman of the subcommittee. 
   Despite our hard work and achievements, I am disappointed at the outcome in conference on the American River Watershed project. We failed to include the Senate program for providing a 170-year level of flood protection for the City of Sacramento in the American River Watershed. The Senate bill represented the local consensus agreement to increase in the level of flood protection for our state capital, Sacramento. Sacramento's 400,000 residents, 130 schools and 5,000 businesses are located in the flood plain at the confluence of the Sacramento River flowing from the north and the American River, which cascades from the High Sierra mountains, from the east. The most likely cause of a flood would be a breach in the American River levees which could inundate 55,000 acres. 
   The damages from even a 100-year flood would be comparable to the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake which caused 63 deaths, almost 4,000 injuries and $8 billion in direct property damage. Sacramento has one of the highest levels of risk and one of the lowest levels of protection. 
   There was a year-long effort to pressure this Congress to link extraneous water supply projects to this flood control measure, despite the fact that by unanimous vote in the Senate and a 418-to-6 vote in the House, WRDA bills were approved with no special set aside for water supply projects in California that would override the water agreements and planning processes that have taken years of sweat, blood and tears to put into place. We were able in this conference to stop inclusion of those water supply projects, and we achieved an increase in the level of protection for Sacramento from 90-year to 140-year level of protection. However, this level is unacceptable. It still puts 400,000 people at too high a risk of disaster. 
   I would like to ask the leadership of the Environment and Public Works Committee Subcommittee on Transportation and Infrastructure if they believe as I do that this conference report reflects only an incremental step in our efforts to increase protection for Sacramento and that more needs to be done to remove this risk.

   Mrs. BOXER. I thank my colleagues. I do note that, while I am disappointed at the outcome on the American River, this bill does provide numerous benefits for my state of California. The new dredging project for the Port of Oakland will enhance international trade and the regional economy and enable new efficiencies at the port to be undertaken with the new intermodal terminal. In addition, the dredge spoil will help restore wetlands in Marin County where a portion of the former Hamilton Army Airfield is being used for environmental restoration. We have new flood protection plans authorized in Santa Clara, the Yuba River Basin, Sacramento area, the City of Santa Cruz, and Fresno County. We have priority designations throughout the state for the new riverine ecosystem restoration program to encourage natural flood control systems and we have assistance for important new water reclamation projects in the San Ramon Valley and the South Bay area of Los Angeles. 
   But more work needs to be done to protect Sacramento, and we will address those needs in the next WRDA bill. I yield the floor.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, this bill is a reckless tax plan. As a way to summarize my opposition, the following are my top ten reasons I oppose this bill. 
   One, it is unfair to the middle class and the working poor. The average tax cut for a person who makes $30,000 per year is $311, compared to a tax cut of almost $46,000 for someone who makes more than $800,000 per year. 
   Two, it threatens low interest rates. Alan Greenspan testified before the Senate Banking Committee last week--and I quote--``It's precisely that imprecision and the uncertainty that is involved which has led me to conclude that we probably would be better off holding off on a tax cut immediately, largely because of the fact that it is apparent that the surpluses are doing a great deal of positive good to the economy in terms of long-term interest rates.'' If interest rates go up just one percentage point on a $100,000 mortgage, the increased monthly cost is $70--in essence a tax increase on every homeowner. 
   Three, there is not a dime in it for Medicare. As the Baby Boom generation begins retiring in 10 years, the Medicare situation will get larger, not smaller. This plan, by ignoring the issue, just compounds the problem we all know is coming. 
   Four, there is nothing in it for debt reduction. Because the Democratic plan saves Medicare, it has the added benefit of reducing the debt. We have a historic opportunity to ensure that our children will not be saddled with huge interest costs, which currently total over $600 million a day. 
   Five, it contains special-interest goodies, such as repealing an excise tax for a few companies that make tackle boxes and providing a $4 billion tax break on foreign oil and gas income. 
   Six, it will require huge and unsustainable cuts in discretionary spending. Because the Republicans are assuming a freeze on discretionary spending at fiscal year 1999 levels--something they will violate in the next few months--the reality is that this plan would force cuts of an enormous size in education, law enforcement, environmental protection, and the military. This is completely unrealistic given inflation and the needs we have as a country. 
   Seven, it relies on long-term surplus projections, which is very risky. Any businessman will tell you that even projecting out five years is unreliable at best. This bill tries to predict the economy over the next 10 years. 
   Eight, it ties our hands in the event of a recession. The country is in a tremendous economic rebound, and we do not need a broad-based economic stimulus. But if we go into a recessionary period, that is when a tax cut would be needed--to help us get out of the recession. This plan precludes that option. 
   Nine, it risks going back to the dark days of dramatic deficits. We have finally balanced the annual budget after 30 long years of red ink, and this plan turns right around and goes back to those times. 
   Ten, it is totally partisan. The Republican leadership rejected compromising with Democrats--and no Democrats were even in the room when this plan was put together. That is no way to write important legislation that affects every American. 
   I urge the President to fulfill his promise to veto this dangerous legislation, which jeopardizes the most remarkable economic recovery in history.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce today what I think is a very innovative proposal to move our education system into the 21st century. 
   There has been a growing body of research suggesting that a child's early years are critical to the development of the brain, and that early brain development is an important component of educational and intellectual achievement. Yet, in every state in this country, school does not officially begin until a child is 5 to 6 years old. Many children are missing some critical years. 
   I submit that as we enter the next century, if we are going to have the best educational system, we must start reaching children at an earlier age. 
   Head Start does that. Private preschool does that. But Head Start is only for low-income children, and there are not enough slots for all those children eligible to participate. And private preschools are often so expensive that they are out of reach for many middle-class working families. 
   We need to start thinking outside the box. One way to do that is to redefine what our educational system is. If education before kindergarten--before the age of 5--is so critical, maybe school should start a year earlier. 
   The legislation that I am introducing today--the Early Education Act--would begin the process of expanding the existing public education system to include at least one year of early education preceding the year a child enters kindergarten. My bill would set up a 10-state demonstration program over the next 5 years for states that want to move in this direction. The Federal Government would provide seed money of up to 50 percent of the costs for participating states to expand elementary school to include at least one year of early education, with that program open to all students in a school district that participates within the state. 
   A few states, most notably Georgia, are already implementing programs. Several other states, including my state of California, are planning to. In fact, I want to commend our state schools superintendent Delaine Eastin for all of her work in this area. 
   But even those states that are committed to this idea are finding that resources can be a significant barrier. And so what I want to do is to help states out. Let's see if early education--in those states that are interested--really does make a difference. 
   We know what the evidence so far shows. Compared to children with similar backgrounds who have not participated in early education programs, children who do participate in such programs perform better on reading and math tests, are more likely to make normal academic progress throughout elementary school, show greater learning retention and creativity, and are more enthusiastic about school. 
   If these evaluations are accurate--and that is, in part, what my bill is intended to find out--early education has the potential to make significant improvements in the education of our children. 
   I am pleased to be joined in this effort by Senator BINGAMAN. And I want to recognize Representative ANNA ESHOO, who is introducing the House version of this bill. I encourage my colleagues to join us in working to adapt our educational system for the 21st century.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, it is very unusual that an amendment has such strong bipartisan support and unlikely allies across the aisle. This is one of those. I will tell you the reason. 
   We have a situation in this country that has just been recognized by the Environmental Protection Agency where we have been using an oxygenate in gasoline, MTBE, methyl tertiary butyl ether, an additive which is in essence, without going into technicalities, poisoning the water across this country, and particularly in my home State where MTBE is in use. It is an oxygenate, and it has been used in the blending of gasoline. We thought it was safe, and we thought it cleaned up the air. It does help clean up the air, but it is in fact harming our water supply. 
   While other oxygenates such as ethanol may be used to meet the requirement of the Clean Air Act which calls  for 2 percent of our gas to be reformulated, MTBE is the oxygenate of choice for most refiners, and today it fulfills 85 percent of the demand for oxygenate that the Clean Air Act requires. Ethanol fulfills only 8 percent of that demand. 
   Why did I offer this to the Agriculture bill? I think that is a legitimate question. Some Senators have asked me. Because I will tell you that if we can use more ethanol, it is going to help our farm States in a big way. Senator FITZGERALD is going to go into that point far more than I will. He knows the subject. If we can help our farm States increase their income, that is going to reduce the cost of subsidies to taxpayers. So this is very much related to the Agriculture bill. 
   Unlike other harmful constituents of gasoline, such as benzene, when MTBE leaks from underground fuel tanks, it moves through the water very fast and very far. After it is released into the environment, it resists degrading. Once in the water, MTBE, even at the very low level of 5 parts per billion, can cause that water to take on the taste and smell of turpentine, rendering it undrinkable. 
   My colleague from Texas said, How do you know it is undrinkable? The answer is, there have been many hearings all across my State of California. People have testified that where MTBE leaks into the drinking water supply, the water smells. We had a chance to smell that water. You wouldn't even put it close to your lips. 
   MTBE is a possible carcinogen in animals, and it is a probable carcinogen in humans. Why on Earth would we continue to add it to our gasoline, knowing it will leak into our drinking water supply? There is no Federal drinking water standard for MTBE to protect the public health, because the studies necessary to determine if there is a safe level of MTBE have not been performed. Let me tell you the news on this. 
   Many of us have been calling for a phaseout of MTBE. Senator FEINSTEIN has her own bill. I have a bill. We know there is a reason. There is a reason to ban it, because the EPA has just stated that it should be decreased dramatically. This is the first time they have ever stated that in their blue-ribbon panel. 
   In Santa Monica, CA, the people of that city lost 71 percent of their local water supply because of MTBE contamination. Imagine being told you cannot drink the water because it is contaminated. They were forced to close nine 
   high-volume drinking water wells. Before the contamination, those wells served 6.5 million gallons of water per day. Efforts to clean up continue today. The city estimates that it will cost $160 million to clean up the affected wells. 
   I want to tell you that the EPA has spent hundreds of millions of dollars in an effort to clean up the contamination from MTBE. Just in the city of Santa Monica, they say it is going to cost $160 million to clean up those affected wells. 
   Why are we continuing to use MTBE? We know enough now to move away from it. We have alternatives, and our resolution talks about that. We have litigation now concerning cleanup, and alternative water supply costs continue to rise. 
   Santa Monica's contamination is just the tip of the iceberg. I think a lot of you have heard about Lake Tahoe. What a beautiful place that is. Yet in South Lake Tahoe, CA, we have lost 13 of 34 drinking water wells because of MTBE contamination. 
   If somebody stands up on the floor of the Senate and says this is premature and that we have not looked at this enough, I say: Come to California. Take a look at Lake Tahoe. Talk to the people of Santa Monica. They have lost their water supply. Read the blue-ribbon panel report of the EPA that was very reticent to take it on initially. They finally did. That blue-ribbon panel says that MTBE is bad. 
   In Santa Clara, CA--that is in the Silicon Valley--MTBE has been detected in the local drinking water supply reservoirs, and it is creating a real problem there. We have seen it in the ground water in that county in over 400 sites, and many of those sites are very near public water supply wells. 
   I don't want to have to come back here every year and talk to you about the tragedy of MTBE destroying the water. We take this first step tonight. Several of our colleagues want to speak on this. I will quickly summarize. Hopefully, we will hear from other colleagues. 
   We know that California isn't the only place where there is trouble. Governor Davis has signed an executive order prohibiting MTBE in California after December 31, 2002. 
   Last year, Maine announced it would take steps to reduce MTBE's use after a study revealed between 1,000 and 4,300 private wells could contain unhealthful levels of MTBE. New Hampshire is considering taking similar action. In New Hampshire, MTBE has been detected in more than 100 public wells. 
   We cannot allow the States to take on this fight by themselves. After all, it is up to Congress because of the Clean Air Act and the requirement to make sure that a safe additive is used. 
   In summary, I think we have a terrific chance tonight to send a very clear signal to the Environmental Protection Agency. It is simply a sense of the Senate, but I think it will have a lot of weight because we have never voted on the MTBE question before. This would be our first vote. We will have a vote most likely on a motion to table. 
   The bottom line is MTBE is poison. It is poisoning water supplies. It is a known danger. We have options, including ethanol. We have other options. We can do two things at once: We can send a message to the EPA, phase out MTBE; and at the same time send a message to our farmers who need a message of hope that they have a product that can fill the void. 
   I hope we will get a good vote on this. If there is a motion to table, I hope we will have a strong vote against that. I look forward to listening to my colleagues who have been extraordinary in helping to shape this resolution and helping get it to the floor.

   Mrs. BOXER. I did look down. Methyl tertiary butyl ether, let the RECORD show I have mastered it. 
   The point is what I have mastered--I want to ask my friend a question--is that this is a serious problem wherever the MTBE shows up, and I have discussed in my abbreviated statement the places it has. Has the Senator had the opportunity to read the blue-ribbon committee's report? I do not know that he has because it is very fresh off the press. I wanted to say to my friend, is he aware that in this the EPA blue-ribbon panel says the new tanks are simply not the solution? Because we have had new tanks put into place in California, and it is not working. This stuff is leaking. It is leaking badly. 
   Also, I know my friend talked about environmentalists and I also want to know if he knows the list of environmental organizations that support what we are doing.

   Mrs. BOXER. I just want to make sure my chairman, who I absolutely revere, has read that we do not say ``ban.'' We say ``phase out.'' That is a big difference. We phase it out so you make sure you are doing it in a wise fashion. That is exactly what Gov. Gray Davis said. I want to make sure that is what we are calling for.

   Mrs. BOXER. I know Senator INHOFE is patiently waiting, and he is chair of the Clean Air Subcommittee, as my chairman, Senator CHAFEE, has stated, but it is important to know, and I want to know if my friend is aware, that the chairman of the Drinking Water Subcommittee, Senator CRAPO, is an original coauthor of this. 
   I want to make the point of my friend that we have a situation that this additive was to clean the air, and now we find out it is poisoning the water, and we cannot get it out of the drinking water. The more we let this thing go, without phasing it out, my friend is absolutely right, the more expensive it gets, the more of a problem it is, the more poison is spread. To sit here and wait around does not seem to make much sense. 
   I also ask my friend if he is aware that we have large numbers of environmental organizations that support this, along with many in the farm community, including the Sierra Club, the Audubon Society, and Communities for a Better Environment. I hope my friend asks that we place that in the RECORD. I wonder if he is aware that Senator CRAPO brings a lot of authority, I think, to this particular debate.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I hope we will not accept this. I will be very brief. We all know what this is. This is sending this bipartisan sense-of-the-Senate resolution right into the graveyard. 
   My friend, my esteemed chairman, says it is complicated. Let me tell him it is not complicated to understand that MTBE is leaking. It is leaking badly. The State of California has phased it out. It is an opportunity for other options which will help our farmers. I think this is a unique moment. 
   We have Senators agreeing, Members who don't vote together very often. We have a long list of environmental organizations that support this. We have a long list of people from the farm States and organizations that support this. We don't need to continue with hearings. 
   As the Senator from Texas stated, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency can take action under her emergency powers to phase out MTBE. I believe if we support this sense of the Senate and vote down the second-degree amendment, she will understand that we really care about this issue, we care about getting rid of a possible carcinogen, and we care about helping our fathers at the same time. 
   To me, it isn't that complicated, perhaps because I see what is happening to drinking water in California. Right now in California it is going to cost $1 to $2 billion to clean up the poison in our drinking water. And my friends are saying: Plenty of time to study. 
   Members don't want this to happen to their State. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today I am pleased to be joined by my colleague on the Foreign Relations Committee, Senator SMITH of Oregon, and by Senator LAUTENBERG in introducing the International Tuberculosis Control Act. 
   This bill speaks to the growing international problem of tuberculosis. That is a disease we thought we had eliminated--and in fact, in the Western World, we largely did with the development of antibiotics in the 1950s. But the disease is making a comeback. As the World Health Organization (WHO) notes on the back cover of its most recent report on TB, ``The tuberculosis epidemic is growing larger and more dangerous each year.'' 
   According to the WHO, last year, nearly 2 million people died of tuberculosis-related conditions. And--get this--the WHO estimates that one-third of the entire world's population is infected with TB. 
   Like so many other diseases, it impacts women disproportionately. TB is the world's leading killer of women between the ages of 15 and 44. For women in the primes of their lives, more than twice as many die of tuberculosis than because of war. TB kills three times as many women aged 15-44 as HIV/AIDS, and three times as many as heart disease. 
   And it is a leading cause of children becoming orphans. 
   But this is not just a growing international problem. Because of its persistence abroad, it is having a tremendous impact here at home. 
   TB is an airborne disease. You can get it when someone coughs or sneezes.  And with the increased immigration and travel to the United States--as well as the homeless population, the rate of incarceration, and HIV/AIDS--we are seeing it re-emerge in many of our communities. Nearly 40 percent of the TB cases in the United States are attributable to foreign-born individuals. 
   We have seen it in my state of California, where local public health officials never thought they would have to worry about TB again. But they are. In 1997, nearly 20,000 TB cases were reported to the Centers for Disease Control. And over 4000 of them--20 percent of all TB cases in the United States--were in California. 
   The headline on the March 25 editorial in ``The Oakland Tribune'' said it best: ``We ignore TB at our peril.'' Public health officials acknowledge that the key to controlling TB at home is to control TB abroad. 
   Fortunately, the experts know what to do--and it works. TB can be treated and cured. We have seen that in this country. 
   But in many other countries where this disease persists, there are numerous barriers that are facing public health officials. For example, the process for screening, detecting, and treating tuberculosis is very lengthy and labor intensive. Also, there is a lack of trained personnel and medicine in those nations with a high incidence of TB. 
   The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and the World Health Organization have begun implementing a program to eliminate these barriers and to treat and control tuberculosis. So far, they have had some success. But the resources are, quite frankly, inadequate. 
   And they may become even more inadequate in the near future. The WHO is currently developing a global action plan to combat tuberculosis. That plan should be finalized and ready for implementation early in the year 2001. But unless there is a greater global investment of resources, we may have an action plan that does not see much action. 
   So the purpose of our bill is two-fold. First, we must raise awareness that TB is still a problem. I suspect that few Americans realize that the disease persists--not only in other countries, but also right here in the United States. And fewer still realize how easily it can be transmitted. 
   Second, we must increase the resources available to fight this disease in foreign countries. 
   This year, USAID will spend about $12 million on fighting tuberculosis abroad. Under the Foreign Operations Appropriations bill, as passed by the Senate, there should be enough funding for USAID to increase that to about $14 million next year. 
   I wanted to increase that even more, and I offered an amendment to the Foreign Operations bill. My amendment, which was accepted, says that if more money overall is provided for foreign aid programs before the appropriations bill becomes law, a top priority should be to provide more money for the infectious disease control program, especially tuberculosis. 
   But, Mr. President, I am not sure that will happen, and even if it does, I do not believe it will be enough. So our bill would authorize $60 million for fiscal year 2001--a five-fold increase over current funding levels--so that USAID can expand the work it has begun. 
   Make no mistake, we cannot do this alone. That is why this legislation calls on USAID to coordinate its efforts with the WHO and other organizations and why the bill adopts detection- and cure-rate goals based on the goals established by WHO. This must be a global effort with contributions and participation from nations around the world. But it is also an opportunity for the United States to provide global leadership.

   Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Senator for crystallizing where we are. When the Senator says we will go home and there is nothing we can point to, he is right. What happened to the juvenile justice bill and all the sensible gun control measures? Every day we wake up to some other horrible incident, and we are doing nothing to protect our children and our people from gun violence. It strikes me that the same thing happened with the Patients' Bill of Rights--nothing. The kind of sham bill that came across this place and passed isn't going to make any lives better. 
   But then, it seems to me, when our colleagues on the other side of the aisle do something, they do something bad. My friend was alluding to it. I just want to ask a couple questions on that point. 
   Is it not a fact that the tax bill which we passed did not allocate one slim dime for Medicare?

   Mrs. BOXER. I want to pick up on that Medicare question. Because when my friend said seniors want to live fuller lives, this is so true. That is where we are now. We have come such a long way with our health research and with our ability to take certain prescription drugs that help us live fuller lives; that when we look out into the future, with the demographic changes that are coming, this is our biggest challenge. How do we make sure that when we pass age 60, 65, 70, 75, we are living full lives? 
   This tax bill turns its back on this whole matter by doing zero for Medicare. They can say: Oh, we left a whole lot of money over here, and we can possibly use it, but the fact is, it is zero for something we know is coming down the road at us and something that is very important. 
   So it seems to me--and I would just ask my friend to comment; then I will yield the floor--that when we go home, assuming this Republican tax bill continues to roll--and from what we can tell it may well continue to roll right through--what will have been done will be bad for Medicare, bad for paying down the debt, and threatens this economy. Just listen to Alan Greenspan. He is the one my friends from the other side of the aisle have followed very religiously. 
   Suddenly, Alan Greenspan gets up and says: You better not now. Don't stimulate this economy now. You could threaten recovery. They roll right over Alan Greenspan, and they are going to roll right over us. So we are going to go home and probably say they didn't do what they should have done on juvenile justice, sensible gun control, HMOs--fighting against them--and what they did do threatens this economic recovery and does nothing for Medicare. It is a bad deal all the way around.

    Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today, I recognize an important and historic restoration project now nearing completion in Mendocino, California. While the North Coast of California is renowned for its natural beauty and breathtaking views, in Mendocino there is another coastal landmark that has captured the imagination of this rugged region. Built in 1908, the Point Cabrillo Lighthouse is a living reminder of California's maritime history. And on August 6th, the Lighthouse celebrates the 90th anniversary of the first lighting of its light. 
   This one-of-a-kind structure was originally built by the United States Lighthouse Service to protect the legendary ``doghole schooners'' that plied the lumber trade between San Francisco and California's northern coast at the turn of the century. The Lighthouse was turned over to the U.S. Coast Guard in 1939, and still houses Coast Guard navigational aids and monitoring equipment. However, the Lighthouse structure and its rare Fresnel lens suffered significant damage after many years of neglect. Then, in 1998, the California Coastal Conservancy and North Coast Interpretive Association stepped forward to restore and reinstate the original Fresnel lens, and to renovate the Lighthouse for use as an educational and interpretive center. 
   Thanks to the efforts of the people of Mendocino, the Coastal Conservancy and the North Coast Interpretive Association, the Lighthouse restoration project will soon be complete. A weekend of festivities will celebrate the Lighthouse's revival and highlight the attractions of the Point Cabrillo Preserve and Light Station. This celebration will acknowledge the efforts of the many volunteers and community partners that also helped make this project a success. 
   It is important to take the time to applaud the restoration of this nationally significant, historic landmark. I also think it is important to recognize the significance of community projects such as the Point Cabrillo Lighthouse, which serve as invaluable, irreplaceable links to our common past and as unique educational tools for the future. I commend the efforts that have gone into this restoration project, and send the Point Cabrillo Lighthouse volunteers and other partners my best wishes for their continued success.

    Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today, I extend special birthday wishes to a very special Californian, Angelo Quaranta, whose birthday is August 8. 
   Angelo is perhaps best known as the owner and driving force behind Allegro, an Italian restaurant on San Francisco's Russian Hill. Regardless of whether you are the Governor, the Mayor, a community organizer or just someone looking for a wonderful plate of pasta, Angelo's grace and easy manner always make you feel welcome. 
   Angelo was born in Taranto, Italy in 1934. Before leaving his homeland for San Francisco in 1960, he attended the police academy and became national Judo champion while serving with the Italian Police Force. Upon arriving in San Francisco, he first worked as a window washer and then began a distinguished career in the insurance industry. 
   Cooking may be Angelo's passion, but he can be found in many more places than the kitchen. He has long been active in local government and is a leader in community affairs. He is currently president of the Commission of Parking and Traffic, and served on San Francisco's Recreation and Park Commission. In the 1970's, he operated an Italian television station that broadcast programming from Italy. He founded Unione Sportiva Italia, and has been active in numerous efforts to celebrate the invaluable contributions of Italians and Italian-Americans to the life of the city and nation. Angelo has served as a member of the Juvenile Diabetes Foundation and founded Candlelight Again, an organization comprised of restaurant owners and their patrons dedicated to raising funds for community needs. In recognition of his work, and in addition to many other honors, the Mayor's Office has twice proclaimed it ``Angelo Quaranto Day in San Francisco.'' 
   Angelo has two adult daughters who live with their husbands and children in Italy. It is a pleasure to join them and the larger civic family Angelo continues to nurture in San Francisco in wishing him a joyous 65th birthday.

   Mrs. BOXER. Thank you, Mr. President. I thank Senator BAUCUS. 
   My colleague from Texas says the Democrats hate investors and the Democrats hate capitalism. As a former stockbroker, I deeply resent his remarks. Maybe when the Senator from Texas was a Democrat he hated capitalism and he hated investors, but the Democrats around here don't. One of the reasons we are not supporting his amendment is that we think it is bad for capitalism and we think it is bad for investors. 
   I have to say that this amendment, which reflects what the House did, is a risky and radical amendment. It hurts the middle class. He says he loves the middle class. He talks about his momma and Dicky Flatt. And I love to hear him do it. But the bottom line is, the result of his amendment will hurt the very people he says he wants to help because it is such an unfair tax cut that would go to the very wealthiest and hurt the middle class and the working poor. 
   I say to my friends who may be listening to this debate, the Senator from Texas is a great debater but he was wrong when he said the Clinton plan would lead to economic disaster and he is wrong today. I hope we will vote down his amendment. 
   I yield my time.

    Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise to salute Carleton (Carly) Fiorina of California, who was recently named president and chief executive officer of Hewlett-Packard Company. I wish to congratulate Ms. Fiorina and express my best wishes for success in her new position. 
   Founded by technology pioneers William Hewlett and David Packard, Hewlett-Packard (HP) is the world's second-largest computer company. Based in Palo Alto, California, HP employs more than 120,000 people worldwide and had a total revenue of $47.1 billion in its fiscal year 1998, including $39.5 in computer-related revenue. The company is a leader in the industry and a cornerstone of California's economy. 
   In succeeding Lewis Platt, Ms. Fiorina has some big shoes to fill. In Lew Platt's seven years as CEO, HP raised its revenues 187 percent and its earnings 436 percent. 
   But Carly Fiorina is prepared to build on HP's success and guide the company into new territory. She comes to HP with nearly 20 years of experience in technology and telecommunications at AT&T and Lucent Technologies. As president of Lucent's Global Service Provider Business, she led the division to dramatic increases in its growth rate, revenues, and market share. She has a well-earned reputation for developing clear corporate strategies, building strong leadership teams, and accelerating growth in large technology businesses. 
   Carly Fiorina's move to the top of Hewlett-Packard has implications beyond the company, the industry, and our state. That is because she is the first woman to be named CEO of a Fortune 50 company or a company listed in the Dow-Jones Industrial Average. So this important accomplishment for her as an individual is also an important milestone for American women. It is only fitting that a pioneering company in such a forward-looking industry would break this critical barrier. 
   HP chose Ms. Fiorina to lead the company because of her merits, not her gender. That is clear. However, her selection is important for every American woman. In July 1999, the same month that the U.S. women's soccer team inspired millions of American girls, Carly Fiorina inspired American women to raise the bar and reach for the top.

    Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President. I rise today to offer my congratulations to San Francisco State University as its friends, faculty, staff and students celebrate its Centennial Year. 
   On March 22, 1899, the California Legislature established the San Francisco State Normal School to provide training for the region's teachers for an initial student body of 31. Today San Francisco State University has evolved into a major metropolitan university serving some 27,000 students and offering more than 200 undergraduate and graduate degrees. From nationally recognized biology, creative writing and journalism programs to the Nation's largest multimedia studies program, San Francisco State University is a vibrant academic force for its students and a valuable resource for the entire Bay Area. 
   For 100 years, San Francisco State University has been a leader in providing quality, accessible higher education for California residents. I am confident that the University's second century will be distinguished by creating an even stronger educational experience for students through promoting excellence in teaching and learning, embracing diversity and fostering community partnerships that will enrich the cultural and economic life of the Bay Area. 
   I commend and congratulate San Francisco State University for all of its successes over the last 100 years.

   Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Senator for yielding for a question. I want to join in on the CBO question. I have gotten to the point where I don't listen to any bureaucrats. I listen 
   to the Nobel Prize-winning economists. They are saying the Republican plan is risky and dangerous. Many signed a letter. I am going with them. 
   We cannot trust the CBO anymore. 
   I want to ask my friend about the tax break and the question: Is this fair? The Senator has an important chart. I found out yesterday under the Republican Senate plan anyone earning $1 million a year gets back $30,000 each and every year in a tax break, while those at the bottom hardly get anything. 
   I want to pose a question to my friend from Illinois. A millionaire gets back $30,000. That equals the average income of an average citizen. In other words, a millionaire gets back as much in a tax cut as the average American, who gets up every day and goes to work for 8 hours a day, earns in a year. 
   I pose the question to my friend: Is this fair?

   Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Senator. 
   I say to the Senator from New York, I really appreciate his contribution to this debate. I always go back, in my mind, to who is getting these tax cuts--the Donald Trumps, the Bill Gateses, et cetera. The other chart that was used before by my friend from Illinois showed very clearly that if you earn about $800,000 a year, you get back $22,000 a year; if you earn about $25,000 a year, you get back about $129. 
   I want to talk about that for a moment and ask my friend a question. 
   Mr. President, $129 is nice to have. No one would turn it away. But if at the same time you suddenly get a bill for $250 a month more for your Medicare, because the Republican plan doesn't put a penny in for Medicare solvency, now you are behind the eight ball, are you not? That $129 you get back is gone, plus you may even have to take care of your parents because Medicare is not going to survive.

   Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Senator from Illinois. We are having this conversation while we await the arrival of the interior appropriations bill, which I know we are both looking forward to working on with the rest of the Senate. 
   Nothing could be more important right now than the business that will come before this body tomorrow, a huge Republican reconciliation bill which includes these massive tax cuts to the wealthiest and, as a result of that, really crimps the functioning of the rest of the Federal Government. 
   Again, because my friend is so clear thinking, I underscore what he said in this colloquy. 
   The Democratic plan makes four very important decisions. First, the Democratic plan takes care of Social Security for the extended future. It says every single dollar of the surplus that belongs to Social Security will be locked up for Social Security, while the debt is paid down at the same time. The difference with the Republicans is, they dip into the Social Security trust fund 6 years from now. 
   Secondly, the Democratic plan says: What else is important? What else is the safety net for our people? Medicare. So it treats Medicare, in essence, the same way we treat Social Security. We treat it as the twin pillar of the safety net. We say we will take care of Medicare to the tune of over $200 billion. We lock that up. And while it is sitting there, it is used to pay down the external debt of the country. 
   The third thing we do--I have alluded to that--is debt reduction. Debt reduction is the external debt, the debt that is owed to private people, Americans and those around the world who pick up our bonds. We owe them debt. I see my friend from South Carolina who has pointed this out. Because of that debt, we are paying over $300 billion a year in interest payments which, as my friend said, is bad for the economy. It is wasteful. It does no good to anyone. 
   Then there is a fourth piece. That is, we take care of the business of Government. We leave enough over to take care of 
   education, to take care of health research, to take care of airport safety, safety in the streets, highways, transit, the things that our people want us to do; we take care of the basic business of Government, no frills but the basic business of Government. Educating our kids is basic. If we don't do that, we are nowhere as a country. 
   My question to my friend is this: Unless we are not hearing the people, they want us to take care of Social Security and lock it up for the future. They want us to take care of Medicare and lock that money up for the future. They want us to reduce that external debt so the interest payments on the debt disappear. And they want us to take care of the basic business of Government: taking care of our kids, health research, the things we stand on this floor day in and day out talking about, how important it is to improve the quality of life for our people. That is what we do. 
   The Republicans, the only thing they do is take care of the wealthy. Yes, they take care of some of Social Security, but in the second 5 years, they are dipping into that pot, too. 
   Does my friend agree with the sort of wrap-up I have given of his remarks? Are we on the same page? And, in conclusion, does he think our plan meets the needs of our people and their plan is risky, it is frightening, it pays off the wealthy and does nothing for our other needs?

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I want to ask him a question about an issue he and I have worked on together for so many years. It takes us back to when we were in the House together. We served together there for 10 years. That is the issue of health research. 
   Right now, only one out of every three approved grants is actually being funded. So that means cures for cancer, Parkinson's, AIDS, heart disease, stroke, you name it--the biggest killers--are not being found. In other words--let me repeat--we have one out of every three grants approved by the National Institutes of Health because they are very promising. If some scientist has a theory about how to cure prostate or breast cancer, he may not be able to get it done. 
   This will be my final question. As he goes through the Republican plan, which leaves virtually zero room, as I read it, for increases in this kind of basic spending, does the Senator not think we are shortchanging American families? When I talk to them, that is what they are scared of most.

   Mrs. BOXER. Has the Senator heard from his people that they are clamoring for the tax cuts? Has he heard from his people who are earning in the high dollar amounts, and who will benefit from this, that they want the tax cuts? 
   Someone earning $800,000 a year is going to get back $22,000 a year, and someone earning $30,000 gets back $100 bucks. Are the phones in his office ringing off the hook with people asking for these tax cuts and to forget about Social Security and Medicare?

   Mrs. BOXER. They certainly do pay taxes. Under your plan, they get back $121 of their hard-earned income. Under your plan, the $800,000 person gets back $22,000. If you earn a million, you get back $30,000. I think when the Senator says hard-working Americans, she is talking about, in their plan, hard-working, very wealthy Americans, unfortunately, leaving out the bulk of the people.

   Mrs. BOXER. I appreciate the leadership of the Senator from Washington and Senator DURBIN from Illinois on the Appropriations Committee fighting this antienvironmental rider all the way from the day they heard about it. I am just pleased to be here in a supportive role. 
   The reason I came to the floor is that the Senator from Washington has spoken in depth about a particular mine in her State. I want to ask her a few questions about a mine in my State, not that I expect her to be aware of all of this, but to see if she agrees with some of my conclusions on this. 
   First, I want to underscore through some questions what the Senator from Illinois asked; that is, I say to the Senator from Washington, I have learned by listening to this debate that when one mines for coal, there is in fact a royalty payment due to the Federal taxpayer. Is that correct?

   Mrs. BOXER. I ask my friend, because she is the expert on this, if she thinks my description is a good description of why they seem to need so much more land for their waste. From the cyanide leach mine pits, piled hundreds of feet high, over an area of several football fields, is a cyanide solution that is sprinkled over the piles. The cyanide, which is poison, trickles down through the ore, chemically combines with the gold and ore, and collects and pools at the base of the piles. The gold is stripped from the cyanide solution, but the cyanide solution is left on the site. 
   That is what is so contentious. We have poisoned and dumped on beautiful Federal lands. In this bill, we say: Amen; continue to do it. My friend from Washington is trying to say no to that environmental degradation.

   Mrs. BOXER. I have a last question, and I don't expect the Senator to know about this particular proposal, but hopefully 
   she can respond to this. In southern Imperial County, CA, a Canadian mining company called Glamis Imperial proposes to build a massive, open pit, cyanide heap leach mine, the kind I have described in my question to the Senator from Washington. 
   I want the Senator to know how much the people of California treasure their environment, particularly in these areas where we have Native Americans who have very serious tribal concerns over this area. When she fights for the environment in this way, it is not just for the precious State she represents so well, but it is for many other States, including California. 
   My question is, is my friend aware at the reach and breadth of the fight she is waging?

   Mrs. BOXER. Thank you very much, Mr. President. I thank Senator REID, our distinguished minority whip, who has done such a fine job on so many issues. 
   Mr. President, I say to the public who may be watching this debate, it may sound a little arcane, but we are debating the rules of the Senate. They will hear about rule XVI, they will hear about rule XXVIII, and they will say: What does this have to do with us? What does this have to do with my daily life as an American citizen? 
   Let me tell you, it has everything to do with the daily lives of the American people because this debate is about the power to bring issues to the American people by way of the Senate. It is about who has the right to bring issues to this floor for debate--issues that really matter to people, issues that relate to their jobs, issues that relate to their health care, issues that relate to their kids' education, issues that relate to how much congestion there is on a freeway or at an airport. So the power to bring up issues on the floor of the Senate is, in essence, the ability for all of us as Senators to make a difference in the lives of the American people. 
   If you were to ask me who has the right to bring issues to the Senate floor, my answer would be every single Senator, be they Republican, Democrat, or Independent. I think it is a very sad day today because, very clearly, the way this place has been running there is an attempt to shut down all but the Republican Senators. Because the Republican Senators control these appropriations bills in the committee, they will be able to load them up with all kinds of legislation. But once those bills get to the floor, there will be no way for Democratic Senators or Independent Senators to add their voices to that legislation. 
   There was a time in the Senate when things weren't like this. Perhaps they were the golden days of the Senate. When I first got here, we worked well--the Democrats did--with the Republicans. In those days, the Democrats were in charge. We worked well together. We weren't afraid to take the tough votes. We had full debate. Authorization bills were brought to the floor of the Senate. There was open debate. 
   Now we have a majority leader whom I like very much. Notwithstanding that, every chance he gets, his goal is to shut down the debate, to not allow a full debate. If he were in a position to open up the debate on authorizing bills, I say to the distinguished whip, we would not be here today fighting against reinstating rule XVI. 
   I want to take a look at how we actually got to this point. Rule XVI of the Senate rules prohibits amending appropriations bills. In other words, the rationale--which is a very good rationale--is that appropriations bills are merely bills that decide how much we spend on a particular item, and therefore they should be immune from the larger debate about underlying law and changes in underlying law. I always thought that was a good rule. We had it in place, as I say, when I got here. 
   Then, in 1995, the Republicans changed the rule. It came about because a Republican Senator wanted to stop the Endangered Species Act in its tracks and she wanted to attach an environmental rider to an appropriations bill. She needed very much to change rule XVI in order to win her point. 
   I remember being very upset at that time for two reasons. 
   No. 1, I thought it was really bad to change rule XVI because I thought we had fair and open debate. Secondly, I thought, here is a major policy change, a major change in the law, without going through the authorizing committees, no hearings, no witnesses, no real debate in the committee. 
   The Endangered Species Act has been a great act. Is it perfect? No. But it saved the California condor and the bald eagle. Yet we have a Senator wanting to throw the whole thing out, essentially, and stop all the new listings because she didn't like it. In order to do that, her colleagues accommodated her and they went back to allowing legislation on appropriations; 54 Republicans voted with her at the time. 
   Now, after several years of seeing some of us move our legislation, such as the Patients' Bill of Rights, campaign finance reform, taking a page out of the book of the Senator from Texas, they suddenly say in the middle of the Congress that they have changed their minds. I know why they have changed their minds. They have figured out how to run this place similar to the House of Representatives, as my friend, Senator REID, pointed out. 
   I served in the House of Representatives for 10 years. That place runs very differently from the Senate. They shut you down. They shut down debate. How many times have you seen House Members try to deliver a whole speech in 30 seconds or a minute? I know because I learned to do it over there. The fact is that there are time constraints over there. There are so many people over there. The Senate is a different place. 
   Let me put it in a different way. This used to be a different place. I say to my friend--and then I will yield to him--when I was a little girl, my father used to tell me, years before I would even dream that I would even be in politics,  because in those days women were not in politics: Honey, I want you to watch the U.S. Senate because that is where they really debate everything. The people who are there serve for 6 years. They are not afraid to take a tough stand, and they are not afraid of issues. They are willing to debate them; they are courageous; you hear all the different views. It is the greatest deliberative body in the world.

   Mrs. BOXER. My friend is exactly right. We did serve together in the House of Representatives, and it was a thrill to be there for 10 years. But there are differences between the two bodies. One of them certainly is the breadth and depth of the debate that goes on in the Senate as compared to the House. It is a different institution. 
   I think it is, in fact, a sad time. What happens when a piece of authorizing legislation comes before the Senate? We have the majority leader blocking our attempts to amend those pieces of legislation. My friend is right. 
   When I ran for reelection in the Senate in 1998, there were many differences between my opponent and me. It was a very hotly contested race. We talked about health care, campaign finance reform, protecting children from toxic waste; We talked about raising the minimum wage; We talked about more teachers in the classrooms. We talked about fixing school infrastructure because we have schools, I say to my friend, that are falling down because they are so old; We talked about the importance of afterschool programs, preschool, cops on the beat, sensible gun laws, and ending violence at women's clinics. These were issues of great importance. 
   I told my constituents: Look, I don't know if we are going to win on all these issues because it could be that when I get back to the Senate, the other party will be in control and they are not for raising the minimum wage; they are not for campaign finance reform; they are not for afterschool programs, and a lot of these things. But I promise you one thing: I am going to put up a fight. We are going to have those debates. 
   So the point is, I say to my colleagues who may be listening today, it seems very strange that when a party is in control and they have a good number more seats than we do, they should not be so insecure that they don't even allow us to offer amendments to authorizing legislation; 
   now they have decided to shut us down on appropriations bills when they are the ones who fought for that right themselves. 
   This is not an arcane debate. This is a very important debate. I think you have to put all of this in the context of how the minority party has been treated. I love this institution. I agree that we shouldn't legislate on appropriations bills. But I say that with a caveat--if we are treated fairly on all the other legislative vehicles; if we are allowed to offer amendments without having the majority fill up the so-called amendment tree and block us out; if we can have bills brought to this floor. 
   The Senator from North Dakota brought up a very important point. Because the majority leader wasn't ready to bring up the FAA reauthorization act, we did a 2-month extension. I wonder why. Can it be that he doesn't want to bring a piece of authorizing legislation to the floor because then he couldn't stop us that easily from bringing up our issues? 
   I don't know the answer to that. But I do know that I am going to join with a vast majority of Democrats to fight for the kind of Senate my dad talked to me about when I was a little girl, the kind of Senate where, regardless of political party, every single Senator has a right to bring an issue important to his or her State to the floor of this Senate. I think that is the least we could do. 
   I say to my distinguished whip, who does such a fine job in leading us on this side, that I really appreciate the fact that he is leading this particular effort. I think the issue of rule XXVIII is important because if we are going to shut down our ability to amend bills on the floor, we ought to shut down the ability of the majority to add anything they want in the conference that may not have passed either House. I don't know how that can be considered democratic. 
   Arcane though this debate might be, I say to the American people who may be focusing in on this debate, it is very important to you. If you want your Senator, regardless of party, to be able to come to the floor of the Senate and bring up issues that are important to you, then you ought to work to make sure that this Senate is open and is fair. 
   Thank you very much. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished whip. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I thank my colleague very much for his very fine summation of where we are. 
   It is amazing to me to see how far we have come in this economy, from the worst of all days when people were despondent. I remember when President George Bush went to Japan and he became ill, and it became kind of a symbol of what was wrong with this country. We went to Japan to find out how they were doing it and what was wrong with our country. Why could we not get our economy under control? Now we finally have it under control. It is in the best place it has been for generations, as my friend has shown us, 
   in terms of employment, in terms of job creation, in terms of no more deficit, in terms of being able to finally pay down the debt, in terms of housing starts and business starts--you name it--inflation. It is all going right. 
   What do our friends say? Whoops. Let's change course. We finally have it right, but let's turn around and go back to the bad old days. 
   It is amazing to me. I want to ask my friend a question about the so-called surplus. I was rather stunned to see my chairman, Senator DOMENICI, of the Budget Committee, for whom I have great respect, hold a press conference yesterday and tell the press that there is a $3 trillion surplus. I sort of thought maybe I misheard it. He repeated it four times, at least. He said there is a $3 trillion surplus. Therefore, all we are giving is a $1 trillion tax cut. It is a very small part of the overall surplus. Don't the American people deserve a refund? 
   I want to ask my friend a couple of questions. Is it not true that $2 trillion of that $3 trillion so-called surplus is Social Security? It isn't anyone else's; it belongs to Social Security. Is my friend in agreement with me on that point?

   Mrs. BOXER. Will my friend yield? I want him to know something. That $22,000 a year, back to the top 1 percent, is an average, I say to my friend. I can assure you that Mr. Trump and Mr. Gates will get far more than that in a refund. 
   As we discussed yesterday on this floor, when you think of people who work at the minimum wage and get dirt under their nails, and work hard and sometimes have two jobs, that average refund to the top 1 percent is twice as much as they earn in 1 year. There they go again. It is right on target. 
   I want to ask another question of my friend. We don't have a $3 trillion surplus because we already agreed that $2 trillion belongs to Social Security. That leaves $1 trillion. We know Medicare is in trouble. We know Social Security and Medicare are the twin pillars of the safety net. What good does it do someone on Social Security if they know they get that but their 
   Medicare premium is going to go up so high that they can't afford to buy their food or pay their rent? So we need to take care of Medicare. How much is in the Republican plan to save Medicare?

<TEXT>
   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am very relieved that we are seeing an acceptance of this amendment. It is so straightforward. 
   Under current Federal law, you cannot sell a gun to any person if the seller knows or has reason to believe any of the following, that the buyer is: a felon, a fugitive, an addict of a controlled substance, is mentally ill, is an illegal immigrant, has been dishonorably discharged from the military, has renounced his or her American citizenship, is subject to a court order on domestic violence or has been convicted of a domestic violence misdemeanor.  
   Already under current law anyone selling such a person a weapon, who knows, or has reason to believe this, cannot do that. All we are adding to this is: a person who is intoxicated. This is very simple. I am so pleased we are going to see this accepted. Senator CRAIG is going to make some comments. 
   But I want to talk about one case, a story about a woman named Deborah Kitchen, who is a quadriplegic, and she got that way because her ex-boyfriend shot her. 
   Tom Knapp consumed, by his own estimate, a fifth of whiskey and a case of beer. He went to K-mart in Florida to buy a .22-caliber rifle and a box of bullets. He was so intoxicated that the clerk had to help him fill out the Federal form required to purchase the gun, but he still bought the rifle, he shot his girlfriend, and left her a quadriplegic. 
   Let me tell you another story. This one is from Michigan. It involves an 18-year-old named Walter McKay, who had engaged in a day-long drinking spree and then went and bought ammunition for his shotgun. He was so intoxicated that he could not remember whether it was a man or woman who sold him the ammunition and could not identify what he purchased. 
   He took those shotgun shells, loaded his gun, and intended to shoot out of the back window of an acquaintance's truck. He was intoxicated. The shot missed, ricocheted off the wheel of the truck, and hit Anthony Buczkowski. Mr. Buczkowski had to have a finger amputated and his left wrist surgically fused. 
   To me, it flies in the face of common sense that someone who is intoxicated is able to buy a gun or ammunition. And it flies in the face of the evidence. 
   A 1997 study in the Journal of American Medical Association found that ``alcohol and illicit drug use appear to be associated with an increased risk of violent death.'' 
   Yet, Mr. Knapp and Mr. McKay could buy a gun and ammunition because it is not--I repeat, not--against the law to sell a gun to someone who is intoxicated. Gun sales are largely regulated at the federal level. Gun sales involve Federal licenses and federal forms. This is a Federal responsibility, and there should be a Federal law that stops this outrage. 
   So, my amendment makes it against federal law to sell a firearm or ammunition if the seller knows or has reasonable cause to believe that the buyer is intoxicated. 
   I want to talk about for a minute about one of the items on the list. Notice that the current federal law includes a prohibition on the sale of a gun to a drug user. 
   In fact, the way the law is worded, you do not even need to be high on drugs at the time you buy the gun. If the seller knows or has reasonable cause to believe that you are a user or addict of an illegal drug--regardless of whether you are high at the moment the gun is purchased--he is not supposed to sell you a gun. 
   So, I say to my colleagues, if you cannot buy a gun when you are high on drugs, you should not be able to buy a gun when you are intoxicated on alcohol. 
   That is all my amendment does. 
   I want to make one more point. And that is about what an individual cannot do when he or she is intoxicated. 
   States and localities have all sorts of laws that prohibit intoxicated people from engaging in certain activities and buying certain things that are otherwise legal. 
   There are State laws that prohibit people from serving alcohol to someone who is intoxicated, selling fireworks to someone who is intoxicated, and renting an intoxicated person a car. 
   But in reviewing State laws, we could not find a single State that prohibited the sale of guns to intoxicated persons. So this amendment--which prohibits it under federal law--is really critical. 
   Guns and alcohol do not mix. And all I am saying with this amendment is that if you are intoxicated, you cannot buy a gun or ammunition. It is very reasonable, and it will save lives. 
   In many States in this Union, if you are drunk you cannot drive a car, operate a boat, operate a snowmobile, fly a plane, even get on a plane, operate an all-terrain vehicle, ride a bike, and in West Virginia you cannot even obtain a tattoo if you are drunk. But you can go in and buy a gun. 
   So I think this is a really important step forward as we try to pass sensible gun control legislation. It is common sense. I am very pleased it has been accepted, and I am happy to yield the floor.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I thank my friends and say that clearly we are not suggesting in any way, shape, or form that people who are in the retail business and sell guns should have a breathalyzer. We are merely adding to this list a person who is intoxicated. 
   Clearly, under current law, you do not have to be a psychiatrist or you do not have to have a psychiatrist on your staff at K Mart, if you sell guns, to determine if someone is mentally ill. The way 18 U.S.C. 922(d) reads is you have to know or have reasonable cause to believe. It is a pretty broad definition. 
   I hope Senator CRAIG, in working with us, will recognize we are not doing anything different than we do for all of these other problem areas. It is just going to make the law stronger and better. We will stop people, such as Thomas Knapp, from walking in and buying a gun dead drunk, flat-out drunk, going home, and injuring a perfectly innocent person, in this case a loving person. I yield the floor.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, the reason I need a little time is that this is a complicated situation we are facing and it involves the whole issue of dolphin protection versus trade versus countries that owe money to the Tuna Commission and are not at this point paying their fair share. I will explain all of this. 
   All my amendment says is that until the Latin American countries pay their fair share to the Tuna Commission, they should not be allowed to export their tuna into this country. 
   The Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission has set these laws. It says that each member country to the Commission must pay its required share to the Commission and makes it clear that if they do not pay as required by current law, they may not export tuna into the United States. 
   Right now in this appropriations bill--and I think this is very important--our contribution is way too large. We are picking up the contribution of the Latin American countries. The contribution of each country is supposed to be based on the percentage of the catch in the eastern tropical Pacific. Our catch at maximum has been 40 percent, and yet in this bill, we are paying 75 percent of the total cost of the Commission. 
   I do not mind being Uncle Sam, but I object to being Uncle Sucker, and that is what we are doing. We should not be picking up the tab for countries that want the privilege of exporting their tuna into our markets. 
   There are three principal benefits from this amendment which, by the way, is cosponsored by Senator BIDEN, Senator JOHN KERRY, Senator DURBIN, Senator FEINGOLD, and Senator REID. 
   One, the amendment forces countries to pay their fair share of expenses which they committed to do when they signed on to 
   the Commission. 
   Two, the amendment will delay the importation of tuna that is caught by chasing and circling dolphins. It will stop that importation because we know that purse seining on dolphin hurts and harm the dolphin. There was a huge boycott in this country by the schoolchildren a long time ago because purse seining was seen by them and by many Americans as being wrong: harass the dolphin, chase the dolphin because they happen to swim over the tuna, then they encircle them, catch them in the net and a lot of them are harmed, some of them are killed. If we delay the importation of tuna that is caught in this fashion, we will be saving the dolphin. 
   Third, because we put a freeze on the amount of money that can be paid by the United States, or I should say be limited to $2.35 million, we are saving about $1 million, and that $1 million can go to a host of other places and commissions that deal with fisheries conservation. 
   It is important to note that the Tuna Commission is involved in many activities that affect all the member nations. Why should we be picking up the tab for them? There are costs associated with this commission, and the convention clearly indicated that each Nation should pay its fair share. It says the countries that fish more in this particular part of the ocean should pay more. 
   The convention states:  
   The proportion of joint expenses to be paid by each High Contacting Party shall be related to the proportion of the total catch from the fisheries covered by this Convention.*.*.*  
   This was decided in 1949, but it still makes sense. Countries are required to pay a share of expenses relative to their utilization of the fisheries. 
   The United States has always paid its fair share, but this year, for some unknown reason, we are paying the share of these other nations. We are not the largest beneficiary of tuna from the eastern tropical Pacific, and we should not be paying 75 percent of the cost. It must stop. Other countries should be carrying their own weight on this and, frankly, when we had our big debate over purse seining on dolphins and changing the label that goes on the tuna can--and many of us who really did not like this law went along with it--we went along with it in part because finally at least it recognized that these other countries have to pay their fair share, and now they are not doing it. 
   And these countries are purse seining the dolphin. They are harming the dolphin. We have seen a decline, since that tuna labeling bill went into effect, of 80,000 dolphin a year killed down to 5,000. Now, unfortunately, we lost that battle. This tuna that is caught in Latin American countries is going to come in, and these countries are not paying their fair share of the costs of the Commission. 
   So I think it is very important that we agree to this amendment. It isn't right that other countries are not paying their fair share. Frankly, it isn't right that other countries are encircling the dolphin, killing the dolphin, maiming the dolphin, and they want to come in to our market, and they want to come in without doing anything to pay their share. 
   Scientists, consumers, and tuna companies agree that chasing and netting is not safe for dolphins. The dolphin population in the eastern tropical Pacific are not recovering. And the harassment by these fishermen is a tremendous problem that is affecting dolphin reproduction. So what do we do? Instead of trying to encourage safe fishing methods, we say to the other countries: Just do not worry. Send this tuna in. We will even pay your share of the cost of the International Tuna Commission. 
   I understand that Senator BIDEN is on his way over, so I reserve the remainder of my time for him. I am happy to yield to the other side who is opposing us on this amendment. 
   Mr. GREGG addressed the Chair.

   Mrs. BOXER. The United States portion of its catch and utilization is less than 40 percent, yet it has been paying 91 percent of the cost of the Commission. As my friend pointed out, there are nations here--Ecuador is catching 26 percent, and they are paying nothing. So what are we doing here? 
   I know these countries are our friends, but the taxpayers are our friends, too, besides which, these countries are purse seining on dolphin, and they are hurting those beautiful creatures. So why are we in such a rush to cover their payments and let them bring in this tuna? 
   My last point is another point my friend from Illinois made. He usually hits the nail on the head; he has done it again. Here are some of the other commissions that could benefit from the $1 million we are saving in this amendment: the Great Lakes Fishery Commission, Pacific Salmon Commission, International Pacific Halibut Commission, International Whaling Commission--it goes on and on--North Atlantic Salmon Conservation Organization, North Pacific Marine Science Organization, Inter-American Sea Turtle Convention Commission, Commission for the Conservation of Highly Migratory Species in the Western and Central Pacific Ocean. 
   Here we see that what we are doing is taking money from our taxpayers to pay for the Latin American countries that are going to get away with not paying their bill, and still they are allowed, unless we pass this Boxer-Biden-Kerry amendment, to export their tuna into this country--I want to underscore--unlike the American companies, that are really good to the dolphin and use safe fishing practices. They will bring their tuna in after purse seining dolphin, harassing the dolphin, killing them, maiming them, harming them, hurting their reproductive capacity. 
   With this amendment, I think we do a lot of good things. We save money, we help other commissions, and we stand up to our friends in Latin America and say: Pay the bills. 
   I yield to my friend from South Carolina.

   Mrs. BOXER. My friend is exactly on target. When we reached this compromise, which wasn't a happy compromise for us, one of the clear understandings was that as these countries sought to export their tuna, which has been banned from this country, as my friend knows, for a long time, because of their fishing methods which are so cruel to the dolphin, we said: If you have to bring this tuna in, then pay your fair share of the commission. 
   Essentially, if you look at the public law that we did pass, you will find it exactly here. In order for them to export, such nation, the section says, ``is meeting the obligation of the International Dolphin Conservation Program and the obligations of membership, including all financial obligations.'' 
   This is the law Senator STEVENS agreed to, Senator BREAUX agreed to, Senator GREGG agreed to, and all of us--sad that we were that we didn't win what we wanted--agreed to. Now they are not paying their fair share, and they still say, well, let them export their tuna. This is wrong.

   Mrs. BOXER. Could I ask a final question? 
   My friend and I have been on this floor on numerous occasions as proposals have come forward to raise the eligibility age for Medicare to 67 or 68. We have said, at a time when there are so many Americans with no health insurance, let us not raise the eligible age for Medicare. 
   I know how strongly the Senator feels, and how Senator 
   SARBANES and I feel about Medicare. Does my friend not believe, as I do that, when we talk about the safety net for our senior citizens, we must talk about Social Security and Medicare--that, in fact, they are the twin pillars of the safety net? 
   I ask my friend--and I will yield to him--that if we save Social Security--and both parties have agreed, because President Clinton laid down the challenge, that that was good--and then do nothing about Medicare--which is the Republican plan--and suddenly those on Medicare have to pay $200, $300, or $400 a month more for their health care because Medicare is strapped, does that not mean there really is no safety net because the seniors will have to use their Social Security to pay out-of-pocket expenses for their health care? 
   Does my friend believe, as I do, that to say you are reserving the safety net for seniors and at the same time you do nothing for Medicare, it is really kind of a fraud on the people?

   Mrs. BOXER. I have to again say thank you to the Senator. I was looking at some of the analysis of the Republican tax cut, the across-the-board one. It said, if you earn about $300,000 a year, you would get a $20,000-a-year tax cut. I wonder if the Senator has thought about this. The tax cut, therefore, for those folks who earn over $300,000, would be almost twice as much money as a person working on the minimum wage earns, which is approximately $11,000, $12,000. Could my friend just talk about the unfairness of that situation?

   Mrs. BOXER. It is a very brief question. 
   I have just gone over with my colleague and some of our staff the fact that the House sent this bill over 3 weeks ago. We did our work. They did their work. And when our friend, the majority leader, says we are dragging our feet, we certainly didn't drag our feet on the juvenile justice bill. 
   I ask my friend if he agrees that we have not dragged our feet on that bill and that we have acted as we should. God knows, we want to make sure we do something to make things better. 
   As I see it, on June 23, 1999, this bill was placed on the calendar. No one is dragging their feet on this bill. Both Houses have done their work, and it is time to move forward to avoid another tragedy. 
   I ask my friend if he agrees with that.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, Californians have been deeply saddened and moved by a number of losses we have faced. One involves the death of the senior member of our California Democratic delegation, George Brown, who was a beloved Congressman on both sides of the aisle. As a matter of fact, one of the Republicans in the House said on his passing, if everyone was like George Brown, we would not need to go on retreats to find out how to get along better with one another. 
   George Brown was that kind of person. George was a man of great compassion, of great reason. He was consistent. He never changed his views according to the polls. He was a mentor of mine when he ran for the Senate in 1970, which takes us back a long time. I very proudly worked on his campaign simply as a volunteer. He was an advocate for science and technology, and although he was 79 years old, he was an ageless person. He had so many young ideas, and he was so future oriented. 
   Then, of course, the Nation faced the tragedy that befell the Kennedy family once again with the tragic loss of John F. Kennedy, Jr., and his wife and her sister. The press was calling and asking for a comment. I said it truly is a tragedy beyond words. I think at times such as these all you can really do is pray that the family will be able to cope with a loss of such enormity. 
   I particularly want to spend a moment talking about my colleague, TED KENNEDY, because after all the tragedies with which the family has had to deal, TED has become a real father figure to the entire next generation of Kennedys. I know how Senator KENNEDY teaches those of us who have not been here as long as he, how he monitors us and guides us. 
   I can just imagine the close bond he had with John Kennedy, Jr., and what this has done to his heart. I know when he does come back, every one of us will give him our strength. 
   When President Kennedy died, Robert Kennedy said the following. He said:  
   When I think of President Kennedy, I think of what Shakespeare said in Romeo and Juliet: 
 When he shall die, take him and cut him out into stars and he shall make the face of heaven so fine that all the world will be in love with night and pay no worship to the garish sun.  
   I think when we think of John Kennedy, Jr., we will think of him sharing in those bright stars. 
   To close, I have a poem that was written by someone who is in her thirties. I think the words will have meaning for those who look to John, Jr., for their future. This is what it is called: ``If Only We Could Have Said Goodbye.'' 
 Our special son the namesake he of honorable tradition to serve our great country 
 Passed down through generations of dedicated, determined souls He understood our devotion and carried with him a nation's hope 
 This honor never did he shun In public he graced us well With patience he regaled us with tales Of hiding behind the Oval's chair, Or that indelible salute 
 We mourned together his father's fate While marveling his mother's grace These traits were passed on to Kennedy's own to John, indeed 
 Could he be the return of Camelot? We wondered and inside we cheered this Kennedy's fate with the wish that he could fulfill in his time those hopes left so unmade 
 Or perhaps just share with us, a bit of the mystery, a bit of your name If only we could have said goodbye  
   Mr. President, it is a sad day across this land. Our prayers are with the Kennedy family and the Bessette family. 
   I thank the majority leader for yielding me this time.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am so grateful to the majority leader. This morning there was, I thought, a very good presentation by several colleagues concerning S. 25, the Murkowski-Landrieu bill. This legislation, which is supported by a number of my colleagues, is called the Conservation and Reinvestment Act. 
   I want to say that is a wonderful title because it implies that we are going to conserve something and that we are going to reinvest money to make our environment better. 
   It is very tempting when you first look at the bill to say this is an excellent bill. But as you get into the bill, and as you listen to the remarks of my colleagues who are for it, you basically realize that it does basically one thing and one thing only; that is, it encourages more offshore oil drilling on Federal lands because it makes the revenues States receive dependent upon how much offshore oil drilling they engage in off their coast. 
   What it means for States such as California that protect its coastline by restricting offshore oil drilling, is that there will be less funding for conservation, and States that encourage offshore oil drilling, which I believe despoils the environment, will be rewarded by far more funds. States that have absolutely no offshore drilling and those that are landlocked also do not benefit from this bill. 
   While purporting to simply provide guaranteed funding for the Land and Water Conservation Fund, S. 25 distorts the fundamental principle behind the establishment of the Act. 
   The original idea behind it is to purchase beautiful lands for future generations. 
   When I ask colleagues if, in fact, S. 25 encourages offshore oil drilling--they say, no; we don't. But yet if you listened to Senator MURKOWSKI's comments on the floor today, you will hear something different. This is what he said about the bill, S. 25:  
   In order to have a successful Conservation and Reinvestment act, we've got to have a continuation of OCS revenues occurring off the shores of some of our States.''  
   He went on to say: 
   Support for this legislation is related, to some extent, by those States that see an opportunity to generate a source of revenue. 
   And continued to say:  
   In order for it to be successful, we have to have and encourage offshore revenue sharing.  
   Clearly, what Senator MURKOWSKI is saying about S. 25 is the truth. That is, if a State wants to receive more funds, they should allow and promote more offshore oil drilling off their coasts. 
   I come from a State that treasures its coastline and knows that the impact of offshore oil drilling is devastating. I don't think we should be punished because we stand strong in our State in a very bipartisan way, to say we don't want this impact. 
   I don't believe S. 25 is a conservation bill. I believe the principal goal is to encourage more offshore oil drilling, and thereby bring about more destruction to the environment--not less destruction. 
   States that have active drilling programs will be the primary benefactors. There is no question about it. Alaska, Texas, and Louisiana get 50 percent of the money while the entire Nation will lose as we deplete a beautiful federal publicly-owned natural resource; namely, our ocean. 
   This doesn't seem fair. This is a national resources owned by the American people. As such revenue from this resource must be shared throughout our nation. 
   States that are protecting their resource and don't have offshore oil drilling, as well as States that are landlocked, will 
   lose under S. 25. 
   I introduced a bill that really does fulfill our commitment to the preservation of our natural resources. Congressman George Miller introduced the companion bill in the House. The bill we introduced, the Resources 2000 Act, has a number of fine cosponsors. In fact, 37 states would benefit more from the funding distribution under Resources 2000 than in S. 25. 
   I hope colleagues will look at the Resources 2000 bill, which has the support of over 200 environmental organizations. 
   Those on my bill include Senators DIANNE FEINSTEIN, PAUL SARBANES, CHUCK SCHUMER, FRANK LAUTENBERG, PAUL WELLSTONE, TED KENNEDY, JOE BIDEN, BARBARA MIKULSKI, BOB TORRICELLI, and JOHN KERRY. We have more coming. 
   We have a national resource--our oceans. We destroy that resource when we drill for oil. 
   Frankly, the amount of oil that is there isn't worth all the destruction that follows. However, if a State wants to do this, that is their option. 
   But I don't think they should get rewarded more because they do not mind destroying their coast. States that care about their coast and protect and defend it with laws and coastal zone management plans are penalized under S. 25. 
   In 1965, Congress established the Land and Water Conservation Fund. Congress decided that as we deplete one of our nation's natural non-resources, we should invest that money into protecting and preserving our nation's renewable resources. The Act required that we take the revenue from offshore oil drilling and put that money into purchasing critical lands. 
   They take the money and they repair. They repair, and they buy beautiful tracts of land to save it in perpetuity. Part of that money is supposed to be for historic preservation, which we haven't fully funded either.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, when I entered the United States Senate in 1993, women's rights were strong and secure. That year alone, we passed the Violence Against Women Act, the Family and Medical Leave Act, and the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act. We lifted the gag rule, which freed up doctors to tell their patients that abortion is a legal option. 
   Things are quite different now. Since 1994, the tide has turned against women's rights, as there have been nearly 100 votes to restrict choice, and pro-choice forces have lost most of these votes. 
   Congress recently blocked women in the military and military dependents from using their own funds to obtain an abortion at military facilities. The House of Representatives voted to make it a crime for any adult to help a teenager travel to another state to avoid her home state's restrictive parental consent laws, and the Senate voted to prohibit women who work for the federal government from accessing health plans that offer abortion services. 
   At the same time, violence against clinics and health care workers is increasing. Last year, the Feminist Majority reported that nearly one out of four clinics faced severe anti-abortion violence including death threats, stalking, bomb threats, bombings, arson threats, arson, blockades, invasions, and chemical attacks. 
   In my own state of California, there have been 29 recorded incidents of violence against clinics since 1984. The firebombing of a women's health care clinic on July 2 in Sacramento serves as a grim reminder that this violence continues. 
   While there are many in the community and in Congress who have helped fight off assaults on women's health rights, playing defense is not enough. We need a positive agenda for women's health, choice and family planning if we hope to move the pendulum back the other way. 
   The Family Planning and Choice Protection Act of 1999 sets out such an agenda. This comprehensive bill is pro-choice, pro-family planning, and pro-  women's health. It will improve family planning programs and services; strengthen women's right to choose; expand access to contraceptive coverage; protect patients and employees at reproductive health care facilities; and give law enforcement the resources needed to protect women's legal rights.

   Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I thank Senator KENNEDY for his incredible leadership on this issue. 
   Last night, I said the score was 8 to 0; it was 8 for the HMOs, patients nothing. I think this amendment is worth 2 points, so it will either be 10 to nothing or 8 to 2. 
   Let me tell you why I think this amendment is so important. If this amendment is agreed to and the HMOs cannot be held accountable in a court of law, it means that if they kill you, if they maim you, if they hurt you or your family or your children due to callous and uncaring bureaucrats, they cannot be held accountable. We set no new Federal cause of action. We simply say if the States believe it is right--such as Texas decided it was--then they can allow these lawsuits to proceed. 
   Let me tell you about an emergency room physician I met. He came before the Congress. He told a harrowing tale of a man who was brought into the emergency room with uncontrollable blood pressure. The doctor tried everything. Finally, by administering drugs through an IV, he was able to control the pressure. He felt the man needed to stay in the hospital at least overnight. He called the HMO. The HMO said, ``Absolutely not. Give the man his medication and send him home.'' 
   The doctor begged. The doctor cajoled. The HMO was unrelenting. The doctor went to the patient. He said, ``Your HMO will not allow you to stay here, sir, but I strongly advise you to stay here.'' 
   The patient said, ``What will it cost?" 
   The doctor said, ``About $5,000.'' 
   This gentleman started laughing. He said: I don't have $5,000. I have a family. I have to go home. I have a job. I am sure my HMO would never do this to me, would never put me in danger. If they say I can have the drugs, give me the drugs, and I will go home. 
   The doctor could not prevail with the gentleman. The gentleman went home and had a stroke. He is now paralyzed on one side of his body. 
   I ask for an additional 30 seconds on the bill.

   Mrs. BOXER. So now what happens? This man is paralyzed for life. Oh, he could sue the doctor, that good doctor who begged the HMO. Yes, he could sue the hospital. The hospital had nothing to do with it. 
   I am saying to my friends on the other side of the aisle, you are always talking about States rights. We come in here and get lectured every day. All this amendment, under the underlying bill, says is, if a State decides to allow their people the right to sue a callous, uncaring, and negligent HMO, as Texas decided to do and other States did, let them do it. 
   I hope this amendment will be defeated. Remember, it is worth 2 points.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, by popular demand, I have my scorecard back. It was 8 to nothing. And then I gave two points to the liability, one, because that is crucial. Unfortunately, we lost that--the patients did. The HMOs won. They still will be able to get away with hurting people and not paying any price whatsoever. 
   So we are 10 to nothing. 
   We are about to have two votes. The Collins amendment is opposed by the obstetricians and gynecologists who  have sent out a letter saying it is nothing; it is a cruel nothing. I have their exact words at everybody's desk. 
   I hope we will vote that down. It doesn't do anything about the specialists. It doesn't do anything about OB/GYNs. It doesn't do anything about emergency rooms. Senator GRAMM pointed that out. They are still going to be charged. 
   Again, we have a sham proposal. I hope it will be 10 to 2 after the next two votes. But I am afraid it is going to be 12 to zero. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I say to my friend, who is my chairman, how much I respect him and also how much I disagree with him. 
   I ask my friend a question. The Senator said--and I think he said it very clearly and straight from the heart--the Democrats are wrong, it is a philosophical difference, that we are wrong to say we need a national bill because the States are taking care of this problem. 
   Senator DORGAN has a chart. I want to ask the Senator if he will take a look at it. Thirty-eight States have no protection for their people when it comes to access to specialists. It goes down the list. Many States have virtually no protection on most of the issues we are debating in this Patients' Bill of Rights. The question is, How does the Senator respond to that? 
   He has said States are taking care of it when, just taking specialists, there are no protections for people getting specialists in 38 States, and there is a whole other list that I won't go into. I think that is an important question. I would like to hear the Senator's response to it.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, if I may take back my time, I ran for the Senate on a lot of issues. My friend has been elected many more times than I have to the Senate. We stand up and we say what we believe. 
   For example, I know the Senator is very strong on mental health protection. I have been with him on that. For me to think that I am going to sit here and say some legislature in some other State knows more than what my people tell me, I think we are here to do the people's business. When we look at this list, when we see how many things people don't have, I think it is ducking responsibility to say we should walk away from it. 
   By the way, the Republican bill claims to give people specialists, so the Senator himself has argued in favor of it for 48 million people. 
   Mr. REID addressed the Chair.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, we are in the final inning, so it is time to bring out the scoreboard. 
   HMOs, 12; patients, zero. It is a shutout. On every amendment, patients have lost and the HMOs have won. Mr. President, 12-0 and counting. 
   The Republican bill will pass. It is a bill supported by the insurance industry. It is a bill supported by the HMOs. 
   This is what it leaves out: It leaves out OB/GYNs for women, the right to a specialist, the right to an emergency room, the right to a clinical trial for every fatal disease, the right for all Americans to be covered--70 percent of  Americans are not covered in the Republican bill. It leaves out the right to hold HMOs accountable if they kill you, if they maim you, if they hurt you or any member of your family. 
   The Republican bill is a shutout. The American people are shut out from any protections. Patients are shut out. Decency and fairness are shut out. And the HMOs will continue to put their dollar signs ahead of our vital signs. 
   We will not give up. The innings may be over on this particular battle, but we are going to be here. We will be here for several more years and we will fight this. As Senator DORGAN said, a lot of these fights took a long time. It took a long time to get Medicare. There were fights from the other side of the aisle that it was a horrible idea to give senior citizens coverage. 
   I could go back in history. We will be on the right side of history because we are fighting for what is right for the patients of this country, for the people of this country. It has been a good debate. I am glad we have had it. I think it does show the difference between the parties. I think we are very open and honest about our differences. I am proud to stand on this side of the aisle on this Patients' Bill of Rights.

   Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Chair, and I thank the Democratic whip for yielding me this time. 
   Mr. President, I rise in favor of the Dodd amendment, which deals with access to clinical trials and access to prescription drugs. I think this is a very important amendment, and I am very proud to speak in favor of it. 
   Yesterday, as I left the floor of the Senate, I realized what the score was for the people: Zero. In very close votes in each case, this Republican majority voted, with rare exception, for the HMOs and against the patients of this country. It is stunning to me to see that, a most amazing thing. 
   As I discussed some of what happened yesterday with my Democratic friends, who happened to be women, we were all stunned at the vote against a very straightforward amendment by Senator ROBB which basically said, after a mastectomy, a doctor should determine the length of stay. It is stunning to me that that couldn't pass the Senate. The hold and the grip of the HMOs is extraordinary. 
   There is a cartoon in today's Washington Post that I find very interesting. It pictures huge campaign contributions. The Senator from Wisconsin talks about that all the time. I am not surprised people are cynical. All I hope is that they wake up and listen to this debate. This amendment on clinical trials is one they ought to listen to. 
   What is a clinical trial? A clinical trial occurs when there is a promising new therapy for a condition, a disease for which traditional therapies are not working for everyone. So what happens is people will enroll in these clinical trials; usually, they are pretty desperate at that point because their disease is not responding well to the traditional therapies. They want to get into this trial, and they want to see if they have a chance at surviving. The good news about this for society is not only will this individual have a chance of surviving, but we learn about the therapy, and, of course, it is the way we have seen therapies move into the mainstream of treatment. 
   Well, what is happening now with the HMOs--because they are so interested in their profits and paying their CEOs $30 million, in one case, and $50 million a year in another case--is they are cutting back on costs. So where they used to pay the costs associated with a clinical trial, not for the experimental therapy itself, because that is paid by the company that invented it, but by the associated costs, if there are reactions to the therapy, et cetera, they are cutting back on this treatment. So by their refusal to pay for the patient cost, many research institutions--particularly cancer centers--are cutting back on the clinical trials because there is a lack of payment by the HMOs, and we are running into a real serious problem. 
   When you continually put profit before patient care, when you continually put dollar signs ahead of vital signs, what happens is we are losing the opportunity to test these promising treatments for cancer, for Alzheimer's, for Parkinson's, for diabetes, for AIDS--you name the disease. By the way, if you ask the average American what they fear most, they will tell you it is illness; it is cancer; it is heart disease; it is stroke; it is the loss of a loved one. 
   So what we have is a situation where HMOs are refusing to pay the patient costs in clinical trials, and clinical trials are being cut back at the very time when we are making tremendous strides in learning more about therapies. This is a sad day. 
   So what we do in this amendment is essentially say let's go back to the way it always was, where the HMOs pay for the costs associated with these clinical trials for their patients. If we don't pass this amendment and this trend continues, we will reverse the trend of finding better cures for disease. 
   The other thing this amendment does, which is really important, is it deals with access to prescription drugs. Nearly all the HMOs have developed what is called a formulary, which is a limited list of prescription drugs for which the HMO will pay. They do this to receive discounts from drug companies and to limit the number of medications for which they pay. This is a cost-saving measure. I don't have a problem with this--except when the formulary drug isn't right for the patient, except when a doctor says the drug his patient needs is not in the formulary. What this amendment says is that the HMO must pay for the drug that a doctor determines his patient needs, even if it isn't in the list that the HMO provided. 
   It also says in this amendment that HMOs cannot classify a drug that is approved by the FDA as experimental, which is one of the ways they get around having to pay for a drug. They say to a patient: Well, I know your doctor wants you to use this drug, but it is experimental. 
   Well, if a drug is approved by the FDA, the Food and Drug Administration, then it is clear that the drug has been approved and ought to be available. 
   So this is a very important measure. This will ensure we keep making progress on clinical trials. This will ensure people get access to the needed drugs. I hope we will stand up, not as we did yesterday, because this Senate sat down for the people and stood up for the big money interests in this society, the HMOs and their bottom line. Let's stand up for the people and let's support this Dodd amendment. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Chair. 
   Mr. President, I feel really bad about what is happening here. Every single amendment, the people lose and the HMOs win. 
   There is a cruel irony in the Snowe amendment, which the Senator from Connecticut tried to repair and could not. Let me tell my colleagues about the cruel irony of the Snowe amendment. 
   That amendment treats women who need mastectomies with dignity, and I am for that. That is why I supported the Robb amendment yesterday, and that is why I agree with the Snowe amendment. But let me tell my colleagues what else the Senator from Maine does that makes this a real cruel irony. At the same time she gives dignity to women who have to undergo mastectomies and gives them bed care, she strikes the Dodd amendment which would allow those same women to choose another option other than mastectomy by getting into a clinical trial. 
   To explain that specifically, I have a dear friend who I have known for many years. She was diagnosed with breast cancer. The doctor said: You have three alternatives: One, you can get into a clinical trial on tamoxifen; two, you can get into a clinical trial on a new drug called reluxifen; three, you can have a double mastectomy. My friend wanted to avoid the mastectomy. She is doing everything she can to get into a clinical trial, and she is reaching obstacle after obstacle after obstacle. 
   The Dodd amendment says, if someone is in need of a different type of therapy--and it is very tightly drawn--they have a right to get into that therapy. 
   What the Snowe amendment says to women is: Yes, my dear, if you need a mastectomy, we will treat you fairly. That is good. But, no, my dear, we cannot guarantee you the right to get into a clinical trial to avoid that amputation, as my friend from Maryland called it yesterday. 
   That is just one example, a personal example of someone I know. There is no reason we can't get around the parliamentary hurdles. We are good at  that. We know how to do it. As a matter of fact, I am going to make a unanimous consent request at the end of my remarks, I alert the Senator from Vermont, to solve our problem and to put the two together, the Snowe amendment and the Dodd amendment. 
   The Dodd amendment ensures that if your doctor says you need a certain type of drug to solve your health problem, your HMO cannot keep that prescription drug away from you by claiming it is not in their formula. 
   Here we have the Snowe amendment, which takes a giant step forward in the treatment of women with mastectomies but, at the same time, strikes the opportunity for women to get into clinical trials to get the drugs they need that are necessary to give them their health. This is a sad day. 
   What is the response from the Senator from Maine? Gee, I am sorry about this; it is parliamentary. 
   I am very sad. I have never seen the Senate be as partisan as it is on this issue. This is a sad, sad day. What happened to the days of Kennedy-Kassebaum? It wasn't that long ago that we worked together when we could agree. I think the American people are the losers, and women are the losers. 
   Yesterday, we had a situation on this floor--I have handed out on each desk an example of this--where Senator ROBB offered an amendment. Senator ROBB said that OB/GYNs want the right to be primary care providers. Senator FRIST stands up and says: They don't want to be primary care providers. He quoted a particular doctor and said this doctor, an OB/GYN, doesn't want to be a primary care provider. 
   That was false. That was false. I have the proof right on your desk. This doctor says:  
   Senator FRIST's misuse of my statement in support of his position that OB/GYNs could not act as primary care physicians.......is, to say the least, misleading and does an injustice to the true intent of my statements.  
   He supports OB/GYNs being designated as primary care providers. 
   Then a letter from the organization that says it is imperative that doctors who are OB/GYNs be primary care providers. 
   Let's stop the misstatements, and let's put together the Dodd amendment and the Snowe amendment. 
   As a matter of fact, I ask unanimous consent that S. 1344 and the Daschle substitute amendment be modified with language from the Snowe amendment No. 1241 prohibiting drive-by mastectomies and requiring coverage for second opinions, and this will keep the clinical trials and the drive-by mastectomies provision.

   Mrs. BOXER. I think it is very important that the people in my home State understand that the Republican plan does not do anything for very many of them. 
   The second question I have deals with children. As the Senator from North Dakota pointed out, we do have national laws. This is one Nation, under God, indivisible, and we do have national laws. I find it unbelievable that colleagues on the other side--a couple came over and said: States are taking care of all these issues. 
   I want to talk about children. Every Senator in this body I know cares about kids. I know they care about kids. They care about their own kids, their grandkids, and the kids they represent. I ask my friend to elaborate on this. If we can have child labor laws which say you cannot hire a child, you have to wait for a certain age, and when you do, there are certain rules that apply, should we have a national law that protects every child in this country so if that child comes down with a cancer, they are not told by their HMO: Go see a general surgeon; you don't need a pediatric surgeon? 
   I know my friend has had experience with this. Can he talk just a moment about why the Democratic plan is for the children of this country and the Republican plan is a sham?

   Mrs. BOXER. The only rationale I could find--I was here when my friend asked Senator ABRAHAM the same question--this Republican plan has been pieced together. It makes no sense. It is a political response, I believe, to the Democratic proposal. They looked at this issue, and they said: OK, when it comes to mastectomies, we'll make our plan apply to everybody. 
   But, by the way, if you get ovarian cancer, under the Republican plan you do not get the benefits. If a man gets prostate cancer, he doesn't get the benefits. If you are a little child and you have a rare form of cancer, like one of my constituents, Carley Christie--and there were only a couple doctors who knew how to handle it--you are out of luck. 
   They say leave it to the States? Fine. If the States want to do a good job, we are happy. We are just setting a floor in this bill, as the Senator from Massachusetts points out. 
   So I can only respond by saying their approach is pieced together. It is a political response to a real issue. They are doing the least they can do to try to say, with a straight face, they have done something. The bottom line is, their bill is hollow, and if my friend's amendment does not pass, it will make virtually no difference to most of the people in this country.

   Mrs. BOXER. I say to my friend, 50 million are left out. I say to my friend, the vast majority of women are left out. In the last amendment by Senator SNOWE, the one good thing she did is cover all the women in terms of her amendment that dealt with mastectomies. We are facing an amendment, whereas the underlying bill will guarantee--that is the Democratic bill--all women these protections, this only applies to a very small percentage of the women. Let's make sure people know this is a sham.

   Mrs. BOXER. It would leave out about two-thirds. My friend is correct. I wonder, I say to my friend, what his response is. I was asked that question by Senator KENNEDY. The only thing I can come up with is politics. The heat was on on the mastectomy issue, the light was on, so they covered everybody. Now on this other amendment, they do not cover all the women. 
   If my colleagues will turn to page 8 of this bill, I say to my friend from Maine and my friend from Vermont, if they will read the way they have structured this, it says:  
   A group health plan described in this paragraph may treat the ordering of other care that is related to obstetrics or routine gynecological care.  
   ``May treat.'' It does not say they have to. This, I say to my friends, is a sham proposal. It does not do anything for the women of this country. It leaves out two-thirds of the women, and it leaves it up to the health plan if they are going to give this kind of care. 
   Let me tell my colleagues specifically what I mean. Yes, they provide access for routine gynecological care. Suppose you finish your checkup, everything is fine and a month later you find a lump in your breast. You cannot go to that OB/GYN, except if the Democratic bill passes because we give direct access to women and make OB/GYNs the primary health care provider. 
   In the debate yesterday, the Senator from Tennessee stood on this floor and said the OB/GYNs do not want to be primary care providers. That was an untruth. We have a letter on the desks from the organization that represents them, and the gentleman who was cited on the floor of this Senate said it was a misrepresentation; they support the Democratic proposal. They want to be primary care providers. 
   So we have an amendment here that purports to help women, but, A, it does not help the vast majority of the women in this country; B, it undermines the Democratic bill, which says you can go to your OB/GYN any time you want without having to go through a gatekeeper; and, C, it does not treat women the way they ought to be treated. 
   So I would call on my colleagues to support the underlying Democratic bill.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I have been keeping score of these votes, where the HMOs are in every single vote. It may not be an All-Star game, but 7-0, HMOs over patients, that is where we are. Every single amendment they have won on their position, and the vote on every single amendment has basically been party line. To me, it is a sad day in this greatest of all deliberative bodies to have such partisan voting. 
   I wanted to mention a couple of things to the Senator from Arizona before he leaves the floor. In his opening he was very gracious. He said: Yes, it is true, some HMOs have made mistakes in their zeal to cut costs. I think he was very accurate in the way he talked about it. 
   The Republican bill--and this is such an irony--does not even cover HMOs. It covers only the 48 million people who essentially have self-funded plans. So the Republican bill doesn't even reach to the people in this country who utilize HMOs.

   Mrs. BOXER. Yes. I will take this on my own time. As Senator EDWARDS pointed out, it is a meaningless situation which I hope the Senator is going to correct. We talked about correcting it after the Senator from Vermont said it is perfect. Now we hear there is an amendment coming. Good, we are looking forward to seeing it. 
   But the basic bill, as Senator KENNEDY has pointed out, does not cover the vast majority of the people. Take the Collins amendment. The Collins amendment does not cover the vast majority of women in its provisions, or the vast majority of patients. Mr. President, 77 percent of the people in California are not covered by the basic bill. If you look at the whole Nation, it is about 70 percent or so. So it is 7-0, and we have many more amendments to go. I do not have much hope this is going to change. That is why I have this little flip chart. But we are hoping for something better in the later innings. 
   Let me say to my friends who support the Collins amendment, do not be fooled. You better look at this letter that just came in from the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. Let me tell you what it says.  
   This amendment is an empty promise to the millions of women enrolled in managed care plans, covering only one in three women in ERISA-regulated plans......[It erects] new barriers to follow-up care for both ob and gyn services.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, this debate is very interesting, but it is very sad because we, on our side of the aisle, are offering amendments to try to correct real problems that are happening to real people. On the other side, we get empty promises. Not my words, the words of the OB/GYNs: Empty promises, sham, shells, but nothing real. So it is 7-0. 
   I rise also in support of a very fine amendment. I rise in very strong support of Senator BINGAMAN's amendment on specialists. 
   I want to tell you about one of my constituents, Carley Christie. I met her dad a long time ago. These are his words:  
   Carley was 9 years old when she was diagnosed with malignant kidney cancer: When the HMO insisted we trust our daughter's delicate surgery to a doctor with no experience in this area, we were forced to find an expert and pay for it ourselves.  
   Mr. President, $50,000 Mr. Christie had to come up with. He said:  
   You only get one chance at removing a Wilms' tumor correctly and successfully to ensure the highest probability of survival in children, and we weren't going to take that chance with our daughter's life because the HMO wanted to save money.  
   And he goes on to say:  
   Congress must close the ERISA loophole and hold health plans accountable for cost-cutting decisions that result in patient injury.  
   These are the words of a dad, a loving dad. We have a lot of loving dads in this institution. We have a lot of loving granddads in this institution. One is on the floor right now, the Senator from Utah. 
   I have to tell you, we have to start acting to help loving moms and dads such as this because we are not doing that. 
   I ask for 30 additional seconds.

   Mrs. BOXER. We are not acting on behalf of loving dads such as Harry Christie. We are turning our backs on them and we are acting in favor of the HMOs against the patients, against the Carley Christies, against the Harry Christies. It is wrong and we ought to change and we ought to support the Bingaman amendment and get on the right track. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I thank Senator KENNEDY for his work on this, and Senator MIKULSKI for her inspirational talk, and Senator ROBB for offering an amendment that I think is crucial to the women of this country. I am eternally grateful to him for putting this amendment together. 
   Earlier, Senator SMITH made a very eloquent talk about the need to set aside politics and do what is right for the people. I think we have an extraordinary opportunity to do that on this Patients' Bill of Rights. It is really very simple to do. Whether we are Democrats or Republicans or Independents, we can set all that aside and follow this simple rule, asking every time we vote: What is best for the people of our Nation? That is it, the simple question: What is best for the children? What is best for the women? What is best for the men? What is best for the families, the old or the young, et cetera. 
   The Robb amendment is good for American women. As a matter of fact, the Robb amendment is crucially needed. It is desperately needed. The Senator from Maryland was eloquent on the point. Think about finding out you have breast cancer and learning you have to have a mastectomy. You do not need to be a genius to understand that you want a doctor making the decision as to how long you stay in the hospital. 
   It is very simple: Mastectomies are major surgery. Cancer is life-threatening and difficult. It is physical pain. It is mental anguish for you and your family. You don't want an accountant or a chief operating officer in an HMO telling you to leave after a few hours, with tubes running up and down you and being sick as a dog and throwing up and all the rest. I hate to be graphic about it, but we have to come to our senses in this debate. What is the argument against this? It is going to cost more? We know the CBO says it is maybe $2 a month to obtain all the benefits in the Patients' Bill of Rights. I think it is worth $2 a month to know a doctor makes the decision. 
   I want to talk about the CEOs of these HMOs. They make millions of dollars a year. They are skimming off the top, off of our health care quality, and putting it in their pockets. They make $10 million a year, $20 million a year, $30 million a year--one person. If his wife comes down with cancer and needs a mastectomy, do you think he is going to leave the decision to an accountant in an HMO? You know he is not. He is going to dig into his pocket, into his $30-million-a-year pocket, and pay for her to obtain good care. 
   What about the average woman? What about our aunts and our uncles and our neighbors? They deserve the same kind of attention and care. That is what the Robb amendment will do. 
   It will do something else. Again, I am so grateful to the Senator from Virginia on this point. Senator MURRAY had offered the mastectomy amendment in committee, and even Senators who were on the original Feinstein-D'Amato bill, Republican Senators, voted against her amendment in the committee. She is on the floor fighting for this. 
   Senator SNOWE and I, in a bipartisan way, introduced a bill that would require your OB/GYN, your obstetrician/gynecologist, to be your basic health care provider. Senator ROBB has included that in his amendment. 
   The reality is that a woman does consider her OB/GYN as her primary care physician. Let's make it a guarantee that her OB/GYN can refer her to a specialist. You do not have to jump through hoops. 
   Mr. President, 70 percent of the women in this country use their OB/GYN as their only physician from the time they are quite young. So the Robb amendment recognizes the reality. 
   Let me tell you why we should come together, both parties, on this amendment. Let's look at what happens to women who regularly see an OB/GYN. A woman whose OB/GYN is her regular doctor is more likely to have a complete physical exam, blood pressure readings, cholesterol test, clinical breast exam, mammogram, pelvic exam, and Pap test. 
   This is why it is so important. These are the threats to women.

   Mrs. BOXER. So you can see that the women who use their OB/GYN on a regular basis get what is necessary for them to stay healthy, to avoid the traumas, to avoid the problem of missing, for example, a breast cancer because they do not have that regular mammogram. 
   In conclusion, we have Senator ROBB who has long been a champion for women's health, and I can tell you chapter and verse that I have worked with him over these years and he has taken the most important issues to the women of this country and has rolled them into one, plus an additional part that deals with the deductibility of premiums if you are self-employed. 
   This is a wonderful amendment. This is not an amendment that responds to Democrats, Republicans, or any other party. It is for American women and their families. I urge us to support this fine amendment. 
   I yield back my time.

   Mrs. BOXER. Is the Senator aware that when he talks about people losing their insurance, there is a $100 million effort going on by the HMOs to scare people into thinking that if the Democratic Patients' Bill of Rights passes--which is supported by all the health care advocate groups in the country--they will lose their insurance? 
   Is the Senator aware that his own Congressional Budget Office has clearly stated the maximum cost of the Democratic Patients' Bill of Rights is $2 a month? 
   And further, is the Senator aware that the President, by executive order, gave the Patients' Bill of Rights to Federal employees, and there has been no increase in the premium? 
   So what I am asking the Senator is, is he aware of this campaign by the HMOs? Has he seen the commercials? Does he believe the HMOs that who have an interest in this, the CEOs of which are getting $30 million a year, really have the interests of patients in their heart?

    Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise to salute my Deputy Chief of Staff, Beatriz (Bea) Rivas Rogalski, on the occasion of her upcoming retirement after 25 years of distinguished service to the people of the United States. As director of casework in my House and Senate offices for more than 16 years, she has helped literally thousands of Californians get the timely assistance they need from their federal government. As Deputy Chief of Staff, she is beloved by staff members and constituents alike. 
   Bea began her public service as I did, in the office of then-Congressman John Burton. In 1974, Bea Rivas was a recent immigrant from El Salvador. While working at Macy's department store in San Francisco, she took a second part-time job to help support her mother. 
   Bea went to work in John Burton's campaign office on a temporary basis as a key-punch operator. Given a six-month project, Bea completed it in two months. Following the election, she went to work as a staff assistant in Congressman Burton's district office, answering phones and tracking bills. Her diligence and demeanor quickly impressed her supervisors, who promoted her to case worker. 
   It was a perfect fit. She quickly learned the most arcane workings of government and did her utmost to help constituents negotiate the shoals of bureaucracy. 
   Bea has what it takes to help people get their due from their government. She is kind, considerate, generous, and above all patient. I cannot overstate how she always listens carefully, always acts diligently, always goes the extra mile to take care of constituents' needs. She is incomparable and irrepressible. She will also be irreplaceable. 
   Mr. President, by serving the people of California so well, Beatriz Rogalski has brought honor on this institution and the United States Government. I hope you will join me in thanking her and sending best wishes to her, her husband Hans Rogalski, and their son Hans, Jr.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise today in opposition to the amendment offered by the Senator from Ohio, Mr. DEWINE, and I want to tell you why. I hope colleagues will listen to this, because this is an amendment that impacts 1.2 million women in America today. It is a law that is aimed directly at them. It will harm them; it will take away their rights. 
   We do a lot of things around here, and some of them don't really affect real people. This affects real people who happen to be women, 1.2 million of them, who are hard-working women, who pay for their own health insurance--part of it. Yet, under the Senator's amendment, he says to those 1.2 million women: You are going to be treated differently from every other working woman in America today just because you happen to work for the Federal Government and just because the Senate has the power to impact you. 
   I think this is a sad day for us again, a very sad day. Every other woman in America who has a health insurance plan can avail herself of all the legal procedures that are known to exist today. They have no problem. Abortion is a legal procedure. Let me repeat that. Abortion is legal in America. That is what this is all about. This isn't a debate about these 1.2 million women, not at all. 
   It is about the underlying question. 
   The Senator from Ohio is a leader in the effort to take away a woman's right to choose. He is open about it. He is honest about it. He is forthright about it. He thinks abortion should not be legal under any circumstance. And his cosponsors today, if you look at their record, are all in favor of a constitutional amendment banning the right to choose. 
   What we are seeing is another way to get to the same end. If you can't repeal Roe, if you can't take away a woman's right to choose, take away her right to be able to pay for the procedure which is legal. 
   Federal employees work hard. They work in every aspect of our lives. Some of them are scientists at the NIH. Some of them work delivering the mail. They work hard. 
   It seems to me unconscionable that we would say, because we have the power to do it, we would say because of raw legal power, Federal employees, women, you are second-class citizens, and you do not have the same rights as someone who works for American Telephone, or any of the companies, small or large, in this country. 
   Why is it that the Senator from Ohio doesn't have that in his amendment? Because he can't get it passed. But he has figured out a way because, yes, the Federal Government, as part of our benefits package, pays part of the health insurance premium. 
   So that is the vote. It is true that this has passed a couple of times. We didn't have a debate on it really the last time. I found it very interesting when we started this because my friends came to me and said: Do we really need to have a vote? Do we really need to talk about this? 
   I want to say something about this. We have a lot of time to talk about Y2K. We have endless days to talk about Y2K, and then we add another hour and a half to talk about Y2K. When it comes to business, we have a lot of time. But when it comes to taking away the rights of women, oh, Senator BOXER. Do you really need to talk about it? Can't we just forget about it? We don't need a vote. We want to go home. I want to go home. But we are about to do again what we have done before, which is to say to these women, you can't be treated like other women. 
   Everyone who gets up on that side to talk about this--I guarantee it--really wants to outlaw abortion, period. 
   That is what this is about--make it tougher, make it harder, any hook that they can find to stop a woman from exercising her legal right given to her by the Supreme Court decision, and, by the way, ratified over and over and over again by that Court--even the current Court. Yes, it is legal for a woman to have control over her own body. Yes, it is legal, they said. It is within her privacy rights. It gives her dignity. It gives her options. It gives her the ability to take care of her own health. 
   This is an insult to women who work for the Federal Government. 
   The Senator from Ohio has no compunction about it--standing up here and looking at the women who work here; his own staff, by the way, who will be treated as second-class citizens, different from all the other women in this country. 
   I now yield 10 minutes to the Senator from Washington.

He said abortion is not a fringe benefit. It is taking the life of an unborn child. Therein lies this debate. That is what he believes. He has said it in his own words. 
   I say to him that a woman's right to choose is legal. It is a legal health benefit for her to have that option. And to take it away from 1.2 million women who happen to be Federal employees and then to stand up here and say no, you wouldn't take it away from women who work for corporations, even though they get billions of dollars in subsidies, is an inconsistent position, in my view. 
   I yield 2 minutes to my friend from Minnesota.

   Mrs. BOXER. I yield myself such time as I might consume. 
   Mr. President, abortion is legal in this country, and I know there are many on the other side particularly who do not like that. But it is legal. It is a health procedure that impacts on the rights of women, and the Supreme Court has said over and over it is legal. 
   This amendment by the Senator from Ohio, supported by the Senator from Pennsylvania and others, picks on women. It picks on a procedure only a woman would need. And it says to that woman: You cannot use your own health insurance to access the health care system for a procedure that you decide you want to have because it is legal in this country. 
   This amendment does not say you cannot use your health care insurance for a vasectomy. It does not target men and say you cannot use your own health insurance for a vasectomy. Some may not like that procedure. It does not say you cannot use your health insurance for Viagra. No, it picks on women, 1.2 million women. 
   My friend from Louisiana pointed out that corporations all over America offer their employees this benefit. We subsidize them every day with tax breaks and sometimes even direct payments, and yet we do not touch them. We are picking on 1.2 million women who work for the Federal Government. It is wrong. These are good women. These are hard-working women. They deserve equal rights. They deserve dignity. 
   I hope some are listening to this debate and will come over and vote no, or if I move to table, will vote aye to table this amendment. 
   I reserve whatever few seconds I may have left.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise in support of the McConnell amendment. I thank the Senator for offering his amendment because, frankly, without it, a number of us will have problems supporting the underlying amendment by Senator BROWNBACK. 
   The Brownback amendment addresses a very important issue of revitalizing trade in that area of the world, and the problem with it is that it gives the President the authority to waive section 907 of the Freedom Support Act. The McConnell amendment strikes that portion from the Brownback amendment and, therefore, makes it a fine amendment. But without the McConnell amendment, I am afraid we are doing some very great harm and damage to human rights and to common decency. 
   Section 907 of the Freedom Support Act was enacted to place restrictions on United States government-to-government assistance to Azerbaijan until that country lifts its blockades of Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh. 
   I have very strong concerns about ending section 907, which is essentially what we are doing, because we know the administration's position on that. Doing that would reward the Azeri Government for taking no steps in lifting their blockade. 
   The blockade they have put on has prevented the transportation of basic human necessities, such as food and medicine, from reaching the suffering people of Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh. I don't believe the United States should stand by and allow the Armenian people to live with a devastated economy, without a real commitment from Azerbaijan that they are taking steps to end the blockade. 
   Let me be clear about section 907 and what it does not do. It is not a sanction. In fact, the United States has normal trade relations with Azerbaijan. Section 907 does not prevent humanitarian aid from reaching Azerbaijan. It doesn't prevent the Overseas Private Investment Corporation, the Export-Import Bank, and the Trade Development Agency from functioning in Azerbaijan. 
   The only thing section 907 requires--and that is why I don't understand why Senator BROWNBACK wants to, in effect, repeal it--is that the Azeri Government ``take demonstrable steps to cease all blockades against Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh.'' That is not a high hurdle to clear. If the Azeri Government cannot even take steps--small  steps--to end this blockade, I believe it has no right to the assistance that will be provided in the underlying Brownback amendment. 
   I understand Mr. BROWNBACK's amendment is well intentioned, and I enjoy working with him on many issues that affect the world. But because it would repeal section 907, I think if he were to accept Senator MCCONNELL's amendment, we would have a good underlying bill. 
   In closing, I wanted to read into the RECORD a brief comment made by Senator PAUL SARBANES in his minority views that he put into the RECORD. I serve on the Foreign Relations Committee, and I know Senator SARBANES believes strongly in this. 
   This is what he said:  
   Under current law, all Azerbaijan must do in order for section 907 to be lifted is to ``take demonstrable steps to cease all blockades against Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh.'' This is an entirely reasonable expectation, especially given the basic purpose of this bill, which is to promote trade and economic cooperation between the countries of the region.  
   He points out:  
   For nearly a decade, the government of Azerbaijan has prevented the transport of food, fuel, medicine, and other vital commodities to Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh, causing immense suffering.  
   So I ask the question of my friend, Senator BROWNBACK--in a rhetorical way, since he is not here--why would he want to do something that would only increase the suffering? Under the McConnell amendment, we cure this problem from his bill. 
   Senator SARBANES says:  
   During winters, much of the Armenian population has had to live without heat, electricity, or water. Schools and hospitals have been unable to function, and most Armenian industries have been forced to close down, crippling the economy and producing widespread unemployment and poverty.  
   We all want to see progress in the world. We want to see trade and jobs created. But we don't want to see more human suffering. I think if we go along with the Brownback amendment, without the McConnell amendment, we will be doing a disservice to the world. 
   I know I have a little time left. I have no further comment, and I yield the rest of my time to Senator MCCONNELL.

   Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Senator from Vermont for his leadership on the juvenile justice bill, all parts of it. I see the Senator from New Jersey has come to engage also in some conversation. 
   I ask the Senator from Vermont, because when you read a book that says how a bill becomes a law, it seems very simple in many ways. It says a bill passes the Senate or the House. Then it goes to the second House. If it started in the House, it goes to the Senate. Then there is a conference where the differences are ironed out. Then the bill goes over to the President. 
   When we passed this bill--and my friend pointed out the overwhelming margin with which it was passed--the country really celebrated because for the first time in a long time we passed some sensible laws.

    Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, last week marked the beginning of the 1999 Women's World Cup, a competition that includes the best soccer teams from throughout the world. Held every four years since 1991, the women's World Cup brings together the finest women athletes and allows them to compete at the highest level. It is so wonderful that young women throughout the world have these role models to look up to--role models such as our very own charismatic Julie Foudy, working mother Joy Fawcett, teenage sensation Tiffany Roberts, and veteran superstar Michelle Akers. 
   The United States team, which is among the favorites to win the tournament, is led by the best women's soccer player of all time: Mia Hamm. Mia Hamm has scored more international goals than any person--man or  woman--in the history of the game. It was perfectly fitting that she scored the first goal of the tournament by half-volleying a Brandi Chastain pass into the roof of the net. 
   It is also fitting that Mia Hamm was born in 1972, the same year that President Nixon signed into law Title IX of the Education Amendments Act. This law ensures that federally funded schools provide equal athletic opportunity for members of both sexes. Twenty-five years later, the U.S. National Team is one clear sign that this law is a success. 
   According to the Women's Sports Foundation, the number of girls who participate in high school sports since the enactment of Title IX has risen from 300 thousand to 2.37 million. Women are now 37 percent of college athletes and were 39 percent of the 1996 United States Olympic Team members. 
   The record-breaking crowds this weekend in San Jose and Pasadena reveal that the enthusiasm for women's soccer is not restricted to players only, but is shared by the public. Over 78,000 loyal fans packed the seats of Giants Stadium to watch the US-Denmark match, and the weekend ticket sales total of over 134,000 surpassed the 112,000 for the entire 1995 Women's World Cup in Sweden. Ticket sales for the Cup to date have passed 500,000 and are rapidly growing--potentially shattering the 600,000 world record for a sporting event held for women. 
   The stellar start for the World Cup speaks volumes for the future of women's soccer. Female soccer players may not have to wait much longer to play professionally in the United States. The successful weekend attests to the wonderful athletic stars and enthusiastic fans ready, willing and eager to support a women's professional soccer league in major markets such as Los Angeles, San Francisco, New York and Chicago. Citizens both domestic and worldwide are watching the Women's World Cup with pride that our teams are pioneering the path to put women's sports on parity with men's. 
   The impact of gender equality in sports goes far beyond the soccer field and ticket sales. Female student athletes are more likely to graduate from college than students who do not participate in sports, women who are active in sports and recreational activities as girls feel greater confidence, self-esteem and pride in their physical and social selves; and 80 percent of women identified as key leaders in Fortune 500 companies participated in sports during their childhood. 
   The Women's World Cup is also an important way to bring together diverse nations of the world. From North Korea to Canada, from Ghana to Sweden, everyone shares in the joys of competition and love of the game. Television viewers throughout the world have been introduced to many countries and its players. During the first week of play, we saw the flamboyant Nigerian goalkeeper Ann Chiejinei confidently lead the ``Super Falcons'' to the second round. The Brazilian one-name wonders of Sissi and Preinha brought to mind visions of Pele and Romario in scoring the first hat tricks of the tournament. And Norway, which has played in the previous two World Cup title games, opened its title defense with three impressive victories. 
   So, Mr. President, I will make two predictions. My first prediction is that the United States will reclaim their title as women's World Cup Champions on July 10, in Pasadena, California. And more importantly, my second prediction is that generations of women and girls for years to come will continue to thrive because of Title IX.

I came down to the floor today to talk about how we have been fighting this for over 2 years. We have increased and we have escalated the debate in the last week, but I asked my staff to go through my earliest talks on this subject.

   Mrs. BOXER. I know we are running short of time so I will be glad to yield to my colleagues for questions. 
   On January 28, 1998, I came to the floor and talked about the case in my State of a gentleman named Harry Christie who had a very poignant story to tell me about his daughter who, when she was 9 years old, was diagnosed with a very malignant and dangerous tumor in her kidney. It was explained to Mr. Christie that there were only a couple of surgeons who knew how to operate on this kind of a tumor, and it would cost $50,000 for the operation. 
   He went to his HMO. He said to them: Look, this is my flesh and blood, my daughter. She means everything to me. I am assuming the HMO will allow me to go out of the plan, get the specialist, and then the HMO will pay the specialist. 
   They said: No, we have good oncologists on our staff. We have good physicians, and they will handle it. 
   He said to them: Did they ever do this kind of pediatric surgery? 
   No, they had never done it in their lives. 
   And Mr. Christie said: This is an impossible situation, and I won't accept this. 
   They said: Then too bad. You will have to pay for it yourself. 
   Well, that is exactly what he did. It was not easy. 
   What about parents who can't do that? What happens to their child? 
   This is just one story. I told it January 28, 1998. By the way, the end of the  story is that Carley is now 15 years old and her cancer is gone. She is a fantastic young woman.

   Mrs. BOXER. Yes. My friend is exactly right. 
   First of all, I think his point about the House putting off any action on the juvenile justice bill that deals with making sure we keep guns out of the hands of children and criminals is an outrage. When they tried to put this bill forward, we pointed out it was really a sham. Now we have the same thing in the Senate. 
   I think the Senator from North Carolina was speaking before and we were talking. He points out that it is not a question anymore of the Republican bill or the Democratic bill. He said that we ought to just say it is about a bill that is supported by patients and doctors versus a bill that is supported by insurance companies. We understand on this side of the aisle that it is supported by patients and doctors.

   Mrs. BOXER. It is exactly what this debate is all about. 
   I want to talk about another case that I brought up about a year or two ago, also a doctor with a similar story in Texas. He came to testify before the Democratic Policy Committee. This was in Texas. This doctor was assigned to work in the emergency room. A gentleman comes in with terribly high blood pressure. They checked him into a room, and they monitored his blood pressure. It could not be controlled by medication. They were giving him a lot of medicine that didn't work. The doctor called the HMO and said: We need to keep this patient overnight. I am very fearful he will have a stroke. 
   Bottom line: The HMO says: You control it by drugs. He says: I can't. 
   He has to now tell the patient that the HMO won't cover this, and he says to his patient: Pay for that out of your own pocket; I will fight for your right to be reimbursed. 
   The patient said: How much will it be? Five thousand dollars. I can't do it, says the man, I am sure the HMO wouldn't hurt me. 
   P.S.--you know the story. The gentleman had a stroke, and he is totally paralyzed on one side. 
   The irony of all ironies about this is that under current law the doctor can be sued but not the HMO that actually made the decision. 
   Isn't there any wonder that doctors are joining with patients? You spend your life trying to save others' lives, and now you can't do it--a doctor in Highland Park, and a doctor in Texas. It goes on. 
   I would be happy to yield to my friend.

We have to pass a Patients' Bill of Rights, because, unless you are so wealthy that you can pick up the tab and the cost for these very expensive procedures, you are just plain out of luck. We have said this a number of times to our friends on the other side of the aisle. We have good health insurance as Members of the Senate. We really do. We are 
   fortunate. We have the clout. We have good health insurance. We are trying to bring everybody up to our standards.

   Mrs. BOXER. I think the Senator has made a very good point. If we believe that each of us should be responsible for our actions and our deeds, the current law certainly undermines that. It is unfathomable to me. As the Senator from Illinois has pointed out in another debate, the only people in our country today who are truly exempted from any kind of accountability--you can't go after them--is a foreign diplomat and an HMO. Something is wrong with that.

   Mrs. BOXER. My friend is right on point. It is another aspect of our Patients' Bill of Rights where you have a truly independent outside review so the people who are looking at the actions of the HMO are not part of the initial decision. On the other side of the aisle, they have an appeals process where essentially the HMO says who the outside reviewers are. That is not really an outside review. 
   I want to say to all of my friends who have been so good on this issue 
   I had such a transforming event 2 years ago at a hearing the Democratic Policy Group had. A woman from an HMO spoke. By the way, she was afraid to show her face. She was on a satellite television hookup with her face covered and her voice was disguised because she was a whistleblower. 
   In the course of her testimony, she said something that made my skin crawl. I wonder if my friends feel the same. We kept asking questions about patients. We said: What happened when a patient came in and had heart symptoms? How was it handled? Who made the decision? 
   In the course of describing the patient, she said: This unit was a case we felt we had to look at. 
   I said: What did you say? 
   She said: This unit. 
   I said: What do you mean, this ``unit"? 
   That is how we refer to clients. 
   I said: You mean patients? 
   She said: Yes, we refer to patients or clients as units. 
   I had this sense there was no humanity left. It is all about ``units.'' It is all about dollars. It is all about the bottom line. It is all about profit. It is not about serving. That is why doctors are saying this is against their Hippocratic oath: Do no harm, help people. 
   Now they are doing harm. They are in situations where they have predicted patients could die if they didn't get the treatment, and the HMO didn't give the treatment. 
   I want to hear from my friends as we go back and forth on this question. 
   I yield to the Senator from North Carolina.

   Mrs. BOXER. I thank my friend from North Carolina for articulating two areas of our Patients' Bill of Rights which are so important: The right to independent review if a patient feels the HMO made a mistake, and the ability to hold HMOs accountable if they do the wrong thing. 
   By the way, the opposition from the other side is misleading because all we do is say if States choose to hold HMOs accountable, they can. We don't dictate the law on the right to sue. It is up to the States. However, we lift the impediment to holding them responsible. 
   I think it is important to note that we in America have the safest products in the world, even though every once in a while there is a horrible example of something monetarily wrong. The reason is, we hold companies accountable if they make an unsafe product that could explode and harm a child. Most of the time we don't have any problem because we have a very clear precedent in law that says if you don't take into account what your product can do to a human being, and they get hurt, you will pay a price. For HMOs, we don't do that. The irony is that they are dealing with life and death decisions every day and they are making wrong decisions. 
   My friend is right on those two aspects of our Patients' 
   Bill of Rights, working together.

   Who is supporting our Patients' Bill of Rights? It is every patient advocacy group, every provider who has an organization, including the nurses and the doctors. And who is on the other side? The insurance companies. 
   What do we have? Two bills. The bill on our side is supported by these advocacy groups and doctors; the other is supported by the insurance companies. 
   My friend is right. People are getting so upset that this place seems dominated by the special interests.

As my friend points out, if you look at the differences, whether it is the appeals process--and my friend last week came to the floor and pointed out that under the Republican proposal it doesn't look as if there is an outside entity looking over the HMO decision but, rather, someone essentially selected by the HMO itself.

   Mrs. BOXER. I find it quite interesting. I ask my friend, do the people who live in farm country need health insurance? Do the people who live in farm country have problems if they need to go to emergency rooms? Do the people in farm country have problems when their child needs a specialist? 
   I wonder whether or not we segment things too much. I think people who live in farm country also need health care. If we could reach agreement so we could offer our amendments and give the people in farm country and in suburbia and in urban America the right to decent health care--my friend from Idaho said: Oh, my God, what you are doing will cost so much. We have a letter from GAO. It is $2 a person a month to get decent health care in this country. 
   I ask my friend, because he is such a stalwart supporter of family farmers, do they not have a problem as well as all the rest of us?

   Mrs. BOXER. So pretty much a partisan vote. 
   We basically had the Republicans--who are out here saying, oh, bring on this bill, our poor family farmers--voting down an emergency package for those very same farmers and fighting us so those farmers and everyone else in America can't get decent health care. 
   Lastly, I wonder if my friend sees a connection, because I am thinking about it. I saw my friend from Idaho come out and, instead of debating us on the bill, scare America by saying: Oh, my God, with this Patients' Bill of Rights, 1 million, 2 million people are going to lose their insurance. It sounds like scare tactics. 
   It reminded me a little bit of the debate we had on the juvenile justice bill, when all we were saying on our side of the aisle was that we wanted to do background checks on criminals and mentally disturbed people before they get a weapon. They said: Oh, my God, they are trying to take everyone's guns away. 
   America knows that is not the case. When you fight for sensible things, you hear scare tactics from the other side. 
   I wonder if my friend notices this kind of desperation deal going on, every time we try to do something, of trying to scare the people of this country.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, it has been two months since the tragic shooting at Columbine High School in Colorado. That incident heightened awareness around the country--and I saw it first hand when I traveled throughout California--of the need to take steps to make our schools safer. 
   It seems to me that being safe in school is a fundamental right. It ought to be a top priority of every school district in America--and I know that a lot of schools are committed to making improvements. But some are having a hard time finding the money to do what needs to be done. I believe it ought to be a top priority of the federal government to help localities do what they need to do to ensure the safety of our children when they are in school. 
   So, today, I am introducing, along with my colleague, Senator DURBIN, the School Safety Fund Act. This bill would allow the Attorney General to provide grants to school districts to undertake a variety of activities to prevent school violence and to make our schools safer. The key is we want local schools to make the decision about what they need to do, but we want the federal government to provide some financial help. 
   Now, what are some of the things that schools want to--and should--do? 
   Schools could establish hotlines and tiplines, so that students could anonymously report potentially dangerous situations. We could put more community police officers in the public schools. Some schools need metal detectors and other security equipment. I think almost all schools could use more counselors, psychologists, and school social workers. Many teachers and administrators need training on the identification of the early warning signs of troubled youth. And, many of our students need conflict resolution programs and mentoring. 
   The point is, each school needs to decide the extent of its problem and what the best solution will be in that community. We are not dictating here. We are saying that we want to--we need to--help our local schools. 
   Let me talk about how these grants will be funded, because I think it is an interesting approach. Rather than set up a specific authorization level--rather than pulling a number out of a hat and saying, this is the need--my bill would give discretion to the Attorney General. The bill says that the Attorney General can make these grants out of the Violent Crime Reduction Trust Fund to meet the need that is out there. 
   For example, if there is a particular crisis in a particular community, the Attorney General has the flexibility to make grants. She does not have to wait for Congress to act--or watch as Congress fails to act. If the problem improves, the Attorney General can spend less or, perhaps someday, no money at all for school safety. Again, the number of grants would be based on an assessment of the needs. 
   Finally, let me say a word about my cosponsor, Senator DURBIN. I am very pleased to have him join me in this effort because several weeks ago, he fought this fight hard. He was a member of the conference committee on the supplemental appropriations bill, and he tried to get additional emergency funding--and it was and still is, in many respects, an emergency--for many of the activities we are talking about in this bill. Some on the other side of the aisle resisted his efforts, and eventually they voted him down. But, with his previous work on the subject, I am so pleased that he has joined me on this bill. 
   Mr. President, it is now mid-June, and many schools are closed for the summer or will close shortly. We must reject the notion that because our children are no longer in school, there is no longer a problem. There is a problem, and unless we begin to find ways to solve it--and unless the federal government helps fund the solutions our local communities come up with--I fear that when the school house doors open again in the Fall, the problem might again hit the front pages of the newspapers.

   Mrs. BOXER. For example, a doctor examined a child and determined that child had a rare form of cancer. I had a constituent with this circumstance. It was a rare form of cancer, say, of the kidney, which happened to be the case, and she needed immediate surgery by a specialist who had done this operation before, because, by the very nature of it, it is a very dangerous operation, and the doctor said this is the only way this child could live. 
   Is my friend saying in that particular situation the bureaucrats and the businessmen in the HMO could essentially say: That is very interesting, but the child will have to go see the cancer doctor who is in our plan, and she may not go and see this specialist who actually could, in fact, save her life because he or she has done this operation before?

She said this century has been the greatest century known to humankind for finding new options for care, new research, gene research. We know more now than we ever knew before, and how ironic it is that at a point in time, going into the next century, when we know more than any other nation in the world, in this country HMOs are 
   denying our people access so they cannot benefit from this research. 
   As the Senator from South Dakota talks about medical necessity, if he can weave that into his comments, I will be very interested in his response.

   Mrs. BOXER. Because the Senator has made a point that is rather stunning to me. In other words, he is saying that in the Republican proposal which purports to be a Patients' Bill of Rights, if a patient believes he or she has not received the appropriate treatment and there is an internal review--and let's pass over that--and then there is an external review; in other words, people are coming in from the outside to take a look at whether or not you should have had a different treatment for your cancer, let's say, the Senator is saying to me that under the Republican proposal, the very organization that denied you a certain kind of treatment gets to pick the people who are going to decide if that HMO was wrong? So if they pick their friends, naturally, what chance does the patient have? I say to my friend, this seems like a kangaroo court if I have ever heard of one. Does he not agree?

    Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the accomplishments of a remarkable public/private partnership in California's Silicon Valley that is moving aggressively to address a problem which plagues many communities: the shortage of available and affordable housing. 
   In Silicon Valley, the fast-growing home to some of the Nation's most dynamic and innovative high technology firms, housing costs have risen as dramatically as the supply of available housing has diminished. Since 1992, Santa Clara County has created some 250,000 new jobs; however, only 50,000 new homes and apartments have been constructed. This combination of rapid growth and scarce housing has created a volatile situation in which renters and potential home buyers alike must compete mercilessly for the few units that are to be found. To address this challenge, a coalition of concerned businesses, nonprofit groups and local governments formed the Santa Clara County Housing Trust Fund. 
   The Santa Clara County Housing Trust Fund is a broad-based working group consisting of the Community Foundation of Silicon Valley, the Silicon Valley Manufacturing Group, the Santa Clara County Collaborative on Housing and Homelessness, the Santa Clara County Board of Supervisors, the Housing Action Coalition and the Housing Leadership Council. Through donations from nonprofit organizations, commitments from local governments and financial backing from the business community, the trust fund hopes to raise $20 million. With this money, the trust fund plans to house more than 1,000 homeless individuals and families, assist in building up to 3,000 new apartments and help nearly 800 first-time home buyers. 
   I pay special tribute to five companies that recently pledged a remarkable $1 million to the trust fund, hopefully paving the way for other Silicon Valley businesses to follow suit. On June 10, Adobe Systems, Applied Materials, Cisco Systems, Kaufman & Broad, and the Solectron Corporation each stepped up to the plate with contributions sure to improve the quality of life in their communities. This is responsible corporate citizenship at its best. I hope that these five companies represent only the first wave of firms that will rise to the challenge of tackling the housing problems in Silicon Valley.

Mr. President, so that people in this country understand, when it comes to the State Department, which deals with other countries, there doesn't seem to be any problem of the leadership with having 50-plus amendments. But when it comes to the reality and everyday life of our people who are not getting the quality health care they deserve, who want to see HMOs held accountable,  who want to be able to go to a specialist, who want to make sure they have the information as to what all the possibilities of treatment are, who want to make sure, if they are, for example, a woman and they go to an OB/GYN and all of those points on there, we can't have that. They would add up to 20, 21 amendments, but we do not have agreement. 
   I think the American people ought to understand what is going on here. I have to say, in my heart of hearts, as my friend points out, every responsible organization that deals with health care supports this Patients' Bill of Rights--the Democrats' version. So one can only conclude it is the special interests on the other side that are blocking this proposal from coming to the floor. I can't come up with any other answer. I wonder if my friend can.

   Mrs. BOXER. Yes, I just heard Senator DASCHLE propose again that we have a late shift. He said many Americans, after they work their day shift, work a late shift. Why don't we do it here in the Senate? Here we are, the Senator from Utah is in the Chair, and he is always ready to work; he is a great worker. We are here ready to work. The people want us to do the business. 
   I will close my question this way. This happened once before on the minimum wage. I hope the Senate remembers the ending of that. When the Senator from Massachusetts decides to take all his energy and put it to an issue, and we come around and we put our energy and spirit behind an issue, what happens is that eventually the issue will be heard. We did it with the minimum wage. It was a horrible situation, trying to get that before the Senate. But I think we know how to do it. As the Senator from Massachusetts said, if this wasn't an important issue, we would fail in our effort. If this was a frivolous matter, we wouldn't win. But it is important every single day to people. 
   I have case after case in California--and I hear them coming from around the country--where you have a little child who is your pride and joy. Suddenly, a terrible disease hits and an HMO says: You don't need a pediatric specialist; take him to our cancer specialist. They ask: Has the cancer specialist ever operated on a child before? The answer is: No, but he is good. They say: No; I want the best for my child. I want somebody who knows what it is to examine a little body. Children are not little adults; they are changing, they are growing, they are different. I, on the other hand, am a little adult, but a child is different and they need to have specialties. 
   Under the bill the Democrats are supporting, that would be a fact. You would have the right to have someone who knows what they are doing. If you want to get a tooth pulled, you don't go to a foot doctor. If you want to treat a child, you go to a pediatric specialist. So this is serious. 
   I am so happy to be part of this little trio tonight.

   Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Senator for his eloquence on this point. 
   When he said we spent 5 days taking care of the computer industry, I come from the Silicon Valley. I love those people. 
   They are good people. They are the best employers. As a matter of fact, I thought it was a bit insulting to them to think that they need to have all of this special help from us. I think they are going to take care of the problem and stand up to the challenge. They are wonderful people. We took care of them with days of debate. We took care of the steel companies. We just did that. Oil companies--just did that. 
   I am sitting here thinking what about all these people who write us every day. 
   I want to ask the Senator a question. Is it not his understanding--because the Senator said this before, and I want the Senator to expound on it--that there are only two groups in America today who cannot be held accountable in a court of law? Could the Senator talk about who those groups are?

   Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Chair. 
   Mr. President, I thank Senator LAUTENBERG for his leadership. What he did in the gun debate is expose that the other side had a sham bill which they said would promote sensible gun laws. He exposed that. He put forward the Lautenberg amendment, which eventually passed, that did something about the safety of our children. 
   He is doing it again today. He is ready to offer a real amendment to help our seniors, and he is not able to do it. 
   Let's face it--the Republicans admit it--Medicare is not included in their lockbox. The Senator from Pennsylvania, Mr. SANTORUM, accuses us of political demagoguery for pointing this out. To me, that is extraordinary. Because we want to offer an amendment to include Medicare in the lockbox, we are practicing political demagoguery. 
   Let's ask the average senior citizen if they need their Medicare. There is a beautiful picture of a beautiful couple next to our friend from Michigan. If they were sitting on this floor, I think he would lean over to her and say: Honey, I didn't know they were leaving out Medicare. 
   Let me tell you why. Because if you leave out Medicare, even if you do save Social Security--and that is not a fact in evidence in this lockbox; there are so many loopholes in it--and all of a sudden seniors have to pay $300 a month more for their Medicare, maybe even more, that will eat up their Social Security. 
   Medicare and Social Security are the twin pillars of the safety net for our retired people. Before Medicare, 50 percent of our seniors had no health insurance. 
   Put Medicare into the lockbox. Give us a chance. Vote down cloture. Let's have a debate that is worthy of this body.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today I am introducing the ``Electric Vehicle Consumer Incentive Tax Act of 1999'' to  provide new incentives and extend previous ones to spark the zero emission vehicle market. This legislation is similar to previous bills that I have introduced in the 104th and 105th Congresses. 
   I am pleased to see that already the market for electric vehicles is emerging. All major domestic automakers and most of foreign automakers have zero emission vehicles in the market. However, we still need to provide tax incentives to help lower the cost of the new technology vehicles. Despite the what appears to be a new understanding from our automakers that they must begin to produce environmentally friendly vehicles, the costs of these new generation of vehicles are still steep for most Americans. 
   The need to decrease automobile pollution is still critical. Since 1970, total U.S. population increased 31 percent and vehicle miles traveled--that's our best measure of vehicle use--increased 127 percent. During that time, emissions for most of the key pollutants have decreased from the introduction of new technologies. But we are still failing to meet air quality standards in many areas. In fact, the emissions of one key pollutant--nitrogen oxides--actually increased 11 percent from 1970 to 1997. Nitrogen oxides, produced largely from automobile fuel combustion, is the building block for smog. About 107 million Americans were residing in counties that did not meet the air quality standards for at least one of the National Ambient Air Quality Standards pollutants in 1997. 
   These emissions still produce profound and troubling impacts on the health of Americans, particularly the young. 
   That is why I believe Congress should help and encourage Americans to purchase or lease zero emission vehicles. Electric vehicles, which produce no pollution from their engines, will not become the preferred automobile for all Americans, but for many it can become the preferred commuter vehicle or city car. Electric vehicles can also help state and local governments, and private fleet operators, meet new and future air quality requirements. 
   Mr. President, I am pleased to say that previous provisions of my clean fuel vehicle legislation have become law. The lowering of the excise tax on liquified natural gas will help spur the market for that fuel for heavy duty vehicles. The repeal of the luxury tax on electric vehicles also helps remove or lessen market barriers. But more needs to be done. That is why I have introduced the ``Electric Vehicle Consumer Incentive Tax Act of 1999.'' U.S. Representative MAC COLLINS of Georgia has introduced the companion bill in the House, H.R. 1108. 
   The bill provides four major incentives. First, it removes the governmental use restrictions for electric vehicles. At present, the Internal Revenue Code prohibits any tax credit taken for property (in this case electric vehicles) used by the United States or any state or local government. Removing this bar will encourage the leasing of electric vehicles for state and local use. By removing restriction on governmental use of electric vehicles, owners of electric vehicle fleets could ``pass on'' any cost savings from tax credits to the government. 
   Second, the bill makes large electric trucks, vans, and buses eligible for the same tax deduction available now for other clean-fuel vehicles under the Energy Policy Act of 1992. Large electric trucks, vans and buses currently are limited to the maximum tax credit of $4,000 under the Code. Other clean-fuel vehicles, however, may receive a $50,000 tax deduction. This section of the bill would remove the unfair distinction between large electric and other large clean-fuel vehicles. Each would qualify for the tax deduction incentive which would serve to promote the greatest use of clean-fuel vehicles. The bill would end the tax credit for large electric vehicles and provide a tax deduction instead. 
   Third, the bill provides a flat $4,000 tax credit on the purchase of an electric vehicle. Under current law, electric vehicles are eligible under the Code for a 10 percent tax credit for the cost of qualified electric vehicles, up to a maximum of $4,000. The bill would modify that section to provide for a flat $4,000 tax credit (rather than 10 percent of the purchase price up to $4,000) in order to maximize the tax incentive. 
   Fourth, the bill extends the sunset period for the tax credit. Current law phases out the electric vehicle tax credit beginning in the year 2002. The Energy Policy Act of 1992 anticipated that electric vehicles would be available commercially in 1992. The first electric vehicles were not available to the public until 1997. All major automakers now have electric vehicles on the market. However, that market is still very small. Therefore, the bill extends the phase out for four years with the credit sunsetting December 31, 2008, instead of December 31, 2004. The phase out provisions are conformed by amending the Code to provide that the credit will be phased out, at a 25 percent annual cumulative rate, for each of the three years preceding termination. 
   I believe these provisions can provide important market incentives for Americans to purchase automobiles that do not contribute to urban smog or other pollution and at a modest cost in reduced Federal taxes. I ask that my colleagues join me in supporting this legislation and making way for a clean fuel future in the 21st Century.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I say thanks to my friends, Senator HOLLINGS and Senator MCCAIN. They worked very hard on moving this piece of legislation through. 
   I really like the premise of this bill. As a matter of fact, when I saw there was a bill introduced, and there were several that gave a 90-day cooling off period where we can fix the Y2K problem, I thought, there is a great idea. But the more I got into it, the more I saw the consumers being trampled on. 
   That is not the way my friend from Oregon sees it. I have the utmost respect for him. We just simply disagree. I say: How do you know who is right? I harken to what Senator EDWARDS said. Every consumer group is against it. They don't like taking on lost causes that they are going to lose. 
   This bill is going to pass overwhelmingly. Why would consumer groups step up to the plate and say it is wrong? Because in their heart they know the bill goes too far. 
   I am just going to give you three examples of what happened to this bill when it came to the floor. I am going to pick out three amendments as examples as to why this bill moved over so far to the anticonsumer. 
   Take one of the amendments of Senator EDWARDS. My friend offered an amendment that simply said that if you sell a computer in the year of 1999, or you sell software, and it is supposed to be Y2K compliant and something happens, you should get the protection of the underlying bill. 
   Why should we protect people who sell a computer to an ordinary person, or a small business, or sell software in the year of 1999, I say to my friend, as late as November of 1999, and then, whoops, it goes wrong, and in the year 2000 you still get the protection of this bill? I don't get it. It goes too far. 
   Then we have the Boxer amendment supported by a number of my friends. 
   What did that say? In the remediation period of that 60 days after you have notified the computer company or the software company that you have a failed product, they have to fix it, if they have a fix. 
   We had 31 votes or something like that. Where are the voices of the consumer in this Senate? It is perplexing to me. We showed at that time the law of the State of Arizona, a law on Y2K protecting their computer people, as well. Guess what. It said in the remediation period, you must offer a fix to the people. 
   If this is supposed to cure the problem, how are we curing it when we vote down the Boxer amendment, which said if there is a fix, fix the computer, fix the problem? 
   Today, we have the Gregg amendment. If I am correct, it is my understanding that the Gregg amendment will be accepted; is that correct?

   Mrs. BOXER. If it is accepted or we know they will pass because they all are passing, what does the Gregg amendment do? Under the Gregg amendment, if your small business makes a certain chemical and has to live by the rules of the Environmental Protection Agency regarding dumping of that chemical, but your computer goes on the fritz--I don't mean that in a derogatory way--your computer breaks down, guess what. Under the Gregg amendment you don't have to live by the environmental laws. Dump that stuff anywhere, because you will get a waiver which says the problem was my computer went down and, therefore, I can't live within the environmental laws. 
   This is amazing. 
   I have given the Senator three examples of how every proconsumer amendment has been voted down and every amendment that flies in the face of good government has moved forward. I am totally shocked and chagrined that we could not even pass the simplest amendments. 
   I see my friend from Vermont is here. I yield the floor.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, before I start to explain the amendment, I wonder if I may engage in a colloquy with the managers of the bill to make sure we are on the same path. 
   As I understand it, after conversing with Senators HOLLINGS and MCCAIN, there has been an agreement that we will have a vote at 2 o'clock on this particular amendment--I want to make sure I am correct on that--and that we will come back at 10 to 2 and each side will have 5 minutes at that time.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. BOXER. We will just start the debate and see how long it takes us. 
   Mr. President, this bill is an important bill to the State of California. I want to put it in a certain perspective. I very much want to vote for a Y2K bill, and that is why I supported the Kerry alternative which I believe is a fair and balanced bill because, after all, what we are trying to do is get the problem fixed. 
   A lot of times I listen to this debate and it gets very lawyerly, and that is fine. I am not an attorney. What I want to do is get the problem fixed. What I want to do is be a voice for the consumer, the person who wakes up in the morning and suddenly cannot operate his or her computer; the small businessperson who relies on this system, and, frankly, a big businessperson as well. I want to make sure what we do here does not exacerbate the problem. I want to make sure what we do here gets the problem fixed. That is what all the Senators are saying is their desire: to get the problem fixed. 
   The reason I support the Kerry bill and think it is preferable to the underlying bill is that I believe it is more balanced. If you are a businessperson and, as Senator HOLLINGS has pointed out, many times you make a decision based on the bottom line--most of the  time--what you will do is weigh the costs and the benefits of taking a certain action. If you have a certain number of protections the Senate has given you, and those protections mean you have a better than even chance in court of turning back a lawsuit, you are apt to say: Maybe I will just gamble and not fix this problem, because I have a cooling off period. 
   Frankly, in the underlying bill, the only thing that has to be done by the manufacturer involved is, he has to write to the person who thinks they may be damaged. That is all they have to do. They do not have to fix the problem. They do not even have to say they are going to fix the problem. They just have to say: Yes, I got your letter and I am looking at the situation. 
   Then you look at the rest of the law, and the bar is set so high that I believe some businesspeople--certainly not all--will say: I am probably better off not fixing the problem. 
   I go back to the original point. If your idea is to fix the problem, we ought to do something that encourages the problem to be fixed. 
   I totally admit, each of us brings a certain set of eyes to the bill. When I look at the underlying bill, I see some problems. Others think it is terrific, that it will lead to a fix of the problem, and therein lies the debate. 
   Every time I listen to this debate, I hear colleagues of mine who support this bill talk about how much they love the high-tech industry, how important the high-tech industry is to this country, how important it is that we do not do anything to 
   reverse an economic recovery. 
   All I can say is, no one can love the high-tech industry more than the Senator from California--I should say the Senators from California--because it is the heart and soul of our State. I do not have to extol Silicon Valley, the genius of the place, the fact that it is now being replicated in other parts of California, in San Diego, for example, in Los Angeles, where they have these high-tech corridors. It is wonderful to see what is happening. 
   The last thing I want to do is hurt that kind of industry and hurt that kind of growth. But there is something a little condescending when my colleagues who support the underlying bill stand up and say: You are going to hurt the industry if you do not support the underlying bill. I think it is demeaning. I think it is demeaning to Silicon Valley. 
   This is a strong industry. This is an ethical industry. These are good, decent people with good business sense and a sense of social justice, if you look at what they are doing in their local communities. To make it sound as if they need special protections and they need to be coddled is something that I do not ascribe to. 
   I think it is a lack of respect. Yes, we have a problem here. Let's try to fix it. But to assume that this industry cannot stand up and fix a problem somehow troubles me. It is not respectful of the industry. It says there are some people who may need to have this special protection, and not fix the problem of the consumers. 
   So when I look at the bill, I say, what really is in this bill that will lead to a fix of the problem? I have to tell you, in my heart of hearts, I really do not see it. I support a cooling off period. I think everybody does--most people do, because we do not know exactly what is going to hit us. Let's have a cooling off period. But something ought to be done in the cooling off period--more than just simply having a letter. 
   If I write a letter to company X and say, ``I woke up this morning; my computer failed me; I'm a small businessperson; I'm in deep trouble; fix it,'' you know what the McCain bill says? I have a right to get a letter back within 30 days telling me what the company is going to do. What does that do for my business? What does that do for me? What does that do to help me get back on line? Nothing. As I read the bill, that is all that is required. 
   So I want to fix the problem. I want to do it fairly. Under this underlying bill, suppose you bought the computer in 1998 or 1999. They could 
   charge you more for the fix than the computer itself. You might just say: I am just getting rid of this computer. I am going to go out and buy a new one. You know what. You might then go to court; you would be so angry. 
   So I don't see what we are doing in this bill that is real. I want to offer something that is real. That is what I do in this amendment. 
   I want to tell you where I got the idea for this amendment, because I want you to know I did not think it up, as much as I wish I did. The consumer groups brought this to me--not the lawyers, not the high-tech people, the consumer groups. They said: We really don't want to have to go to court. We want to fight for a fix. We have this good idea. Guess where it was found, word for word, almost. Congressman COX'S and Congressman DREIER'S original bill on Y2K contains this wonderful idea that, in the cooling off period in the bill, after you write to the company or companies involved, they must write back to you. And if they determine there is a fix available--and it is their determination, nobody else's--they have to fix the problem. 
   What we have said in this amendment is, if the fix is on a system that is between 1990 and 1995, they can charge you the cost of the fix. So the company is out nothing, because we figure it may be a little more complicated than the later models. If it is after 1995, to 1999, then they have to do it for free, because--I have listened to Senator HOLLINGS, and perhaps he can help me out with this point--most of the companies knew about this problem a long time ago. And, more than that, a vast majority of them are fixing the problem. They are doing it for nothing.

   Mrs. BOXER. I want to make a point. It is a very subtle point to make. But by discussing minute after minute these special protections that go beyond the fair protections that I believe are warranted--and, by the way, my friend from Oregon made this a much better bill; I give him tremendous credit for that--but in my view, they still have special protection that, frankly, the greatest business in the world does not really need to have, because they are good people, because they are making the fixes, because their future depends upon how the consumer rates them.

   Mrs. BOXER. Absolutely. I think this argument has not been made before. Something was troubling me, as I listened to the debate, because it seemed to me that the implied sense around here is that somehow this wonderful industry can't stand up to this test. This is an industry that has performed miracles for the people of this country, changing the nature of the way we do business, the way we live, the incredible communications revolution. I think they can meet this challenge. I do not think they need to have, as my friend puts it, this special carve-out, because I think in a way it is insulting to them.

   Mrs. BOXER. Exactly right. Under the underlying bill, if you bought a computer in 1999, and it fails you a few days later, you get nothing in terms of a fix. You get a letter. We hope the letter says we are going to fix it. But you do not have any commitment that it would be for free. You could get charged thousands of dollars. Our friend, Senator HOLLINGS, who has been so articulate in the opening moments of the debate, talked about these doctors where the company said in order for them to get a fix, it costs them more than the original system. Am I right, I say to the Senator?

   Mrs. BOXER. I thank my friends for their comments, because as I listened to them, I become more and more convinced of the importance of this amendment. It levels the playing field between the good actors and the bad ones. 
   Right now, if this bill passes without this amendment, nobody has to do anything. The people who already have taken the move to fix the problem are definitely at a disadvantage. Why? They spent money to do it. They worked hard to do it. Yet, we are protecting those who are sitting back and saying, wow, I can't believe this deal I am getting. 
   They are changing the law. It is only for 3 years, but it is enough time. How many people are going to sit around and wait to get their computers fixed? They will throw them out, and that is hard for a lot of consumers. That is why the Consumers Union is so strongly behind this and Public Citizen is so strongly behind this.

   Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Senator. I can't be more proud of the Silicon Valley. I can't be more proud of the high-tech industry that I see blossoming all throughout my State. I can't be more proud of them. 
   The facts the Senator put into the RECORD make me even more proud, because what he is saying is the vast majority are good actors. The vast majority understand their good practice of fixing the Y2K problem will redound to their benefit as well as to the benefit of consumers. They have a business conscience. They are good corporate actors. They have a social conscience. They understand it. 
   In many ways, when you talk to some of these executives, they are very democratic. 
   And I don't mean in terms of their party affiliation; I mean democratic with a small ``d.'' They want to spread democracy. They want each individual, through the power of the Internet and the power of their computer, to have the information, to have the knowledge. That is what excites them. 
   So they are good people making a wonderful product. They don't want it to fail. Yet, we have a bill here that essentially says to those who haven't moved aggressively on this problem--and by the way, this is taken from the Apple web site, I say to my friend. There is a great quote by Douglas Adams about the year 2000 readiness. His quote is:  
   We may not have gotten everything right, but at least we knew the century was going to end.  
   Good point. They knew the century was going to end. They knew there might be some problems. 
   So to sum up the argument I am making for this important amendment, it is the one amendment that I know of where the attorneys and the Silicon Valley were not even entered into the discussion. It is a hard, straightforward, consumer rights amendment, brought to you by the consumer groups, the people who really care about the individual business and the individual. It was originally found in the Cox-Dreier legislation, which was introduced in 1998. We practically take it word for word. What does it require? It says in that remediation period, after you have notified the company of your problems, if they determine they have a fix to your problem, they have to fix it. It is as simple as that. Who decides if there is a fix? They decide. We are not having anybody come and look over their shoulder. If the company says we have a fix, they fix it. 
   Guess what happens. Everybody is happy. The consumer is happy. They can go back to work on their computers. The company is going to be happy because they are going to have to satisfy the consumer. There will be no lawsuit. Why? We fixed the problem. 
   In some very interesting way, the underlying bill, because it doesn't require any fix at all, even if your computer was bought 3 days before the millennium, encourages companies not to do it. I just hope there will be a unanimous vote for this amendment, and if there isn't, if we don't win this amendment, it says to me the consumer isn't important in this debate. 
   I can't imagine we are being so fair--if it is a really old computer, before 1990, the company could charge anything they want because we admit maybe it is worthless. But if it is between 1990 and 1995, they can charge you the cost. If it costs them $500 to fix the problem, you will pay $500. If it is a newer computer, between 1995 and the year 2000, they ought to do it for free because, as the Apple people said, ``We may not have gotten everything right, but we knew the century was going to end.'' 
   I have to tell you that by 1995, 1996, 1997, 1998, 1999, if people didn't know this was a problem, they had to be sleeping, because everybody knew this was a problem in the 1990s. 
   I am very hopeful to get the support of the Senator from Oregon and to get the support of the Senator from Arizona. I think this will be something that would make this bill more consumer friendly, despite the other problems. 
   I yield the floor at this time.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, first of all, I thank my friend. I know it is hard, when you put so much work into the bill, when there is a disagreement. I just want to say to my friend, in terms of my particular bill, it focuses on that so-called remediation period. That is what I am focusing on, because, in my opinion, there is nothing that requires any action to fix in that period. It requires communication back and forth. That was my only point. 
   This amendment--I am happy my friend is sympathetic to it, and I hope we can work out our differences on it--actually says to the manufacturer--the retailer is not involved in this. I say to my friend, if he reads my amendment, it just says if the manufacturer determines that there is a fix, then they must make the fix. 
   In that 10-year period, we prescribe that if it is a newer part and a newer system, he does it for nothing, because in 1995 he should have known it, and prior to 1995, 1990 to 1995, we say at cost. 
   Again, I want to make sure my friend knows, we do not change one piece of the underlying bill in terms of the rest of the bill. The rest of the bill stands. We don't add any other court suits. We don't change any damages. All we say is fix it if you can. And if you cannot, the underlying bill will apply. That is really all we are doing. 
   I think this sends a clear message to those manufacturers that have been lax to follow the lead of the good manufacturers that have been wonderful. And those are the ones I know and love from my State who have said we are going to make the consumer whole, we are going to make the consumer happy. 
   I want my friend to know that we add no new cause of action--nothing. In the underlying bill, we just say remediation, period, instead of just saying it is a time for people to write bureaucratic lawyers a letter to each other, which is better than nothing. It is a cooling-off period. We say if you have a fix, make it work, because under the underlying bill there is no such requirement. You could charge people more than they even pay for the machine, et cetera, even if they got the machine 3 days before the millennium. 
   I am happy to work with my friend. If she wants to put a quorum call in, perhaps, and sit down together to see if we can come up with something, Senator MCCAIN said to me through staff that he thought we could do this as a policy. 
   Frankly, we are writing legislation, and I think it is deserving of being included. But I would be delighted to work with my friend.

   Mrs. BOXER. I want to engage with my friend. I thank him for his usual willingness. 
   I want to make a point that I want my friend to understand. This is a very business-friendly amendment, because this amendment says the manufacturer has to determine if a fix is available. 
   In all the issues my friend raises--well, there is a part over here from that company, and a part over there--the question is, it has nothing to do with liability; it has to do with a fix available for the consumer. If the manufacturer determines there is no fix, because there is little product in inside, and a company is out of business and they can't replace the part, the manufacturer simply says there is no fix available, and then the rest of the bill applies. 
   Again, I say to my friend, as he said, as he described the fact, of course, the bad actors will be called into court later. We want to avoid that--both my friend and I. 
   I believe we have so many good actors out there, and my friend cited one of the companies that has really taken care of this problem. I think that is what the Senator from Oregon was talking to me about before when he said you know some of these companies are doing this. Absolutely, they are. We ought to make that the model. We ought to say that is wonderful, you take care of it, and everybody is happy, and there is no lawsuit. 
   I am hopeful, because I don't see this as complicated. We worked very hard to make it simple. We didn't want to tell the manufacturer, ``You can make the fix,'' if in fact they can't. If they in good faith say, ``There is a part inside this mother board, and we can't fix it,'' then they simply say, ``I am sorry, there is no fix available in this circumstance,'' and then the underlying bill applies. 
   But we think the leadership by the really good people in this high-tech community ought to be followed. We believe if we don't put this amendment in the bill that those who already have acted in such good faith, in such good business behavior, and such good corporate responsibility to fix the problem and are seriously at a disadvantage, because they scratch their head and say, ``You know, I should have waited, maybe I didn't have to do all of this, and people would have decided it is too much of a hassle, I will just throw out my computer and get a new one,'' I can tell my friend, I bet a lot of people will wind up doing that. That would be unfortunate, if a fix is available. 
   Whenever the Senator wishes to put in a quorum call, actually our friend from Delaware has been waiting to speak on another very important topic.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Washington for not moving to table at this time so I have an opportunity to respond to his comments. 
   I want the Senate to understand those who are supporting this bill came back to this Senator with a suggestion on how I could change the amendment so it would be agreeable to them. We agreed with their changes. We said fine, we are willing to back off a little bit. 
   Guess what happened? My colleagues on the other side of the aisle still would not accept it. 
   It is not the Senator from California who was unwilling to make the amendment more workable to the other side. It was the other side who recommended a change. When we said OK, they decided it was still unacceptable. 
   I don't quite understand it. Now there is going to be a motion to table this amendment. 
   I see the Senator from Illinois is on the floor. I wanted to make sure he understood we were negotiating to try to reach an agreement. We were offered some changes. Even though we did not think they were perfect, we accepted them. The other side, however, continues to resist. 
   I don't know whom they checked with, but it was not the consumers, because this is the only proconsumer amendment that I thought had a chance to make it into this bill.

   Mrs. BOXER. The Senator is exactly right. 
   The proposal I had in the form of this amendment was taken almost verbatim from a bill that was offered by two Republican House Members, CHRIS COX and DAVID DREIER, very good friends of the business community. The concept for my amendment was essentially taken from that bill.

   Mrs. BOXER. I thank my friend. 
   I think the amendment pending--which, unfortunately, the other side is going to move to table--is a proconsumer, probusiness, pro-ordinary person amendment. It is a commonsense amendment. 
   It simply says to the manufacturer, if you have a fix available and you determine you do, then fix the problem. We are only talking about computers that were made in the last 10 years. We are exempting all the rest. 
   We are not adding an undue burden. There are a lot of good people out there who are making the fixes. We are saying to the rest of business, emulate that, fix the problem, and there will be no lawsuits, no waiting at the courthouse door; you will be able to get your computer back in operation, you will be able to keep your business going and growing. 
   For some reason, the other side cannot see their way clear to accepting this.

   Mrs. BOXER. As it relates to lawsuits, it has the same exact provisions. All we say is, if a manufacturer has a fix available, do the fix. Be a good actor. Be good corporate citizens. Do what most of the fine companies are doing up and down the State of California and throughout the country. They knew this problem was coming, and the good ones have done something about it. This amendment, frankly, was brought to me by the consumer groups. They said: You know, no one is really talking about fixing the problem. They are all talking about legalisms here. It made so much sense to me. 
   It was brought to me by the consumer groups, taken straight out of the Chris Cox-David Dreier original Y2K legislation. But we cannot even get ourselves here to support this very simple matter. 
   As a matter of fact, Cox-Dreier went even further than my amendment. Let me tell you what they said. They said, if you do not do the fix and you had the fix, you do not get the protections of the underlying bill. Imagine. DAVID DREIER and CHRIS COX. And when I looked at that, I said, that is a little tough on my computer people; I am not going to go that far. All we say is, if you have a fix and you do not do it, then if you do sue, the judge has to consider all these facts when he or she determines the damages to be awarded, if any. 
   So here we have a proconsumer amendment. My friends on the other side come back with some changes to it. I say: Fine, I am willing to do it. And they say: Oh, never mind, never mind. 
   If we vote down this amendment, I say to my friends, there is nothing in this bill, that I see, that does anything for consumers. There is nothing in this bill that helps them. There is nothing in this bill that helps, by the way, the good corporate actors out there who are already doing the right thing. All this is about is protecting the bad actors, the bad folks who are not doing the right thing, who, if they are listening to this debate and if they are smart--and believe me, they are smart--what are they hearing? Hey, if you are really fixing matters now, cool it. Why do it? Why spend any money? Under this underlying bill, you do not have to do a thing. 
   I am just a normal person here, not a lawyer, OK? Maybe that is part of my problem. They call it a remediation period: 30-day notice. You notify the manufacturer that you have a problem. They have to write back. Good, that is  the McCain bill. They have to write back. 
   Then you have a 60-day remediation period, but nothing is required of you. What are you remediating? We say, if there is a remediation period, let's make that terminology mean something: Remediate. It is a 60-day period. We ought to fix the problem. 
   The Boxer amendment, supported by Senators DURBIN and HOLLINGS and TORRICELLI and others, simply says let's make the remediation period true to its name.

   Mrs. BOXER. I thank my friend. 
   As we pointed out earlier in this debate, when I hear people get up and talk about the high-tech industry and how great the high-tech industry is, I know it firsthand because I come from Silicon Valley country. I meet these people. I am in awe of them. And they are good. They are good at what they do. The vast majority of them are taking care of this problem. They ought to be encouraged to continue taking care of this problem. We should not reward those who are not taking care of the problem, who are riding along as if they did not know. 
   I just love that quote from the Apple people. I do not have it here in front of me, but it is something like: 
   We may not know a lot of things, but we knew the century was ending. 
   At some point people said, ``Whoops, there is going to be a problem.'' I guarantee it was well before 1990. But I think we are being very careful in this amendment not to place an undue burden on these people. We are saying you can recover your costs from 1990 to 1995; prior to that, you can charge anything you want. We really are being fair in this amendment. 
   I am stunned we did not get this amendment accepted. I cannot tell you the feeling I have. I am amazed, because when I think about the beginnings of this bill--I remember being excited I was going to be the Chair on the Y2K problem, because I was in line to take that. I asked Senator DODD if he could do it, because it was a tough time for me; I had an election, and I had my regular job. I knew I could not do it justice. I knew this was going to be a problem, and I wanted to make sure we could help consumers fix the problem and we could do it in a way that was fair to business. 
   The 90-day cooling off period is a good idea, in my opinion. That is why I supported the Kerry bill, and I hope eventually that will be the bill that will become law. But the 90-day cooling off period does not mean you sit there with a fan. That is not my idea of a 90-day cooling off period. 
   A 90-day cooling off period should be a time for everyone to sit back, see what the problem is, fix it, and remediate the problem. 
   I have to ask my friend, Senator HOLLINGS, who knows this bill like the back of his hand far better than I do, I keep reading to see what the requirement is in this cooling off period for the businesses. All I come up with, and please correct me if I am mistaken, is that once a company is notified that a consumer has a problem, under this bill, to get the protections of this bill, all that company has to do is write back to the consumer and say: Yes, I got your letter; I am looking at the problem; I don't know what I am going to do, but I will stay in touch with you. 
   That is my understanding of what you have to do to meet the requirements to be protected by this, essentially, rewrite of the laws of our land. I want to know if I am correct or incorrect.

   Mrs. BOXER. Basically, what we are saying is the amendment is: Remediate and you will not need to litigate. That is basically this amendment. Remediate and you will not have to litigate. Just fix the problem, and let's get on with our lives. 
   I want to ask my friend another question. Let's say in this year, today, I am a small businessperson. I run a small travel agency, say, out of my home. I am very computer dependent. I go to a store. I buy a computer. They say it is Y2K compliant; it is not going to be a problem. I have it just a few months, say, 6 months. I wake up on that day and it is down, and it is down the next day, and it is down the next day. 
   I want to talk about what happens under the McCain bill. What do I do? As I understand it, I write to the company, and I say: I am stunned. I bought it 6 months ago. I spent $15,000 for it, and it isn't working.  
   Under this bill, as I understand it, if they do not accept this Boxer amendment, which clearly they are not, and if it is not adopted, which it probably will not be, as I understand it, all the 
   company has to do is write back and say: We got your notification; we will stay in touch with you.

   I view it as an insult to the good people in the Silicon Valley, to the good people in San Diego, to the good people in Los Angeles who work at this night and day, who knew the century was going to end and took steps to prepare for this day, who are making fixes. 
   Now what happens? The people who were irresponsible are getting a loud message from this Senate, particularly when they vote down this Boxer amendment: Oh, boy, we did the right thing by 
   not fixing anybody's computer. We did the right thing just to sit back and see what happens. We have been protected by the most deliberative body in the world; they protected us from not doing the right thing. 
   I just do not get it around here. Sometimes I wonder for whom we are here. I do not get it, because to not have this amendment accepted, the only people you are helping are the people who do not want to make the fix. It is outrageous to me. This amendment is probusiness, it is pro the good businesspeople, the good corporate citizens. I just do not get it. It would reward those who have not done the fixes. 
   I have run out of arguments. I have a hunch that minds are made up. I don't know how I get that feeling. But I have a feeling that minds are made up on this, that this is going to be tabled. We will have a bill, then, that has not one thing in it for the consumers of this country. I have news for the people who are not going to vote for this: Every single American is a consumer, bottom line. I hope they rethink their position. I was willing to compromise and get a good amendment through, but, unfortunately, the other side could not agree to that. Let's get on with the vote. I yield the floor.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I thank my friend for yielding. I thank his staff for doing just a tremendous job of ferreting out all these various laws. 
   I have something to tell the Senate that I hope will sway them in favor of the Boxer amendment. In the research that was done by Senator HOLLINGS' staff, we find out that the law in 
   Arizona, which was signed on April 26, Senate bill 1294, includes in it stronger language than the Boxer amendment. I repeat: The Senator from Arizona, whose bill we are debating, cannot agree to the Boxer amendment which simply says if you have a way to fix the problem for the consumer, be they individual or business, then do it. He can't accept that. But in his own State, the law says if you want to take advantage of a particular new set of laws that they have passed to protect these businesses, here is what you have to do. You have to unconditionally offer at no additional cost to the buyer either a repair or remedial measures. If you do not do that, you cannot take advantage of these new laws that will protect business. 
   Let me put that in a more direct fashion. In the State of Arizona, the State of Senator MCCAIN, who has the underlying bill, a company cannot take advantage of the new Y2K laws, which will help them, unless they have offered to fix the problem. They have to prove that they unconditionally offered at no additional cost to the buyer a repair or other remedial measures. 
   I want to engage my friend from South Carolina in a little discussion here, ask him a question. Does it not astound the Senator that we have an amendment before us that will not be accepted by the Senator whose own State has a tougher provision than the Boxer provision, that we can't go even halfway toward the State of Arizona law which says in order to take advantage of the new legal system you have to unconditionally offer to fix the problem? 
   I ask my friend, who is very knowledgeable in this, if this doesn't strike him as being very strange?

   Mrs. BOXER. Well, I remember that the Democrats were being criticized and they were saying: You are not letting us get this Y2K bill up for a vote, because we wanted to do--I remember this very clearly--some sensible gun amendment. We were told we were holding up Y2K. We said: We can get those things done. And, thanks to the majority leader, we moved to the juvenile justice bill, and with bipartisan help we got some good, sensible gun amendments through, and we went right to Y2K. 
   I want to say to my friend, the ranking member on the committee, who has some real problems with the bill--more problems than this Senator has--didn't object to proceeding to the bill. He said: OK, we will proceed. He asked me to please make my case. I said: I will settle for any time agreement. I said I didn't need a vote. I said: Take my amendment. I agreed to the other side's recommendations. Then they said: Oh, we can't do it. 
   I don't understand why they can't take this amendment. I keep coming back to that. Every time I work my way into my best closing argument, because I think there is going to be a vote--I had my best closing argument at 1:55, because I thought we were voting at 2. Then I had to rev up again at 2:30, and I got another good closing argument. Now they say we are going to have a vote at 3:30. I don't see anybody here yet. I hope they come here, because I think it is important. 
   The amendment pending before the Senate is a consumer amendment, because it says fix the problem. It is weaker than the consumer amendment that is included in the Arizona law. This is incredible. In the Arizona law, which is a beautiful law, which passed overwhelmingly, they say--and this is important; it defines the affirmative defenses that will be established if you do certain things. You have to do certain things to help people. If you do these things in good faith, you get a little more protection at the courthouse. What are they?  
   The defendant has to notify the buyer of the product that the product may manifest a Y2K failure. And the notice shall be supplied by the defendant explaining how the buyer may obtain remedial measures, or providing information on how to repair, replace, upgrade, or update the product. The defendant [meaning the company] has to unconditionally offer, at no additional cost to the buyer, to provide the buyer the repair or the remedial measures.  
   All we say in the Boxer amendment is, you don't even have to do it for free--only for free if it is the last 5 years. Prior to that, from 1990 to 1995, at cost; before that, you can charge whatever you can get. The Boxer amendment doesn't even say you have to do this to avail yourself of these new laws. It simply says if you don't do it, the judge--if there is a court case--has to take into consideration the fact of these cases. I cannot believe this wasn't accepted in a heartbeat. It is weaker than the Arizona law. 
   What has become of us here? I don't know. I cannot figure it out. I love high-tech companies, software companies. They are the heart and soul of my State. They are good people. They are good corporate citizens. Most of them--the vast majority--are doing 
   the right thing. They are doing these things already. So whom do we protect in this bill that was so important that we were supposed to rush to it, and now they are not going to vote on it until next week? What happened to all the rhetoric that this is an urgent problem? If we went to the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD, it would be embarrassing for people who were saying, ``Vote next week,'' just a couple of weeks ago, who said, ``This is urgent.'' I heard one of my colleagues on the other side say this is an emergency. I am baffled by it. 
   So I think what I will do is yield the floor, because I don't know what else I can say to convince my colleagues, who I am sure are listening to every word from their offices, that this amendment is the right thing to do for the people we represent, the people who vote for us. 
   I am going to tell my friends in the Senate, if you don't vote for this amendment, the phone calls will start coming in on January 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, saying, ``I thought you took care of Y2K. You had so much fanfare about the bill. What can I do now?'' 
   There will be nothing they can do, because without this Boxer amendment there is no requirement to fix the problem during the remediation period, or ``cooling-off period.'' The only thing required, to repeat myself, is a letter: Oh, yes, I got your letter. I know you have a problem. I will get back to you. That is it. You don't have to do the fix. It doesn't have to be for free. You can do whatever the market will bear, and you get the protections of the bill. 
   It is not right, my friends. It is not right. We can make it better. 
   When I go back home and talk to my friends in Silicon Valley and they say, ``Senator why didn't you support the underlying bill?'' I am going to be honest and say, ``This bill is an insult to you; it is an insult to you. It is assuming you are too weak to do the right thing. It is assuming you are a bad corporate actor.'' 
   I can't do that to the people I represent. They are too good, too important, too successful to have this kind of treatment. That is how I see it. 
   So, again, hope against hope that we will have a change of heart here, and maybe they will take this amendment or try to go back to the offer they gave us a little while ago. Otherwise, I guess we will just have to wait for the motion to table. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mrs. BOXER. Thank you very much. 
   I wanted to explain to my friend what I have done to make this even more palatable to the Senate. We are now saying the fix only has to be made to small businesses and individuals. 
   So we have narrowed the scope of the repair. Now it becomes even easier for the companies to make these repairs. I say to my friend when he talks about this attack on lawyers that I find it very interesting, because I read when Newt Gingrich was in power on the other side of the aisle that they had a poll done. They had a document prepared which everyone was able to see at some point or other. Their pollsters said in order to divert attention from an issue, attack the lawyers. Just take the attention away from what it is about. 
   In other words, if there is a dangerous product--let's say a crib--we had these before where the slats in the cribs are made in such a way that a child could die because they could fit their head through those cracks and choke to death--divert attention from the product, and say look at that greedy lawyer, he made X million dollars. 
   What they do not understand is that all of these kinds of cases--we are not talking about personal injuries, because this bill doesn't involve personal injuries. But I am just making the point here that when a lawyer takes on such a case--I want to ask my friend to talk about this because he knows this for a fact--they don't get paid unless there is a recovery in the suit. They put out maybe sometimes years of work and much expense, and they take a chance because they know the company is powerful and big and strong, and by the way, it has many lawyers. So they go to the people to divert attention from the tragedy that occurred. This is what a lot of politicians do, and they say it is all about the lawyers in Washington. 
   I hope the people of the United States of America know that there is a rule against frivolous lawsuits and that you can't bring a frivolous lawsuit because a judge can throw it out. 
   In addition, what lawyer would bring a frivolous lawsuit knowing that he or she is going to be out of pocket for all of these expenses and know that they only get paid if it was really an important lawsuit? 
   There are many lawyers out there who are not good citizens, who are not good corporate citizens, who do not have social conscience, because it is just like any other profession--just like we are talking about the software industry, or in the computer hardware industry. Most of the people are wonderful, and there are some bad actors. 
   But let us not get to the floor of the Senate and turn these debates into lawyers versus everybody else, because that is not what it is about. It is about making sure that people have their  problems resolved. If we start talking about lawyers, it isn't really relevant to real people who are going to deal with this real problem on January 1; they wake up, go to their computer and try to conduct business, and find themselves in deep trouble. 
   I ask my friend if he would comment.

Then my friend from Washington State gave me the courtesy of announcing he was not going to allow an up-or-down vote on my amendment; he was going to move to table at 3:30. It is 10 to 4.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, if it is against the pay grade of one of the most senior respected Members in the Senate, the ranking member on the committee of jurisdiction, clearly it is way above my pay grade. 
   I get paid to do a job here, and the job is to represent the people of California. 
   Make life better for them, make life easier for them, give them a chance at the American dream, keep their environment beautiful and clean, give them opportunity, fairness. What I am trying to do is take that set of values and apply it to this bill. I do not want them waking up on the morning of January 1, 2000, and finding that their small business just crashed before them and they have no remedy when, in fact, a remedy exists and the manufacturer simply has to make a simple fix. 
   Again, my breath is taken away when I read the law in Arizona--I might say a Republican State--which says that before any manufacturer could take advantage of the easier rules of the law to defend himself or herself against a claim, they have to do certain things affirmatively, including offering to fix at no cost. In other words, what you say in Arizona is: We are happy to help you, Mr. and Mrs. Businessperson, but it has to be after you have affirmatively tried to fix the Y2K problem. 
   In the underlying bill, we require very little of a business before they can get to the ``safe harbor,'' if I might use that term broadly, of this bill. What do they have to do? Write a letter:  
   Dear Friend: I got your letter. I know you have a Y2K problem. I am studying it. I'll get back to you.  
   Then they qualify for the rest of the benefits of this law. Who does it help? It helps the bad actors. Who does it hurt? The consumers. Why are we doing it? God knows. 
   We could have done a good bill on this. The amendment I put before you comes from a House bill that was proposed in 1998 by DAVID DREIER and CHRIS COX. This is not some provision written by a liberal Member of Congress. It was written by two Members with 100 percent business records. Why did they put it in the bill? Because I think when they sat down to write the bill that was the object of the original Y2K proposal--a cooling off period, remediation period, get the fix done, stay out of court. I think, if this amendment is taken, if it is approved, I think that will be a good step forward for consumers. If it is not, there is nothing in this bill, in my opinion, that does one thing to cure the problem. 
   So, it is now 5 minutes to 4. Senator GORTON said he would be back at 3:30 to table the Boxer amendment. I am perplexed at what our plans are here, whether we are just going to not have any more votes today or whether we are just whiling away the time or some Members had to go to some other obligation. I do not know what is happening because I do not have word. All I know is I have been here since 12 o'clock on this amendment. It is a good amendment. I am hoping perhaps no news is good news, I say to my friend. Maybe they are so excited about this amendment they are trying to work it out somehow. 
   I see Senator LIEBERMAN is here to make some remarks. I am happy to yield the floor.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, a funny thing happened before the Memorial Day recess. We finally did something around here. I say ``a funny thing'' because we haven't done that much to write home about. What happened was we had the juvenile justice bill come before this body. It was debated. Amendments were offered. Votes were taken. The Senate passed the bill by a large bipartisan majority. 
   I think that is the way we ought to be doing our business rather than having a bill brought up and having the so-called amendment tree filled to prevent those of us on this side of the aisle from bringing up amendments. I think the way the juvenile justice bill was handled was good. I hope we see more of that openness on the floor of the Senate. 
   When we had the juvenile justice bill before us, we did some good things. One of the good things we did was to pass some commonsense gun laws. 
   Now, after a 2-week break, the House is going to be taking up the juvenile justice bill and looking at these gun laws and deciding on which of them they are going to move forward. From the reports I read in the paper today--I haven't read the House bill yet, although we are going over it now--those gun laws are significantly weakened. 
   I say to my friends in the House, where I proudly served for 10 years, if anything, you should strengthen those laws, not weaken those laws. We had the Lautenberg amendment that passed. As I understand it, it has been weakened over on the House side, opening up new loopholes so that people at gun shows can call themselves exhibitors and not have to pay attention to all the important background checks that should take place before a gun 
   is purchased at a gun show. So we will be watching. 
   As the people were very happy to see us do sensible gun laws, they also are waiting for us to do something else. That has to do with their health care. That has to do with the Patients' Bill of Rights. That has to do with the fact that many HMOs are not treating patients in the right fashion. 
   I know we are taking up the Y2K bill to protect businesses from lawsuits. It is an important bill. I am glad we are taking it up. I have my opinions on it. I will be offering an amendment on it. I hope I can support it. 
   But what about the vast majority of Americans who need us to pass a Patients' Bill of Rights? Somehow this keeps going to the back of the list. More and more Americans need us to look at their problems: Women who can't get access to their OB/GYNs or, if they do, it is very restrictive; people who get taken to an emergency room far away from the closest one and are told that this really wasn't an emergency, because, guess why, they didn't die, so then their HMO doesn't cover the visit; a child needs to see a specialist and can't see one or has a chronic condition and must always see a specialist and go through bureaucratic hoops to see that specialist. 
   I thought we honored our children. That is not the way to treat a sick child. We should be making the lives of our children easier, not harder, especially when they are very sick. 
   Worst of all, HMOs cannot be held accountable in court. You cannot sue your HMO, even if the HMO made a medical decision that resulted in a patient's death or put someone in a coma permanently.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, the practices of too many HMOs are outrageous. It is equally outrageous that we haven't had a chance to bring that bill to the floor for debate. We on this side of the aisle spent all last year pleading to bring it up, but we were met with delay and obstruction, just as we did on the minimum wage. 
   We fought hard to finally get a minimum wage bill brought up a couple of Congresses ago. 
   We are going to fight hard again to get a new minimum wage bill brought up, to get a Patients' Bill of Rights brought up. We are not going to stop until it happens. We want to make this Senate relevant to the lives of our people, just as we did when we took up the juvenile justice bill. I look forward to working with Members on both sides of the aisle on a Patients' Bill of Rights, raising the minimum wage, and other issues we need to take up. 
   I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am very honored to rise today with my good friend, Senator HATCH, to submit a resolution designating June 22 as National Pediatric AIDS Awareness Day. 
   I am proud that we have the cosponsorship of 52 of our colleagues, which demonstrates a broad interest in the issue of children and AIDS. 
   Incredibly, AIDS is the seventh leading cause of death for children in the United States. We have lost 2.7 million precious children to this epidemic--a staggering and sobering statistic. 
   Our resolution recognizes and commemorates the children, families, and countless others in the health and education communities who have dedicated their substantial time and efforts to prevention and eradication of AIDS. 
   It also recognizes the 10th anniversary of the Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation, an outstanding charitable organization which has devoted years of effort to the education, research, and prevention of HIV transmission and disease. 
   I hope the Senate will act quickly on this resolution to recognize the devastating effects of this terrible disease on millions of American children and their families, and to honor the contributions of thousands of others who are working to end the epidemic.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. BOXER. Thank you, Mr. President. I will look at this because I have not asked for the yeas and nays at this time. We may well delete that particular part of the amendment. As a 
   matter of fact, we will probably take care of that problem. 
   Mr. President, this amendment is a very important amendment. We basically say that the provision in the bill for leasing six luxury executive jets for military generals will be essentially deleted. These are the same kinds of executive jets that are used by, frankly, billionaires, CEOs of the biggest multinational corporations. I think providing additional executive jets to the military's fleet of over 100 Gulfstream, Lear, and Cessna jets sends the wrong signal to our young men and women in the military and reflects misguided spending priorities by this Congress. 
   I want to tell you--and I know the Senator from Iowa would agree--it wasn't easy to find this gold-plated pork. To say it was buried in this bill is an understatement. It was like finding a needle in a haystack. It is so disguised, there is no direct mention of the Gulfstream aircraft anywhere in the bill. They are being leased for the first time, I think, because it disguises the cost, which is enormous--when I get into it, I will tell you. It is about $39 million for one of these executive jets, compared to the executive jet that is in the fleet now that costs $5.4 million, which is very fancy, and that one is the Cessna Citation Ultra. This one is the Gulfstream; this is the gold-plated version. 
   The New York Times points out that leasing these jets costs taxpayers about $145 million more than buying these jets. But I have to tell you, if you lease them, it is hard to find them in the bill. 
   In order to find out what is going to be leased, we had to call the Air Force and get a fact sheet that clearly says the jets will be leased, and they will be top-of-the-line Gulfstream V jets. Again, nowhere in this bill do you see Gulfstream V or a description of these jets. If you read page 142--that is where the authority comes from--this is what it says. This is literally the last page of this bill, page 142:  
   Aircraft leasing. Inserts a provision to provide the Air Force the necessary authority to negotiate leases for support aircraft.  
   That is it. Support aircraft. No one would know that these were the Gulfstream jets that were stripped out of the emergency supplemental bill. You could not tell. But the Air Force told us right upfront and very honestly. They sent us over a fact sheet and we found out that is what these were about. 
   Many of us here in the Senate--myself included--have said we are willing to provide additional funds for the Defense Department to improve recruitment and retention to fix shortfalls in training and spare parts and address quality of life issues, including family housing and health care for our military personnel. I think the Senate has done a commendable job in addressing many of these shortfalls: A 4.8-percent pay increase, improving the retirement system, increasing retention benefits. 
   I strongly supported each and every one of those initiatives. However, we have more to do. It is shocking to some people to know that we have military people on food stamps. The Senator from Iowa led the fight in the authorization bill to point out that our personnel overseas needed to be part of the WIC Program--the Women, Infants and Children Program--to give their children cheese and milk to survive. So how do we now come up with almost, I might say, $ 1/2 million over the 10-year period to lease the fanciest executive jets that you can find? Until we are totally convinced--and from my point of view not even then--should we even consider this kind of an expenditure? 
   What is it for? So four-star generals can travel throughout the world in the greatest of comfort. I love to fly in comfort. I fly across the country almost every week. It is hard. I fly commercial and sometimes I sit in coach and sometimes I use my upgrades and sit in business class. It is wearing and hard, but it is fine. You don't need to spend $39 million on a plane, or lease it at even a higher cost to do the business the military requires you to do. It is really a question of priorities. We have done a lot for our enlisted personnel, but still we need to do more. Yet, we are doing this in this bill. I am very hopeful that the chairman--if we remove that one part from our amendment--will be able to join us in support of this amendment. 
   There may be some objection. But I hope we can agree to drop this. 
   Our military personnel often live in family housing that needs replacement or repair. This is a priority. 
   I was looking at the amendment offered by the Senate from Arizona. I almost supported it until the chairman explained to me exactly what was happening. Sometimes Members understand these things. We look in our own areas. We see the deficiencies. I think that if Members want to put something in to improve the quality of life of the people they represent in the military, it is appropriate. But I don't think this is appropriate. 
   Let me quote from the May 24 issue of Defense Week. This is talking about the emergency supplemental.  
   The New York Times has exposed the bills' buried aircraft language ..... this raised lawmakers' concerns that appropriators would appear even softer on pork than they already seemed.   
   If the committee thought this was pork and did not belong in this emergency appropriations bill, then I say it is still pork now. It is just in another vehicle. But pork is pork. 
   What is especially troubling is that this leasing authority could cost more than buying the six aircraft outright. Again, the New York times says that leasing the jets costs $476 million --that is almost $.5 billion over 10 years--while buying them would cost $333 million. I do my subtraction. That is a $143 million difference. 
   Here is how the Gulfstream company described these particular jets. This is the company that would get the sale of these jets:  
   The Gulfstream V includes an evolution in cabin design that minimizes the inherent strain of long-range travel. From the 100-percent fresh air control system, to the comfortably maintained 6,000-foot cabin altitude at 51,000 feet, to cabin size--the longest in the industry--the Gulfstream V provides an interior environment unmatched in transoceanic business travel.  
   Make no mistake, this is the top of the line in executive jets--$37 million per plane. For $30 million less per plane--for example, a Cessna Citation Ultra at $5.4 million--we could save a tremendous amount of money. 
   My amendment replaces this authority to lease executive jets with the request that the DOD provide some basic information about these aircraft. I will be happy to work with the chairman if he wants me to change some of that language. But we basically called for, in essence, a study to tell us why we would need these planes and what other planes could do the job that these planes do. 
   By the way, in Defense Week, they called this the ``Go to Meetings Plane.'' These planes are used to go to meetings. It is described that way in Defense Week. 
   We want to ask these questions: 
   How many of the missions require a top-of-the-line executive jet? 
   What wartime requirements make the number of jets needed so high? 
   We will be glad to drop that, if the chairman doesn't like that language, but a GAO study looked at the gulf war and found very few were used in that theater. 
   What is the cost comparison if we lease less expensive 
   jets? 
   Are there existing aircraft in the fleet that can meet these mission requirements or that can be modified to meet these requirements? 
   On another level, and without having to bring it to the Senate, I am going to personally send GAO a letter to look at this as well. 
   I think we need to step back and reexamine our priorities. The 106th Congress is increasing defense at a fast rate. There are many people who make the case as to why that should be so. But I think since we are increasing the defense budget while we are decreasing the domestic budget, it really falls on us to make sure that what we spend is necessary. 
   I don't have to tell Chairman STEVENS, because he has to deal with the aggravation of these nondefense discretionary program cuts overall of $21 billion. I serve on the Budget Committee. I know how hard it is going to be when you get to the civilian side of the budget. Right now, a 9-percent decrease in domestic spending is going to be facing the appropriators. What does that 9-percent cut mean? It means devastating cuts in many programs. The Labor-HHS bill is cut 13 percent. This could hurt programs. We don't know where they are going to cut. But it could hurt programs like Head Start; the Centers for Disease Control; Job Corps; summer jobs, which helps keeps kids out of trouble in the summer months; and dislocated worker assistance. 
   The point is that we are cutting in other areas. We shouldn't be expending this kind of money--$.5 billion--over 10 years, on these jets. 
   The transportation bill already reported cripples the Federal Aviation Administration's program to increase safety and capacity. The bill cuts the modernization program by $273 million from the President's request, meaning that automation in radar systems will be delayed, at best, and perhaps will never happen at our civilian airports. 
   In addition, the Transportation Subcommittee rescinded $300 million from prior year funding for FAA modernization. 
   What am I saying? 
   On the civilian side, we are seeing America fail. We are not going to be providing the highest level of safety for our airports. But what do we do? We spend this kind of money. 
   I see my friend from Iowa is on his feet. I am going to finish in 60 seconds. 
   What do our veterans tell us? Our veterans tell us that they need more national cemeteries. The VA-HUD bill is cut by 15 percent. 
   I will tell you right now, I think it would be a wise thing if we cut these leased aircraft out and looked at these needs on the civilian side of Federal aviation and if we looked at the need to build new veterans cemeteries. It is actually reaching a crisis point. We note the D-Day invasion. We commemorate that anniversary. Yet, we don't do all we should in that area. 
   I think we should get real with this budget. I commend my colleagues on the committee. I am very fond of them. They do a good job. But I think this is one area where we could really save some large dollars, and I think we can do better things with those dollars. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mrs. BOXER. It is my understanding that the Cessna Citation Ultra costs $5.4 million a copy, according to the Appropriations Committee, and that the cost on the Gulfstream V is about $39 million. 
   This is transportation for the highest level of military officers. My friend pointed out that we have a gap growing here between those at the bottom of the economic ladder in the military and those at the top. We know that will always be the case, but it seems to me it is exacerbated with this kind of situation. 
   I want to ask my friend if he believes that a top general could fly comfortably in a $5.4 million plane as opposed to a $39 million plane? 
   What we are doing is simply asking for a study to see if we can accommodate the needs of the generals in a cheaper way.

   Mrs. BOXER. I ask a question of my friend, since that is the rule and that is being strictly enforced today, and I appreciate that. Does the Senator not agree that adding six more of these luxury planes, which would give us a total of nine Gulfstream Vs--we would have nine Gulfstream Vs; that is, one for each of the commanders, plus an inventory of other planes that include Learjets and Cessnas--does he not believe that this is going overboard in terms of the priorities we should have? 
   I agree with my friend, and I ask him this question as well: We are saying that we are very willing to give the generals what they need, but it is a matter of whether you get the gold-plated version or a very solid version, and isn't that what we are really talking about?

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, if we go through this list, you will see all of them: The C-20 series, the C-12 series, the C-21 series, the C-22B series, and it goes on and on with over 300 planes. 
   I thank Senator HARKIN's staff for their work in putting that together. 
   I want to make a point. We have an argument on the floor of the Senate. It is a very fair argument. One side says it is cheaper to lease these Gulfstreams, and others say that it may well be cheaper to buy them--forgetting about the fact that some of us think we don't need them at all. This is almost $ 1/2 billion over 10 years at a time when we are cutting virtually everything else but the military right now. 
   Let's face it. The FAA is almost being crippled with $300 million in rescinded funds to make our civilian skies safer. This is serious. This isn't a small piece of change. 
   If, as my friend says, the study comes back and shows we save money by buying these things, we will take a look at that. 
   I agree with the Senator from Alaska. I think there are times when of course--I know the Senator from Iowa agrees--we want to have certain planes set aside for the convenience and use of our top brass. That is not the question here. There are 300 planes in the military that they can use now. In this very bill, we are purchasing more of the Cessna Citation Ultras, which are beautiful planes that the Senator from Iowa has spoken about, to carry them around in luxury. Yes. They may have to stop to refuel, but they can keep in contact with the President of the United States. I have traveled with very impressive delegations where we have had to stop in the middle of very tenuous circumstances.

   Mrs. BOXER. I reclaim my time. I have a brief amount of time left. 
   This isn't about hurting anyone in the military. My goodness. No one could respect the military more than the Senator from Iowa. I have to say that is not what this amendment is about. This amendment is about a very hard-nosed money question. Can we move these generals around in style but not in the Gulfstream version? Can we look to see what the best way to go is--leasing or purchasing? Then maybe we can save some money that we need desperately. 
   Our veterans need veterans cemeteries. They are being told that they have to have a 15-percent cut in the VA allocation. This includes VA hospitals. We could go on. We have military people. You want to talk about the military who have to go on food stamps or the WIC Program. The Senator from Iowa has led that charge. Maybe that is why we feel so strongly about this, that it is a matter of priorities. Respect for the generals? Absolutely. Respect for the enlisted people? Absolutely. Let's do the right thing. 
   All we are saying is a year's pause, have a good study done, come back together, see what the study shows, and then make the decision that is based more on fact than fiction. 
   Yes. The New York Times did a study. They said it is costing about $140 million more to go the leasing route. Let's see if they are right. 
   I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am pleased to see language in the Department of Defense Appropriations report which recommends $300 million for medical research and development efforts to be used for life-saving medical projects, including breast cancer and prostate cancer research. 
   Of the $300 million, the Committee recommends that $50 million is to be made available for peer reviewed medical research grants and activities. Further, the Committee directs that the Secretary of Defense, in conjunction with the service of the Surgeons General, establish a process to select medical research projects of clear scientific merit and direct relevance to military health. One of the projects listed as having scientific merit and direct relevance to military health is that of alcohol abuse and prevention research. 
   I believe that alcohol abuse and prevention efforts must be supported by Congress. We have all been witness to broken families, broken lives and lost opportunities attributed to alcoholism. To that end, I would like to share with my colleagues the promising research being conducted to combat alcoholism at the Gallo Center in San Francisco, California. 
   The mission of the Gallo Center is to identify genes that control brain responses to alcohol and other addicting agents and then develop new drugs to treat addiction. It is the only alcoholism research program in the country that is based with a department of neurology. The Gallo Center is fully equipped for research in cellular, molecular, and behavioral neuroscience and also invertebrate and human genetics. 
   I join my colleague, Senator FEINSTEIN, in her request for $11 million from the Medical Research activities budget in the Department of Defense Appropriations bill to support alcoholism research at the Gallo Center located at the University of California, San Francisco Medical School. I believe that the important work conducted at the Gallo Center qualifies under the medical research project directive as recommended by the Committee, and that it should be funded from the $50 million already made available for peer reviewed medical research grants and activities. 
   The Department of Defense Health Program has appropriately identified alcoholism research as a priority area. I believe that providing $11 million from the Medical Research activities budget in the Department of Defense Appropriations bill for the Gallo Research Center at the University of California, San Francisco would prove to be a worthwhile investment in our efforts to learn more about alcoholism, it causes, and what we can do to fight it.

    Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, last week during consideration of the juvenile justice bill, the Senate passed some reasonable, common-sense proposals to control the proliferation of guns in this country. I believe the Senate's action was an important first step. But there is more to be done. And, today, I am introducing legislation to prohibit the sale and transfer of any gun to a juvenile, unless it comes from a parent, grandparent, or legal guardian. 
   Let me start, Mr. President, with a review of current law. A federally licensed firearms dealer--that is, someone who runs a gun store--cannot sell a handgun to someone under the age of 21 and cannot sell any other type of gun to someone under the age of 18. 
   The law is different, however, for private transactions. Those are sales or transfers by unlicensed individuals at gun shows, at flea markets, or in a private home. Since 1994, it has been illegal for anyone under the age of 18 to buy a handgun in these cases. But it is not illegal for a juvenile to buy a long-gun--that is, a rifle, a shotgun, or a semiautomatic assault weapon--in a private transaction. And, it is not illegal for a long-gun to be transferred--given--to a juvenile. 
   This is not right. An 18-year-old cannot buy a can of beer. An 19-year-old cannot buy a bottle of liquor or a bottle of wine. Anyone under 18 cannot buy a pack of cigarettes. And, as I mentioned, since 1994, if you are under 18, you cannot buy a handgun. 
   There is a reason for this. There is a reason we keep certain things away from juveniles. And, it does not make sense to me to say that it is illegal to sell cigarettes, alcohol, and handguns to a kid, but it is okay to sell them a rifle or a shotgun or a semiautomatic assault weapon. 
   So, my bill--the Youth Access to Firearms Act--simply says that it would be illegal to sell, deliver, or transfer any firearm to anyone under the age of 18. 
   Now, in recognition of the culture and circumstances in many areas of this country, my bill does contain some exceptions to this prohibition. 
   First, the bill would not make possession of a long-gun by a juvenile a crime. It would only make the sale or transfer illegal. 
   Second, the bill would not apply to a rifle or shotgun given to a juvenile by that person's parent, grandparent, or legal guardian. 
   Third, it would not apply to another family member giving a juvenile a rifle or shotgun with the permission of the juvenile's parent, grandparent, or legal guardian. 
   Fourth, it would not apply to a temporary transfer--a loan--of a rifle or shotgun for hunting purposes. 
   And, fifth, it would not apply to the temporary transfer of a gun to a juvenile for employment, target shooting, or a course of instruction in the safe and lawful use of a firearm, if the juvenile has parental permission. 
   I have put these exceptions into the bill to make it clear what I am trying to do here. I am not trying to stop teenagers from having or responsibly using a rifle or a shotgun. I am not trying to stop teenagers from going hunting. I am not trying to prevent a parent or grandparent from giving a rifle or shotgun as a birthday present. But, what I am saying is that juveniles should not be able to buy a gun on their own--or be given one without the knowledge of their parents. 
   This is precisely what happened in Littleton, Colorado. The two teenage boys who shot up Columbine High School used four guns. Three of those four guns--two shotguns and a rifle--were given to them by an 18-year-old female friend. Under federal law, that was perfectly legal. 
   I should not be. You should not be able to sell a gun to a juvenile. And you should not be able to give a gun to a juvenile, unless you are the parent or grandparent. 
   As I said earlier, there are certain things that are legally off-limits to juveniles. Selling and giving them guns, if you are not their parent, should be one of those things. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this bill.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I will not be supporting the McCain amendment. I am not supporting it for a very simple reason. I felt the BRAC method was very political. It was hyped as: Oh, this is nonpolitical; it is going to be based on the merits. 
   I was not at all convinced that was the case. When you really sat down afterwards and picked the winners and losers, it was pretty clear that a lot went into that decision that was political. 
   Second, we have not seen, as the Senator from Maine, Ms. SNOWE, has stated, the kind of savings that we were promised because bases were closed and then their missions were recreated somewhere else. 
   California got hit so hard I could not even begin to tell you the overwhelming economic impact that we have taken. We still have bases, I say to my friends, that are sitting there that have not even been cleaned up and cannot be reused. 
   So I will not be supporting the McCain amendment. I hope it will not pass. I yield the floor.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I thank Senator MURRAY for yielding me this time. It is so hard to know where to begin to respond to the comments made by both of my colleagues who are the leaders in the anti-choice movement and who are using this amendment as a reason to once more come to this floor and to attack a basic constitutional right, that women have been granted, that they do not agree with. 
   So what has been their effort? It is, in essence, to take away that right bit by bit. I hate to say this: They have made great progress. They have taken away the right to choose in many ways, from poor women in this country, by denying them funding. A woman in D.C. cannot exercise that right, even if she does not use Federal funds but locally-raised funds. They no longer teach surgical abortion at medical schools as a result of the action of this anti-choice Congress. 
   Women in the military, as we now know, are denied the right to go to a safe military hospital. Native American women who rely on Indian health care cannot go to that health care center and obtain a legal abortion. 
   I want to make a statement, and I sure would like a response: Women in Federal prison who need to have this legal procedure get treated better than women in the military overseas. Let me repeat that. Under the laws of this Congress, women in Federal prison get treated better than women in the military who are stationed overseas when both need to have this procedure. 
   Under our rules, if a woman is in a Federal prison, she cannot count on Medicaid, that is so. But if there is an escort committee who can take her to get this procedure paid for privately, she gets that escort committee. What happens to a woman in the military? Suppose you are stationed in Saudi Arabia where abortion is illegal, and you cannot go to your military hospital. You, obviously, cannot go to a clean health facility in Saudi Arabia, so you have two choices: You can go to a back-alley abortionist and risk your life--you are already risking your life in the military--but risk your life or you can go to your commander, who is usually a man, and confide in him as to your situation which, it seems to me, is a horrible thing to have to do, to tell such a private matter to a commander. Then, if you can get a seat on a C-17 cargo plane, maybe then you can go back, in a situation where you really need immediate attention, and figure out a way to get a safe, legal abortion.  
   The Senator from New Hampshire and the Senator from Oklahoma say: Well, this is Federal funding. 
   This is not Federal funding. Senator MURRAY has stated that over and over. I compliment her and Senator SNOWE on their tenacity in bringing this back and forcing us to look at what we are doing to women in the military who risk their lives every single day, and because of this antichoice Senate, we are forcing them to put their lives at risk again. I commend them. This is not a fringe benefit. They will pay. 
   Medical facilities abroad are in a state of readiness. They do not have to turn the lights on when someone comes in for a health care procedure. The lights are on, and they will pay the costs. We all know when we pay our doctors the overhead is put into that bill. That is such a bogus argument. It is amazing that it is even made. 
   What you are doing in this current policy is telling women in the military they are lesser citizens than all the other women in the country when, in fact, they ought to be treated with even more dignity and respect perhaps than anyone else, because not many of us can say that we go to work every day putting our lives on the line. They can say that. Yet, because of this terrible way we treat these women, they are put in jeopardy. 
   I will sum it up this way. There are people in this Senate who disagree with the Supreme Court decision, and I say to my friend from New Hampshire, he certainly does and he does not mince words about it and he is very straightforward about it. He says he is proud to be pro-life. 
   I ask for 1 more minute.

   Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Chair. I say to my friend from Nebraska how grateful I am for taking the time that he has needed to explain this amendment, not only to our colleagues but to the American people. This amendment is a very important amendment. It will delete the provision in law which prevents the United States from retiring additional nuclear weapons delivery systems until the Russian Duma ratifies the START II treaty. 
   The Senator from Nebraska has explained in great detail why that is not a prudent course for our Nation, and I agree with him. I will take 5 or 6 minutes to explain why. 
   For the last 2 years, the defense authorization bill has included a provision which bars reductions below 71 B-52H bombers, 18 Trident ballistic missile submarines, 500 Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missiles, and 50 MX Peacekeeper missiles. Congress has told the Pentagon that we cannot reduce below that level. 
   In this year's defense authorization bill, this provision again is included with a revision that allows the number of Trident submarines to be reduced by six at the request of the Navy. This is a good step. It is a good first step, but more needs to be done to move in this direction. 
   As Senator KERREY has stated, there is no need to maintain these huge stockpiles of nuclear weapons. There is little doubt that Russia will fall well below START II levels whether or not the Duma gives its consents and ratifies the START II treaty. Edward Warner III, Assistant Secretary of Defense, Strategy and Threat Reduction testified that:  
   In light of the very small modernization efforts [Russia] has underway, and the obsolescence of many major components of both their submarines and their strategic military forces, Russia will be hard-pressed to keep a force of more than about 3,500 weapons. And our intelligence analysts say in light of current developments--again, we're projecting out over the decade--by about the year 2010, they will be hard-pressed to even meet a level of about 1,500 weapons.  
   If this is the case, if our own intelligence people are telling us that regardless of whether the Duma passes START II, the Russians are going to have a much lower level of capability, why do we need 6,000 deployed nuclear weapons with thousands more in reserve? What useful purpose do these thousands of weapons serve? 
   If we reduce our stockpiles toward START II levels of 3,500 nuclear weapons, we would still have the ability to obliterate any nation anywhere anytime. 
   I will repeat that because I want the American people to understand that this amendment keeps us strong; it makes us safer; it makes us stronger. START II levels will still leave us with 3,500 nuclear weapons which could obliterate any nation anywhere anytime, and, I add, many times over. 
   It is dangerous to maintain 6,000 deployed U.S. nuclear weapons, half of which are on hair-trigger alert. The massive U.S. deployment pressures Russia to deploy as many of its nuclear forces as it can afford--and they do it on hair-trigger alert--at a time when the Russian command and control is stressed and when Russian launchers are dangerously over age. 
   What Senator KERREY is trying to point to here is not a situation of panic but of truth, and the truth is the more we deploy, the more they are compelled to deploy, and that is at a time when the Russian command-and-control system is stressed and when the launchers are dangerously over age. This sets up a very dangerous situation. 
   Certainly many of us are concerned about what we have learned about China's efforts to steal our nuclear secrets. This is very serious. Every one of us, regardless of party, is sick at heart about what has happened. It has happened over many, many decades, and there is blame to go everywhere. But the truth of the matter is, China has a few dozen strategic nuclear delivery vehicles and 
   that threat is not comparable to the one we face in Russia, as Senator KERREY has pointed out. That is the real threat we face. We need to do something to diminish that threat. 
   There is a question of cost. There can be substantial savings from nuclear weapons cuts. The CBO has estimated that reducing U.S. forces to START II levels by 2007 could produce a savings of $570 million in fiscal year 2000 and a $12.7 billion savings over 10 years. 
   This is not small change. This is important. We just faced a situation where we saw a vote in the Senate, and we lost by four votes, to put some afterschool programs in place across this country. When I talked to my friends on the other side, I received two votes on the other side. The others all said: We love the program, but we can't afford it. We were asking for essentially an authorization of $600 million, and the money was not there. 
   Why do we waste money and make a situation more dangerous when we can save money and make a situation less dangerous? I think that is the merit of the amendment that is before us. Mr. President, $12.7 billion over 10 years is not small change. We have lots of things we can do, and we can always return it to the taxpayers. 
   The CBO further estimated that reductions in nuclear delivery systems within the overall limits of START II could produce savings of $20.9 billion.  
   There is a precedent for what we would do here. 
   It is very important. The Senator from Nebraska said people call this unilateral disarmament. Let me prove to you that this is not the case. In 1991, President Bush had the courage to announce that we would withdraw our tactical nuclear weapons to the United States. That was not dependent on any action by the Soviet Union. He stood up and said this is in the best interest of the United States of America. 
   He also ordered 1,000 U.S. warheads deployed on strategic bombers and ballistic missiles slated for dismantlement to be taken off alert. I think we all remember that day. It was a very exciting and dramatic day. He did those two actions because it was in the best interests of America. 
   Do you know what happened after that? President Gorbachev responded in kind. He withdrew all tactical weapons from Warsaw Pact nations and non-Russian republics, removed most categories of tactical nuclear weapons from service, and designated thousands of nuclear warheads for dismantlement. 
   The point the Senator from Nebraska is making is, sometimes it does take courage to stand up and say this is what is in our best interests and show real leadership, the way George Bush did in 1991 in these two examples and the way President Gorbachev followed his lead. 
   I am very disappointed that the Russian Duma has not yet ratified the START II treaty. Again, if we follow the leadership of the Senator from Nebraska on this, we will be acting in our best interests, not in the best interests of the Russian Duma. We should lead and not wait for them to lead. 
   In conclusion, there are very good reasons for the United States of America to reduce its nuclear weapons. This amendment is carefully drawn. It is carefully thought out. It comes from a man who put his life on the line in the military and would do nothing to harm our national security. As a matter of fact, he would do everything to make us stronger. I hope we follow his lead and adopt his amendment. I yield back my time.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce a bill to protect children from the dangers posed by pollution and toxic chemicals in our environment. My Children's Environmental Protection Act (CEPA) is based on the understanding that children are more vulnerable to those dangers than adults, and require special protection. 
   In fact, we know that the physiology of children and their exposure patterns to toxic and harmful substances differ from that of adults, and make them more susceptible to the dangers posed by those substances than adults. Children face greater exposure to such substances because they eat more food, drink more water, and breathe more air as a percentage of their body weight than adults. Children are also rapidly growing, and therefore physiologically more vulnerable to such substances than adults. 
   How is this understanding that children suffer higher risks from the dangers posed by toxic and harmful substances than adults taken into account in our environmental and public health standards? Do we gather and consider data that specifically evaluates how those substances affect children? 
   If that data is lacking, do we apply extra caution when we determine the amount of toxics that can be released into the air and water, the level of harmful contaminants that may be present in our drinking water, or the amount of pesticides that may be present in our food? 
   In most cases, the answer to all of these questions is ``no.'' 
   In fact, most of these standards are designed to protect adults rather than children. In most cases, we don't even have the data that would allow us to measure how those substances specifically affect children. And, finally, in the face of that uncertainty, we generally assume that what we don't know about the dangers toxic and harmful substances pose to our children won't hurt them. 
   We generally don't apply extra caution to take account of that uncertainty. 
   CEPA would change the answers to those questions from ``no'' to ``yes.'' It would childproof our environmental laws. CEPA is based on the premise that what we don't know about the dangers toxic and harmful substances pose to our children may very well hurt them. 
   CEPA would require the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to set environmental and public health standards to protect children. It would specifically require EPA to explicitly consider the dangers that toxic and harmful substances pose to children when setting those standards. Finally, if EPA discovers that it does not have specific data that would allow it to measure those dangers, EPA would be required to apply an additional safety factor--an additional measure of caution--to account for that lack of information. 
   As work would move forward under CEPA to childproof our environmental standards, CEPA would provide parents and teachers with a number of tools to immediately protect their children from toxic and harmful substances. 
   First, CEPA would require EPA to provide all schools and day care centers that receive federal funding a copy of EPA's guide to help schools adopt a least toxic pest management policy. CEPA would also prohibit the use of dangerous pesticides--those containing known or probable carcinogens, reproductive toxins, acute nerve toxins and endocrine disrupters--in those areas. Under CEPA, parents would also receive advance notification before pesticides are applied on school or day care center grounds. 
   Second, CEPA would expand the federal Toxics Release Inventory (TRI) to require the reporting of toxic chemical releases that may pose special risks to children. In particular, CEPA provides that releases of small amounts of lead, mercury, dioxin, cadmium and chromium be reported under TRI. These chemicals are either highly toxic, persist in the environment or can accumulate in the human body over many years--all features which render them particularly dangerous to children. 
   Lead, for example, will seriously affect a child's development, but is still released into the environment through lead smelting and waste incineration. CEPA would then require EPA to identify other toxic chemicals that may present special risks to children, and to provide that releases of those chemicals be reported under TRI. 
   Finally, CEPA would direct EPA to create a list of recommended safer-for-children products that minimize potential risks to children. CEPA would also require EPA to create a family right-to-know information kit that would include practical suggestions to help parents reduce their children's exposure to toxic and harmful substances in the environment. 
   My CEPA bill is based on the premise that what we don't know about the dangers toxic and harmful substances pose to our children may very well hurt them. It would require EPA to apply caution in the face of that uncertainty. And, ultimately, it would childproof our environmental laws to ensure that those laws protect the most vulnerable among us--our children. 
   I am hopeful that my House and Senate colleagues can act quickly to ensure the passage of my legislation.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise for the first time since I have been in the Senate to oppose a supplemental appropriation. It hurts my heart because there is so much in this bill that is good. But I have to say there is a lot in this bill that does not belong in it, and there are some things left out of this bill, one or two things, that I thought were real emergencies that should have been in there. 
   What started out as requests to fund unexpected emergencies has turned into a flurry of spending and riders that simply do not belong in this bill. The one area that I particularly cared about, violence in our schools--which is an emergency by anybody's measure when parents are telling us, 75 percent of them, they are concerned about their children when they go off to school--a very modest proposal by the Senator from Illinois was turned down by the House members of the conference after it was approved by the Senate members of the conference. So all kinds of dollars were found for many things, but they could not find it in their hearts to do something about violence in the schools by providing some counselors, some afterschool money so desperately needed in our country today. 
   I am happy for the Senator from West Virginia, that he was able to get a commitment for a crisis he is facing in the steel industry in his State. I agreed with him, that particular piece of legislation and those funds should have been placed into this bill, and they were not. So I found this a very strange conference. I miss the Appropriations Committee. I was on it for two beautiful years. So I sat and watched at 1 in the morning as Senators and House Members debated. You may wonder, why would the Senator from California do that? Very simple: It is a very important bill that is before us. 
   I believe in what NATO is trying to accomplish. I agreed with the President that we needed to find about $6 billion for the military. It turns out it is almost double that, that winds up in this bill. The pay raise is taken care of. I wanted to do an even higher pay raise, but that pay raise--it is not an emergency, it is an obligation. We have to back the pay raise in the regular appropriations bills. This is just another way to push dollars around. 
   I do not think it is fair to say that is an emergency. I supported the funds in there for America's farmers, for Hurricane Mitch; those things were fine. But some of the riders in this bill really were wrong, not only wrong in substance but wrong to put in this bill. For example, the rider that deals with the tobacco funds from the tobacco lawsuit. It is not that I object that the Federal Government will not get a share of that--because I am willing to say it is fine, the Governors are the ones who put their names out there and they should get these funds. But to say to the Governors who are getting our part of the reimbursement: By the way, spend it any way you like--we are going to see Governors use that money to put a swimming pool in the Governor's mansion; we are going to see Governors use that to build a little street in the neighborhood where maybe some of their donors live. 
   I do not come from the school of thought that Governors are better than Senators. I think we run on a platform and most of us, most of us from both parties, believe we need to take care 
   of the health care needs of our people. Comes along this bill, comes along a rider that says: Governors, you can spend that any way you want. Build a running track for your friends around the Governor's mansion? Fine, no problem, no strings. I have a problem with that. We should make sure our Governors are taking care of the health needs of their citizens since part of that money rightly comes from a recovery that included Federal programs--Medicaid, as an example. 
   Then there are three riders that deal with the environment in one way or the other. One has to do with oil royalties. This is about the third time that antienvironmental rider has been placed in this bill, because colleagues know they cannot get the votes here. It is stopping the Interior Department from collecting the rent payments or the royalty payments from oil companies who drill on Federal land, taxpayers' land. That money is being stolen from us. How do I know that? Because there have been lawsuits. And every time the Federal Government wins those lawsuits--I ask for 1 additional minute, if I might.

   Mrs. BOXER. So here we have a situation where the Interior Department could use the money to help with our parks and open space, and the oil companies get another special rider on this bill. It is the third time that has happened. Mr. President, I do not think that is the way to legislate. 
   Then we have an environmental rider placed in the bill by Senator GORTON who now, I understand, is not even going to vote for this bill which has his rider in it that does tremendous damage to the State of Washington by permitting a mine up there. 
   There are so many things in this bill that do not belong in it. So it is with a heavy heart I say to my friends, for whom I have great respect, I cannot vote for this. I do not think everything in there is truly an emergency. Yet I think those things that were emergencies were left out. 
   I look forward to working with my friends in the regular order so we can debate some of these important measures outside this so-called emergency designation. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I thank my friend, the ranking member for yielding. I hope he will stay on the floor just a moment because I wanted to ask him something. In this amendment, on page 4, is something that completely astounds me. This commission is going to look at whether the regulation of the content of motion pictures is appropriate. 
   Federal regulation--is this the Soviet Union? What are we doing? I ask my friend if this disturbs him that we would be considering the Federal Government regulating the content of motion pictures.

   Mrs. BOXER. I point out to my friend, who is such an advocate of the Constitution, that this is the third one. We have investigation mania going on here. This is the third investigation of the entertainment industry that is going to be voted on in this Senate; the third investigation. Fortunately, on the first one, we expanded it to include the gun industry. So there is one investigation of the gun industry and how it peddles its products to kids, and then  there are three investigations of the entertainment industry. But this is the very first one where it says in this bill--and I say to my friends, read it. They are going to look at whether there should be Federal regulation of the content of motion pictures. 
   Maybe the Senator from Missouri is interested in writing movies, but I am not. This is what it is about. None of us was elected to be a movie writer. There is no bureaucrat I know who ought to sit around and write movies. We now have three investigations of the motion picture industry in this bill. 
   Let me tell you what they are. The first one was the Brownback amendment. I actually supported it. Everybody did. I thought: OK, we will have a commission; it will look at youth violence. That commission calls for the Federal Trade Commission and the Attorney General, with all the powers of their offices, to look at the marketing tactics of the motion picture industry, the entertainment industry, and the video games industry and see if they are, in fact, taking advantage of our children. 
   Then we have the Lieberman Commission, which is part of the managers' amendment, which sits in this bill. I have it in 
   front of me. Mr. LIEBERMAN, Mr. MCCAIN, Mr. BYRD, Mr. BROWNBACK, Ms. LANDRIEU, et cetera. They are establishing a national youth violence commission and it refers to the various powers of that commission. That is investigation No. 2. 
   Now comes along, in case we did not do enough of this, investigation No. 3. Duplicative, I add, of the others, but a lot more frightening, because it includes the possibility of Federal regulation of the content of motion pictures. 
   It refers to changing the law to seek legal redress against producers. My friend from Missouri can take comfort in the fact that we are already doing what he wants to be done, with the exception of looking at the content. 
   I do not know whether this is going to be accepted or if there is a vote. More than likely it is going to be adopted. Set up a commission. How about doing something that will help? How about keeping our kids busy after school? Oh, no, I only got two people from the other side of the aisle. Keep our children busy after school so they are not sitting in front of the television? Oh, no, we couldn't do that, even though we have a million children waiting in line to get into afterschool programs. 
   But, oh, let's have a third commission and beat up on the entertainment industry and that is going to help keep our kids out of trouble. 
   Look at the FBI statistics. That is when there is juvenile crime. This is a juvenile justice bill. We do a little something for afterschool in this bill, but it is just that, a little something. It will not take care of the backlog of all the children who are waiting, but, oh, we can feel real good and set up a third investigation of the entertainment industry. 
   This is amazing to me. And this one is frightening to me, to think that the Federal Government may now begin to regulate the content of movies. I simply think that the American people do not want to see their Government regulating what can be said in a movie. If you do not like a movie, don't go see it, as Senator LEAHY said yesterday. Don't spend your dollars on violence. Turn the movie channel. But to set up now a third commission on the entertainment industry, this is just going over the top. And suggesting that they look at ways to regulate content, that is a frightening thought to me. 
   I do not have much hope that this will be defeated because it seems to be something we are getting used to here: Let's have an investigation; it's easy; it's easy; have an investigation. 
   By the way, it is going to cost $1 million. Do you know how many slots that could take care of for kids waiting in line to get in afterschool programs? Let's use it on something that works. A million dollars on this commission. I know my friend is a fiscal conservative. I hope when this bill gets to conference, they can take these three investigations and put them into one, because this is simply amazing to me. 
   I have every belief that the Senator's commission will be adopted. The Senate is in the mood to launch yet another investigation, point another finger and, ``Yes, I voted against afterschool, but I voted for that commission; I am going to save our kids.'' 
   I am very surprised we are looking--as a matter of fact, I did not even know this was coming up until somebody said it. I thought: Wait a minute, that is confusing; we already have two investigations. Now we have yet a third. 
   I know what I am saying is not popular around here, but I worry when we start talking about the Government regulating content. That reminds me of the old Soviet Union. That is gone. Let's not follow that model. 
   I hope people vote against this. Again, I do not hold out much hope, but I hope people vote against this. I yield back my time.

I thank Senator KERREY, in particular, for joining with the Senator from New Jersey. I think this combination is a very good one. It is a Senator from the East and a Senator from Nebraska working together. I think it should pull us all together and put this amendment over the top.

   Mrs. BOXER. I wanted to say to my friend, quoting very briefly--then I will put this in the RECORD, and I will yield back--that Janet Reno, our law enforcement officer, says, ``The Senate proposal doesn't do enough to keep firearms out of the wrong hands.'' She said that the ``U.S. Senate has.......the opportunity to make our streets and communities safer by closing the loophole that lets felons, fugitives and other prohibited people buy deadly weapons at gun shows.'' She laments the action that the Senate took. She points out that even though some on the other side said this amendment would close the gun show loophole, they do not, and she basically then says that the bill of Senator LAUTENBERG and Senator KERREY does the job, and it follows the recommendations of the Attorney General. She says there is still time for the Senate to revisit this important issue and adopt legislation that closes the gun show loophole once and for all. 
   I guess my final question to my friend is this: It is unusual to see a Senator get up and offer once again an amendment that essentially he offered before. Does my friend have hope that we will get enough votes on the other side to have a better outcome and to plug this loophole?

   Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Chair. I thank the Senator from Utah for extending me this courtesy. 
   I have been sitting on the Senate floor since about 10 this morning listening to what has been a very fine debate. What I would like to do in these 3 minutes is put this whole debate into the context of reality. 
   We can talk theoretically, but I think reality has finally begun to hit the American people. I think that is why we have seen, finally, proper attention given to sensible gun laws. 
   We can see here in the 11 years of the Vietnam war, tragically we lost 58,168 of our finest people. That is 58,168 families devastated--devastated--by such a loss. Who knows what the potential of those people would have been? Certainly we know that war brought this country to its knees, and whether you supported it or did not, everyone--everyone--grieves that loss. 
   In 11 years in America in the war at home, 396,572 gun deaths, I say to my friends on both sides of the aisle, 11 years, almost 400,000 of our people killed; 396,572 families devastated. Many of those are children. Every day in this country we have the equivalent of a Columbine loss. Thirteen children a day are killed in my home State of California. The No. 1 cause of death to children in my home State--Gunshots. 
   So what are we trying to do in this debate with the juvenile justice bill on both sides? I think we want to make this country safer for children. The debate comes on how you do it. 
   The distinguished Senator from Utah said: You're pushing gun amendments on us. And just how far do you want to go? 
   My answer, as just one Senator, is: As long as it takes to change this. We have to change the reality that our children face. 
   When you ask parents today, do they feel secure when they send their kids off to school, no, they don't. 
   One of the things we could do is close the gun show loophole. Senator LAUTENBERG offered us that opportunity. It was voted down narrowly. He and Senator KERREY have teamed up. They have made a few changes which I think strengthen the amendment. We want to try again to close the gun show loophole.

   Mrs. BOXER. I simply say that Janet Reno has talked here about why it is important to try to finally close this loophole. She points out that the Senators on the other side who offered their loophole closing simply did not close the loophole. Senator KERREY pointed out that new designation of dealers who were exempted. 
   The pawnshop loophole, let me talk about that, my friends. This weakens the law from its current status. 
   I ask for 30 additional seconds, and then I will close. 
</TEXT>

<DOC>
<DOCNO>106-boxer-ca-9-19990519</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. BOXER. The pawnshop loophole, which was opened up by my friends on the other side, if you are going to a pawnshop, you are five times more likely to be a criminal. What they do is to say no background checks anymore. What else do they do to weaken the current law? They say that you can only have 24 hours to finish the background check at a gun show. 
   My friends, in 20 percent of those cases they need more time; they have to call the FBI. The FBI is telling us that isn't a good step; it is going the create more death and destruction. 
   So, in closing, let me urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to finally close this loophole in the right way and support the Lautenberg-Kerrey legislation. 
   I yield the floor. I thank my colleague from Utah for his generous spirit in giving me this time.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I feel very strongly that this amendment should not pass. 
   I wanted to add to what Senator LEAHY has said. As far as I know, none of the movies or programs he talks about, and certainly none of the games--because games are made from computers--were ever made on Federal property as far as I could tell. I think that is an important point. 
   It is interesting that just today, just today, one of the committees here in the Senate voted out some new rules that would govern the filming on Federal property. It was voted out of the committee. I think it is unfortunate we are bringing this up just while we are trying to resolve all of these questions. 
   I think it is important to read the amendment. I have it in front of me, and it uses words that are very subjective, words like ``wanton violence.'' I looked that up in the dictionary because under this amendment we are giving Federal bureaucrats who are not trained as critics of film or critics of television programming the job of deciding whether there is wanton violence. 
   One of the meanings of ``wanton'' is excessively luxurious. So, somebody deciding this could decide to go with that definition. Another meaning of ``wanton'' is without adequate motive or provocation. These words carry different meanings for different people. The Senator from Kentucky has his definition of gratuitous violence, of wanton violence. The dictionary has another. Who knows what the bureaucrat at the FAA will decide violence is, when it is up to him to decide whether his property could be used, or a bureaucrat at the Department of the Interior? 
   I got a call from a Republican friend who said: Senator, I hope you fight this. We couldn't make a western, we couldn't make a war movie. What about a movie that talks about a family in which there are violent relationships and these all get resolved in the movie? Some of the scenes are rough and difficult, but there is a purpose. 
   I am sure my friend would say that is not gratuitous, but that is his opinion. It might not be the opinion of the bureaucrat sitting in the agency or department that he is now charging with becoming a film critic.

   Mrs. BOXER. I am addressing the Senator's amendment and the Senator's amendment says any department. It uses the words ``wanton, gratuitous.'' I think these words are very, very subjective. It is the reason I didn't vote for Senator HOLLINGS' amendment when he came to the floor--it was the same idea. 
   My constituents are concerned this amendment would potentially prevent war movies, westerns, or stories about abusive relationships which find peace and harmony in the end from being filmed on Federal property. It gives bureaucrats in many Federal agencies the authority to decide what violence is. 
   I didn't run here for this job to be an art critic. That is why when we criticize the art world, I think we have to be very careful, because we are not art critics. Most Members are pretty good at what we do, but we are not art critics; neither is a bureaucrat over at Interior or FAA or any of the other departments that will now deal with this. 
   I say, as a parent and a grandparent, I do not want to give this kind of power, this kind of job to an elected, let alone an unelected, person sitting at some Federal agency. I think it is pretty incredible. I do not know where we go from here, I say to the good Senator. 
   Why not, if you want to take this to the ultimate extreme, then say private property cannot be used, private property cannot be used for this purpose, and tell the people of America how they should use their private property? Where do you stop? This is a slippery slope. 
   We all know that every one of us has to look inside ourselves and do something about this problem of violence. Whether you are a parent or a grandparent or a Senator, whether you are in the movie business, in the TV business, whether you are in the video game business, we all have an obligation--or whether you are a firearms manufacturer. The bottom line is we all have to do more. 
   But to then say that bureaucrats in the Federal Government are going to make these subjective decisions? I want the people at FAA to fly the planes. I want the people at the Department of the Interior to take care of the parks. I want the people at the Department of Transportation to regulate transportation. I do not want to give them this job of deciding for the people of America what the definition of ``wanton'' is; or ``gratuitous,'' for that matter.

Others thought ``Schindler's List'' was one of the best movies ever made and it would be important for our children to learn about the Holocaust. 
   Why do I say this? Because it shows how subjective it is. I do not want Federal Government employees who are not trained as critics to become movie critics and TV critics.

   Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Chair. 
   Mr. President, my amendment calls for an expansion of afterschool programs. The purpose of the juvenile justice bill is to cut down on crime, and the debate has been, how do we do that? 
   There are many ways of cutting down on juvenile crime. Certainly one is the gun control amendments which we have been debating and which have received a lot of attention. Another is tough enforcement, tougher penalties. We have been doing that. And another is prevention. I believe this bill is short on prevention. There is not anything in this bill that specifically talks about afterschool programs. 
   I share with my colleagues a chart, which is basically from the FBI, which shows when juvenile crime is committed. One does not need a degree in chart reading to see what is happening. At 3 o'clock the crime rate goes up, and it does not go down until the parents start coming home from work. We know it is very important in that period of time to look at ways to keep our kids out of trouble. One proven way is afterschool programs. 
   Right now, we do have afterschool programs funded by the Federal Government, but we are falling short. Out of the 2,000 school districts that applied for afterschool Federal assistance, only 287 applications were awarded grants because of the lack of funds. 
   President Clinton understood this. In his budget, he asked us to authorize $600 million. That is what my amendment does. It authorizes $600 million. It allows us to accommodate 1.1 million children, many of whom are waiting on line to get into afterschool programs. These are mentoring programs, academic assistance, recreational activities, drug-alcohol prevention programs, et cetera. 
   The American people understand the importance of afterschool programs. I want my colleagues to see this. Senator LAUTENBERG said 89 percent of the people supported closing the gun show loophole. Mr. President, 92 percent of the people favor afterschool programs. We have a chance to do what the American people want us to do. 
   Law enforcement supports our afterschool program, as do over 450 police chiefs, sheriffs, and prosecutors. It is important to look at this list because they are from all over the country. 
   Let's see what the Police Activities League says about afterschool programs. In a letter of endorsement, they write:  
   Afterschool youth development programs, like those proposed in your amendment, have been shown to cut juvenile crime immediately, sometimes by 40 to 75 percent.  
   I need to say this again. Law enforcement is telling us that afterschool programs cut violent crime by children down by 40 to 75 percent. Name one other thing we have in this bill that can have such a dramatic impact immediately on our children. 
   I saw an interesting letter to the editor in today's Los Angeles Times. It is from the Republican mayor of that city, Richard Riordan. He says:  
   Studies have shown that LA's best--  
   Which is their afterschool program--  
   students enjoy school more, show improvement in their grades and feel safe.The kids do better at school. They do better in all the various schools across this Nation, because they have afterschool.  
   Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?

   Mrs. BOXER. I thank my friends. 
   Frankly, I am kind of surprised to see my friends on the Republican side disagree so strongly with law enforcement in this country. There is a reason we put this on the juvenile justice bill. It is because we know that kids get into trouble after school. You do not need a degree in criminology, psychology, or any other ``ology'' to understand that is what is happening. 
   When I held crime meetings, town meetings, all throughout the State of California, the one thing I can tell you the law enforcement people told me--and that is why the National Sheriffs Association supports our amendment--Senator, when we get them, it is too late. When we get them, it is too late. Prevent the crime first. 
   It goes to the next chart. 
   Three o'clock, that is when it happens, folks. They get out of school; they have no place to go; they get in trouble. I am stunned to see the Senator from Vermont once again opposing this. This isn't a new program; it is an expansion of the program that was started by President Clinton. And guess what, I say to my friend. They can only fund a minuscule proportion of the applications from the school districts coming from all over the country. 
   What we would do in this amendment is allow those applications to be funded. This is nothing new. This is nothing extraordinary. It is expanding this program--the same program --to meet the incredible need. 
   I agree with law enforcement on this one: Keep our kids busy and happy after school. We will see that crime rate go down. 
   Thank you very much, Mr. President.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, all we do in this amendment is authorize the amount of money we need to fill the need of all those local school districts which have applied for afterschool programs. We know that at 3 o'clock--this is from the FBI--the crime rate goes up and it does not go down until the parents come home from work. We know that afterschool programs will prevent crime. 
   We also know the reason all these various law enforcement agencies support this is that this is the way to stop crime from happening in the first place.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, we hope to cut down juvenile crime. What better way to do it than to listen to law enforcement, including the Police Athletic Leagues and the National Sheriffs Association, and so many police chiefs who tell us: Senators, prevention is the name of the game. Once the kids get into the system, we cannot turn them around. 
   If we will vote for this, we will authorize the appropriate amount of money the local school districts are telling us meets the needs of 1.2 million children. I hope my colleagues will support this amendment.

   Mrs. BOXER. Thank you very much, Mr. President. 
   I associate myself with the remarks that have been made all morning concerning the passing of Admiral Nance, and what a gentleman he was, and what a difficult thing it is for Senator HELMS to lose a friend he has had since childhood.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I join my colleagues and the entire Senate family in honoring the life and memory of Admiral James Nance, the former majority staff director for the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. My deepest sympathies go out to Bud's wife, Mary, and to his four children and seven grandchildren. 
   I also want to express to my Chairman, Senator HELMS, my sincerest condolences on the loss of his lifelong friend. He and Bud Nance, born just a few months apart, grew up a mere three blocks from each other in Monroe, North Carolina. 
   Bud Nance joined the Navy in 1941 and retired 38 years later as a rear admiral. He served this nation in active duty in three wars. During his service in World War II, he survived 162 Japanese air and kamikaze attacks. Over the course of his career, he served as a Navy test pilot, led an attack squadron and an air wing, and commanded the U.S.S. Raleigh and the aircraft carrier, Forrestal. After leaving the military in 1979, Admiral Nance served as assistant national security adviser until he joined the private sector as head of naval systems for Boeing. 
   In 1991, Senator HELMS asked his old friend to bring his military knowledge and experience in world affairs to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Admiral Nance refused to take a salary and received only the minimum compensation allowed under federal law--$153 per year. 
   Bud Nance will be remembered in this body as a gracious and kind gentleman. When I joined the Foreign Relations Committee this year, Bud called to welcome me and my staff to the Committee. It was typical of Bud's courtesy and good manners. 
   Mr. President, in Bud Nance the Senate has lost a loyal public servant and the nation has lost a true patriot.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, at the end of my remarks I am going to make a unanimous consent request--I see the Senator from Idaho is here; I want him to know that--that I be permitted to send an amendment to the desk regarding the age people have to be before they can buy a weapon or gain access to a weapon. But I will not do that now; I will wait until the end of my remarks, and then I will make that unanimous consent request. I wanted to make sure my colleagues knew I was going to do that. 
   I think it is really important, as we move forward on this juvenile justice bill, to debate all the issues surrounding juvenile justice as fully and as completely as we can. After all, there isn't a politician I know who does not say our future is our children. That is what our future is about. And as healthy as our children are, that is as healthy as our country will be. As stable as our children are, that is how stable our country will be. As productive as our children are, that is how productive our country will be. 
   As we all attempt in various capacities in our lives--as parents, and as grandparents--to ensure that our children understand that in a society that is worthy there should be as little violence as possible, if we can just transmit that to our children, this will be a better world. 
   In the course of the debate, we have talked about many areas in our society that need attention. There isn't one of us who could truly stand up here and say, well, I do everything I can; there is nothing wrong with me. And there is no industry that can stand up and say it. We all have to look inside ourselves to make sure our kids understand that violence is wrong, it is a black and white situation, and it isn't the way to resolve our problems, et cetera. So this debate surrounding this bill is very relevant to the lives of our people. 
   In my home State--and I have said this often on the floor, but it is worth repeating to some of my friends--the No. 1 cause of death among children happens to be gunshots. In other words, for children, from as soon as they are born to age 18, that is the No. 1 cause of death--that they are going to be killed by a gun. 
   Somebody could say, well, that is just the price you pay to live in America. That is ridiculous. That is ridiculous. In our Constitution we have the right to pursue happiness; we have the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness--life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. So when we see gunshots causing so much death and mutilation in our society, we have to take a look at, Where have we gone wrong? What is wrong? Can we do something? 
   We have taken a couple steps in this bill to try to fix this problem of guns, but we have a long way to go. I want to show a chart here which indicates why this is such an important issue in America. 
   In the 11 years of the Vietnam war, we lost 58,168 of our precious people, and this country--this country--was torn apart. Every one of those deaths was mourned by family and by the greater American family. 
   In the last 11 years, we have lost 396,572 people to guns. 
   Yes, it might be time to spend a few more days on this bill when you find yourself in this kind of situation. You cannot turn away from facts. You may want to turn away from facts, but you cannot turn away from facts. 
   As I look around and see these numbers and I see what is happening in the news--in the last few days we had about four or five other schoolkids who, it was found, thank goodness, were going to perpetrate a massacre with guns at their schools --something rings out in my mind, and that is, angry kids and guns do not mix. Angry people and guns do not mix. 
   It seems to me that since we know you have to be 18 years of age to buy wine, to buy beer, to buy cigarettes, you ought to have to be 18 years old before you can buy a gun. 
   Some people might say, well, haven't we fixed that? Well, for handguns, 21; that is, if you go to a dealer. I believe Senator ASHCROFT said you have to be 18 to buy a semiautomatic at a gun  show. You have to be 18 if you go to a dealer to buy a long gun. But if you go to a gun show or you make a private purchase, you can be 14 to buy a rifle or a shotgun under Federal law. You could be 12. So I think it is time for us to look at what we are doing in this country. 
   Eighteen to buy cigarettes, 18 to buy beer or whiskey or wine, 18 to buy a semiautomatic handgun, 21 at a dealer. But you could buy these long guns. And we have juveniles going to unlicensed vendors at a gun show or at a flea market and buying a long gun in what we call private sales. 
   Now, I want to talk about what happened in the Colorado massacre, because one of the things people are saying is, well, many laws were broken there so we don't need any more laws. The truth is, the young woman who transferred those guns to the juveniles, because she said she didn't know they were going to use it for adverse purposes, broke no law. She broke no law. She was 18. She purchased, as I understand it, three weapons and gave them to these kids. She broke no law. She was 18. She gave three long guns to the shooters, legal under Federal law. It should not be. You should not be able to sell a gun to a juvenile, and you should not be able to give a gun to a juvenile unless you are the parent or the grandparent or the legal guardian. 
   I could see that. I have talked to my friend, PATRICK LEAHY, who told me he gave up a hunting rifle to his daughter when she was 15 or 16. That was his choice. So we have in our amendment the ability for a grandparent or a parent or a legal guardian to give such a gun, but not for a friend to run down to the store and get a gun and give it to you if you are 17 or you are 16 or you are 15. That shouldn't be appropriate. 
   So the amendment that I want to put forward here does not say a juvenile can't get a long gun from a parent, grandparent, or legal guardian. It would not make it illegal for that juvenile to possess a rifle or a shotgun or even to own such a gun, if a parent or a legal guardian gave it to them, or a grandparent. However, if it isn't a parent or a grandparent or a legal guardian, it would be illegal to give a juvenile a gun, any kind of gun, any kind of firearm. 
   My children would call this a no-brainer. It is pretty 
   clear that we set age limits for all kinds of things, but not to own a firearm, unless it is a handgun and now a semiautomatic weapon. So there is a giant loophole. 
   As I understand it, all of these guns would be able to be bought by a juvenile under current law. What I want to do, Mr. President, is bring guns in line with cigarettes in terms of purchase. 
   I now ask unanimous consent that I may offer that amendment to S. 254 at this time.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, as the Senator knows, I asked unanimous consent to send this amendment to the desk now. I do not want people to be confused. In the Senate, you can send an amendment to the desk any time you want, if you ask unanimous consent and no one objects. The Senator from Idaho is objecting. He is not allowing me to send this amendment to the desk to get a vote on this amendment, to put this amendment at the desk, to put it in line, when all I am saying is you should be 18 before you can buy a firearm. 
   I just want to be clear, I am very disappointed that this unanimous consent request has been objected to. I will stay on the floor as long as it takes to offer this amendment, which merely says if you have to be 18 to buy cigarettes, you ought to be 18 to buy a weapon.

   Mrs. BOXER. Reserving the right to object, I don't intend to object to my friend. I know that my friend objected to my laying down a new amendment. There were two amendments that already have been debated--the Kohl safety lock amendment and the Hatch-Feinstein gang amendment. 
   I am wondering if the Senator would object if I would ask unanimous consent that at 2:15 we resume consideration of the Kohl amendment No. 352, and that there be 5 minutes for debate, and that upon use or yielding back of the time, the Senate proceed to vote on or in relation to the amendment, and upon disposition of that, the Senate resume consideration of the Hatch-Feinstein amendment No. 353, that there be 5 minutes for debate and, upon the use or yielding back of time, the Senate proceed to vote in relation to the amendment with no intervening action, provided provisions of the previous unanimous consent remain in effect. Would the Senator allow me to offer that?

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am holding the Ashcroft amendment in my hand. It says:  
   For purposes of this subsection, the term ``juvenile'' means a person who is less than 18 years of age.  
   So the age was not raised to 21. There are some on this side who would do that. My amendment talks about all other guns. There is no age limit to go to a gun show. They can be 12 and buy a long gun, a shotgun or a rifle.

   Mrs. BOXER. Thank you very much, Mr. President. 
   It is rare that I disagree with my wonderful friend, FRITZ HOLLINGS, and my wonderful friend, BYRON DORGAN, but I do on this particular amendment that is pending before us. I think the debate is about this: Do we believe there is violence in the entertainment industry? Yes. So there is agreement there. Does it upset all of us when we see it, when we know kids are seeing it? Yes. 
   But how should we deal with it? Should Government become parents and decide what our kids watch or should Government give parents the tools to decide what their kids should watch? And I come down on the side of making sure Government gives parents the tools to decide what their children should watch, and not on the side of those who in essence want the Government, through the bureaucracy, the FCC, to determine what shows should or should not be on television. 
   Again, I do not know who is in the FCC. I think I know the chairman. I think he is a terrific person. But I do not want to say that the FCC members know more about our country's children than the parents do. So if Government can play the role of giving parents the power to determine what their kids watch, I think we are doing the right thing. As a matter of fact, 2 years ago that is what we did do. We required that all new television sets have a V-chip installed. And 50 percent of all the new sets will have the V-chip by July 1; and all the new sets will have it by January 1. So we are moving to the point where all TV sets will have the V-chip when you buy it. 
   I think it is a smart answer, the V-chip, to dealing with the issue of violence on television. It is a chip that allows the parents to program what shows their children can and cannot see. There you have it. Very simply, it is government doing what I think is the right thing, giving parents this tool, this powerful tool, putting the parents in charge, not the government in charge. 
   I worry about going down that path of giving the FCC or any other agency or, frankly, any Senator the power to decide what show goes on at what time. It is very subjective; it is a path that I think we should avoid. 
   Now, the Center for Media Education, which helped develop the TV rating system and is undertaking a national campaign to educate parents about the V-chip, they do not like this particular proposal that is before us. They say ``it would undermine the intent'' of the voluntary rating system and the V-chip. 
   So why would we, 2 years ago, work very hard, all of us together, to develop this V-chip and then, in the stroke of a vote, if we were to pass the Hollings amendment, undermine what the purpose was of that V-chip? 
   Also, the Senate yesterday adopted the Brownback amendment, and we know that is going to launch into an investigation of the entertainment industry to see whether it is marketing to kids violent programming. An amendment of mine would also extend that to investigate the gun manufacturers. 
   I was very happy to see the Senate accept that, because, as I said yesterday, to point the finger of blame at one industry is outrageous. To point the finger of blame at one person or one group of people is outrageous. There is not one of us who 
   can walk away from the issue of our violent culture and say: It has nothing to do with me. I am just perfect. It is the other guy. 
   So we undertook this issue 2 years ago. We passed this V-chip proposal. Senator BROWNBACK, yesterday, encouraged the entertainment industry to step up to the plate and develop solutions by giving an antitrust exemption to the entertainment industry so they can sit down together to come up with even more solutions than the V-chip, because, frankly, they need to talk to one another. If it means they say at a certain time we are not going to show these violent shows, that would be terrific. That would be helpful, and that would mean that the parents' job is easier. They don't have to worry as much as they do now. I agree, they have to worry plenty now. 
   I also want to do this because it is very easy to get up here and blast an industry. In every industry, there are some positive steps. Even the gun manufacturers, which I believe are marketing to children, and many of them are not responsible, there are some who are selling their guns with child safety locks, and they are doing it on a voluntary basis. I praise them. As a matter of fact, the President had those companies to the White House, and he praised them. 
   I think we ought to look at some of the good things the entertainment industry is doing for our children. Viacom, through the Nickelodeon channel, periodically airs programs to help children work through violence-related issues. In this example that I am going to give you, all these examples, I am not going to mention PBS, because they are incredible as far as producing programs for our children that are wonderful. 
   I was sitting watching one of the programs with my grandchild the other day, and kids were talking to each other, young kids, about 10, 11, about the pressures in their lives. It was terrific. I enjoyed it. I think my little grandson was too young to understand it. But for the 9-year-olds, the 8-year-olds, the 10-year-olds, there are some good things. 
   MTV has ``Fight For Your Rights, Take a Stand Against Violence.'' It is a program that gives young people advice on reducing violence in their communities. Now, they also do some things on there that do not give that message. I agree. But are we just going to bash and bash and bash? Let's at least recognize there are some efforts here. 
   The Walt Disney Company has produced and aired numerous public service announcements on issues such as school violence and has featured in its evening TV shows various antiviolence themes. 
   We want more of that, and if we don't get more of that, we are going to just make sure that parents can, in fact, program their TVs so the kids do not see the garbage and the violence and the death and all of the things that Senator HOLLINGS is right to point out are impacting and influencing our children. 
   There are shows and episodes that glorify violence, and there are shows and episodes that denounce violence. 
   I think we need to be careful in this amendment of the slippery slope we could go down if we decide in our frustration and our worry about our children that government should step in and become the parents. The V-chip, the Brownback amendment, those two things give parents the tools they need  and lets the industry sit down together and focus on the issue of violence. 
   So we have some efforts underway that are very important. I do not want to see us short circuit those efforts. 
   This is a difficult issue because we know we have a problem here. When we have a problem, let us take steps that don't lead us into another problem. We had a debate in front of the Commerce Committee. I was there and had the opportunity to testify before my friend. It had to do with ratings. There was a big debate over whether government should rate these movies and TV shows or whether the industry should undertake it. I will never forget this. One Congressman came up and he said: I can't believe what I just saw on TV.

   Mrs. BOXER. I remember what happened then. This Congressman came over from the other side and testified that he couldn't believe that ``Schindler's List'' was put on TV and that he felt ``Schindler's List'' had obscenity in it. A big debate ensued, because many thought ``Schindler's List'' was one of the best things that was shown on TV, that it taught our young people about the Holocaust. There were some rough scenes in it that were historically accurate. 
   All it proved to me is that the eye of the beholder is so important here. Here was someone saying that was one of the best things you could put on TV to teach our children, and here is somebody else saying it was one of the worst things. 
   Keep government out of these subjective decisions. Give parents the tools. Let them decide if ``Schindler's List'' is right for their children, or any other program. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mrs. BOXER. And he finds out some of the fine print. We had a situation on the floor with the Senator from Idaho. I was on the floor at the time. The Senator from New York said to the Senator from Idaho: With great respect, I think you have a problem in your bill--and he pointed it out. The Senator from Idaho at that point argued vociferously with the Senator from New York, who held his ground and happily everyone reached agreement that in fact what the Senator from New York said was true. 
   But what interests me is one of the loopholes that is not closed. That is this pawnshop loophole. I want to ask my friend from New York a question. Am I right in understanding that under current law, if someone goes back to retrieve a gun in a pawnshop, they must undergo an instant check? 
   Let's say somebody puts his gun in the pawnshop and then goes out and commits a crime with another weapon and they come back to retrieve their gun. It is my understanding there is no instant check on that person. It is further my understanding that people who retrieve their guns from pawnshops are five times as likely to be criminals as those who would go to an ordinary dealer; is that correct?

   Would that not be an accurate description of what the Craig amendment did yesterday, and it is not fixed in this amendment; am I correct in that?

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce legislation to nationally phase-out the use of the fuel oxygenate methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE). My bill provides for a priority phase-out schedule designed to immediately prohibit MTBE use in areas where it is leaking into ground and surface waters, to prevent the spread of MTBE to areas where its use is currently limited or nonexistent, and to set us on a course to removing MTBE in all other areas of the nation. 
   MTBE has been used in the blending of gasoline since the 1970s, but its use increased dramatically following the passage of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990. In regions of the country with particularly poor air quality, including Southern California and Sacramento, the Act required the use of reformulated gasoline. 
   Under the Act, reformulated gasoline must contain 2% oxygenate by weight. 
   Today, about 70% of the gasoline sold in California contains 2% oxygen by weight due to this requirement. While other oxygenates like ethanol may be used to meet this 2% requirement, the ready availability of MTBE and its chemical properties made it the oxygenate of choice among most oil companies. 
   While the oxygenate of choice, however, MTBE is also classified as a possible human carcinogen. Moreover, when MTBE enters groundwater, it moves through the water very fast and very far. Once there, MTBE resists degrading in the environment. We know very little about how long it takes to break down to the point that it becomes harmless. We do know that at even very low levels, MTBE causes water to take on the taste and odor of turpentine--rendering it undrinkable. 
   That is, it makes water smell and taste so bad that people won't drink it. 
   I first became aware of the significance of the threat MTBE posed to drinking water following the discovery that MTBE had contaminated drinking water wells in Santa Monica. Ultimately, Santa Monica was forced to close drinking water wells that supplied approximately half of its drinking water due to that contamination. Clean up of Santa Monica's drinking water supply continues today under the oversight of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) at significant cost. 
   Following that discovery, I held a California field hearing of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, of which I am a member, on the issue of MTBE contamination. Based upon the testimony I received at that hearing, I became convinced that MTBE posed a significant threat to drinking water not only in California, but nationwide. Shortly after the hearing, I wrote what would be one of many letters to the Administrator of EPA urging her to take action to remove this threat to the nation's drinking water supply. 
   While EPA has taken many laudable actions to speed the remediation of MTBE contaminated drinking water, it has been slow to respond to my calls for a nationwide MTBE phase-out. EPA maintains that it lacks the legal authority to phase-out the use of this harmful gasoline additive. 
   In the face of this federal inaction, and since the discovery of MTBE contamination in Santa Monica and my  hearing in California, revelations of MTBE contamination in California and the nation have proliferated. In June 1998, the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory estimated that MTBE is leaking from over 10,000 underground storage tanks in California alone. Potential clean up costs associated with MTBE contamination in my state range between $1 to $2 billion. Reports of MTBE contamination in the northeastern United States are also now becoming more common, and several state legislatures have introduced legislation to phase-out or ban MTBE use. 
   This flurry of activity in the northeastern states follows upon the first state action to prohibit the use of MTBE. Specifically, on March 26, 1999, California Governor Gray Davis provided that MTBE use in California will be prohibited after December 31, 2002. 
   While the action in California and several other states to begin to address the MTBE problem is certainly to be commended, I believe it demonstrates a failure of federal policymakers to design a national solution to what is clearly a national problem. 
   The legislation I introduce today would provide that solution. 
   First, my bill empowers the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to immediately prohibit MTBE use in areas where the additive is leaking into ground or surface waters. In my view, we must swiftly stop the use of MTBE in areas where we know we've got leaking underground storage tanks. That's just common sense. 
   Second, my bill prohibits the use of MTBE after January 1, 2000 in areas around the nation where the use of oxygenates like MTBE is not required by law. It has been recently revealed that oil companies have been adding significant quantities of MTBE to gasoline in the San Francisco area even though oxygenates like MTBE are not required to be used in that area. Notwithstanding California's MTBE phase-out, such MTBE use may legally continue throughout California until the state phase-out deadline of December 31, 2002. 
   As we face an estimated $1 to $2 billion in MTBE clean up costs in California alone, I believe we must swiftly take steps to prevent the spread of MTBE contamination to areas where its use is currently limited and is in no sense required under the law. 
   Third, the bill prohibits MTBE use nationwide after January 1, 2003, and provides for specific binding percentage reductions of MTBE use in the interim. Finally, the bill requires EPA to conduct an environmental and health effects study of ethanol use as a fuel additive. 
   I am hopeful that my House and Senate colleagues can act quickly to ensure the passage of my legislation to provide a nationwide solution to the nationwide problem of MTBE contamination.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Vermont. 
   I rise because I think it is very important to point out to my friend, Senator HATCH from Utah, that what we are trying to do on this side of the aisle, under the leadership of the Senator from Vermont, is put more of a stress on prevention. 
   Here is the point. The good Senator from Utah, working with Senators LEAHY, BIDEN, and SESSIONS, had an excellent amendment that moved more toward prevention. We, on our side of the aisle, support the enforcement part, the tougher penalties part, but we want to see even more of a balance. There is still an imbalance. 
   I say to my friend from Utah, and I know he has had a similar experience or I think that he has, if you talk to law enforcement--and I have so many times in my State--they tell me: Senator, once the kids get into these teenage years, until they are 19, 20, 21, it is too late to turn them away from crime. Do more for prevention. 
   Law enforcement has been the driving force behind my afterschool bill because they understand if the kids get the attention after school, they will not go home, get in trouble, and choose a life of trouble. 
   What the good Senator from Vermont is doing in this amendment, and I hope he will get bipartisan support, is to say, let's stress prevention as much as we do enforcement. He has pointed out quite eloquently, yes, we are talking about a couple of dollars out of the pockets of the average American every year, a couple of dollars to prevent crime from happening in the first place. I can assure you, Mr. President, it is much cheaper. Many have said, and it is a fact, that it costs more to imprison one of our youngsters than it does to send him or her to Harvard for a year.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, to address the issue that Senator HATCH raised, the vast majority of the programs in Senator LEAHY's amendment are proven programs. A couple of them that are new are essentially taking adult programs and applying them to the juveniles in our country. So this is a tried and true amendment. 
   I am very hopeful it will pass. It would put more cops on the street. Senator LEAHY waives the matching requirement if you place a community policeman in a school. This is very important. I think those of you who really want to help our children should vote yes on the Leahy amendment. 
   Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I appreciate the hard work the Senator from Kansas, the Senator from Connecticut, and the Senator from Utah have put into their amendment. I have no problem with looking at all the different causes of violence among our youth. As a matter of fact, it is very much called for. 
   I also believe that anyone in our society who says, I have nothing to do with this, is simply not taking responsibility for something very pervasive in our society. That goes for every one of us, in our private lives as moms, dads, grandmas, and grandpas, in our public lives as Members of the Senate. 
   There is one thing missing from this well-worded amendment. I know the Senator from Kansas is checking on some matters for Members who may have some concerns. What is missing from here as we look at the marketing practices of the entertainment industry--which, as I say, I don't have an objection to looking at that--I don't see anything in here at all that deals with the marketing practices of another industry, a huge industry in our country, and that is the gun industry. 
   Why do I bring that up? We all say that angry kids and guns don't mix. We know we want to keep guns away from children. So it seems to me, as we see more and more kids with weapons, we ought to look at the marketing practices of the gun manufacturers if we are to be fair in this amendment. We should look at everybody if we are truly being fair. 
   Why do I think this is important? Let me give my friend a couple of examples so I am not just being theoretical. I say to my friend from Kansas, the author of the amendment before the Senate, this is taken off the amendment. This is a picture directly from the Internet in the Beretta catalog. They call it their Youth Collection. We can see the bold colors in the gun. What they say in advertising--and I think this is very important--from their Youth Collection:  
   An exciting, bold designer look that is sure to make you stand out in a crowd.  
   I don't know about my friend from Kansas, but I don't know what they mean, ``stand out in a crowd.'' If mom or dad takes them hunting, you ``stand out in a crowd'' with your mom and dad? You already ``stand out in a crowd'' with them. 
   This is from a gun magazine called Guns and Ammo: A young man who looks like he is about 13. It is titled ``Start 'Em Young.'' ``There is no time like the present.'' This young man is not holding a long gun; he is holding a handgun--which we believe is a make-believe gun--holding a handgun in one hand and a bottle of Pepsi in the other hand. 
   If we are going to look at marketing practices, we ought to look at them across the board. 
   Here is another advertisement that will take your breath away. A little boy, who like my grandson's age, about 3 1/2 , is being used in a catalog advertising Browning guns. This child looks like he is about 3 1/2 years old. 
   In the NRA Youth Magazine, it says, ``News for Young Shooters.'' It doesn't say young hunters. ``New youth guns for '97.'' 
   This is an advertisement in the NRA magazine. This is a handgun. The advertisement says, ``The right way to get started in handgunning.'' This is in a youth magazine. 
   The law says you can't buy a handgun from a dealer unless you are 21; at a gun show you can purchase at 18. 
   This is the Youth Magazine, I say to my friend from Kansas, Youth Magazine--below 18--and they advertise a handgun. 
   I could show more examples of marketing practices that look to a lot of Members as if they are going after very, very young people. 
   I understand the rules around here and I have great respect for my friend from Utah. He will second-degree the Senator's amendment with an amendment of his own, and I don't know exactly what it will contain. I hope it will be to expand this to gun manufacturers, expand our study. If it is, I would be delighted. 
   I ask my friend from Kansas if he would accept this amendment, which simply adds a new title, takes the same study and includes a study of marketing practices of the firearms industry toward young people, so that we have a well-balanced amendment before the Senate that deals both with  what the entertainment industry is doing and what the gun manufacturers are doing. I ask my friend from Kansas if he is willing to accept this amendment that simply takes the same study and allows it to be made of the marketing practices of the firearms industry toward juveniles.

   Mrs. BOXER. If I may reclaim my time, because I have limited time, the reason I wanted to find out if my friend would accept it--obviously, he is not going to do it. I am happy to look at how many kids a year die because of knives, but I can tell you now, 4,600 kids a year die of gunshots. It is the leading cause of death among children in my State. It is the second leading cause of death among youngsters nationwide. If you want to look at knives, I am happy to look at knives. You show the numbers. They do not come close. Guns are the No. 1 cause of death in California among kids; No. 2 nationwide. It has overtaken car deaths in my State, and it is about to overtake car deaths nationwide. 
   All I am saying to my friend is this. I appreciate the hard work he has put in on his amendment, but I hope he will consider accepting this amendment. I think it is fair. We are looking at causes of violence, dealing with marketing practices in the entertainment industry. We ought to expand it to include this. 
   I have the numbers: 137 children died of knives in 1996 compared to 4,600 who died of gunshots. If you want to examine the knifing deaths, I am happy to do that, but the magnitude of the problem is not the same. We have the equivalent of one Columbine High School incident every day. I know the Senator from Massachusetts----

   Mrs. BOXER. I thank my friend. I have to say to him, why 
   is it out of the flow of this amendment? I am just taking back my time at this point. I yielded my friend time. He made a statement that my amendment is out of the flow. 
   I thought we were looking at reducing juvenile crime and juvenile death. I thought we were looking at reducing the culture of violence. All I am saying to my friend is, you are going after one industry here. Fine. They better stand up and be counted on this. But when it comes to the gun industry, you cited studies. What other studies? 
   As a matter of fact, if you want to look at the way Congress has treated the gun industry, that is the only industry in the whole country that I know of which is not even regulated by any Federal law, in terms of the Consumer Product Safety Commission, which they are specifically exempted from. I have to say I am disappointed because, in the spirit of bipartisanship, we should make every industry stand up and be counted when it comes to our children. 
   Every day in America there is another Columbine. Every day, 13 children are gunned down. They die. Yes, we need to look at the violent culture, as my friend from Utah has pointed out, and my friend from Kansas. Yes, we need to look at why that culture seems to impact our kids more. 
   I was struck by a comment of Senator LEVIN from Michigan, who pointed out that in the town directly across from Detroit, in Canada, where they get the same videos, the same movies, the same music, there were hardly any gun deaths. He has those exact numbers, something like 300 compared to 19. 
   So there are a lot of factors that we have to deal with, including family lives of our children. Do they have enough to do after school? 
   It is about prevention. Senator KENNEDY has been eloquent on the point. Senator LEAHY has been eloquent on the point, saying: Yes, we want to do even more on prevention. But when we are down to studying an industry, how do you say, I really can't study at this point the marketing practices of the firearm industry? To me, it is amazing that they would advertise a handgun in the NRA youth bulletin when laws in our country today say you have to be 21 to buy a handgun from a dealer, and, at a gun show, 18. But nowhere does it say in our law you can buy a handgun under 18. Yet, in the youth magazine, what does it say? ``The right way to get started handgunning.'' Here is this young man, 13 years old, posing with a handgun replica. ``Start 'em young. There's no time like the present.'' 
   Here is the Beretta, painted in bright colors to attract children, in their youth collection of which they say, ``an exciting bold designer look that is sure to make you stand out in a crowd.'' You know, I think that ought to be investigated. What do they mean? I would love to know what they mean by that: ``An exciting bold designer look that is sure to make you stand out in a crowd.'' Those two shooters at Columbine wanted to stand out in a crowd. 
   So I think if we are going to look at an industry and say we will only look at one and turn our back on the firearms industry and their marketing practice, that is wrong. I am disappointed that my friend from Kansas will not accept this amendment. He has eight cosponsors. I am sure a lot of them would support this amendment. 
   It is my intention to offer this at another time, because I do not feel we should study one industry and bring all our efforts down on one industry while turning our back on another industry which looks to me as if it is going after our kids--really young. A picture of a 3 1/2 -year-old child in one of these advertisements--maybe he is 2 1/2 , maybe he is 4. 
   Let me express my deep disappointment we cannot do this by unanimous consent, and express my desire to offer this amendment, which is basically the same as the one before us, with the FTC looking at the advertising practices of the gun industry. 
   I think not to take this amendment, I say to my friends on the other side of the aisle, is a sad day. It is a sad day because it looks to me as if you want to blame everything on one industry and turn your back on another one that is going after our children. 
   It is not balanced; it is not fair. I hope to offer this amendment, and I hope to get support for it at a later time.  
   Mr. President, I yield back my time to Senator KENNEDY.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from New Jersey for his continued leadership on sensible gun laws. That is what we are talking about here: closing a loophole that is leading to trouble, that is leading to death. We have a chance to close the loophole. That is all the Lautenberg amendment does. 
   Good people go to gun shows but not all gun shows are good. Let me read from an associated press article:  
   Undercover state [this is California] agents found illegal weapons so plentiful at a Los Angeles County gun show that they ran out of money after shopping at a handful of booths. 
   The weapons included rocket launchers and flame throwers, Attorney General Bill Lockyer said....... 
   They were readily available, all sorts of illegal weapons.  
   He goes on to say:  
   I don't know what hunter needs a flame thrower.  
   I have to say to my friend from Idaho, if we followed his leadership--  and the Senator from Illinois has pointed out the flaws in his amendment--we would be saying something we don't say to any other industry. 
   Let me explain what I mean. We have standards for cars. They have to have brakes, they have to have wipers, they have to have seatbelts. But guess what. If you sell them at a ``car show,'' as opposed to a ``car dealership,'' they don't need to meet any of the standards and you can sell a car to someone who hasn't got a license because none of the laws would apply. 
   You could do that with pharmaceuticals. The FDA approves a pharmaceutical and says it has to contain certain elements, that is what they approve, but if you sell it at a ``pharmaceutical show'' you don't have to have any of those elements. 
   We could do the same thing for industry after industry. 
   There are more standards for toy guns in this country than there are for real guns, but even toy guns have to meet certain standards if they are sold at a toy show--the same laws apply. 
   To make the law voluntary, as my friend from Idaho does, makes no sense at all. It exacerbates a problem that is already a serious problem. 
   The Senator from New Jersey is saying people are dying unnecessarily from gun violence. There are people getting guns, getting their hands on guns at gun shows who couldn't do it if they went to a licensed dealer. Why on Earth would anyone in this Senate want to condone that--no background checks at a gun show, nothing? 
   All the Senator from Idaho is saying is make it voluntary. That is not going to fly. The bad people who want to get away with it aren't going to say: Do a background check on me; you might find out I'm a felon. They will say: No, I don't want to comply. 
   I thank my friend, the Senator from New Jersey, for this intelligent amendment. 
   I point out to my colleagues who may be following this debate, and I know we vote our conscience here, 87 percent of the American people support a background check on a gun buyer at a gun show--87 percent of the people; 83 percent support requiring background checks on gun show buyers, including dealers. 
   The bottom line is people want us to take action. The people don't like the fact that thousands of people a year die from gunshot wounds. We can stop it. 
   This is a good amendment. I hope we will support it and defeat the Craig amendment.

   Guess how many applications came in. Another $500 to $600 million on top of the $200 million. We have a very big void to fill. 
   As my friend said, crime happens after school. The FBI has shown that. I think for this bill to be balanced it needs to go to tougher penalties for certain crimes but also to prevention and modest gun control measures. I am looking forward to working with my friend on all these matters.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Utah and the Senator from Vermont for their kindness in allowing me to take the floor at this time. I hope to be succinct in my comments. I feel so strongly about this bill and the opportunity we have to do something good for the American people. 
   I wanted to have the chance to make some general comments on what I hope a good bill will do. I think a good juvenile justice bill would have a good piece for prevention, a good piece for tougher penalties, and a good piece for strong enforcement. If we come out with that balance we will have done a good job. 
   I really think this is a chance to make life better for our children and our families. I am glad it looks like we will have an open debate in order to put forward our ideas. 
   I think we have an emergency on our hands when the majority of parents are worried about the safety of their children at school. I think those of us here, thinking back to the years that we went to elementary school and either junior high or high school, do not have any memory of being fearful. Yet that is the circumstance today, where the majority of parents are now saying they are fearful for their children. 
   I think we have an emergency on our hands when many children tell us they see the kind of hostility and isolation that evidenced itself in Columbine--they see that in their schools. 
   We have an emergency on our hands when 31 percent of teenagers know someone their age who carries a weapon--who carries a weapon, not who just owns a weapon, but who carries a weapon. An article appeared last weekend in the San Diego 
   Union Tribune which reported that 138 out of 150 of the brightest students in this country said they had seen guns at their high school. 
   We have an emergency on our hands when teachers say they do not feel safe. We have an emergency when a million kids are looking for afterschool programs and they cannot get in because there is no room. 
   Let's take a look at when juvenile crime occurs. This is a juvenile justice bill. Let's look at when juvenile crime occurs. This chart shows it very clearly. Juvenile crime spikes up at 3 p.m., and it starts going down after 6 p.m. So you do not need a degree in criminology or child psychology or sociology or any ``ology'' to know that juvenile crime occurs after school lets out. One million of our children are waiting in line for afterschool programs. I will be offering an amendment similar to the one I offered during the budget debate to allow those 1 million children to get into afterschool programs. 
   Again, I want to bring us back. This is a juvenile justice bill. It is no secret juvenile crime occurs after school. I think the first thing we ought to be looking at, what ought to be included in this bill, is a piece on afterschool. I want to give some credit to Senators BIDEN, LEAHY, and HATCH, because in their amendment they will be offering soon they do a little bit for afterschool. In essence, they take the block grant and they set aside 25 percent of it; that is about $115 million. One of the uses local districts can avail themselves of, one of the uses, is afterschool programs. But it is not specifically an afterschool program. So we will be offering that and giving our colleagues a chance to really act on the information we have had for so many years. 
   I know the Senator from Utah understands this very clearly. After school the kids get in trouble. We need to help them. I would like to do even a little more than he has done in his amendment. 
   We have an emergency when schools cannot afford metal detectors. Some of them have them and they are broken. Or they cannot afford community police on their campuses. We have an amendment, of which I am very proud, on this side of the aisle, which will allow us to put more community police in the schools. I think it is about 25,000 additional police would be added to community policing and we would waive the match, the local required match, if people put these community police on school campuses. We know we do not have enough school counselors. We know we do not. 
   By the way, there was a little press conference today with some schoolchildren and one of them had done this cartoon. This is a cartoon of a youngster from an elementary school. It shows a little boy and he has a gun in his hand--very crudely drawn by this young girl--and he is thinking out loud. The little cartoon says, ``I'm going after So-and-So because she tortured me all year, verbally.'' And the little girl is thinking, ``Don't do that. Go to your counselor and talk it out. Go to an adult.'' 
   That is good advice from this youngster. But, unfortunately, in many of our schools we are seeing one counselor for 500 kids, for 1,000 kids, for 1,500 kids. So we ought to do something to change this and change the culture of violence by giving our kids grownups who care about them during the school hours to whom they can take their problems. 
   I agree with the President, there is not one particular 
   thing we can point out and say this is the problem. There are a number of problems in our society. We have to deal with all of them,  and every one of us is responsible. Anytime someone stands up, wherever that person is from, whatever industry, and says, oh, it's not my problem, it's somebody else's problem, I simply lose respect for that person who is saying that. I don't care whether he is from the gun lobby or makes videos; if that person says, I have nothing to do with the problem, I don't give him any credibility, because every one of us has responsibility, including every one of us in this Chamber, in our private lives, as parents, as grandparents, and in our public lives as Senators. 
   Too many children are not getting enough support, love, and guidance from their parents, or from their community. Too many are using drugs and alcohol, too many are seeing violent images on computer and TV and in the culture. A lot of those images affect certain children more than others. We know that. But it has an impact just as everything has an impact, a cumulative impact on our children. 
   Let me be very clear. If those two boys at Columbine High School had knives instead of guns, we would not have seen such devastating results. In Jonesboro, AR, if those two boys had used baseball bats instead of guns, that number of people certainly would not have died. 
   I do not want us to tiptoe around the gun issue. I know it is hard. I know it steps on powerful toes, but we cannot tiptoe around the gun issue. It is not the only cause of the problem; it is one of the causes of the problem. Angry kids and guns add up to death. As a matter of fact, angry people with guns add up to death. 
   I want to show you this chart which gives this issue a sense of reality. Many of us came into politics after the Vietnam war, and we saw this country fall to its knees over that war. It was such a difficult time. We lost 58,168 Americans in the Vietnam war, every one of them a grievous loss, a tragic loss, a loss that can never be replaced for so many families; their potential gone on the battlefield. 
   In an 11-year period, 396,572 Americans have been shot down by guns, every one of those a horrible, deep, tragic loss to a family, to a mother, to a father, to a grandmother, to children. As a matter of fact, every single day in America there is a Columbine High School. Thirteen children are killed every day, 
   an ordinary day. Yet, we tiptoe around the gun issue. 
   We have to deal with it, I say to my colleagues, in a fair way, not saying this is the only problem, but it is one of the problems. 
   People say, oh, in Columbine, there were laws; they just didn't work. 
   Not true. The young woman who transferred two guns to juveniles can stand behind the law. That was legal. I say it should not be legal to give juveniles guns. That is one example of a gun law we ought to pass. 
   Let's look at our laws concerning 18-year-olds in this country. If you are under 18 in this country, you cannot buy cigarettes, you cannot buy beer or wine. If you are under 18, you cannot buy whiskey and you cannot buy a handgun. But if you are under 18, you can buy any one of these long guns--a shotgun, a rifle, an assault weapon. You can. 
   That should not be the case. Oh, if a grandma or a grandpa or a mom or dad wants to give you a hunting rifle, that is OK. But they should have to buy it and supervise you. They should not be able to say: Here's some money, go to the gun show and pick up a long gun, if you are 15 or you are 14 or you are 13 or even 12, 11, 10, 9, 8, 7. I cannot believe people say we do not need any more gun laws when a juvenile can walk in and buy a deadly weapon when they cannot buy cigarettes, beer, whiskey or a handgun, but they can buy these long guns. 
   You say to me, oh, Senator BOXER, there's no interest in youth owning guns and the gun manufacturers don't peddle to the youth. 
   Let me show you an ad. We took this off the Internet. This is a Beretta, a painted gun which is part of their youth collection. I want to tell you what they say in the catalog about their painted gun in their youth collection. Think about what I am saying and what it invokes in your mind. This is what they say in their catalog:  
   An exciting, bold designer look that's sure to make you stand out in a crowd.  
   ``An exciting, bold designer look that's sure to make you stand out in a crowd.'' What crowd are they talking about? It is surely not you and your grandma and your grandpa going out on a family hunting trip. That is not what it means. You decide what it means. 
   Anyone who tells you that the gun manufacturers are not looking at the youth, just take a look at this Internet page, the Beretta youth collection, and read what they say about standing out in a crowd. They are playing to the psychology of a young person: How can they be seen as different, special, more important. 
   There are some things we can do to address this. I want to reiterate a point. In our bill, we say, yes, if a parent--I say this to the Senator from Vermont--if a parent or a grandparent wants to give their child a rifle for hunting, in our amendment we say fine. But we do not want that 15-year-old or 14-year-old walking in and buying these guns or, for that matter, buying a used gun which would be more affordable on the street. 
   We have an opportunity to do something that is relevant to the lives of our people. Our people are looking to us. Yes, I think the Robb-Kennedy amendment is good. I am glad Senator HATCH is looking at it. There are good, important things in there: a national center for school safety and youth violence that will help our children, because it will provide a rapid response to violent shootings. It will establish anonymous tiplines for kids to call in if there is some trouble spotted by a youth but he or she is afraid to come forward and go public with the information. All schools will have safety plans. Senator KENNEDY talked about his contribution to that amendment which deals with conflict resolution and violence prevention, very important issues that we need to take care of. 
   I hope Senator MURRAY will offer her amendment to put more teachers in the schools. If we have these huge class sizes, these kids get lost in the shuffle. If we have smaller class sizes, we can pick out those kids who cause trouble. 
   There are just two more points I wish to make, and then I will yield the floor to my friends. 
   Senator DURBIN is leading an effort in the Appropriations Committee to add some emergency funding for our children: more cops in schools, more metal detectors, more afterschool programs, et cetera. I hope he will be successful. We have billions going for the military. We have billions for other purposes. What is more important than the safety of our children, or certainly as important as these other important needs. 
   I hope we will do some of that. But if we do not, this bill becomes even more important, because it is our only hope for the future. 
   So what we will be seeing is a series of amendments, I assume from both sides of the aisle--I will be working on some of those-- on the gun issue. I have talked about 18-year-olds. Also, I will be working with Senator KOHL on locks, child safety locks that would have to be sold with handguns. We need to reestablish the 3-day Brady waiting period. We need to increase the age at which you can buy an assault weapon to 21. 
   I close on this point. The majority in the Senate has shown a lot of compassion for business. They brought up the Y2K bill. Who will that help? Big business. They showed a lot of compassion for business when they brought the Financial Modernization Act to the floor. Who does that help? Big business--the big banks, the big securities companies, the insurance companies. They want to bring the bankruptcy bill to the floor. Who does that help? The big credit card companies. 
   That is fine. I do not have any problem with that as long as we in the process take care of the consumers, the people who use these services. But the other side has shown tremendous compassion for big business. I am asking them to show equal compassion for our children. 
   This is our chance. We just celebrated Mother's Day, and Father's Day is coming. What a perfect moment for us to seize this time--after the Columbine tragedy, after the Arkansas tragedy--and say enough is enough, and to vote out a well balanced bill that gives us the prevention, gives us the treatment, gives us the enforcement, gives us the tougher penalties,  addresses the gun issue in a sensible way, and we can all come out of here in a bipartisan way feeling that we have done something for our children and our families. 
   Once again, I thank my colleagues. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

If he matches his current record--he took office in 1973--if he does this, he will be only 82 when he casts approximately his 20,000th vote, and he will then be a kid compared to Senator THURMOND, who will be there at the time congratulating him on his 20,000th vote.

   Mrs. BOXER. One more question before I yield to my friend. 
   I find it very interesting that Senators would get up and attack this program as if it were some kind of a giveaway program. These bank presidents have told us that these loans are very profitable. As a matter of fact, I wonder if the Senator is aware, at least in California--and now we do have a tie in because, as you know, Mr. McColl, although headquartered in your fair State, does a lot of business in my fair State--they have told us that they are doing very well with their CRA ratings. As a matter of fact, they are telling us--and I want to know if the Senator was aware of this--that their portfolio of CRA loans--these are loans that never used to be made in the old days--are just as profitable, that portfolio, as their other loans. Is my friend aware of that?

   Mrs. BOXER. I thank my friend, and also my friend from Indiana, because I think the notion that somehow, if you are for CRA, you are for doing something with social value and yet interfering with business is simply not true.  These loans are profitable loans. They are good for the community. It goes back 
   to the old adage: ``If you do good, you do good things, you will do well.'' 
   I hope we will stand together in favor of this program that does good things for people and does well for the banks. 
   I yield back to my friend.

   Mrs. BOXER. I have been a longstanding supporter of financial services modernization and affirmed such support in a letter to Secretary Rubin about two years ago, and last year, as a member of the Banking Committee, I voted in support of H.R. 10--the Financial Services Modernization bill reported out of the Banking Committee with strong bi-partisan support. 
   I believe it is important that our financial services sector adapt to contemporary market conditions, marketplace innovations and to growing financial competition from abroad. Moreover, I understand and appreciate the desire of our financial services industries--banks, securities firms, and insurance firms--to further expand their traditional lines of business. 
   I joined the Banking Committee in 1993 when I was first elected to the Senate, and I proudly served on that Committee until this year. So I realize the process of financial services reform has been long, tedious, and often quite contentious. I also realize that many financial services firms are looking forward to the Senate putting an end to that long process by passing a financial services modernization bill. And I would like to see us pass a good bill--a fair and balanced bill. 
   Nonetheless, it is important to remember that the U.S. already has the best banking system in the world. It is the best capitalized, the most transparent, has the highest accounting standards, is very innovative and its safety and soundness is unsurpassed. 
   Therefore, it is appropriate to ask, ``why is financial services modernization necessary?'' It is necessary because the financial marketplace has changed, brought on by, among other things, a combination of new and innovative products and services, as well as technological advances. 
   Regulators must keep pace with these innovations, and we, as legislators must set the appropriate parameters for this changed financial services marketplace. We cannot leave it up to piecemeal regulation and legislation as, all to often, has been the case. 
   Our goal should be to create a regulatory framework which provides measurable benefits to consumers and businesses, enhances competitiveness of the financial services sector on a global basis, and ensures the continued safety and soundness of our financial institutions. While the bill before us goes a long way toward achieving that goal, unfortunately I believe, it falls short. 
   It falls short, principally in my opinion, because it fails to ensure the continued strength of the Community Reinvestment Act. CRA has been invaluable in helping to assure low and moderate income consumers, communities and small businesses have sufficient access to credit. 
   The Community Reinvestment Act has been important to both urban and rural communities. Every CRA dollar is a loan--it is the leveraging of capital. Over the past seven years or so, approximately $400 billion of community development has been leveraged. It has proven to be an 
   effective tool in my home state of California and in states throughout the country. 
   CRA encourages federally insured financial institutions to help meet the credit needs of the communities in which they do business. As Senator Proxmire said in 1974, ``CRA is intended to establish a system of regulatory incentives to encourage banks and savings institutions to more effectively meet the credit needs of the localities they are chartered to serve, consistent with sound lending practices.'' 
   CRA does not, despite many implications to the contrary, impose any requirement upon banks to make unsound or unsafe loans. CRA does not require banks to engage in risky lending or investments. It does not require banks to make loans outside of the lending criteria they have established. I would suggest, in fact, that given how well banks are doing these days, one would be hard pressed to make a reasonable case that CRA has been detrimental to the bottom line of banks or to their safety and soundness. 
   I think it is wonderful banks are doing so well, I appreciate the contributions they are making to our economy. I remember all too well when banks were not doing so well. Thus, I would not support CRA, or any other requirement, which encouraged banks to engage in unsafe lending practices. 
   My specific concerns as relate to the CRA provisions in this bill are as follows. First, as I understand it, there are no enforcement mechanisms or penalties for failing to maintain a ``satisfactory'' CRA rating. By contrast, the bill passed last year by the Senate Banking Committee required all banks in a holding company structure to have a satisfactory CRA rating as a condition of affiliation, and maintain a satisfactory CRA rating in order to continue to engage in new financial activities. 
   Second, this bill provides for a CRA ``safe harbor.'' Under this provision, all institutions which received at least a satisfactory CRA rating on their most recent examination, and received a satisfactory rating in each of the past 3 years, would be deemed to be in compliance with CRA. Such a safe harbor, I believe, would often effectively eliminate the opportunity for public comment. Banks and thrifts are usually examined every two to three years. CRA performance can change in the interim. 
   Third, S. 900 exempts those banks with less assets of less than $100 million, and those that are not located in metropolitan areas, from CRA. While I think we can all agree that institutions with assets of less than $100 million are small, the amendment would exempt more than 75 percent of rural institutions from CRA requirements--that is almost 40 percent of all U.S. banks and thrifts. Ironically, I would note, it has traditionally been these smaller institutions that have had the worst CRA records. Moreover, the new CRA rules, which went into effect in January 1996, provide a streamlined examination for banks and thrifts with assets less than $250 million. In fact, pursuant to the changes which took effect in 1996, small banks do not have any data collection or reporting requirements. 
   I do not believe the CRA changes envisioned in S. 900 are appropriate, or needed at this time. If there are abuses or specific problems, let's deal with them--let regulators, and, if appropriate, law enforcement deal with them. Such abuses are hurtful to CRA and to those who can potentially benefit from CRA. These abuses, I would suggest however, are extraordinarily rare. On the whole, bankers have found CRA to be an extremely minimal intrusion at most. 
   CRA has not been a problem to most bankers in my home state of California. BankAmerica, Wells Fargo and others have made important CRA commitments in my state. 
   Between 1992 and 1997, BankAmerica made $3 billion in conventional small business loans and lines of credit for less than $50,000. In 1997, it made more than $1 billion in loans and lines of credit for $100,000 or less. And BankAmerica has often noted their CRA loans have performed as well as other more traditional loans made by the bank. These loans have also been profitable for the bank. In fact, Hugh  McColl, the Chairman and CEO of BankAmerica Corp. has said, ``My company supports the Community Reinvestment Act both in spirit and in fact. We have had fun doing it. We've made a business out of it.'' 
   Moreover, in Los Angeles, as a result of CRA, loans to African American owned businesses increased a whopping 171 percent between 1992 and 1997. However, it is important to note that small business owners of every race have obtained credit as a result of CRA-related programs. For example, in San Diego, at least 25 percent of the loans made by local community development organizations were to white business owners. 
   So Mr. President, although I am a enthusiastic supporter of financial services modernization, I cannot support S. 900 if the CRA provisions contained in the bill are maintained. Access to capital and economic development, I believe, will potentially be some of the most important tools available to low and moderate income Americans in the coming century. Without such access to capital, far too many Americans, particularly those in urban and rural areas, will not be able to share in the economic wealth of our remarkably exuberant economy.

    Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I would like to recognize the National Association of Letter Carriers for its efforts to combat hunger in America through its annual national food drive. 
   Each year, on the second Saturday in May, letter carriers in more than 10,000 cities collect canned food along their postal routes to supply local food banks. Last year, over 50 million pounds of food were donated to feed the hungry, and I am confident that 1999's drive will be an even greater success. In just seven years of operation, the National Association of Letter Carrier's national food drive has grown into America's largest one-day food collection effort. 
   To participate, residents in participating communities need only place a can of non-perishable food near their mailbox--their letter carrier does the rest. In addition to making regular pick-ups and deliveries, their letter carrier collects donations and transports them to a nearby postal station. Food is then sorted and distributed to local charities. 
   Mr. President, an estimated 30 million people go hungry every day in America. Food shortages hit children especially hard in the summer months, when school lunches are not available and many charity pantries run out of supplies donated during the Winter holiday season. The Letter Carriers' food drive makes a critical contribution at a time when help is urgently needed. 
   I commend the National Association of Letter Carriers for its leadership in organizing this annual event. The NALC's organizing partners--the United States Postal Service, the AFL-CIO, and the United Way--also deserve our thanks. 
   Finally, Mr. President, I urge each American to leave a can of food by the mailbox on Saturday. Together, we can fight hunger and make a difference in the lives of millions of Americans.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am so pleased that the Senate will stand up for the rights of women and pass S. Res. 68, a resolution condemning the Taliban's treatment of women and girls in Afghanistan. I especially thank Senator BROWNBACK in joining me as the main cosponsor of this resolution. 
   The Taliban is a militia group that now controls between 85-90 percent of Afghanistan. People living under its rule are subjected to an extreme interpretation of Islam practiced nowhere else in the world. It is especially repressive on women living in Afghanistan. 
   Under Taliban rule, women and girls in Afghanistan are denied even the most basic human rights. They cannot work outside the home, attend school, or even wear shoes that make noise when they walk. Women who are in their homes are not allowed to be seen from the street, and houses with female occupants must have their windows painted over. Parents cannot teach their daughters to read, or take their little girls to be treated by male doctors. 
   Women are also forced to wear a full head-to-toe garment called a burqa. This restrictive covering allows only a tiny opening to see and breathe through. I understand that some women may choose to wear a burqa for religious reasons--that should be their right. However, the requirement that women wear a burqa is a clear violation of human rights. And further, the rules surrounding this requirement are frightening. 
   Women found in public who are not wearing a burqa are beaten by Taliban militiamen. If they wear a burqa and their ankles are showing, they are beaten as well. Poor women who cannot afford a burqa are forced to stay at home, preventing them from receiving medical care. 
   The Physicians for Human Rights recently conducted a study of 160 women in Afghanistan and their findings are horrific. 
   The study found that 77 percent of women had poor access to health care in Kabul, while another 20 percent reported no access at all. Of the participants, 81 percent reported a decline in their mental condition; 97 percent met the diagnostic criteria for depression; 42 percent met the diagnostic criteria for post-traumatic stress disorder; and 21 percent reported having suicidal thoughts ``extremely often'' or ``quite often.'' In addition, 53 percent of women described occasions in which they were seriously ill and unable to seek medical care. 
   The resolution passed today calls on the President of the United States to prevent a Taliban-led government of Afghanistan from taking a seat in the United Nations General Assembly, as long as these gross violations of human rights persist. 
   My resolution also urges the Administration not to recognize any government in Afghanistan which does not take actions to achieve the following goals: effective participation of women in all civil, economic, and social life; the right of women to work; the right of women and girls to an education without discrimination and the reopening of schools to women and girls at all levels of education; the freedom of movement of women and girls; equal access of women and girls to health care; equal access of women and girls to humanitarian aid. 
   It is shocking that women and girls in Afghanistan are suffering under these conditions as we approach the 21st century. The United States has an obligation to take the lead in condemning these abuses. 
   I want to thank the majority and minority leaders for allowing this legislation to come to the floor, and I appreciate the support from the many cosponsors of this resolution who are working to end human rights abuses against women in Afghanistan.

   Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Arizona for his indulgence. He has been very patient as Members have debated--many speaking against his resolution. He has been very generous in his attitude toward all Members. I greatly appreciate it. 
   I rise this afternoon to debate the resolution that is before the Senate and to also join with all Americans in rejoicing that the three prisoners of war have been released and have been united with their families. 
   One of these young men, Sgt. Andrew Ramirez, is a constituent of mine from Los Angeles. I spoke with his mother a few days ago before we knew his release was a possibility. I know how she felt. I heard in her voice the terror of the situation. We are all relieved. 
   I say today to all the families, you did the right thing by coming forward, by continuing to look into the cameras when it was difficult for you; yet because you did that, you put the human face on these young men. That was very, very helpful. I thank Jesse Jackson for working to secure the release of these brave soldiers. 
   The irony of the situation is that Milosevic wrongfully abducted these soldiers. Now he allows them to return home, while at the same time he refuses to allow the million Kosovar Albanians who were wrongfully displaced to safely return home. 
   Yes, the three soldiers come home and now we see no move by Milosevic at all, at all, to allow so many decent families to return to their homes. 
   Mr. Milosevic could end this war today. I know some have said, let's take a pause in the bombing, and that may be something that NATO wants to do. It is going to be up to them as they go about deciding the best strategy. But I say to Mr. Milosevic that he can end this war today. He has to agree to do three things. They are very simple. 
   No. 1, pull your army and your special forces out of Kosovo; 
   No. 2, allow for the safe return of Kosovar refugees to what is left of their homes;  
   No. 3, allow for an international peacekeeping force, which includes NATO's participation, to ensure the safe return of the refugees. 
   That is very straightforward. It is very simple in many ways. It takes us back to the days when Kosovo had its autonomy and those people could live in peace. So, yes, we welcome the POWs home with our open arms and open hearts, and we long for the day that Mr. Milosevic will stop this war by allowing the refugees to return home, ensuring a stable situation by allowing an international peacekeeping force into Kosovo. 
   I know the McCain-Biden resolution was written with the aim of achieving those three goals that I outlined, the three steps that Milosevic must take. However I do not support that resolution for the following reasons. I stated this in the Foreign Relations Committee, but I wanted to expand my remarks a little bit today. No. 1, the resolution is too broad and it is too open ended. Specifically, I am very concerned about the clause that says, ``all necessary force and other means.'' I do not believe it was the intention of the Senators to open the door to every weapon known to mankind. But when you read the resolution, there is no clarity on that point. I think it opens the door for Congress to underwrite the use of chemical weapons, biological weapons, and nuclear weapons. 
   In the committee, Senator SMITH entered into a colloquy with Senator BIDEN and he said: Senator, I am worried about this being so all-encompassing that it could include biological, chemical, and nuclear weapons. Senator BIDEN said that was not the intent. We can have a colloquy on the floor to say that is not what we meant; we meant conventional weapons. But a colloquy is not enough for Senators to have, it seems to me, when you are voting on a measure so important. It ought to be clear what we are talking about, and this resolution says, in essence, any and all weapons. That is the first reason I oppose it. It is open ended and too broad. 
   Second, the resolution takes Congress out of the decisionmaking process. In other words, once you pass this sweeping resolution, our job is essentially done; you are handing this over to the President. 
   By the way, I think this President has shown tremendous leadership on this issue. I disagree with my friend from Pennsylvania and my friend from Indiana on their colloquy. If you think it is easy to keep 19 NATO nations together on one track, think again. This is not easy. Some of these nations have an inclination not to go along. I give tremendous credit to President Clinton and to Prime Minister Tony Blair on this matter, because I think they are the ones who have kept NATO focused. 
   I am very pleased with the fact that the President has done something here, but I do not want to take the Congress out of this debate. I think this resolution does that. I think my constituents want me to be included in this every inch of the way. If the President asks us for ground troops, we need to vote on that. If he asks us for other means, we should be able to vote on that. I do not see it as others do, that the Congress really should just say: Any and all force. 
   I support what we are doing. I want to be clear. I want to respond to Senator HAGEL who said those of you who do not support this, essentially you are not courageous and you are not--I don't want to put words in his mouth, but he basically said we are not standing up with courage. I just want to put that into context, because when I voted to support the NATO bombing, I was taking a very strong stand. This is not easy, to see these bombs falling. This is tough. I believe they will bring Milosevic to the table. I do really believe that. So I do not view that vote as just some easy vote. It was a hard vote for me to say use force in this circumstance. So I hope colleagues would not think those of us who do not support them on this want us to leave the scene, to run away. 
   There are three points of view here that are all very legitimate. One that I have heard represented by several of our colleagues is: Do nothing. Do nothing. This is not in the national interest of the United States of America. Do nothing. I do not agree with that. If it is not in the national interest to stop the most god-awful ethnic cleansing since Hitler--if that is not in our national interest, I do not know what is. We are human beings first and foremost. We cannot allow that to stand. So I do not subscribe to those who say: Do nothing, in terms of military force. I just do not think we have the choice here. Milosevic was engaging in this ethnic cleansing. The only difference now is the light is on it and we see it. 
   I also do not agree with those who back this resolution, which is: Any and all necessary force, all kinds of weapons, the President has the ability to do that. I think it goes too far, takes us out. 
   So I am in the middle here. I support the current policy. I do think it is working. I do think we need to be patient. I do know there has been bad weather. I do have faith that the conduct of this war will lead to what we want, an end of the ethnic cleansing. 
   The President has not asked us for this additional language. I am sure any President would welcome it, by the way. But he has not asked us. As a matter of fact, he sent us a letter.

   Mrs. BOXER. What the President said is he is confident we will prevail through airpower, and he says, ``I can assure you that'' if we needed ground forces he would ``fully consult with the Congress'' before he would introduce ground forces into what he called a nonpermissive environment. 
   So, I support what we are doing now. I also want to comment on the remarks of one of our colleagues, who said, why don't we stop horrible things from happening in other parts of the world? I do not subscribe to the theory that if you cannot stop all evil stop no evil. I think you stop it where you can. In this case, because of the President's leadership, there are 19 nations united. This is a mission of NATO. We can stop this evil and we should stop this evil. 
   Let me remark on some of the human rights abuses that are being reported by Human Rights Watch. They conducted 19 separate interviews, which showed that 100 men were summarily executed in the town of Meja on April 27. According to the witnesses, these men were pulled out of convoys headed towards Albania, and executed. Witnesses reported the dead bodies covered an area of ground about 12 feet by 20 feet and were stacked 4 feet high. 
   I ask people to imagine, what does that remind you of; after World War II, when we saw those bodies piled one on top of the other? How my colleagues can say it is not in our national interest to stop this is beyond my capability to understand. 
   Another witness said he fled his town of Sojevo, leaving behind his paralyzed father and elderly mother in their home because they could not get out, and he believed the Serb paramilitary forces would not harm the disabled and the elderly and the helpless. He returned home hours later to find his father shot dead and his mother's body mutilated. How can people say it is not in our national interest to stop that?  
   Violence against women in Kosovo has been reported widely. One woman interviewed by Human Rights Watch reported police held a knife to her 3-year-old son, saying he would be killed if she did not produce money or gold. 
   We know there are several accounts of women being raped by Serb forces in front of their children. I heard a quote on CNN that Milosevic said: ``There are bad things happening in Kosovo, but it's not the military, it's the paramilitary.'' 
   I say to Milosevic: Stop it; you can stop it. The paramilitary, the military, the special police, you control it; you can stop it. You can send three POWs home to us. You never should have taken them in the first place. They were on a peacekeeping mission. You can send three POWs home to us. Let the good people who want nothing more than to live in their homes in Kosovo go home and stop the rape and the torture and the mutilation of old people and sick people. Yes, you admit bad things are happening in Kosovo. You can stop them from happening. 
   I support NATO, and I support the administration. I believe the best way to show that support for the current policy is to table the resolution. If we are asked to do more, I will consider it. I stand on my vote of March 23 when Congress approved that resolution authorizing the President to conduct airstrikes against Milosevic. I believe the Senate should stand behind that vote and continue to support NATO's effort to end the nightmare in Kosovo. 
   Last point. I say to my friend, JOE BIDEN, and to my friend, JOHN MCCAIN, Madam President, they are showing leadership in this resolution. They are putting forward their point of view. It is quite a legitimate point of view. I think the other points of view being expressed are legitimate as well. When the House voted, they sent a very chaotic message to the world: Yes, we will keep sending the money; no, we won't bring home the troops; no, we don't like the bombing; no, we don't want ground forces. It was extremely confusing. 
   The best signal we can send today is a signal that we support NATO. If we table this resolution, that will be my interpretation, that we support NATO today, that we reaffirm our support that was given to NATO in a bipartisan way on March 23. 
   I thank you very much, Madam President, and I yield the floor. 
   Mr. SPECTER addressed the Chair.

    Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I submit today the Prostate Cancer Research Commitment Resolution Act of 1999 along with several of my colleagues, Senators LAUTENBERG, REID, JEFFORDS, SCHUMER, ASHCROFT, MACK, COVERDELL, and HELMS. 
   Prostate cancer is the most diagnosed nonskin cancer in the United States. More than 40 percent of all male cancers and 14 percent of all male cancer-related deaths are due to complications from prostate cancer. In 1998, over 40,000 American men died from prostate cancer, and in 1999, it is expected that this deadly disease will strike another 37,000 men in the United States. 
   I, along with my colleagues, am deeply committed to aiding our medical community in their research efforts to find preventive measures to stem--and eventually eradicate--this disease. 
   Our resolution expresses the sense of the Senate that funding for prostate cancer research should be increased substantially, commensurate with the impact of the disease. Funds should be made available at the National Institutes of Health and at the Department of Defense Prostate Cancer Research Program. We are also encouraging these agencies to prioritize prostate cancer research that is directed toward innovative research projects in order that treatment breakthroughs can be more rapidly offered to patients. 
   Mr. President, this is an important step on behalf of men in the United States who have suffered from prostate cancer. Increasing funds for research would assist the medical community in its efforts to identify preventive measures men can take through prostate cancer screening procedures. 
   I am pleased to offer this resolution today and I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.

   Mrs. BOXER. This is for a question. I appreciate the Democratic leader taking to the floor. I want to use this opportunity to ask him a particular question. 
   The Democratic leader and the Democratic caucus have an agenda of issues. The Republican leader and the Republican caucus, they have their agenda of issues. This is good. This shows the people our vision for this country. One of the things that occurred when the Senator from Massachusetts offered the minimum wage increase as an amendment here, or asked the bill be recommitted so we could vote for it, was that the majority leader was very unhappy with this and said something to the effect--I am not quoting verbatim, but something to the effect--he even used the word ``tragedy''--it was a tragedy this was occurring on this bill and that this is not a time for one party to put forward its political agenda. 
   I ask my leader this question: Isn't it totally appropriate that each side here, Republicans and Democrats, has a chance to put forward their political agenda? The Senator from New York talked about his race. I had a race that was very difficult. I can assure my friends on both sides of the aisle, it was based on real issues. It was not some theoretical race. It was about the minimum wage, it was about the Patients' Bill of Rights, it was about equal pay for equal work, it was about the environment, yes, and schools and education. 
   So the question is, I would love to ask my leader what he thinks about our agenda, whether it is pressing? I think the majority leader said this bill is timely. It is; that is true. But is our agenda not timely as well?

   Mrs. BOXER. And I am proud that I was able to take that time to do it, because by my presence I wanted to show the support I feel for what he is trying to do. I am a person who represents the Silicon Valley, the high-tech people. I want to solve the Y2K problem. I know my friend is a leader on technology in his State. 
   We want to do the right thing. I have praise for his colleague, Senator KERRY, who I think is doing a terrific job, working to come up with a solution some of us would prefer and, by the way, the administration prefers. 
   I want to pick up on this notion of time sensitive, because it is time sensitive that we do this. It doesn't have to be done today or next week, but it is time sensitive. Certainly, we have to do it in time to resolve the problem. 
   But there are a lot of things that are time sensitive. Isn't it time sensitive when a family can't pay the bill? Isn't it time sensitive when, as the Senator says, a woman can't afford to take a Greyhound bus to see her children? Isn't it time sensitive that under current law a 12-year-old can walk into a gun show and buy, essentially, a semiautomatic assault weapon? There are a lot of things that are time sensitive. 
   In many ways, it is as if the majority leader has the corner on what is time sensitive. As my friend says, it depends on who you talk to. 
   Frankly, the people I am talking to must be similar to the people you are talking to. These are bread-and-butter issues. It is safety in schools. It is a Patients' Bill of Rights, the quality of health care, many, many issues, Medicare, Social Security, that we want to take up, in addition to the business issues that the majority leader wants to take up. 
   I ask my friend, isn't time sensitive a term that we could apply to all of the issues that are on the agenda of the Democrats here in the Senate under the leadership of Leader DASCHLE?

    Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today I want to recognize the First Unitarian Universalist Church of San Diego as it celebrates 125 years of religious freedom. The First Unitarian Universalist Church of San Diego enjoys a rich history in San Diego. Founded in 1873, the Church has continued to grow into a diverse community of over 3,000 members with differing beliefs yet shared values. 
   The First Unitarian Universalist Church of San Diego is an important part of the spiritual lives of thousands of San Diegans. In 1890, founder Lydia Horton helped to pioneer women's rights through the Church. Today, it continues that tradition of activism by working for environmental protection, gay and lesbian rights, and women's equality. In the local community, the Church is fighting discrimination and illiteracy, building schools in underserved neighborhoods, and teaching San Diego's children the value of community involvement. 
   The Church encourages members of its congregation to develop their own religious wisdoms, truthful to themselves and respectful of others. 
   For thriving 125 years in San Diego, I salute the First Unitarian Universalist Church of San Diego and wish them many successful years ahead.

   Mrs. BOXER. I thank my friend from Illinois for putting together this very important piece of legislation which has a number of fine ideas to protect our children. I associate myself with the Senator's remarks. 
   While we deal with the computer problem, we have essentially not been able to offer this bill today. It is hard for me to believe that. The majority leader said it would not be right to deal with this because we are still coping with the sorrow of Littleton, CO. The best thing we can do in the name of those children is to do something to stop this from happening again. 
   I had a question for my friend, because I want his reaction, his comment to this. In the 11 years of the Vietnam war, we lost 58,000 Americans, a tragedy that brought this country to its knees. Every institution was questioned. The country has never been the same. We are just getting over it. 
   In the last 11 years, I say to my friend, 400,000 people have been killed in this country by firearms. Let me repeat that: 58,000 killed in the 11 years of the Vietnam war; 400,000 killed in the streets of this country. That doesn't even count three times the number of people who wind up in hospitals, nursing wounds that will be with them for the rest of their life. That doesn't even put a dollar figure on a couple billion of dollars a year to pay for the wounds to those people. Does my friend think there has to be some outrage here? 
   The people in this country are looking for leadership. Our Chaplain led us in the most magnificent prayer I have ever heard him give, and he gives good prayers. I have to say to my friend, I have been praying for too many people who were gunned down, including one of my son's best friends who did nothing more than visit his wife in her law  firm, when a man walked in with a TEC-9 --the same gun that was used by these kids--and mowed him down as he threw himself over his wife to save her life, which he did. He died. 
   Prayers are very important right now. We turn to God at these moments, but we also have to turn to ourselves. What the Senator is saying is, it is time for this Senate to do something about this problem. 
   I would like to get his reaction to those numbers I put out here. Again, I thank him for this opportunity to comment on his legislation.

   Mrs. BOXER. I want to pick up on that point because there is a gun lobby. We all see it, we all know it, there are a lot of bucks behind it. But there is another lobby out there, the people, and the people want us to do sensible measures to protect our children. 
   I want to make one last point to my colleague, and that is, in my home State of California, the largest State in the Union by far--34 million people--the No. 1 cause of death among children from the minute they are born until they are 18, the No. 1 cause of death is gunshots--No. 1 cause of death. 
   If we had a disease that was the No. 1 cause of death, we would be working on this floor feverishly until we addressed that disease. This is a disease. 
   I have to say to my friend, I watched him take on the tobacco lobby and win. There is not a time I do not get on an airplane and realize I do not have to smell that smoke and have that in my lungs that I don't think of him and his courage in that matter. When he came over here, I just knew reinforcements were coming for some of these tough issues, and this is one of them. 
   This is a tough one, but that is what we are here for. It is very easy to vote for the easy bills. It is easy to vote for ``Children's Appreciation Day.'' It is easy to do that. It is a 
   little tougher when you take on the gun lobby. 
   I hope we are judged by this. My experience is that people respect you, even if they might not agree with you, if you have the guts to do something about a problem. 
   I say to my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, please join with us. Some of these issues are so easy for you to vote for. For example, one of them you have in here says if a local district has a proposal in for more cops on the beat, waive the matching fund if the community police are assigned to the schools. That is one that does not even touch a gun. But today we are told by the majority leader that he believes it would be unseemly to act. That is his view. I respect it. I don't think it is unseemly to act in the wake of this tragedy. I think people want us to act in the wake of this tragedy. 
   Thank you. I yield back to my colleague.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, we don't have a lockbox for Social Security before the Senate. We should be clear; this lockbox as it pertains to Social Security has no lock; it has no box. The fact is, there is a huge, giant crack in the box that says, ``Exception: Social Security reform.'' 
   We have heard it before from the other side of the aisle: Privatization of Social Security. That is another way to say end Social Security as we know it. 
   My mother used to say, just because someone says he is your friend does not mean he is your friend. Listen to who is speaking. Know who the true friends of Social Security are.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, each year on April 24 many of us in Congress pause to remember the tragedy of the Armenian Genocide. On that date in 1915, more than 200 Armenian religious, political and intellectual leaders were arrested in Constantinople--now Istanbul--and killed, marking the beginning of an organized campaign to eliminate the Armenian presence from the Ottoman Empire. This brutal campaign would result in the massacre of a million and a half Armenian men, women and children. 
   Thousands of Armenians were subjected to torture, deportation, slavery and murder. More than 500,000 were removed from their homes and sent on forced death marches through the deserts of Syria. This dark time is among the saddest chapters in the history of man. 
   But Armenians are strong people and their dream of freedom did not die. More than seventy years after the genocide, the new Republic of Armenia was born as the Soviet Union crumbled. Today, we pay tribute to the courage and strength of a people who would not know defeat. 
   Yet, independence has not meant an end to their struggle. There are still those who question the reality of the Armenian slaughter. There are those who have failed to recognize its very existence. We must not allow the horror of the Armenian genocide to be either diminished or denied. 
   Genocide is the worst of all crimes against humanity. As indications of genocide arise in Kosovo, it is especially important to remember those who lost their lives in the first genocide of this century. We must never forget the victims of the Armenian Genocide.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, in 1969, American astronauts heading for the first walk on the moon sent back breathtaking pictures of the Earth. Later that year, Senator Gaylord Nelson called on teachers and students to hold a national teach-in on environmental issues. 
   The two events were closely related. The NASA photos gave everyone on Earth an inescapable image of our planet as one world, a tiny ``blue ball'' floating in the vastness of space. Along with Senator Nelson's call to action, it helped galvanize a growing consciousness of the Earth's fragile environment and how it was affected by human activity. 
   Millions of people answered Gaylord Nelson's call. On April 22, 1970, over 20 million Americans--including students at 10,000 public schools and a thousand colleges--gathered to express their concern about environmental issues. ``Earth Day'' was born. 
   Congress responded quickly by establishing the Environmental Protection Agency and enacting three sweeping laws that laid the cornerstone for the environmental protections we enjoy today: the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, and the National Environmental Policy Act. 
   The first Earth Day and its aftermath were a great success. On Earth Day 1999, we can celebrate the fact that the air we breathe, the water we drink, and our oceans, rivers, and streams are cleaner now than when Earth Day was first celebrated. In the past three decades, we have banned lead in gasoline. We banned DDT. We reduced toxic air emissions. We established strong public health standards for drinking water. We eliminated direct dumping of sewage into our oceans, rivers, lakes, and streams. 
   We have made great progress in providing a safer and healthier environment for ourselves and our children. But we still have a long way to go, especially where children are concerned. Most of our environmental standards are designed to protect adults rather than children. In most cases, we haven't even done the tests that would allow us to measure how harmful substances affect our children. And, perhaps most surprisingly, in the face of that uncertainty, we don't presume that harmful substances may present special dangers to our children and adopt a more protective standard. 
   In effect, our environmental laws assume that what we don't know about harmful substances won't hurt our children. 
   That is why I wrote my Children's Environmental Protection Act, or CEPA. CEPA would child-proof our environmental laws. It would require the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to set environmental standards to protect children. And, most importantly, if there is no specific data that would allow EPA to measure the dangers to children, it requires EPA to set a more protective standard to take that lack of information into account. 
   As we strive to give our children a safer environment, we must also consider the natural legacy we hope to leave them. Along with clean air and water, we need to preserve wild places and wide-open spaces for future generations to enjoy. We need to preserve historic sites, conserve farmland, and maintain public parks. 
   Earlier this year, Congressman GEORGE MILLER and I introduced sweeping legislation in the Senate and the House of Representatives to protect America's historic and natural heritage. The Permanent Protection for America's Resources 2000 Act--or Resources 2000--sets aside $2.3 billion annually in offshore oil and gas drilling revenues to create a sustainable source of funding to acquire and maintain public lands, expand urban recreation opportunities, and protect the Nation's marine, wildlife, and historic resources. 
   To mention just one example, Resources 2000 would mandate full funding of the Land and Water Conservation Fund. In 1965, Congress established this Fund, which was to receive $900 million a year from Federal oil revenues for acquisition of sensitive lands and wetlands. The good news is that Fund has collected over $21 billion since 1965. The bad news is that only $9 billion of this amount has been spent on its intended uses. More than $12 billion has been shifted into other Federal accounts. Resources 2000 would fund the Land and Water Conservation Fund at $900 million per year, the full level authorized by Congress. 
   On Earth Day 1999, I ask my colleagues once again to answer Gaylord Nelson's noble call to action. Let us enact an agenda that will sustain both a healthy economy and a healthy environment. Let us rededicate ourselves to the principles of Earth Day and do all we can to heal, protect, and honor the Earth. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today we are faced again with an tragedy in one of America's schools. There are many things that schools are and could be doing to prevent violence--and many ways the federal government could help. But, today, I am going to speak to just one of them. 
   Under the COPS program--President Clinton's initiative to put 100,000 new police officers on our streets--local governments are required to provide 25 percent of the funding. But, the Attorney General has the authority to waive the local matching requirement for any reason. 
   Last summer, I called on the Justice Department to establish a blanket waiver policy for any local community that wanted to place a law enforcement officer in a public school. To its credit, the Department has done so in some cases, and it says it will continue to do so on a case-by-case basis. 
   But, Mr. President, that is not good enough. We need to tell our local communities that the local match will be waived, period, for any new police officer hired to be in the schools. I have again called on the Administration to establish such a waiver policy--and to tell our local communities about it. Just in case, however, I am also introducing legislation today--the COPS in Schools Act--to require a waiver. 
   I am not advocating putting police officers in the schools just to patrol. Nor do I want people to think our schools are or should be jails or combat zones. Police officers in schools are important to work with school staff to develop anti-crime policies on campus, to implement procedures to ensure a safer school environment, and to reassure parents that a police officer is there to deal with those students that might cause problems. 
   Children in public schools have a right to be safe, and it is our obligation to ensure their safety. It is as fundamental as the right to a free public education. Let's not wait for yet another tragedy to get adequate protection for America's school children. My bill is a small step, and it is not the only step we need to take. But, it can help to reduce the chance of more bloodshed at yet another school.

   Mrs. BOXER. Thank you very much. 
   Madam President, I ask for as much time as I might consume--not expecting to consume more than about 5 or 10 minutes. 
   Madam President, this is a good day for the Senate. I am very proud to be a cosponsor of S. 531, and I want to thank my colleagues, Senators ABRAHAM, LEVIN, SESSIONS, KENNEDY and HARKIN, for working on this important and historic legislation and making sure that it was brought to the floor of the Senate. 
   Today I expect that we will move forward unanimously--this is my expectation--in the effort to award Rosa Parks a Congressional Gold Medal which will celebrate her leadership to ensure that all of us are treated equally in this country, the greatest of all countries in the world, the United States of America. 
   I urge the House to move forward with their bill. I understand they have many, many cosponsors, so we ought to take care of this soon. 
   The last time I saw Rosa Parks, she was getting on in years, just as we all do. It would be important to allow her this one more reward for her bravery, for her courage, and recognize that she is an inspiration to every single one of us regardless of our race or religion, regardless of what we look like, regardless of whether we have a disability or not. We all find ourselves in the situation where we are not treated equally. And for ensuring that African Americans will be treated equally, Rosa Parks took a giant step forward for all of us. 
   I shudder to think of where our country would be were it not for the pioneers in the civil rights movement. We have seen in the world and we see every day what happens when people turn on people for no reason other than the status of their birth. It makes no sense. It goes against God. But it happens. 
   For us to take time out particularly now to honor Rosa Parks is very, very fitting. Where would we have been as a society if Mrs. Parks had agreed when the bus driver turned around, and said, ``You get up and give your seat'' to a white person on December 1, 1955? We don't have to speculate, because Rosa Parks had the courage to say no. 
   At the time she was 42 years old. She was coming back from work. She was tired. She worked hard, and she thought to herself--I am sure because I am sure she had thought it many times--``Am I worth so little as a human being that I can't have the dignity to have a seat on a bus?'' 
   Senator ABRAHAM was talking about the first time he heard about Rosa Parks. We all have our experiences when we are in the presence of greatness and how it feels. It is very humbling to meet someone like that. She could have been beaten, injured, or killed for a very simple premise that she had an equal right to sit on a bus. 
   When I was a little girl--and I will not give away how old I was--I was in a southern State where my mother was recuperating from an illness. I was very unaware of any of these laws that said black people have to go on the back of the bus. 
   I didn't know anything about it. I was young. I was having fun. I found myself in a situation with my mother in a bus. And I was sitting down kind of towards the front, about the middle of the bus. An elderly woman came in who happened to be African American. She was carrying a lot of packages. She was frail. I did what I was always taught to do. I stood up. I said, ``Here, ma'am. Please sit down.'' My mother was sitting next to me on the bus. She let me do this. She knew. And this woman said, ``No, thank you.'' I didn't understand. 
   I said, ``No. Really. Please sit down. I want you to sit down.'' She said, ``No. No, thank you.'' And she proceeded down. And my mother told me. She leaned over, and she said, ``She can't sit there.'' I said, ``Why?'' ``Because she is minority, she can't sit there.'' 
   I didn't know quite what to do. I mean I was not quite a teen. But I knew this was absolutely wrong because of everything that I was taught as a child in my loving family. 
   I just said to my mother, ``Well, I am not going to sit down. I will just stand up.'' I went toward the back and held on and stood up, and for whatever it was worth--nothing, probably, but to me at least what I did was not totally helpless. It occurred to me as a youngster, this makes no sense at all. 
   The thought that it took Rosa Parks to turn it around is amazing to me. It shows you how institutions of discrimination are so inculcated in society that it takes that kind of bravery to turn it around. 
   What is the message of all of this when we give Rosa Parks this medal? It is, of course, to remember these times, because if we don't remember the past, we are bound to repeat it. Everybody said that it is true. But it is also a message to our young people, and to all of us who live pretty good lives--that we should have a little bit of courage in our lives, that when we see something wrong, if we hear something that is offensive, that is hurtful, it is real easy to turn the other way. And we hear it all the time. We always say, ``Well, I don't want to really not be liked by everyone. I don't want to say anything. They will think I am `politically correct'.'' I hate that term, because I don't get that term. It is either right or it is wrong. It is not ``politically'' anything. It is right or it is wrong. If it is wrong, we need to do something. We may not have the courage of Rosa Parks. Not all of us are born with that. But there are things that we can do. 
   Mrs. Parks' quiet strength and defiance helped commence one of the most profound social movements in American history. Imagine just saying, ``No. I will not give up. I have a right to be treated equally.'' She helped precipitate the Civil Rights Act of 1964. It took a long time. But we came around.  
   That is why this country is so great, because we do the right thing. 
   There she was, a woman of 42 years old, well respected, and had a lot to lose by acting out in this way. But she did it. 
   She also refused to take ``Black Only'' escalators, and often avoided riding the bus home from work because of the constant harassment and the segregated seating arrangement. 
   Finally, she acted. Her arrest was a call to action for the African American residents in Montgomery, AL, who were determined to fight segregation and win. 
   That boycott lasted 382 days, and it involved 42,000 boycotters. It cost the bus company a lot of profit. 
   Then, in 1956, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the Montgomery segregation law was illegal and ordered the desegregation of buses. 
   That was the first of many victories for those in the civil rights movement. 
   When you see Mrs. Parks, you will see a fragile person. You look in her eyes, and you try to imagine what it was like for her to do what she did. But you see a strength in those eyes. She kept the community glued together for the common goal of equality, and she changed this Nation for the better forever. 
   This is what she said when someone asked her how she would like to be known. She said, ``I would like to be known as a person who is concerned about freedom and equality and justice and prosperity for all people.'' 
   Her actions made sure that this Nation does offer freedom, equality, justice, and prosperity to all people if they work hard for it. 
   Our courts ensure that people are free from discrimination. When we see it here, we cry out about it with one voice, whether it is against people for the color of their skin, their sexual orientation, their disability, or their religion. It is all part of what it means to be an American, it seems to me, to fight for equality for all our people. That is what makes us a better country. It makes us a more prosperous nation. 
   In closing, I will read part of the preamble to the Constitution. The great thing about our country is we don't put our Constitution on a back shelf. We try to make it real. There are a lot of nations in the world that have good constitutions but they don't enforce them.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I thank my chairman, Senator DOMENICI, and my ranking member, Senator LAUTENBERG, for yielding me 10 minutes of time. 
   Mr. President, I have served on the Budget Committee since I came to the Senate. That was almost 7 years ago. In the House I served for the maximum period allowable on the House Budget Committee, 6 years. So I have seen budgets come; I have seen budgets go. I have seen good ones, bad ones, middle-of-the-road ones. And I have to say that my heart is heavy as I look at this budget. My heart is heavy because I think it is not a good roadmap for our future. 
   I say that because I think this budget fixates on tax cuts to the wealthy, to the exclusion of other important critical priorities such as Social Security, Medicare solvency, and the environment. Under this proposal, virtually all of the onbudget surplus would be used for tax cuts. Tax cuts are good and I certainly do support targeted tax cuts to people who need it, such as the kind of program we unveiled yesterday at the White House with the President, the USA accounts, the Universal Savings Accounts that will go to people with $100,000 a year and less, and give them incentive to save by having matching funds from the Federal Government. It will make life good for our people. That is the kind of tax cut we ought to be talking about. 
   But that is not an across-the-board tax cut that we hear talked about. And my friend from New Mexico says it is premature to criticize the tax cut portion of this; we don't know what it will look like. 
   I have listened to Congressman KASICH and others wax eloquent about the importance of an across-the-board cut, and we know what that means. It will mean $99 back for most of the people earning approximately $40,000 a year or less. But for those in the very high brackets, those who earn $800,000, we are talking about $20,000 a year back. 
   Mr. President, $20,000 back to some who earn more than $300,000, the top 1 percent, is that something that we can truly say is going to bring the American dream to the people who do not have it? I don't get it. That is more than people make on a minimum wage, who sweat and toil every day--at the minimum wage. And we have had great objection every time we tried to raise the minimum wage. 
   I don't even get into the people who make $1 million a year. High-wage earners are good people. They have worked hard. But I don't find when I talk to them that they are saying to me, ``Senator, you have to give us more money back.'' They are doing well. They are doing well in the stock market. They understand that this country does well when you bring everyone along. 
   So I have a problem. 
   Let me give you another clue as to why I believe these tax cuts will go to those at the very, very top of the ladder. If you look carefully in this budget proposal and they talk about taxes, they go out of their way to mention cuts in estate taxes--taxes that are paid when someone dies. Mr. President, almost ninety-nine percent of the people in this country will never have to pay an estate tax. In other words, we have exempted much income from the estate tax. Here we see the Republican majority fighting again for the top 1 percent of income earners. 
   Mr. President, I offered a very simple amendment in the committee. Do you know what it said? If there are going to be tax cuts, the substantial benefit should go to the first 90 percent of income earners. The Republicans didn't want to vote on that. As a matter of fact, my chairman, whom I respect and like and admire, said, you know, last year that was a good idea; this year it is not a good idea. They wouldn't take that. They substituted some other language. Then when we got to the floor of the Senate, guess what. They didn't want to vote on it. They accepted it only to drop it in the conference. 
   So this budget fixates on tax breaks for the people who do not need them.  And even bipartisan votes were dropped in the conference. It is hard for me to understand how this is a good roadmap for our future. Education, yes there is a good increase needed in education. But every single amendment that was moved forward, such as the one from our ranking member on school modernization, was dropped in the conference. 
   My language on after school, which we know works for our children--and we have so many local districts that want that program--was dropped in the conference. Why? The new thing: We don't want to tell local districts what to do. Mr. President, these programs don't tell local districts what to do. We simply make funding available if they believe after school is a priority, if they believe school modernization is a priority, if they believe putting more teachers in the classroom is a priority. 
   The new words are ``flexibility'' and ``accountability.'' How is it holding anyone accountable if you give them money and you don't even tell them you think they ought to look at after school, or you think they ought to look at lowering the number of children in the classroom? We were elected because we have views on these subject matters, not just to simply write a blank check and say, ``Oh, take the money. We don't care.'' 
   Do with it what you will: Put a new carpet in the administrator's office, have him hire a new assistant, put a shower in his office. I don't think that is the way we ought to legislate. We ran on these issues. We understand them. If we don't, we don't belong here. 
   I am not going to give a blank check to some school administrator. I am going to say, look, this is what we have available for you if you feel these are your priorities. Do Members know who set that standard, that kind of model? Dwight David Eisenhower, Republican President in the 1950s who authored the National Defense Education Act, who said there is a shortage of math teachers and science teachers; the Federal Government will help you pay to train those teachers--a Republican President. He didn't say, ``Here, take the money, we don't care what you use it for.'' He said there is a national problem here, let's address it. 
   We know there is a national problem, as the Senator from New Jersey knows, fixing up the schools. We know there is a national problem, no afterschool programs, our kids get in trouble. We know there is a national problem, too many children in the classroom. We simply try to put some language in and it gets dropped in the conference. 
   Yes, my chairman is right: There is a huge difference between Democrats and Republicans. More and more I realize this. All you need to do is look at this budget to find it. They don't save Social Security. They put it in a lockbox for 1 year. They have language that mandates that the Social Security surplus be used only for the payment of Social Security benefits, retirement security, or to reduce the Federal debt. 
   What does retirement security mean? It could mean anything. You could argue you give a tax cut to someone earning over $300,000, that will help him with his retirement. Not only that, if we want to break out of the lockbox, it looks to me like they only need 51 votes to do it. They don't save Social Security. They do nothing for Medicare. 
   I was surprised to hear my chairman say, ``Without doing anything, the economy is good, Medicare is doing great.'' Medicare needs attention. We are living longer--that is the good news; the bad news is there are strains on Medicare. We should have put money into that program. 
   My chairman was right, we never offered a Democratic alternative budget. We had amendments on every one of these issues. My ranking member offered them on every one of these issues. We know where we stand. We said we want Medicare funding from the surplus put into a lockbox, too, because we think Medicare, as well as Social Security, are safety net issues that need to be addressed. 
   The point is they don't do in this budget what they should do for Social Security and Medicare. They don't do in this budget what they should do for working men and women. They don't do anything for the environment. 
   Senator CHAFEE, a Republican Senator, had his language dropped. Yes, they put $200 million in from one account to another but the language that directing that the money be used for land and water conservation stateside spending was dropped. There is no instruction here. 
   Senator JOHNSON, who will be speaking shortly, and I worked together on a very important amendment to set up mandatory spending for the environment, for a land and water conservation fund, for the purchase of open space. It was bipartisan, adopted in the committee and was dropped in the conference. 
   I point out Senator MURKOWSKI has a bill on this matter, I have a bill on this matter, several other Republicans and Democrats have bills on this matter. We were simply making room for the environment in this budget and it is gone. This is a roadmap that I do not think is a good roadmap for America today. I am very sorry to stand here and say that because I believed we had an 
   opportunity to do some very good things because we are on such strong fiscal ground. We had a chance to do some important things. We are going to see huge cuts in domestic spending as these numbers go over to appropriations. They are hidden in this budget right now, but as soon as you get over to appropriations it is going to be very, very difficult. There will be cuts in domestic priorities. 
   I will vote against this budget. We had an opportunity to work together; we didn't do it. We didn't save Social Security, we didn't save Medicare, we didn't talk about the real needs in education, we turned our back on the environment. This is a budget that I do not believe the American people will support. 
   I don't hear the American people saying give tax breaks to the people who earn over $300,000, $500,000 or $1 million a year. I don't hear them saying that. Do you know what I hear them saying--keep up fiscal responsibility and give help to the people who really need that help so they can climb up that economic ladder and this country can truly be all it can be. 
   I yield back my time to Senator LAUTENBERG.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I just wanted to make a brief statement in support of this move to help our service men and women and to point out that I tried to amend the Senate bill with a very straightforward sense of the Senate which just said we should ask the Pentagon to ensure, if there are parents of minor children called up and both are sent to combat, that they do everything in their power to ensure that one of those parents is not actually in combat. 
   Unfortunately, as the Senator from Georgia said, there was objection for some reason to this approach. I just want to say again, I do not understand that. We passed something very similar during the gulf war. We care about the tax burden of our men and women in uniform, and we should. How about caring about their families, their children? 
   Many of us have seen ``Saving Private Ryan,'' or know the story. I cannot understand why we could not simply amend the Senate version of this bill with this very simple sense of the Senate asking the Pentagon to do what they could to ensure a mother and father were not sent into combat leaving behind a small child. 
   Having said that, I hope I can bring that up in the future as a freestanding measure, and I certainly do support the House bill that is coming over to give our people relief. They deserve it and they also deserve protection for their children, should a husband and wife be called into combat. 
   Mr. President, I will not object to us yielding back the time.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise in support of the military tax-filing fairness bill that passed the Senate earlier today. This is an important signal of support to send to our troops in the Balkans as they fight against the forces of ethnic cleansing, mass murder, and genocide. All Americans should be proud of the dedication and professionalism shown by our military personnel in the ongoing NATO operation. 
   While I am very pleased that we were able to pass this legislation, I am disappointed that I was unable to offer an amendment that would call on Secretary Cohen to do everything in his power to ensure that both parents in dual military couples are not deployed into a combat area. 
   As the number of United States personnel slated for the Balkans increases--and as there is an increased possibility of a Reserve call-up--I am concerned that situations may arise where children will have to watch both of their parents deployed in combat. It is difficult enough for children to watch one parent go off to war. It is unacceptable that they should have to see both of their parents put in harm's way. 
   I hope that we will have the opportunity to discuss this matter further  and to come up with a solution that protects our children while maintaining our military effectiveness.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, every day, millions of working parents are faced with the dilemma of finding constructive activities for their school-aged children to become involved in during the after school hours. These parents know that, when unsupervised, the likelihood of their child becoming involved with drugs, alcohol or criminal activity is increased. In fact, juvenile crime peaks during the hours of 3 p.m. and 6 p.m.--after school. 
   That is why I am introducing a bill to help assuage the concerns of parents, law enforcement and communities to help develop edifying activities for youth during the after school hours. The After School Education and Anti-Crime Act of 1999 will help give our children safe, productive places to go after the school bell rings, which is what ninety-two percent of all Americans have indicated they strongly support. 
   Not only do after school programs provide children with activities and parents with relief, they also help law enforcement officials connect with their communities and help them reduce incidences of juvenile crime. Several law enforcement organizations have expressed their support of my proposal and for after school programs, including the National Association of Police Athletic and Activity Leagues (PALS), Fight Crime Invest in Kids, National Sheriffs Association, Major Cities' Police Chiefs and other law enforcement representing California, Illinois, Texas, Arizona, Maine and Rhode Island. 
   This legislation would authorize $600 million in funding for after-school programs. These programs, as developed by communities, will offer positive alternatives in the after school hours, such as mentoring, academic assistance, recreation, technology and job skills training, and drug, alcohol, and gang prevention programs. 
   If passed, the funding in this bill would enable an estimated 1.1 million children each year to participate in after school programs. The demand for after school programs is very high. Last year alone, nearly 2,000 school districts applied for after school federal assistance--of that, only 287 grants were awarded. 
   We have the opportunity in the 106th Congress to answer the call of communities all across America that understand the importance of--and need for--after school programs for kindergarten, elementary and secondary school students. After school programs are anti-crime, pro-education, pro-community, and make common sense.

   Mrs. BOXER. Reserving the right to object, and I do not plan to object, I want to have an opportunity to let the Senate know I have been trying to work with my friends to get a very straightforward sense of the Senate attached to the Senate bill that would simply say that the armed services would do everything in their power to ensure that where there is a child of a military couple, that the husband and wife are not deployed into a combat zone. This is something that we have done in the past--during the gulf war--after we found out that, indeed, we did have a mom and dad in a combat zone together. I think it is very appropriate, as we give benefits to our brave men and women, that we protect the children at the same time. 
   As I understand it, we are going to discuss the Coverdell bill, but we will actually pass the House bill. I ask my leader if that is, in fact, the case? If there was a Senate bill, I would object, because I would like the opportunity to have this particular Senator's amendment included, but understanding that it will be the House bill, I won't stand in the way. Do I have the assurance that the vote will be on the House bill?

   I am only saying as we look to the financial burden of our men and women in uniform and as we look at these refugees and the way those kids look at their parents, it is no different from our families here when there is a disruption in family life. 
   I look forward to working with my friend to see that we can at some future time, very soon--because it could happen soon; they are talking about calling up the Reserves now in the Air Force--that we would protect those children and those families. We don't want to have a child go through the trauma of losing a mother and father in a combat zone. We don't have to do that. 
   I thank the Senator very much for his cooperation. I look forward to working with him on this matter.

    Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today I wish to acknowledge the life and passing of Joyce Chiang, the sister of a member of my staff, John Chiang. I extend my deepest condolences to all the members of Joyce's family and to the many friends who are grieving today over her loss. 
   A young woman of great talent and promise, Joyce touched the lives of many through her vivacious spirit and dedication to her community. She will long be remembered and greatly missed. 
   At the age of 28, Joyce had already demonstrated a strong commitment to public service. Most recently, she worked as an attorney for the Immigration and Naturalization Service. Prior to joining the INS, Joyce was a staff member for Congressman Howard Berman. She served as the Student Body President at Smith College, where she graduated in 1992. In her spare time, Joyce volunteered for local charities. 
   After Joyce disappeared one night in January, her friends and family began organizing to find her. They posted fliers, wore yellow ribbons,, and held weekly candlelight vigils for her safe return. These vigils, which were held both in Washington and in California, were attended by hundreds of people--a testament to Joyce's ability to touch people's lives in a special way. Tragically, the search for Joyce Chiang ended with the terrible news that her life had been taken. 
   Joyce was a young person full of energy, intelligence, and generosity. She was deeply dedicated to improving our communities and had only begun to make her contribution to our society. Her passing is a loss not only for her friends and family, but for all of us in the greater community in which she lived.

   Mrs. BOXER. Thank you very much, Mr. President. 
   I am very happy that the chairman of the Budget Committee is going to agree to Senator LAUTENBERG's language, because there is some confusion here, if you read the press reports today. That wouldn't be the first time there would be some confusion. But what it says here is that ``[t]he final budget resolution will also contain language allowing the entire $1.8 trillion Social Security surplus over the next 10 years to be used for retirement security..... .'' It could include Medicare, it says. 
   Here is the nub of the argument that we had in the Budget Committee, of which I am proud to be a member. The Democrats on the committee wanted to see 15 percent of the surplus dedicated to Medicare and 62 percent for Social Security. We had a very good debate, I thought, in the committee about that. And my colleague from New Mexico made the point very clearly that Social Security would be put in a lockbox and would be used only for that. And we really did not get anywhere on the Medicare debate because we did not set aside anything from the surplus. Yes, there is money in there for Medicare at the current level, but there is nothing additional out of the surplus. We wanted to see 62 percent of the surplus for Social Security, 15 percent for Medicare. 
   Now we read that that 62 percent would be used for Medicare, in other words, stealing that money from Social Security. I am very glad that my colleague from New Mexico is going to accept this language. It will clarify it. I assume that this report is incorrect and that this language will not appear. 
   I also hope that this newspaper is wrong when it reports that the Dodd-Jeffords language on child care was stripped from the resolution. This was a 59-vote majority in this body, quite bipartisan, to do something about child care. 
   So I am very pleased that we are going to have agreement on this. I hope when we look at the budget language--and, hopefully, I will be there looking at it with my colleagues--that we will not see such language in the resolution. 
   I thank you very much and yield back my time to Senator LAUTENBERG.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Massachusetts for yielding for a couple of questions. 
   First, I thank him for his motion to instruct conferees. As a member of the Budget Committee, I can tell you that the Democrats on that committee fought very, very hard to get the committee to set aside enough funds from the overall surplus that we have to meet the needs of Medicare. And many of us brought out points that the Senator from Massachusetts has brought out before. I just want to ask him a couple of questions. 
   Does the Senator not agree that Medicare is really the twin pillar of Social Security for our people? In other words, you save Social Security, but if you do not save Medicare, then our seniors will have to spend their Social Security income to pay for their health care. Doesn't the Senator feel that this is the twin pillar of the senior citizens' safety net?

   Mrs. BOXER. I have one more question that goes to the heart of the Senator's point. What the Republicans are saying is we can reform our way. We don't think we need additional resources. They proposed tax breaks for the wealthiest people in America instead of saving Medicare. What you do is very clearly say, yes, we will support targeted tax relief for low- and middle-class families, but we want to save Medicare before we give back funds to the wealthiest among us, those at the very, very top tier. 
   The question I wanted to pose to my friend is this: As I look at Medicare and the numbers we have in the Budget Committee, I want to ask my friend if he agrees with these numbers. We are told that the Medicare program provides health care to 39 million Americans today, but by 2032 the number of Medicare beneficiaries will double to 78 million as the baby boomers retire. So the question for the Senator is basically this: We are looking at a program that is very important, and we are looking at some good news. We are living longer. This is good. We all work toward that. We want to live longer. We want to have a good quality of life. But can we just say we can reform our way out of this problem, or do we have to commit some of the surplus to Medicare?

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I want to thank the chairman of the committee and my ranking member for agreeing to this. Of course, Senator LAUTENBERG was very supportive in committee, and Senator DOMENICI tonight has said he will go along with this amendment. 
   It is very simple and clear. It says if there should be a tax cut, we want to see the substantial benefit go to the first 90 percent of wage earners, rather than the top 10 percent. 
   I think this is good for the people of the country. 
   I want to thank, again, Senator DOMENICI and Senator LAUTENBERG.

    Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise to salute the Springtime and the birth of Caroline Byrd Fatemi, great-granddaughter of the distinguished Senator from West Virginia. 
   Last week, Senator BYRD took the floor to bring us glad tidings of spring and of Caroline's birth. Today, before we fly to the four corners of America, I would like to salute our beloved colleague and his progeny. 
   Time and again, Senator BYRD has graced this chamber with the lessons of history and the sweet music of poetry. Last week he ushered in Springtime with a stanza from Algernon Charles Swinburne. Let me quote the same poet to welcome Caroline to the world: 
 Where shall we find her, how shall we sing to her, Fold our hands round her knees, and cling? O that man's heart were as fire and could spring to her, Fire, or the strength of the streams that spring! 
 For the stars and the winds are unto her As raiment, as songs of the harp-player; For the risen stars and the fallen cling to her, And the south-west wind and the west-wind sing. 
 For winter's rains and ruins are over, And all the season of snows and sins; The days dividing lover and lover, The light that loses, the night that wins; And time remember'd is grief forgotten, And frosts are slain and flowers begotten, And in green underwood and cover Blossom by blossom the Spring begins.  
   Mr. President, the link between the elder BYRD and the younger symbolizes for me what our job here is all about: Looking forward every day, every month, every year to the eternal Spring that is America--and keeping faith with every generation of American. 
   Whether we are working to improve education or save Social Security, we who are privileged to serve in the United States Senate can, by our actions, strengthen the bonds that unite our nation from generation to generation. 
   As we strive to make the world a better place for Caroline and every child of her generation, let us follow the advice in Laurence Binyon's poem ``O World, be Nobler''--

    Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am very concerned about the drastic cuts the Republican budget makes to our foreign affairs budget. In his budget request, President Clinton asked for $21.3 billion in funding for foreign affairs. The budget before us cuts $3.2 billion from that request. 
   U.S. leadership around the world requires adequate resources both for embassy security and for international programs. As a member of the Foreign  Relations Committee and the Ranking Member of the International Operations Subcommittee, I have heard many times that our embassies abroad are in dire need of security upgrades. 
   We should not forget the terrible tragedy that took place last year when over 100 people died in the embassy bombings in Nairobi, Kenya and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. It was a stark reminder that the men and women who conduct our diplomacy abroad put their lives on the line to promote U.S. interests throughout the world. We have the obligation to ensure their safety in every way possible. 
   These cuts to the State Department budget are so deep that Secretary Albright called them ``outrageous and unacceptable.'' 
   Let me outline some of the important programs that will have to be eliminated from the budget under the Republican budget. A $24 million anti-narcotics initiative and programs to fight money laundering and trafficking in women could not be realized. The new Expanded Threat Reduction Program to reduce the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction in the former Soviet Union could not be implemented. And, the U.S. request of $500 million to support the Wye Implementation accord would not be achievable under the Senate Budget Resolution. 
   I cannot believe that my colleagues would chose to undermine our efforts to fight the international war on drugs, control the proliferation of nuclear weapons, and support the peace process in the Middle East, in Ireland and in Bosnia. 
   We live in a very dangerous world, and this budget puts us at greater risk. We must find the resources to fix this problem and properly fund the international affairs budget.

   Mrs. BOXER. Thank you so much, Mr. President. I thank the chairman and the ranking member, Senator LAUTENBERG. 
   I was so pleased to be a member of the Senate Budget Committee in the House. I was on the House Budget Committee for 6 years. To me, the Budget Committee is very important, because what we in essence do is present a roadmap for the priorities of this country. I think it is key to the people, the decisions we make here. How much are we going to spend on education? How much are we going to spend on Social Security, Medicare? How much are we going to spend on the military? And on and on--Border Patrol. Every single item comes under scrutiny in the Budget Committee. Although we may not make detailed recommendations, we essentially say to the American people--and we have to feel good about what we do--this is how we are going to spend the taxpayers' money and we hope you will be pleased with it. 
   Mr. President, I am not pleased with what we do about Medicare in this budget. That is what brings me to my feet today. 
   The President took the leadership on this budget when he challenged Congress--Members on both sides of the aisle--to save Social Security and Medicare and to do something about the low rate of savings in America today. So he came forward with a very good suggestion. He said set side 62 percent of the surplus for Social Security, set aside 15 percent of the surplus for Medicare, and set aside 12 percent of the surplus for targeted tax cuts, which will help our people increase their savings for the future. 
   The good news is that both sides of the aisle have agreed on Social Security. Both sides in the Senate have agreed to set aside every penny of the Social Security surplus every year for Social Security. The bad news is that nothing--I say 
   ``nothing''--was done for Medicare by the Republicans in this committee. We tried to work with them. Senators LAUTENBERG and CONRAD spoke eloquently on the point and offered a number of amendments. They will do so again. Yet, on a straight party line vote, we were unable to budge our Republican friends. 
   I have to say this: Having seen a parent wind up in a very difficult position in a nursing home and having seen her be able to hold her head up high because she has Social Security and Medicare, they are twin pillars of the social safety net. Why do I say this? Because if you ask our elderly what they fear, what they fear is getting sick and they cannot rely on their Medicare. If their Medicare becomes out of reach for them, if it no longer protects them, then they will have to use their Social Security to pay for their health care costs, and they will wind up in very bad shape. 
   So, to me, you can't stand up with a straight face and say you are helping seniors in this country, you are helping our people get through their golden years, if you do not help Medicare, as well as Social Security. 
   There are those on the other side who we will hear say, ``Oh, these Democrats. All they want to do is throw money at Medicare. They don't want to reform it.'' That isn't so. But we do know we need to do both. We need to set aside funds from the surplus to get us through these years coming for Medicare; also, let's look at the reforms of the program. 
   As Senator KENNEDY said, the proposal we will put before the Senate will save Medicare through the year 2020. That is nothing to scoff at. Then we have the time to work on the reforms. We need to make sure that those reforms, in fact, are good reforms and that ``reform'' does not become another word for ``repeal.'' We don't want to repeal Medicare. We don't want to change Medicare in such a way that it no longer is that peace of mind for our seniors. We want to fix it so that it continues to work. 
   I hope it will be different on the Senate floor than it was in the committee. Shockingly, almost every vote, almost every vote--I will not say every amendment, but certainly every vote--to save Medicare was a straight party line. We see more and more of it. I see Senator MURRAY on the floor, a member of this committee, who was talking to me about how shocked she was that in the markup of the Patients' Bill of Rights it was party line all the way. What has become of us? 
   These are issues we should work together on. I am sad that we are not able to do it. On the other hand, I recognize that there are legitimate differences between the parties. It is for the people to judge as to who they feel is going to keep Medicare going. 
   I want to share a couple of charts with you. It seems to me that what we ought to be doing in this budget is securing America's future. In the budget we envision, and the kind of amendments we will be offering, we want to do a few things. We want to save Social Security. I again credit my Republican friends. We have worked together. This is done. 
   We also want to strengthen Medicare. Mr. President, it is not done in this budget. There isn't a slim dime set aside for Medicare, despite the fact that we were talking about last year what we would do with the tobacco tax, should it be enacted. Members on the other side of the aisle said: If you have extra funds, save Medicare. I don't know what happened. We will hear more about that in the debate as it unfolds. 
   Also, we should cut taxes to help ordinary Americans save. Those kinds of targeted tax cuts, more modest than the ones in the budget before us, are the ones we ought to be supporting. So, yes, we support tax cuts, but we want them to go to ordinary Americans who need those tax cuts. Yes, we want to strengthen Medicare by setting aside 15 percent of the surplus for Medicare. 
   I think it is stunning to look at this budget. This is what this budget does with the surplus vis-a-vis Medicare and tax cuts. My Republican friends will say, ``Well, we do spend money on Medicare.'' Yes, they spend the money. But nothing out of the surplus--nothing to address the problem in the future once we have a problem. 
   The good news story is that we are living longer. This is good. All the work we do around here to increase spending on health research is paying off. All the investment we make in the private sector and make in high technology is paying off. People are living longer. This is good; this isn't something to be sad about. But yet it has to be addressed. If we don't address it, we not only hurt the aging population, but  the children of the aging population whose problem it will be when mom and pop can no longer afford health insurance--and they may be uninsured--or have to dip into their pocket to a great extent when hit with a disease. 
   Just take a look at this. I ask the question, Is it fair? Is it fair? Tax cuts--$1.7 trillion; zero investment in Medicare out of the surplus. I don't see how this could be supported. Senators LAUTENBERG, CONRAD, KENNEDY, and others will be offering us an opportunity to do something about this. I hope we will. 
   I have a final chart that I want to show. 
   So you say to yourself, OK, the Republicans are giving these tax cuts out of the surplus; not a dime for Medicare. Who is getting the benefit? My friends, I have to tell you, if you earn over $833,000 a year, you are going to get a good benefit from this Republican tax plan because you are going to get an average of $20,697 back a year. 
   In other words, the top 1 percent will average $20,697 a year back in their taxes. That is twice as much almost as the minimum wage. And we can't get support from the other side of the aisle to raise the minimum wage. People who get up and work hard, get dirt under their fingernails every day, earn about $11,000 a year. We can't get anyone to raise it again. 
   But look at this, folks: $20,697 average back to the top 1 percent every year, and the bottom 60 percent of taxpayers, that is, whose income is below $38,000, get back $99. This is paid for by essentially ignoring Medicare. I say to my friends: $99 a year; yes, it is good to get that back. But how far does that go when mom and dad call you and say, ``My Medicare premiums just went up a huge amount. You have to help me; I can't pay the premium''? I say that $99 will be gone pretty darned quick. 
   So I just don't think it is fair. I respect my friends. They think this is good policy. I know they believe it in their hearts. As a matter of fact, shockingly--I had an amendment in the committee. Do you know what it said? It said that the substantial benefits of the Tax Code, of any Tax Code that winds its way through here, should go to the first 85 percent of taxpayers rather than the top 15 percent. And to my shock, my dear colleagues on the other side would not even let us vote. They had a substitute. They did not like it. They supported it last year, but they said this year times are different. They do not support it now. 
   So the reason I love this debate, on the one hand, is there are such clear differences in the philosophy of the parties, as evidenced by the votes that were taken in the Budget Committee. But I have to say I was disappointed. Even an amendment I offered--and I know, again, my colleagues will speak on their own amendments--that simply said without adding a penny let's make sure we fund afterschool programs out of the increase in the education budget, except for one colleague, every Republican voted it down. One Republican colleague joined me, but it failed on an 11-11 vote. They will not even say that afterschool care should be a priority within the education budget, because the philosophy is let the local government decide. 
   What if the local government decided to spend it to put a shower in the principal's office instead of on afterschool? I think there ought to be some accountability for the tax dollars we send back. We are not saying you have to use it. We are saying if you apply for the funds, whether it is for afterschool or more teachers in the classroom--we could not even get a vote ``yes'' on that one. So I am proud to be here today to stand up for the priorities I started off talking about: Saving Social Security--which I give my friends credit for, we do--or strengthening Medicare, which they do not do. We are going to offer some amendments, so we hope they will do it. And to cut taxes, not for the wealthiest Americans, but for ordinary Americans. 
   I want to say a word to my colleague, Senator LAUTENBERG. He and Senator DOMENICI may not agree, but they get along and it is a wonderful thing for us to see. Because, as tough as it is to disagree on these issues, there is a certain friendship and comity that pervades that committee because of their example. I thank them for that. I hope my colleague, Senator LAUTENBERG, will rethink his decision to retire because we will miss him too much. 
   But the amendments that he will offer symbolize what he is about, which is standing up and fighting for the little people, the people who need us. Before Medicare, we had old men and women destitute, destitute. And my friend, Senator LAUTENBERG, is an example of the American dream when he tells me the story of his mother who ran a bakery. She was widowed and she raised her family. 
   He served his country. He became a very successful businessman, and against his own economic interests, takes positions here that are for the good of the people. As he stands up and talks about Medicare, I know it is from the heart. I hope we will follow his leadership. I hope we will get a bipartisan vote to save Medicare. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mrs. BOXER. What I said clearly is of course there is funding there for Medicare. I said: Out of the surplus. There was nothing out of the surplus. I was very clear to state of course the committee takes care of Medicare under the current condition, but doesn't take anything out of the surplus.

    Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, last week, the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee marked up managed care reform legislation. Unfortunately, this markup was characterized by the partisan politics that have plagued this issue for over a year now. 
   I fear that this squabbling shows no signs of letting up, and I expect it to carry over onto the floor of the Senate. The result may be no action at all. And that, Mr. President, would be a tragedy. There are many individuals who need to be protected from some of the outrageous practices of managed care networks, and as long as we argue, they are not being helped. 
   It is time to move beyond the squabbling and get something done. Do not get me wrong. I strongly support and am a cosponsor of the Patients' Bill of Rights Act, introduced by Senator DASHCLE. I have no intention of renouncing my support for this excellent bill. Many of its provisions are based on a bill I introduced in 1997. 
   But, I do believe that we need to start reaching across the aisle to find common ground in those areas where this is agreement. So, today, I am introducing, along with Senator SNOWE, the Women's Access to Care Act--to guarantee that women in managed care plans can designate their ob/gyn as their primary care physician. 
   Let me tell you, Mr. President, why this bill is so important, and I will start with this basic fact: Many women consider their ob/gyn their principal doctor. According to a 1993 Gallup Poll, 72 percent of women had a regular physical examination in the previous two years from an ob/gyn. And, three-fourths of all women object to restricted access to their ob/gyn. 
   But, managed care companies are not paying attention. 
   Sometimes, a managed care company requires a woman to get a referral in order to see her ob/gyn. Or, a managed care plan allows a woman to see an ob/gyn without a referral only under limited circumstances--such as for only a few visits each year or for only certain medical conditions. Or, a managed care network does not allow a woman's ob/gyn to refer her to a specialist. 
   All of these hurdles placed between a woman and her doctor mean that a woman has to get a referral from another doctor just to see her doctor, and that she must, for all practical purposes, have two doctors. 
   Let me give you an example that will illustrate how absurd this is. 
   A 39-year-old woman--who considers her ob/gyn as her doctor--is in the office for a routine check-up. The ob/gyn discovers a lump in the woman's breast and tells her that she needs to get a mammogram. But, because the woman is under the age for automatic coverage of mammograms, she can only get one if her doctor says it is medically necessary. But, the 
   managed care plan does not consider the ob/gyn as the woman's doctor--even though she does. So, this woman has to go find a primary care doctor just to get that doctor to okay a mammogram. And, the ob/gyn certainly cannot refer her to a specialist about the lump in her breast. 
   That, Mr. President, is silly. It makes no sense. And, it is not even good health policy. According to the Commonwealth Fund, a woman whose ob/gyn is her regular doctor is more likely to have had a complete physical exam, a blood pressure reading, a cholesterol test, a clinical breast exam, a mammogram, a pelvic examination, and a Pap smear. 
   In other words, a woman is more likely to receive the health care she needs when she can see her ob/gyn. Why? Because many woman consider their ob/gyn their principal doctor. 
   The bill that Senator SNOWE and I are introducing today recognizes this fact. The Women's Access to Care Act would provide a woman in a managed care plan with three options. 
   First, she could designate an ob/gyn as her primary care physician. She would have the same right of access to--and the doctor would have the same right of referral as--any other primary care physician. 
   Second, she could continue the practice common today. That is, she could designate a general practitioner as her primary care physician. But, if she does, she must be allowed to see an ob/gyn without a referral for all routine gynecological care and pregnancy related services. And, the ob/gyn could refer the woman to a specialist for any other needed gynecological care. 
   Third, we would say that a woman could designate both an ob/gyn and a general practitioner as her primary care provider. Sometimes a woman considers her ob/gyn as her doctor but does not want to close off access to a general practitioner for other health care needs. 
   Finally, Mr. President, let me briefly address what is known as direct access to an ob/gyn. Allowing a woman to go directly to her ob/gyn without a referral would be an important step forward. But, keep in mind that it is not the full story. Even if the direct access were unlimited and unfettered, it would not allow an ob/gyn to refer a woman to the specialist she needs. To do that requires allowing an ob/gyn to be designated as a primary care physician. 
   Mr. President, I believe the Women's Access to Care Act is a common sense approach that recognizes the reality of the way many women receive--and want to receive--their health care. It is also an opportunity to break through the partisan logjam on managed care and enact something meaningful to help the women of America. 
   I urge my colleagues to join me and Senator SNOWE in this bipartisan effort.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I had planned to offer an amendment to repeal a special interest rider attached to the Emergency Supplemental Appropriations bill. 
   This rider prevents the Interior Department from acting to ensure that oil companies pay a fair royalty for oil drilled on public lands. My amendment would have stripped that rider--allowing the Interior Department to finalize their rule so that the taxpayers will receive the millions of dollars they are owed in royalty payments. 
   I have decided that while I still firmly believe that this rider should be stripped, because of recent action taken by the Interior Department, this amendment would not be timely. However, I would like to assure you that if I will block any future attempts to further delay this necessary and important rulemaking process. 
   Mr. President, this is a very simple issue. 
   For years, oil companies have been cheating the American taxpayers out of millions--if not billions--of dollars. 
   The Department of Interior took action to stop the cheating. 
   Now, Congress is preventing the Interior Department from stopping the cheating. 
   Just as the Interior Department was about to finalize a new rule to resolve arguments over royalties, here comes yet another rider on an unrelated must-pass bill to stop the new rule from going into effect. 
   So who benefits from this rider? Big Oil. And who loses? The American taxpayer. 
   We had this same debate last Congress. Some of my colleagues will say that this delay is necessary to force the Interior Department to listen to the oil companies. 
   Mr. President, the Interior Department has listened. In fact, in response to pressure from the Big Oil, the Interior Department has re-opened the comment period on the proposal to--once again--see if there is anything new. 
   Because of the Interior Department's action, it is unlikely that the Department will be able to finalize the rule before October 1, 1999 despite this rider. The rider is unnecessary and is just another attempt by Congress to bully the Interior Department. 
   The Interior Department has gone through a thoughtful and detailed process to get this rule done. The Interior Department has acted in good faith to respond to concerns of the oil industry and members of the Senate--meeting with Members of Congress on several occasions and reopening the comment period on the rule. 
   It is now time for the Congress to act in good faith and let the Interior Department proceed. 
   Mr. President, let me explain how royalty payments work. When oil companies drill on public lands, they pay a royalty to the federal government. This royalty is like paying rent. The oil companies want to use federal land or offshore tracts, so they pay rent--a percentage of the value of the oil--to the federal government to use this land. A share of this royalty is given to the state, and the remaining money is used by the federal government for the Land and Water Conservation Fund and the Historic Preservation Fund. 
   The oil companies sign an agreement to pay a fixed percentage of the value of the oil they produce on federal lands--12.5%. The question is 12.5% of what? It's that number that the big oil companies understate. 
   According to the signed agreement, that number for the value of the oil, ``shall never be less than the fair market value of the production.'' But the oil companies are currently understating the value, and as a result, they underpay their royalties. 
   The debate is over how to determine the true value of oil. Is the true value of the oil the value that the oil companies themselves decide? Or is the true value of the oil the market price that one would pay if they actually purchased a barrel of oil? I agree with the Interior Department that the oil companies must base their royalty payments on the market price. 
   Currently, oil companies themselves determine the value of the oil and pay a royalty based on that value. The value determined by the companies is called the posted price and merely reflects offers by purchasers to buy oil from a specific area. It is just an offer to buy and does not represent any actual sale of oil. 
   Now you may be hearing from the oil companies that this proposed system is unfair and that it harms the small independent producers. The Department of Interior has informed me that the new regulations will only increase royalty payments for 5% of all the companies. This 5% is not your mom and pop operations--this is Shell, Chevron, Exxon, Texaco, Mobil, Marathon and Conoco. This is the large integrated companies that trade with their affiliates and have no actual sale of oil. 
   You may also hear from my colleagues that the oil companies are hurting. With oil prices the lowest they've been in decades, how can we increase their royalties? This isn't about increasing the royalties, this is about the American public getting their fair share--whatever the value. And with the Interior Department's proposed regulations, as oil prices fall, so does the royalty. It's all based on the market. 
   So in summation, to guarantee taxpayers a fair royalty payment in the future, the Interior Department proposed a simple and common sense solution: pay royalties based on actual market prices, not estimates the oil companies themselves make up. The  new rule was proposed over 3 years ago. Since that time, the Department has held 14 public workshops and published 7 separate requests for industry comments on this rule--and three more public workshops are scheduled in the next month. High level Interior officials have met with Members of Congress and industry on several occasions and have made several changes to the regulations to address industry's concerns. 
   At some point the negotiating must stop and the Interior Department must be allowed to move forward with this fair rule. 
   This rider is outrageous. It saves the wealthiest oil companies in the world millions of dollars while shortchanging taxpayers and, in the case of California, our schoolchildren which is where my state's oil royalty payments go. What does this say about our nation's priorities? 
   The Interior Department's proposed regulations are fair and they are accurate. They are not based on the subjectivity of the big oil companies, but are based on actual market prices. 
   It is time that we end this flawed system of calculating royalties and move to an objective, market driven system. The Department of Interior has spent much time developing an equitable system and we should allow it to move forward. 
   While I am not offering my amendment this time, I am here to say that this cheating must stop and these riders must stop. Let the Interior Department do its job and move forward with these regulations.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to protect the rights and interests of local communities in suing the gun industry. I am joined in this effort by Senators CHAFEE, LAUTENBERG, REED, SCHUMER, and TORRICELLI.  
   Frankly, I would prefer not to have to introduce legislation at all. But, it has become necessary because the gun industry has begun a concerted campaign to gag America's cities. In order to preserve local control and options, federal legislation is needed. The federal government must stand alongside our local communities to fight the gun violence plaguing too many of America's cities. 
   So far, five cities--New Orleans, Atlanta, Chicago, Miami-Dade County, and Bridgeport, Connecticut--have filed lawsuits against the gun industry. Many more are considering such lawsuits, including, in my State of California, San Francisco, Los Angeles, and Sacramento. These cities are suing because they are being invaded by guns. 
   Consider the city of Chicago. Chicago has one of the toughest handgun control ordinances in the country. And yet, this year, the Chicago police will confiscate some 17,000 illegal weapons. City officials acknowledge that's only a fraction of the guns on the streets. And there are now 242 million guns in America. That's almost one for every man, woman, and child in this country. 
   The result is that each year, guns cause the death of about 35,000 Americans. The number of handgun murders in this country far outpaces that of any other country--indeed, most other countries combined. Japan and Great Britain have fewer than one murder by a handgun per one million population. Canada has about three and a half per million people. But in the United States, there are over 35 handgun murders per year for every million people. 
   In my state of California alone, there are five times as many handgun murders as there are in New Zealand, Australia, Japan, Great Britain, Canada, and Germany combined. Yet those six countries together have ten times the population of California.  
   Over 11 years, nearly 400,000 Americans have been killed by gunfire. Compare that with the 11 years of the Vietnam War, where over 58,000 Americans died. 
   If this continues, the Centers for Disease Control estimates that in just four years, gun deaths will be the leading cause of injury-related death in America. 
   And for every American who dies, another three are injured and end up in an emergency room. The cost to our health care system is estimated to be between $1.5 billion and $4.5 billion per year. And 4 out of every 5 gunshot victims either have no health insurance or are on public assistance. U.S. News reported that one hospital in California--the University of California-Davis Medical Center--lost $2.2 million over three years on gunshot victims. That means you and I and all taxpayers are paying the bills. 
   That is why many cities want to sue. But, the NRA does not want to fight this in court. The gun industry wants to circumvent the legal process through special interest legislation--legislation imposed on our cities by big government. 
   To preserve local control and individual rights, federal legislation is needed. Today, I am introducing such legislation, known as the Firearms Rights, Responsibilities, and Remedies Act. This bill would ensure that individuals and entities harmed by gun violence--including our cities--have the right to sue gun manufacturers, dealers, and importers. 
   Specifically, my bill would create a federal cause of action--the right to sue--for harms resulting from gun violence. A gun manufacturer, dealer, or importer could be held liable if it ``knew or reasonably should have known'' that its design, manufacturing, marketing, importation, sales, or distribution practices would likely result in gun violence. But, this is not an open-ended proposition. The term ``gun violence'' is defined specifically as the unlawful use of a firearm or the unintentional discharge of a firearm. It would not be possible to sue for every gun sold--or even for all violence and deaths that result. A suit would only be possible if there is some negligence on the part of a manufacturer, dealer, or importer. I believe this language is broad enough to allow cities to pursue their claims, but not so broad as to open the floodgates for every gun-related death and injury. 
   Suits could be brought in federal or state court by States, units of local government--such as cities, towns, and counties--individuals, organizations, and businesses who were injured by or incurred costs because of gun violence. A prevailing plaintiff could recover actual damages, punitive damages, and attorneys fees. 
   I am not saying that the gun industry should be required to pay any particular amount of damages, and I am not advocating any particular theory that would hold the gun industry liable. What I am saying is that the gun industry should not be exempt from the normal course of business in America. The right to redress grievances in court is older than America itself--older than the Second Amendment to the Constitution. But the NRA is now pushing legislation in many states and here in Congress to say that the gun industry should get special rights and special protections. I believe that the gun industry should be treated like everyone else, and I believe that our cities should have their day in court. 
   My bill does not impose anything. It does not require anything. It is designed for one purpose: to preserve local control. As Jim Hahn, the City Attorney of Los Angeles, noted in a letter to me endorsing my bill, what many States are considering would ``represent a significant intrusion in to the authority of local governments.'' And my bill would, in the words of Alex Penelas, the Mayor of Miami-Dade County, ``preserve access to the courts for local governments and individual citizens.'' 
   Now, Mr. President, there have been questions raised about the constitutionality of this measure. It was not easy drafting a constitutional measure, but in working with Kathleen Sullivan, the Dean of Stanford Law School, and Larry Tribe of Harvard, I believe we have a bill that is constitutional. 
   Finally, Mr. President, let me just note a bit of irony in this whole debate. Some of the legislation that the NRA has worked so hard to defeat over the years--such as mandatory safety locks, smart technology, and product safety legislation--is the basis of some of these suits by the cities. If the NRA had let us pass such laws, they wouldn't be facing so many lawsuits today. The NRA and the gun industry do not want to be regulated and then they do not want to be held accountable. The NRA and the gun industry want to escape their responsibilities for what they are doing to America's cities--and all too often, to America's children. 
   I sometimes wonder if N-R-A stands for ``No Responsibility or Accountability.'' 
   It has been said that some Americans have a love affair with guns. But we should not stand idly by when that love affair turns violent. Today we stand with America's cities to say enough is enough.

    Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, yesterday, Senator BROWNBACK and I introduced a resolution, S. Res. 68, condemning the treatment of Afghan women and girls by the Taliban. I hope my colleagues will join us in condemning the systematic human rights violations that are being committed against women and girls in that war-torn nation. 
   The Taliban militia seized control of most of Afghanistan in 1996 and now control about 90 percent of the country, including the capital, Kabul. This group imposes an extreme interpretation of Islam practiced no where else in the world on all individuals. It is especially repressive on women. 
   Before the Taliban assumed control of much of Afghanistan, women were highly involved in public life. They held positions in the government and worked as doctors, lawyers, nurses, and teachers. The picture could not be more different today. Today, under Taliban rule women in Afghanistan are denied even the most basic human rights: they cannot work outside the home, attend school, or even wear shoes that make noise when they walk. They must wear a head-to-toe covering called a burqa, which allows only a tiny opening to see and breathe through. Parents cannot teach their daughters to read, or take their little girls to be treated by male doctors. Mr. President, women have been stoned to death, beaten, and otherwise abused for ``breaking'' these harsh laws. 
   The Physicians for Human Rights recently conducted a study of 160 women in Afghanistan and their findings are horrific. One of those women, a 20 year-old woman interviewed in Kabul had the following story:  
   Eight months ago, my two-and-a-half year old daughter died from diarrhea. She was refused treatment by the first hospital that we took her to. The second hospital mistreated her [they refused to provide intravenous fluids and antibiotics because of their Hazara ethnicity, according to the respondent]. Her body was handed to me and her father in the middle of the night. With her body in my arms, we left the hospital. It was curfew time and we had a long way to get home. We had to spend the night inside a destroyed house among the rubble. In the morning we took my dead baby home but we had no money for her funeral.  
   The study found that 77 percent of women had poor access to health care in Kabul, while another 20 percent reported no access at all. Of those surveyed, 71 percent reported a decline in their physical condition over the last two years. In addition, there was also a significant decline in the mental health of the women surveyed. Of the participants, 81 percent reported a decline in their mental condition; 97 percent met the diagnostic criteria for depression; 86 percent showed symptoms of anxiety; 42 percent met the diagnostic criteria for post-traumatic stress disorder; and 21 percent reported having suicidal thoughts ``extremely often'' or ``quite often.'' In addition, 53 percent of women described occasions in which they were seriously ill and unable to seek medical care. 28 percent of the Afghan women reported inadequate control over their own reproduction. 
   S. Res. 68 calls on the President of the United States to prevent a Taliban-led government of Afghanistan from taking a seat in the United Nations General Assembly, so long as these gross violations of human rights persist. 
   Our resolution also urges the Administration not to recognize any government in Afghanistan which does not take actions to achieve the following goals: effective participation of women in all civil, economic, and social life; the right of women to work; the right of women and girls to an education without discrimination and the reopening of schools to women and girls at all levels of education; the freedom of movement of women and girls; equal access of women and girls to health care; equal access of women and girls to humanitarian aid. 
   Mr. President, I am shocked that women and girls in Afghanistan are suffering under these conditions as we approach the 21st Century. The United States has an obligation to take the lead in condemning these abuses. 
   I want to thank Senator BROWNBACK for joining me in introducing this legislation. He has been a strong voice for human rights and I know that he shares my passion for seeing an end to these abuses in Afghanistan.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator so much for yielding. 
   I say to the Senator from North Carolina, Mr. EDWARDS, and the Senator from Rhode Island, Mr. REED, for arranging this, thank you. I think it has been a very high moment in my career in the U.S. Senate. I say to Senator KERREY, I wish you never had been hurt in war, and I just want to thank you for coming back from that trauma, because it has changed the lives of so many people. 
   To those who do not know BOB KERREY as well as his colleagues know him, I say this is a man of no wasted words. This is not a man of small talk. This is a man with big vision, big ideas, and little time to waste. One, I think, can make the leap that that experience, that brush with death, has made him understand, as many do not understand, that life is fleeting and life goes fast. 
   Although his rehabilitation must have seemed like an eternity, what he got out of that clearly was the love and support of many people, and it made him realize that he wanted to have a chance to give that kind of support to others. 
   I consider working with BOB KERREY an honor. It is always interesting. It is always exciting. It is always an experience you can never figure out until it actually happens, because he is not someone who is driven by the ordinary; it is the extraordinary. 
   I add my words of praise for my friend BOB KERREY. I also add words of praise for the people who rehabilitated you in your tough times. Because of their work, we have you here. 
   Thank you very much.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, as a Senator from Joe DiMaggio's home state, I am pleased to be an original co-sponsor of the resolution honoring ``the Yankee Clipper.'' Joe DiMaggio holds a unique place in the hearts of every baseball fan and every Californian. 
   Joe DiMaggio was born in 1914 in Martinez, California, near San Francisco Bay. Like many Californians then and now, Joe was the child of immigrants. His parents came from Sicily to California, where his father found work as a fisherman. 
   At age 18, Joe began his professional baseball career with the San Francisco Seals, where he set a Pacific Coast League record that still stands by hitting in 61 straight games. Three years later, he joined the New York Yankees and immediately became one of baseball's brightest stars. In 1941, his 56-game hitting streak set a major league record that most baseball fans consider the game's greatest achievement. 
   DiMaggio played 13 seasons for the Yankees, winning three Most Valuable Player awards and playing on nine World Series championship teams. He was selected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1955 and voted Major League Baseball's greatest living player in 1969. 
   Joe DiMaggio was a great ballplayer, but he was far more than that. Joe was a role model for young people and a model citizen. At the height of his career, he left baseball to volunteer for the Army Air Corps and served three years in World War II. In his later years he worked tirelessly to support the Joe DiMaggio Children's Hospital in Hollywood, Florida. 
   I will never forget a televised image of Joe DiMaggio from a decade ago. In October 1989, as the Oakland A's and San Francisco Giants were about to start a World Series game, a mammoth earthquake struck the Bay Area. Fire swept through San Francisco's Marina district, where DiMaggio lived at the time. That night, as residents struggled to deal with the earthquake and its aftermath, they saw a man who--despite his advanced age--showed the strength and dignity to walk calmly through the rubble and reassure his neighbors. At this moment, as always, DiMaggio was an inspiration to us all. 
   From his early days with the San Francisco Seals to his service as baseball's greatest ambassador, Joe DiMaggio was the epitome of elegance, grace, and good sportsmanship.

   Mrs. BOXER. Thank you, Mr. President. In 2 1/2 minutes I hope to convince my colleagues to support this afterschool amendment. 
   The Senator from Vermont said it is not so exciting to fund new programs. This is not a new program. This is a tried and true program. This is a program that works. This is a program that we all agreed we would spend $200 million on last year. The response in the community has been overwhelmingly positive and we need to fund it at a greater level. 
   What we do in this amendment is authorize the same amount of funding that the President has put in his budget; $600 million would accommodate over 1 million children. Look at these children, look at their faces, look at how they are involved with a mentor after school. After school programs keep children like them from getting into trouble by involving them in positive activities. We can see here, if we look at this chart, that the time when juvenile offenders commit violent crimes is during the after school hours. You do not need a degree in criminology or sociology or psychology to understand that youth offenders are more likely to commit crime or become involved in criminal activity when they are home alone or unsupervised. We see criminal activity among youth peaking here at 3 p.m., when schools let out. Gradually, as the hours move into the early evening and parents come home, the peak drops. Additionally, law enforcement supports afterschool programs. We call this particular amendment an anticrime amendment. It has been endorsed by police athletic leagues from across the Nation. Members have been calling in favor of this amendment. Here is the list of the many law enforcement groups, just a handful of them, to show you how popular this program is. 
   Who supports afterschool programs in America? In a recent poll, August of 1998, 92 percent of Americans support afterschool programs. After school programs are anticrime, pro-education, pro-community, and make common sense. Again, I hope Senators will vote in favor of afterschool programs. This is not a new program. I thank my colleagues for their attention.

   Mrs. BOXER. Thank you, Mr. President. I will take that time, if I might. I knew I could speak fast, but I did not realize I had left all that time. 
   Again, I say to my friend, this is a moment, an opportunity for us. We have an education bill before the U.S. Senate. Why would we wait to put more teachers in the classroom? Why would we wait on afterschool programs when, in fact, it is so necessary? Throughout America, people are asking us to act. If you go to the community and say, well, we are waiting for a different vehicle to come before the Senate before we address after school programs, they will look at you and say, wait a minute, we need these funds now. Our kids are getting into trouble after school. We have an opportunity, with a good bill that Senator WYDEN has brought to us and Senator FRIST, to make it even better. I urge my colleagues, please vote in favor of this amendment for afterschool programs.

    Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to Robert Condon, one of our nation's leading child literacy advocates, who died last month, tragically, at the all-too-young age of 40. I ask my colleagues to join me in sending condolences to the Condon family. 
   Robert Condon was a successful businessman, but his true passion was reading. Throughout the 1980s, he took time from his career and family to read to children at local homeless shelters. He understood, far before many Americans did, that reading aloud to children is one of the most effective ways to teach literacy and improve young people's lives. 
   In 1991, Robert Condon quit his regular job in order to work full time promoting youth literacy. He founded the non-profit organization ``Rolling Readers USA,'' where he and a small cadre of volunteers read to children in public housing developments, homeless shelters, and schools in the San Diego area. 
   Robert Condon's passion was contagious and Rolling Readers grew exponentially. Today, it has 40,000 volunteers reading to children in 24 states. Rolling Readers has won acclaim from national organizations, including the International Reading Association and Reading Is Fundamental. 
   In his short life, Robert Condon touched the lives of hundreds of thousands of children. In his memory, Rolling Readers USA is sponsoring March 27 as a national read-in day, when tens of thousands of volunteers will spend part of their day reading to children, keeping Robert Condon's ideals moving forward. 
   Mr. President, I encourage all Americans to participate in Rolling Readers USA's national read-in day and to become involved throughout the year to promote youth literacy. Volunteering our time and energy makes a difference and is a fitting way to pay tribute to this remarkable Californian.

    Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to Robert L. Ozuna,  Chief Executive Officer of New Bedford Panoramex Corporation from 1966 until his death on March 6 at the Queen of the Valley Hospital in West Covina, California. He was 69. 
   Robert Ozuna was the oldest of four children born in Miami, Arizona to Mexican-American parents. In 1940, after his father's death, Robert moved with his mother, brother and sisters to East Los Angeles, where he worked steadily from an early age in order to help support the family. 
   As Founder and President of New Bedford Panoramex Corporation (NBP), Robert Ozuna became one of the most successful Mexican-American entrepreneurs in southern California. He gained his business experience on the job and his engineering education by attending night school in the California community and junior college system. 
   In 1966, Ozuna began to build his company with a second mortgage on his home, and a few electrician's hand tools, hard work and entrepreneurial instincts into the thriving electronics manufacturing business it is today in Upland, California. NBP designs, develops and manufactures electronic communication systems and remote monitoring systems for its primary client, the United States Government. 
   Robert Ozuna's hard work and dedication were given public recognition when he received the Department of Transportation Minority Business Enterprise Award for 1987 and again for 1991. He received the Air Traffic Control Association Chairman's Citation of Merit Award in 1994. He was an active member of The California Chamber of Commerce for various cities and a founder of Casa De Rosa Annual Golf Tournament, which he started to raise funds for the Rancho de Los Ninos Orphanage in BajaMar, Mexico. 
   As industrious as Robert Ozuna was in business, he was equally involved sharing his prosperity with many philanthropic activities in his community. He sponsored many events in the Hispanic neighborhood where he grew up, and he was a founding director of the East Los Angeles Sheriff's Youth Athletic Association, which promotes educational, athletic and drug awareness programs for more than 60,000 youths in the Los Angeles Metropolitan area. 
   Robert Ozuna is remembered by his employees at New Bedford Panoramex Corporation as a man with a deep passion for life. His concern for his employees and their families along with his abundant generosity to them was always present. 
   Robert Ozuna was married for 35 years to Rosemary, who passed away in November of 1998. He is survived by his mother Amella Ozuna, his sons Steven Ozuna and Jeff Dominelli, his daughters Nancy DeSilva and Lisa Jarrett, his sisters Lillian Gomez and Vera Venagas, and his brother Tony Ozuna. He also leaves six grandchildren. 
   Robert Ozuna epitomized the American dream, which promises to anyone who works hard and plays by the rules the opportunity to achieve great success. Robert Ozuna lived that dream. Though he will be greatly missed, his life and achievements will serve as an inspiration to generations to come.

   Mrs. BOXER. I say to Senator KENNEDY, thank you very much not only for yielding to me, but also for your great leadership on this important issue of education. 
   I want to just bring us up to date on where we are, at least where I think we are. At 1 o'clock we are going to have a vote to basically allow us to take up the issue of the 100,000 new teachers in the classroom that Senator MURRAY has worked so hard on, and Senator KENNEDY and others. Certainly, the President puts this as a priority in his budget. Where we are now is, if we do not vote to do that, this bill is effectively shut down. Ed-Flex alone--and it is a good bill--turns its back on all the other education needs my colleagues have discussed. 
   The Senator from Vermont keeps offering an amendment on IDEA to fund it; and he is right, and I am ready to vote for that. Why does he block my chance to vote on afterschool? Why does he block my chance to vote on 100,000 teachers? Why does he block my chance to vote on dropouts? I will support him in his desire to fund IDEA. He is right on that point, but he is wrong to go along with the strategy which blocks us from voting on issues of such importance to America's families. 
   I want to share a couple of charts in my remaining few minutes with everyone. Here you see children involved in afterschool activities. We want a chance to offer our afterschool amendment which would open up afterschool to a million children. Look at the look on the faces of these children. They are engaged, they are learning, they are occupied, and they are happy. 
   Another picture. Look at these children. They are not getting into trouble. They are engaging with a mentor and obviously, from the look on their faces, are very involved in this learning game. 
   What happens if we do not have these afterschool programs? You do not have to be a genius to know that kids get in trouble after school. Look at this chart. At 3 o'clock, juvenile crime spikes and it does not go down until late in the evening and it starts to go down at 6 when parents come home from work. We know that children need to be kept busy. That is why we have the support of law enforcement for our afterschool programs. 
   Let me show you the law enforcement who has supported afterschool  programs since we began this effort. Senator DODD has worked hard on this; Senator KENNEDY. Again, I do not want to sound like I am the only one that is pushing this. We have many, many Senators on our side of the aisle--and we hope some on the other, although it has not been tested yet--who support this. 
   Here are the law enforcement that have written to us: National Association of Police Athletic Leagues, 
   Fight Crime, Invest in Kids, National Sheriffs Association, Major Cities Police Chiefs, Police Executive Research Forum, National District Attorneys Association, California District Attorneys Association, Illinois Association of Chiefs of Police, Texas Police Chiefs Association, Arizona Sheriffs and Prosecutors Association, Maine Chiefs and Sheriffs Association, Rhode Island Police Chiefs Association. 
   That is an example of law enforcement that supports afterschool programs. 
   We just got a letter from the Police Athletic League in which they talk about the importance of adding an amendment such as the Boxer amendment which, in essence, says that law enforcement participation in afterschool programs is important. We mention law enforcement in our bill over and over again. 
   A quote from the PAL letter:  
   After-school youth development programs like those proposed in your amendment have been shown to cut juvenile crime immediately, sometimes by 40-75 percent.  
   That is a quote from a letter to me. 
   I say to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle who often talk about law and order and the importance of going after criminals--and I share their concern--this is one thing we can do to stop crime after school. 
   I close with this statistic: 92 percent of the American people favor afterschool programs. Let's do it. 
   Thank you.

   Mrs. BOXER. Thank you, I say to the Senator. 
   I am so pleased he is talking about afterschool programs. I am so disappointed at this point we cannot offer our amendment which would, in fact, accommodate, as the Senator pointed out, more than a million children in afterschool quality programs. 
   I ask the Senator if he was aware of the relationship to the crime issue, juvenile crime, that we have been told by the FBI that the highest incidents of crime occur at 3 o'clock. And we have tremendous support for this afterschool amendment from the police athletic leagues all across this country and the police officers because when you have quality afterschool programs, it not only improves the education of children--and they do much better as they have done in afterschool programs throughout California--but also the police athletic leagues tell me they see a 75-percent reduction in crimes. So I ask the Senator if he could comment on the impact these afterschool programs have on reducing juvenile crime.

   Mrs. BOXER. I do want to thank the police athletic leagues for getting involved in this. I want to ask my friend this question, because he is our leader on education. He was the former chair of the Education Committee, now the ranking member. 
   I seem confused in trying to understand the majority leader's decision here not to allow these amendments to be offered. And I read somewhere that he said he looked forward to this debate when we began and he said, let's have those amendments, and we will vote them up or down. Can my friend explain to me why on Earth, when we have a situation here where the No. 1 issue in America today is our children and their education, the majority leader will not allow us to have an up-or-down vote on 100,000 teachers, on expanding afterschool programs, on the myriad of issues that we all know we need to address, the No. 1 issue today? Does my friend understand this change of heart? And can he explain to me what the rationale is for filibustering our amendments, for not allowing us to be heard by placing a gag rule on the Senate? Does he have an explanation?

   Mrs. BOXER. If my friend would continue to yield to me, I came over here not to seek time on my own, I say to my friend, but really to engage him in a conversation, because I think the American people are completely confused. I know I am confused. I see an Ed-Flex bill coming over here. It is a good bill. The Senator supports it. I support it. But as we have said before, it is a thin bill. It does not go to the heart and soul of what we need to be doing--more teachers in the classroom, afterschool care for our children, dropout prevention. 
   I will tell you why I am confused. I read that our majority leader, Senator LOTT, was with our Presiding Officer in his State. They had an excellent townhall meeting on education, and they talked about education a lot. They talked about it a lot. They talked about how it was a priority for the Republican Party. Well, talk is cheap. 
   I would like to know, what are we going to do? And we have an opportunity here, because there is an education bill on the floor, to let the majority of the Senate work its will; allow us to vote up or down. The Senator is completely correct. On afterschool, I offered a 1-hour timeframe and an up-or-down vote after that--1 hour. That is all. We are not trying to tie up the Senate. And further, my friend reminded me, which I had forgotten, there is a banking amendment on this bill. 
   I am confused here, I say to my friend, and continue to be confused, that we have this bill on the floor that deals with education. The majority leader says he doesn't want it amended by any education amendments but he allows an amendment to go through that deals with the banking system. Members can only come to one conclusion, and that is that the Republicans like to talk about education but when it comes down to doing something to help our children, they are missing in action, regardless of town hall meetings. 
   I am glad that the Senator from Massachusetts, the ranking member on the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions, has taken this time to explain what is going on to the American people, because you can't fool them. 
   I think what is interesting, as my friend has pointed out, we are not going to go away. Senator MURRAY, who isn't with us this morning because she had a tragic death in her family, Senator MURRAY is not going to go away. She and the Senator from Massachusetts were on their feet Friday, they were on their feet yesterday, they tried in vain to get a vote on the 100,000 teachers. She is not going to go away. The Senator from Massachusetts isn't going to go away. This Senator isn't going to go away. Why not have an agreement to bring up these issues and vote on them? 
   There is only one thing I can say, and that is that the majority leader does not support these amendments, he does not support 100,000 teachers in school, he does not support afterschool, he does not support dropout prevention. Otherwise, I can't imagine why he would use the heavyhanded tactics.  
   I yield back to my friend to continue to enlighten us on where we stand and how he sees the rest of the year going when we start off with such a gag rule on such an important measure.

   Mrs. BOXER. I think it is an important point the Senator makes, that when you have smaller class sizes you can give special attention to the children who need it. The Senator makes a very interesting point. Perhaps some of these children who now need to be pulled out of those classes because they are so large would be able to be served in smaller classrooms. 
   I had a very interesting conversation with a woman who sat next to me on an airplane back to California on Friday who works for the Pentagon. She was so excited about the fact that the military has just decided to undertake a project to lower classroom sizes. 
   I ask my friend if he had heard about that. Their goal now in the early grades is to have 1 teacher for every 18 children. Now, this is the military, the U.S. military. These are schools that are run by the military. 
   I say to my friend, if our children whose parents are in the military can benefit from smaller class sizes--because the military is so smart, they understand it works--why should we deny our children in the public schools the same opportunity for smaller class sizes? 
   Does my friend see in this an irony that the majority leader and the Republicans who join us in being very strong supporters of strong defense, in giving the military what they need so there can be a quality of life for their kids, that they would undertake such a program? Yet, we would be gagged. Maybe my friend is right; maybe we will be able to go to the amendment. If we don't go to the amendment, doesn't the Senator see an irony here that the Pentagon will have 18 kids--15 to 18 --in a classroom, supported by the Congress, and yet we see this opposition for the other children who happen to not be in military families?

   Mrs. BOXER. If the Senator will yield, because I am leaving in 30 seconds, I want to thank her and ask her a question. Does the Senator not agree with me that we owe a real debt to Senator WYDEN of Oregon, because the force of his desire to make education better resulted in a bipartisan agreement to bring an education bill to the floor? In doing so, I want to make it clear, because he and I have spoken, while we all agree with him that this is a good program, there have been many waivers passed on by Secretary Riley because he, too, agrees that Ed-Flex is working. This is a golden opportunity that he has given us to flesh out this bill, to make it even better. 
   I say to the Senator from Washington, she worked so hard to get 100,000 teachers into the classroom and reduce class sizes. We worked together on these issues to get afterschool funds to the school districts who wanted so much. Last year, there were $540 million worth of requests for afterschool programs. We only had $40 million. This year, the President wants to have the money to accommodate all those local districts. 
   I say to her, as a former school board member, the kinds of amendments that we hope to add to this bill, does she agree those kinds of amendments will give resources to the local districts so they will be able to make up their own minds as to whether they want those resources, that they will be able to design the programs themselves, and that what we are doing here, what the majority leader has done to us today, by not allowing these amendments, is simply to hold back these important bills from being voted upon so that those children will right now be denied the kinds of help they need? 
   The last point I want to make, and the last question I have to the Senator from Washington is this: Does she not agree that education is the No. 1 issue on the minds of the people and that when we see filibusters and stalls and hours of just chitchat and no work on education, that we are not meeting our responsibilities? Would she not agree with that? Again, I want to thank her for her leadership.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, this Nation lost one of its great leaders when Morris K. Udall passed away on December 12, 1998. I was lucky enough to serve with Mo for ten years in the House of Representatives. He was an inspiration to me when I first came to Congress, an able representative of the people of Arizona, and an accomplished leader for our nation. 
   Mo Udall served the people of the Second District of Arizona for 30 years. I want to thank the citizens of Arizona's Second District for blessing our entire nation with a Congressman whose dedication and service represented the voices of millions of Americans throughout our nation. I want to thank them for electing Mo Udall in 1961, and for continuing to do so in each of the 15 elections that followed. The Second District of Arizona shared with the entire nation a leader who truly improved our cultural and natural heritage. 
   Mo Udall was a visionary. He came to Congress in 1961 and put that vision into action. As Chairman of the House Interior and Insular Affairs Committee from 1977 to 1991, Mo was responsible for some of our most progressive environmental accomplishments--designating millions of acres of federal lands as wilderness, banning development on millions of acres in Alaska, and reforming strip mining and nuclear waste management. 
   His conservation ethic is what I, and so many others, respected about him most. But there was more to him than that. He was widely regarded for his sharp wit and keen intellect. For so many reasons, he was respected by his Congressional colleagues, as well as the press and the public. 
   When Mo retired from Congress, David Broder wrote, ``The legacy he left is imposing and enduring. It ranges from strip mining and Alaskan wilderness legislation to the reform of archaic committee and floor procedures that congressional barons had used to conceal their arbitrary power. For a whole generation of congressmen, Udall became a mentor and a model--and they will miss him as much as the press galleries do.'' 
   Just last week, I joined Congressman GEORGE MILLER in introducing a piece of legislation that I hope would make Mo Udall proud. It is up to those of us still in Congress to carry on his legacy of environmental responsibility. Lucky for us, there are two new Udalls in town. Mo's son, MARK UDALL, was just elected to Congress from Colorado, and his nephew, TOM UDALL, was elected to Congress from New Mexico. I look forward to working with them both. With their help, maybe we will be able to sustain the Udall environmental vision.

   Mrs. BOXER. I am so pleased that the Senator from Illinois has once more come to the floor to discuss something so fundamental to our country. I think if you asked people in the country, ``What is good about your national Government?'' yes, they would say a strong military; they would also say Social Security and Medicare. 
   Has the Senator talked about the 1995 Government shutdown yet?

   Mrs. BOXER. I want to ask him a few questions and then let him finish his remarks. 
   As the Senator was talking and showing this chart, it brought back to me the 1995 Government shutdown. We remember what that was about. Essentially, the President took a very firm stand in favor of Medicare, the environment, and education, and against the kind of tax cuts for the wealthy that would have meant devastating those programs. And the Government actually shut down over this. I am sure my friend remembers, it was a stunning thing. But it was really tax cuts for the wealthy, taking it straight from Medicare. 
   Now what we have is a situation that is very similar. We know we have to fix Social Security. The Republicans have said they agree with that, but they are silent on the issue of Medicare. They do nothing about shoring it up whatsoever. And yet they propose the same kind of tax cuts.  
   So I say to my friend, in 1995 Republicans essentially shut down the Government because they wanted these tax cuts at the expense of Medicare. And this year it looks like they are shutting down Medicare so they can go back to these tax cuts. 
   I wonder if he sensed, as I did, as we watched this budgetary debate unfold--if it did not bring back all these memories, and how he feels about that, because it was a pretty tough time we went through and I do not want to see those times repeated. 
   I ask my colleague to comment.

   Mrs. BOXER. Let me say to my friend again, I appreciate his leadership on this. We did hold a press conference today, the Democratic members of the Budget Committee, to call everyone's attention to this. 
   When you deal with a budget the size of this Federal budget, it has a lot of important things that we do. But this is one thing that we need to call attention to, the fact that if we are going to protect Social Security and Medicare, we are going to have to defer these tax cuts for the wealthiest people, some of them earning millions of dollars, who would get back tens of thousands of dollars, while the average person would get back $99. 
   As a result, we would see Medicare essentially shut down as we know it, and we don't want to go through another Government shutdown of that nature. We don't want a Medicare shutdown; we don't want an education shutdown. We want a budget that addresses these issues. 
   Again, I thank my colleague. He and I have known each other a long time. We have both gone through the situation of aging parents together. We have talked many times about how important Medicare is. I will never forget my friend and I being on the floor of the Senate when there was a move to raise the eligible age for Medicare. He and I stood here and fought. We said right now people are praying that they will turn 65 so they can get some health insurance, and then if we increase that age when we should actually be reducing the age that people can get Medicare--we should allow the President's plan to go forward on that as well, to allow people to buy in if they have no Medicare at 55, 60, and 62. This was going to raise the age. We told the stories of our families and how Medicare brought peace to our aging parents. 
   So we are, I think, going to stand shoulder to shoulder through to the fight. 
   I want to again thank him for yielding.

   Mrs. BOXER. I ask my colleague if he would engage in a colloquy. I don't have a speech, but I was so moved by what the Senator just described as what we need to do. 
   Oftentimes I wonder if the Senator would agree that what we see happening here with the leadership on the Republican side is that they know that education is a key issue and they bring before the Senate these very narrow bills. For example, last time we had a bill that would have given a benefit of about $7 a year, allowing some children to get $7 more to go to a private school. We were arguing that we needed a broader vision. 
   I say to my friend, does he not see this in somewhat the same fashion? We have a narrow bill when, as the Senator says, we need to look at afterschool, we need to look at more teachers, see that the classrooms are smaller; we need to look at what is happening to kids when they need mentoring. We have to look at what kind of classrooms they are in. 
   And my colleague misses Senator Moseley-Braun, who worked so hard on school construction. I wanted to ask my friend if he saw a pattern here developing where certain folks take a poll and they see there is an important issue, and they come back with a very narrow answer when what we need is a broader vision for the next century.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am going to finish quickly because I want to give the Senator from Washington the floor. 
   When I think about kids and schools, I think about Senator MURRAY because of her hands-on experience. But I can tell you that as a parent--now a grandparent--decrepit as you are, I say to the Senator from Illinois, and even a little more, in my younger days, I volunteered to work in the auxiliary, going down to schools in San Francisco where they needed volunteers, and this whole issue of keeping the kids busy after school is an education issue and it is a crime issue. A lot of people hear say they are tough on law and order. What better way than to give our children something to say yes to? 
   The FBI tells us that between 3 o'clock and 6 o'clock are the hours kids get into trouble, when juvenile crime peaks. You don't need a degree in criminology and psychology to know that this makes sense. The President has a tremendous expansion of ``after school'' in his budget. We need to talk about that when we get this Ed-Flex bill before us. Kids should not be going into classrooms where they can't read because it is so musty. I have been in those rooms. I had to run out of one particular classroom in Sacramento, which was so musty because there were leaks that hadn't been fixed; it was a disaster. To think that our children are in that atmosphere--that is not right. 
   After school children need to be kept busy, and during school they need small class sizes. We know what we have to do when we get a little bill that is very narrow here. And it may make some people feel happy that they are doing something. But I think it is our obligation--those of us on both sides of the aisle who care about our children--to point out that just passing a bill that has the title ``education'' in it doesn't mean that we are really doing right by our kids. It is just a sham. I am very proud to be here with my colleagues, and I am very much looking forward to this debate on the Ed-Flex bill, to make it a bill that really meets the needs of our young people. 
   I yield back to my friend, Senator DURBIN.

    Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I note with great pride that the President has announced his intention to nominate Mr. Bill Lann Lee, a native of my State of California, to be Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights in the Department of Justice. 
   The Senate will recall that Bill Lann Lee was nominated for this post more than a year and a half ago, in July 1997. His nomination died in the Judiciary Committee at the end of the 105th Congress. The majority of that Committee denied the full Senate a vote on the nomination because it knew Bill Lann Lee would have been confirmed if a vote had been taken. 
   Mr. President, I hope that the Judiciary Committee will not make the same mistake twice. Bill Lann Lee is fully qualified for this position. Indeed, I believe that he is the best person for the position. His personal history and his professional credentials both make him the perfect candidate to be Assistant Attorney for Civil Rights. 
   Bill Lann Lee was born in Harlem, the son of immigrants. He learned early in life about patriotism, from his father, who volunteered for military service in World War II in order to serve the adopted country that he loved so much. Bill Lee also learned from his parents, who ran a laundry, the value of hard work, a good education, and commitment to excellence. 
   Bill Lee spent most of his 24-year legal career with the NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund, which was founded by Thurgood Marshall. He also spent several years in the 1980's working for the Center for Law in the Public Interest. Throughout his career, Bill Lee has demonstrated a talent for consensus building--surely one of the most important attributes for the top civil rights job. 
   Elected officials and other leaders from both parties have strongly endorsed Bill Lann Lee, including Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan, who said, in a letter to the White House: ``Mr. Lee has practiced mainstream civil rights law. He does not believe in quotas. He has pursued flexible and reasonable remedies that in each case were approved by a court.'' 
   He has the endorsement of the National District Attorneys Association, which wrote: ``..... as the Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights, he will remain fully cognizant of the need and expectations of the people of the U.S. to be provided effective, efficient and fair law enforcement services. ..... he will do his utmost to ensure that honest and hardworking police officers are not tarnished by the acts of a few miscreants.'' 
   I join the many people across the country--lawyers, law enforcement, elected officials, and others--who want the Senate to finally confirm this splendid nominee for this very important post.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today, I am introducing the Permanent Protection for America's Resources 2000 Act--Resources 2000. This legislation is the most sweeping commitment to protecting America's natural heritage in more than a generation. It will establish a permanent, dedicated funding source for resource protection. I am honored to be working on this legislation with Congressman GEORGE MILLER in the House of Representatives, and my Senate Colleagues, Senator John KERRY and Senator ROBERT TORRICELLI. 
   As we embark upon the 21st Century, it is time to make a new commitment to our natural heritage--one that can take its place beside the legacy left by President Teddy Roosevelt as we began this century. That new commitment must go beyond a piecemeal approach to preserving our natural resources. It must be a comprehensive, long-term strategy that enables us to ensure that when our children's children enter the 22nd Century, they can herald our actions today, as we revere those of President Roosevelt. 
   Today our natural heritage is disappearing at an alarming rate. Each year, nearly 3 million acres of farmland and more than 170,000 acres of wetlands disappear. Each day, over 7,000 acres of open space are lost forever. 
   All across America, we now see parks closing, recreational facilities deteriorating, open space disappearing, historic structures crumbling. 
   Why is this happening? Because there is no dedicated fund for all these noble purposes--which can be used only for these noble purposes. 
   The legislation that I am introducing today will address this problem in a comprehensive Resources 2000 in a bold, historic initiative to provide substantial and permanent funding from offshore oil resources for the acquisition, improvement and maintenance of public resources throughout the United States: public lands, parks, marine and coastal resources, historic preservation, fish and wildlife. Resources 2000 will provide permanent, annual funding for historically underfunded, high priority resources, preservation goals. 
   A major funding source for resource protection already exists. Each year, oil companies pay the federal government billions of dollars in rents, royalties, and other fees in connection with offshore drilling in federal waters. In 1998 alone, the government collected over $4.6 billion from oil and gas drilling on the Outer Continental Shelf. 
   My bill would allocate $1.4 billion every year for land acquisition, park and recreational development, historic  preservation, land restoration, ocean conservation, farmland preservation, and endangered species recovery. 
   Resources 2000 will also mandate full funding of the Land and Water Conservation Fund. In 1965, Congress established this Fund, which was to receive $900 million a year from federal oil revenues for acquisition of sensitive lands and wetlands. 
   The good news is that Fund has collected over $21 billion since 1965. The bad news is that only $9 billion of this amount has been spent on its intended uses. More than $16 billion has been shifted into other federal accounts. 
   On the ground, this means that we have purchased some key tracts of land in the Golden Gate National Recreation Area, Redwood National Park, Tahoe National Forest, and Channel Islands National Park, among many others. 
   At the same time, however, we missed golden opportunities to buy critical open space because the Land and Water Conservation Fund was underfunded. Some of these parcels--in the Santa Monica Mountains, along the Pacific Crest Trail, and elsewhere throughout California--have since been lost. If we had been able to use the entire Fund, these areas would have been protected. 
   To preserve meaningful tracts of open space, we must spend the entire Fund to acquire land and water. Congress must move to take the Fund ``off budget'' and use it all for its intended purposes. 
   Resources 2000 would fund the Land and Water Conservation Fund at $900 million per year, the full level authorized by Congress. Half of this amount would be dedicated to federal acquisition of lands for our national parks, national forests, national wildlife refuges, and other public lands. The other half would go for matching grants to the states for land acquisition, planning, and development of outdoor recreation facilities. 
   Furthermore, this can be done without causing further harm to the environment. My bill does not contain any incentives for new offshore oil drilling. All of the revenue would have to come from already producing leases.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. Chief Justice, thank you for your dignity. And to both our leaders, thank you for your patience. 
   Colleagues, I will vote to acquit the President, and it is not because his poll numbers are high or because the economy is good. And it is not because Bill Clinton is a Democrat. 
   When I was in the House of Representatives, an impeachment resolution was filed against Republican President Ronald Reagan--an impeachment resolution because of Iran-Contra, which involved selling arms to a terrorist nation with the proceeds going to the Nicaraguan contras. This was against the law of the United States of America--against the law--against the rule of law. 
   I voted for that law, but I never went on that impeachment resolution against Ronald Reagan because I felt it would have hurt the country and because there was no bipartisan support for it. 
   I think the same should be said of this impeachment. There is no bipartisan support for it and the President's removal would hurt the country. 
   One more preface: It has been said that what the President did in this case was worse than what Senator Packwood did. 
   In this case, we have a consensual affair, wanted by both parties. It was irresponsible and indefensible: a young woman, a relationship wrong in every way, a president trying desperately to hide the affair. 
   The young woman was secretly tape recorded and forced to testify. Her mother was forced to testify. 
   The more than 20 women who complained about Senator Packwood alleged forced sexual misconduct against them. One victim was 17 years old. They wanted to tell their stories. 
   So each of us can decide for himself or herself the relationship of one case to the other. But surely that is not the issue before us. 
   Neither is the Paula Jones case, which was thrown out of court by a Republican female judge who ruled that there was no sexual harassment by the President. Testimony about a consensual sexual affair was immaterial. 
   Yes, the case was later settled, but that doesn't change its history: no sexual harassment, determined by a Republican female judge. 
   So, Senator Packwood is not before us, nor is Paula Jones. What is before us is the sanctity of the Constitution. 
   Let me now offer an apology to my constituents for voting in favor of the Independent Counsel Law in its current form--a law that has given one person an unlimited budget, unlimited scope, unlimited time and an unlimited ability to hurt people, and to hurt them badly. 
   The Senate is now sitting as a court of impeachment, primarily because, for over four years, we had an Independent Counsel spending more than $42 million searching for an impeachable offense. 
   And while I condemn the President's behavior, it was no excuse for the Ken Starr witchhunt, which went from a real estate deal, to several other fruitless investigations, to a sex deal built around illegally recorded phone conversations with someone named Linda Tripp. Linda Tripp, who says she's like all of us. Heaven help us if all of us act like Linda Tripp, secretly recording our dear friends. What a country this would be! 
   I also want to comment on one other matter which is personal to me, and that is my daughter's family connection to the First Lady. 
   While none of my Senate colleagues questioned the propriety of my participation in the impeachment matter--for which I thank you all--I was the target of a barrage or questions by the media and others outside this body. 
   I just want to say that yes, my daughter is married to the First Lady's brother, a brother who loves and admires his sister and doesn't want to see her hurt. So, I am far from being a defender of the President's behavior. 
   But I am a fierce defender of our Constitution. 
   That is why I have joined a small number of senators, led by the distinguished senator from West Virginia, in fighting amendments to that precious document. 
   Believe me, being against the line-item veto and the balanced budget amendment were not popular positions in my state; my positions made my reelection tougher. But I have never doubted that defending the Constitution is worth risking my Senate seat, which I cherish so much. 
   And it is because of my deep reverence for the Constitution that I believe we must reject the articles of impeachment before us today. 
   Why? Because the high crimes and misdemeanors constitutional requirement for removal has not been met--not even close. 
   The Constitution does not say remove the President if he fails to be a  role model for our children. It does not say remove the President if he violates the military code of conduct, or the Senate Ethics Code. It does not say remove the President if he brings pain to his family. 
   It says very clearly that the President shall be impeached and removed from office only for committing treason, bribery or other high crimes and misdemeanors. 
   In his Commentaries on the Constitution, Justice Joseph Story endorsed the view that ``those offenses which may be committed equally by a private person as a public officer are not the subject of impeachment.'' This means that presidential impeachable offenses are, generally, acts which could not be done by anyone other than the president. 
   Impeachment and removal from office was not meant to be a punishment of the President, but rather a protection of the country from a tyrant who would use his or her power against the people and the Constitution. 
   This President is not a tyrant who is threatening our democracy and freedom or the delicate balance of powers set up by our Constitution. So the ``high crimes and misdemeanors'' standard established by the Constitution has not been met in my view. 
   We must also reject these articles because there is every reason to doubt the House managers' case on perjury and obstruction of justice. They have presented not one shred of direct evidence for their claims, and the details of their circumstantial case have been decimated in many respects. As one manager said on national television, he couldn't win the case in a court of law as it was presented in the House. 
   I don't see how the case was strengthened in the Senate. In fact, I believe that it was weakened in the Senate. 
   When you have clear statements by Monica Lewinsky that the President never, ever told her to hide gifts and never discussed the contents of her affidavit--when you have Betty Currie saying she never felt intimated by the President and Vernon Jordan saying the job search was never connected to anything else--it seems to me there is substantial doubt on both counts. 
   That leads to another point. Rejecting these articles of impeachment does not place this President above the law. As the Constitution clearly says, he remains subject to the laws of the land just like any other citizen of the United States. 
   As Article I, Section 3 of the Constitution says, the President ``shall ..... be liable and subject to Indictment, Trial, Judgment and Punishment, according to Law.'' So it should be a comfort to those who believe the President committed crimes surrounding his affair that the President, indeed, is subject to the rule of law--our Founders made that certain. 
   At this point, I want to thank Senator TOM HARKIN for his challenge to the House Managers that the Senate is not a jury. In so ruling, Chief Justice Rehnquist, in my view, gave us the charge to look at the big picture, and that is very important. 
   Part of that picture is how the House of Representatives acted in this matter. I served in the House for ten years, and I never saw the minority party denied a vote on an alternative of their choosing in an important matter. Yet Democrats and moderate Republicans were denied a vote on censure, and I believe this was a disaster for democracy in that body. 
   Listen to what a Republican House Member who voted against impeachment wrote to a constituent:  
   I regret that Congressional Republicans were so blinded by their opposition to President Clinton that they voted to impeach him rather than stand by the traditional principles of their Party. I also regret that threats were made against me by the Republican leadership in an attempt to keep me from voting my conscience.  
   Those are the words of one of the five brave Republicans who voted against impeachment in the House. To me that speaks volumes about the kind of illegitimate process that got us here, and I believe in my heart that history will judge the House proceedings very harshly. 
   But I believe that the Senate, if it rejects the articles in a bipartisan way, will be viewed in a better light, and history will say that in 1999 the Senate decided that impeachment should not be used by one party to overturn the results of a presidential election that it did not like. 
   As Chief Justice Rehnquist wrote of the Senate acquittal of President Andrew Johnson in 1868:  
   The importance of the acquittal can hardly be overstated. With respect to the chief executive, it has meant that as to the policies he sought to pursue, he would be answerable only to the country as a whole in the quadrennial presidential elections, and not to Congress through the process of impeachment.  
   If I may, Mr. Chief Justice, I understand from your wise words that the President does not and should not serve at the pleasure of the House and Senate. 
   The Senate did the right thing in 1868--and by its decision not to remove the President, it brought stability to our nation. We should do no less now. 
   Voting against the articles of impeachment is the right thing to do to keep faith with our Constitution and to keep faith with our democracy for generations to come.

    Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today I ask the Senate to join me in commending those brave Americans who served aboard the U.S.S. Phaon. 
   During World War II, the Phaon  compiled an outstanding record as a battle damage repair ship. She was part of three major battles and helped the U.S. fleet to remain in action throughout the Central Pacific campaign. 
   The Phaon was an important part of mobile Service Squadron Ten, whose battle role was to remain within the battle area and conduct repairs--keeping fighting vessels in action, preventing the loss of damaged vessels by making them seaworthy, and returning repaired vessels to action as soon as possible. To accomplish this, the Navy converted tank transports into battle damage repair ships. 
   The Phaon  was one of the original mobile service squadron vessels that arrived in the Central Pacific in late 1943 to test new concepts in naval logistics and mobile repair. Their work began under fire at Majuro with restoration of all types of craft from the invasion of Tarawa and repairs to the battleships Washington and Indiana. 
   By early 1944, the Phaon's crew was skilled, experienced, and ready to participate in the campaigns to advance across the Pacific. In March, she was with the fleet at Kwajalein and Eniwetok. In June, she joined the invasion of Saipan. In July, she was at Tinian. She was subject to more than sixty air raids while working. 
   Time and again, the Phaon heroically entered the fray to repair a damaged ship. At Saipan, the destroyer Phelps was hit while engaged in ground support shore bombardment. She called the Phaon, and the two ships tied bow to stern. While the Phelps continued to bomb the shore, the Phaon repaired her damage and replenished her ammunition. At the same time, the Phaon dispatched several off-ship repair crews to other vessels and had alongside for repairs a tank landing craft, a minesweeper, and the destroyer U.S.S. Shaw. One month later, at Tinian, the Phaon performed similar feats to repair the destroyer Norman Scott and the battleship Colorado. 
   By the war's end, the Phaon had repaired at least 96 ships and more than 2,000 vessels and crafts of all types. She played a major role in the success of Service Squadron Ten, of which Rear Admiral W.R. Carter said:  
   Had it failed, the war would have lasted much longer at much greater cost in blood and dollars. ...... It was a never-ending job, and the men and officers ..... were as much a part of the fleet which defeated Japan as were ..... any battleship, carrier, cruiser, or destroyer.  
   Admiral Raymond A. Spruance, Commander of the Central Pacific Force, called the record of the Phaon  and Service Squadron Ten achievements of which all Americans can be justly proud, but about which most of them have little or no knowledge. 
   Mr. President, I hope that these remarks increase our knowledge and respect for the critical role that damage repair ships played in the Pacific campaigns. I know you will join me and every American in saluting the brave crew of the U.S.S. Phaon.

   Mrs. BOXER. Regular order. 
   Ms. Counsel MILLS. I just wanted to address, for a second, Manager HUTCHINSON's comments with regard to 1503. And he cited a 1987 case. In 1995, I think, as we talked a little bit about, and the House managers had discussed, Aguilar came down. And in that case the issue was, Was there sufficient nexus between the actual conduct of the person involved and the proceeding? And in particular, I am just going to read to you for 1 minute from the case law.  
   The Government argues that respondent ``understood that his false statements would be provided to the grand jury'' and that he made [these] statements ..... to thwart the grand jury investigation and not just the FBI investigation. ..... The Government supports its argument with ..... the transcript .....  
   They go through the discussion that was between the judge and the agent in which the judge specifically asked whether or not he was a target for the grand jury investigation, and the agent responded:  
   There is a grand jury meeting. Convening I guess that's the correct word. ..... [E]vidence will be heard ..... I'm sure on this issue.  
   So, in other words, the person making the statement knew at that point that there was potentially the possibility that his testimony would be presented to the grand jury, and the court  ruled, as I talked to you a little bit about during my presentation before, that that was an insufficient nexus for there to prove a violation of 1503.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce several important bills that I hope the Senate will consider early in the 106th Congress. 
   The first bill is the American Handgun Standards Act. This legislation would require that handguns made in the United States meet the same standards currently required of imported handguns. This legislation would halt the sale and manufacture of new ``junk guns,'' which have been found by criminologists to be disproportionately used in crimes. 
   The next bill is the Health Insurance Tax Deduction. This important legislation would make the costs of health insurance tax deductible for individuals who purchase their own health coverage--up to a maximum of $2,000 per year. Currently health care costs are only deductible for corporations and the self-employed. Current law clearly discriminates against individuals and should be changed. 
   Also included is legislation to make the Research and Experimentation Tax Credit permanent. Virtually all economists agree that the R&E Tax Credit is a valuable incentive that encourages high-tech companies to develop innovative products. In the past, however, the credit has been enacted intermittently and only for very limited periods of time. The on-again, off-again nature of the R&E Tax Credit makes it very difficult for companies to plan long-term research projects. It should be made permanent. 
   The next will would improve our pension system by exempting multi-employer plans from the annual income limits of Section 415 of the Internal Revenue Code. Current law sets pension compensation based on three consecutive years of pay. However, for workers whose income fluctuate from year-to-year, this requirement may lower annual benefits. To ensure fairness for these workers, multi-employer plans should be exempted from Section 415. 
   Next is the Coastal States Protection Act, which will provide necessary protection for the nation's Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) from the adverse effects of offshore oil and gas development by making management of the federal OCS consistent with state-mandated protection of state waters. Simply put, my bill says that when a state establishes a drilling moratorium on part or all of its coastal waters, that protection would be extended to adjacent federal waters. 
   The final bill is the Domestic Violence Identification and Referral Act, which would help ensure that medical professionals have the training they need to recognize and treat domestic violence, including spouse abuse, child abuse, and elder abuse. The bill will amend the Public Health Service Act to require the Secretary of Health and Human Services to give preference in awarding grants to institutions that train health professionals in identifying, treating, and referring patients who are victims of domestic violence to appropriate services.

    Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today I would like to honor Andrea Mead Lawrence, who is retiring from the Mono County Board of Supervisors after 16 years of distinguished service to her constituents. 
   Andrea personifies the great American tradition of public service that is the backbone of our governmental system. As a County Supervisor, she was a member of the Great Basin Unified Air Pollution District since 1984, serving as its chairman in 1989, 1993 and 1996. She played a key role in that capacity in the negotiations with the City of Los Angeles that will lead to reversing the worst particulate air pollution problem in the United States, cause by the dry bed of Owens Lake in Southern Inyo County. 
   She also successfully worked with others for the restoration of Mono Lake and its priceless ecosystem. In that and other efforts, she testified before Congress in support of creation of the Mono Basin National Forest Scenic Area to save Mono Lake. Over the years she also testified before Congress on behalf of the Bodie Protection Act, the San Joaquin Wilderness Act, and the California Desert Protection Act. Andrea was the founder of Friends of Mammoth, a citizen's advocacy group that was formed to fight environmentally damaging development in the Town of Mammoth Lakes, her home. She also founded the Southern Mono Historical Society. 
   Understanding that regional problems require grassroots and local involvement to bring effective long term solutions, Andrea was a co-founder and Past President of the Sierra Nevada Alliance, a group dedicated to the preservation of the ``Range of Light'' and its economy. 
   Her public involvement is seemingly endless and certainly on going. Early in her career she distinguished herself as a member of the United States Olympic Ski Team in 1948, 1952, and 1956. In 1952 she won two Olympic Gold Medals in the Slalom and Giant Slalom in the Olympic Games in Oslo, Norway. 
   Andrea Mead Lawrence exemplifies so much that is good in America. I wish her and her family all the best as she enters a new and productive part of her life.

    Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise today to commend those brave Americans who served aboard the U.S.S. Phaon. 
   During World War II, the Phaon compiled an outstanding record as a battle damage repair ship. She was part of three major battles and helped the U.S. fleet to remain in action throughout the Central Pacific campaign. 
   The Phaon was an important part of mobile Service Squadron Ten, whose battle role was to remain within the battle area and conduct repairs--keeping fighting vessels in action, preventing the loss of damaged vessels by making them seaworthy, and returning repaired vessels to action as soon as possible. To accomplish this, the Navy converted tank transports into battle damage repair ships. 
   The Phaon was one of the original mobile service squadron vessels that arrived in the Central Pacific in late 1943 to test new concepts in naval logistics and mobile repair. Their work began under fire at Majuro with restoration of all types of craft from the invasion of Tarawa and repairs to the battleships Washington and Indiana. 
   By early 1944, the Phaon's crew was skilled, experienced, and ready to participate in the campaigns to advance across the Pacific. In March she was with the fleet at Kwajalein and Eniwetok. In June she joined the invasion of Saipan. In July she was at Tinian. She was subject to more than 60 air raids while working. 
   Time and again, the Phaon heroically entered the fray to repair a damaged ship. At Saipan, the destroyer Phelps was hit while engaged in ground support shore bombardment. She called the Phaon, and the two ships tied bow to stern. While the Phelps continued to bomb the shore, the Phaon repaired her damage and replenished her ammunition. At the same time, the Phaon dispatched several off-ship repair crews to other vessels and had alongside for repairs a tank landing craft, a minesweeper, and the destroyer U.S.S. Shaw. One month later, at Tinian, the Phaon performed similar feats to repair the destroyer Norman Scott and the battleship Colorado. 
   By the war's end, the Phaon had repaired at least 96 ships and more than 2000 vessels and crafts of all types. She played a major role in the success of Service Squadron 10, of which Rear Admiral W.R. Carter said:  
   Had it failed, the war would have lasted much longer at much greater cost in blood and dollars........It was a never-ending job, and the men and officers.......were as much a part of the fleet which defeated Japan as were .......any battleship, carrier, cruiser, or destroyer.  
   Admiral Raymond A. Spruance, Commander of the Central Pacific Force, called the record of the Phaon and Service Squadron 10 ``achievements of which all Americans can be justly proud, but about which most of them have little or no knowledge.'' 
   Mr. President, I hope that these remarks increase our knowledge and respect for the critical role that damage repair ships played in the Pacific campaigns. I know you will join me and every American in saluting the brave crew of the U.S.S. Phaon.

    Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today I would like to acknowledge the hard work and dedicated public service of Mr. William F. Hein, deputy executive director of the San Francisco Bay Area Metropolitan Transportation Commission (MTC). Mr. Hein retired in December, 1998. 
   Mr. Hein served as a deputy executive director of the MTC for 20 years, capping a distinguished four-decade career in the transportation field. The MTC is the transportation planning and finance agency for the nine-county San Francisco Bay Area, and Mr. Hein helped build the MTC into a regional transportation planning and finance agency that is a model for our nation. His expertise and leadership over the last two decades has brought about a transformation of the Bay Area's transportation system, resulting in an integrated, multimodal network of highways, local streets and roads, rail, car pool lanes, ferry services, bicycle and pedestrian access, and bus routes. 
   During his tenure with the MTC, William Hein has earned the respect and gratitude of numerous local elected officials, representing the diversity of the Bay Area, who have been fortunate enough to serve on the MTC. 
   Mr. Hein enjoyed a rich and distinguished career in public service prior to joining the MTC, including his work as director of planning for the Bay Area Rapid Transit District (BART), bureau chief for the New Jersey Department of Transportation, analyst for the California Legislative Analyst's Office, and engineer for the California Bridge Department and the City of Santa Clara. Mr. Hein has also served his country as a Peace Corps volunteer in Bangladesh. 
   Mr. President, and my distinguished colleagues in this United States Senate, the Bay Area transportation community will miss Mr. Hein and his valuable contributions to the quality of life in the Bay Area. I hope you will join me to wish a warm and fond farewell and to thank him for a job well done.
